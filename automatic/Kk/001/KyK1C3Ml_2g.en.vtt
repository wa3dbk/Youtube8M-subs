00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
I need things to be very quick very

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.920 
I need things to be very quick very
simple<00:03:38.500> or<00:03:38.889> I'll<00:03:39.519> forget<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.180> do<00:03:40.329> them<00:03:40.540> or<00:03:40.810> I'll

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
simple or I'll forget to do them or I'll

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.449 
simple or I'll forget to do them or I'll
just<00:03:41.109> get<00:03:41.290> lazy<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.680> not<00:03:41.950> feel<00:03:42.160> like<00:03:42.280> doing

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
just get lazy and not feel like doing

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.640 
just get lazy and not feel like doing
them<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:42.970> then<00:03:43.030> what's<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.720> point<00:03:43.870> because

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
them and then what's the point because

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.860 
them and then what's the point because
at<00:03:44.799> that<00:03:44.920> point<00:03:45.130> it's<00:03:45.400> just<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:46.359> know<00:03:46.480> you're

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
at that point it's just you know you're

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.390 
at that point it's just you know you're
not<00:03:46.989> utilizing<00:03:47.170> it<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:47.889> so<00:03:48.040> you're<00:03:48.190> not<00:03:48.310> going

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
not utilizing it and so you're not going

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.789 
not utilizing it and so you're not going
to<00:03:48.489> be<00:03:48.670> very<00:03:49.060> organized<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:50.410> then<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.590> have

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
to be very organized and then I have

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.940

just<00:05:21.450> did<00:05:21.660> washi<00:05:21.870> tape<00:05:22.200> at<00:05:22.350> the<00:05:22.380> bottom

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
just did washi tape at the bottom

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.490 
just did washi tape at the bottom
they're<00:05:23.520> different<00:05:23.820> for<00:05:24.510> each<00:05:24.690> month<00:05:24.990> I<00:05:25.320> don't

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
they're different for each month I don't

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.930 
they're different for each month I don't
know<00:05:25.740> if<00:05:25.889> I'll<00:05:26.010> continue<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.400> do<00:05:26.610> that<00:05:26.729> or<00:05:26.850> not

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
know if I'll continue to do that or not

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.790 
know if I'll continue to do that or not
but<00:05:27.210> it<00:05:27.270> does<00:05:27.570> look<00:05:27.750> cute<00:05:27.930> so<00:05:28.550> maybe<00:05:29.550> I<00:05:29.669> will<00:05:30.800> so

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
but it does look cute so maybe I will so

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.279 
but it does look cute so maybe I will so
then<00:05:31.949> I<00:05:31.979> have<00:05:32.280> projects<00:05:32.880> and<00:05:33.539> projects<00:05:34.080> again

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
then I have projects and projects again

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.500 
then I have projects and projects again
I<00:05:34.350> have<00:05:34.560> a<00:05:34.590> little<00:05:34.800> sticky<00:05:35.039> note<00:05:35.280> here<00:05:35.610> that

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
I have a little sticky note here that

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.210 
I have a little sticky note here that
has<00:05:36.660> the<00:05:36.810> keys<00:05:37.020> so<00:05:37.380> that<00:05:37.500> way<00:05:37.650> I'm<00:05:37.800> like<00:05:38.010> I

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
has the keys so that way I'm like I

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.770 
has the keys so that way I'm like I
don't<00:05:38.340> know<00:05:38.580> I<00:05:38.820> don't<00:05:38.970> remember<00:05:39.270> where<00:05:39.570> I<00:05:39.600> had

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
don't know I don't remember where I had

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.159 
don't know I don't remember where I had
that<00:05:39.930> key<00:05:40.410> at<00:05:40.620> and<00:05:40.860> it's<00:05:41.340> just<00:05:41.520> right<00:05:41.639> here<00:05:41.850> so

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
that key at and it's just right here so

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.150 
that key at and it's just right here so
on<00:05:43.169> my<00:05:43.380> to-do<00:05:43.710> list

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
on my to-do list

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.260 
on my to-do list
these<00:05:44.400> are<00:05:44.610> to-do<00:05:44.910> lists<00:05:45.300> by<00:05:45.560> by<00:05:46.560> arc<00:05:46.800> and<00:05:47.280> so

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
these are to-do lists by by arc and so

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.680 
these are to-do lists by by arc and so
far<00:05:48.780> these<00:05:48.930> are<00:05:48.990> working<00:05:49.380> well<00:05:49.530> for<00:05:49.560> me<00:05:49.830> I<00:05:50.160> just

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
far these are working well for me I just

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.900 
far these are working well for me I just
wrote<00:05:51.690> down<00:05:51.720> each<00:05:52.080> task<00:05:52.410> and<00:05:52.889> then<00:05:53.400> instead<00:05:53.729> of

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
wrote down each task and then instead of

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.550 
wrote down each task and then instead of
I<00:05:54.120> like<00:05:54.360> to<00:05:54.419> cross<00:05:54.720> things<00:05:54.960> off<00:05:55.200> because

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
I like to cross things off because

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.400 
I like to cross things off because
checkmarks<00:05:56.400> I<00:05:56.940> don't<00:05:57.510> see<00:05:57.690> them<00:05:57.870> and<00:05:58.050> so<00:05:58.260> I'll

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
checkmarks I don't see them and so I'll

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.200 
checkmarks I don't see them and so I'll
forget<00:05:58.740> I<00:05:58.950> need<00:05:59.280> to<00:05:59.400> know<00:05:59.550> right<00:05:59.729> away<00:05:59.880> that<00:06:00.000> I

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
forget I need to know right away that I

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.510 
forget I need to know right away that I
did<00:06:00.510> that<00:06:00.630> so<00:06:00.870> I<00:06:00.900> just<00:06:01.020> cross<00:06:01.470> off<00:06:01.770> but<00:06:02.370> they

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
did that so I just cross off but they

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.250 
did that so I just cross off but they
have<00:06:02.639> this<00:06:02.760> handy<00:06:03.060> check<00:06:03.270> mark<00:06:03.479> tab<00:06:03.690> so<00:06:03.900> I<00:06:03.930> put

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
have this handy check mark tab so I put

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.779 
have this handy check mark tab so I put
the<00:06:04.410> date<00:06:04.590> of<00:06:04.800> when<00:06:04.979> it<00:06:05.130> was<00:06:05.190> completed<00:06:05.669> there

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
the date of when it was completed there

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.339 
the date of when it was completed there
because<00:06:06.090> this<00:06:06.270> is<00:06:06.419> not<00:06:06.570> a<00:06:06.599> to-do<00:06:06.960> list<00:06:06.990> that<00:06:07.320> I

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
because this is not a to-do list that I

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:09.379 
because this is not a to-do list that I
need<00:06:07.620> to<00:06:07.710> do<00:06:07.860> today<00:06:08.099> this<00:06:08.820> is<00:06:09.000> a<00:06:09.030> to-do<00:06:09.360> list

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
need to do today this is a to-do list

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:12.560 
need to do today this is a to-do list
that<00:06:09.720> just<00:06:10.080> needs<00:06:10.289> to<00:06:10.500> get<00:06:10.590> done<00:06:10.820> at<00:06:11.820> some<00:06:12.330> time

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
that just needs to get done at some time

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.490 
that just needs to get done at some time
and<00:06:12.840> so<00:06:13.760> here<00:06:14.760> I<00:06:14.789> color-coded<00:06:15.150> it<00:06:15.599> by<00:06:15.810> priority

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
and so here I color-coded it by priority

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.190 
and so here I color-coded it by priority
us<00:06:16.800> to<00:06:17.220> homework<00:06:18.210> Church<00:06:18.479> personal<00:06:18.960> school

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
us to homework Church personal school

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.650 
us to homework Church personal school
and<00:06:19.530> then<00:06:20.099> over<00:06:20.550> here<00:06:20.580> I<00:06:20.760> put<00:06:20.820> the<00:06:21.090> date<00:06:21.270> of

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
and then over here I put the date of

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.690 
and then over here I put the date of
when<00:06:22.320> they<00:06:22.470> were<00:06:22.530> completed<00:06:23.039> for<00:06:23.370> my

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
when they were completed for my

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.810 
when they were completed for my
reference<00:06:24.150> when<00:06:24.450> this<00:06:24.630> is<00:06:24.810> full<00:06:25.729> there's<00:06:26.729> a

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
reference when this is full there's a

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.629 
reference when this is full there's a
second<00:06:27.270> side<00:06:27.450> so<00:06:28.139> they<00:06:28.380> are<00:06:28.470> two-sided<00:06:28.860> so<00:06:29.610> I

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
second side so they are two-sided so I

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.510 
second side so they are two-sided so I
can<00:06:29.940> just<00:06:30.150> flip<00:06:30.870> the<00:06:31.110> page<00:06:31.349> or<00:06:31.680> probably<00:06:32.340> what

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
can just flip the page or probably what

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.890 
can just flip the page or probably what
I'll<00:06:32.639> do<00:06:32.820> because<00:06:33.060> I<00:06:33.150> don't<00:06:33.360> use<00:06:33.510> this<00:06:33.690> top

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
I'll do because I don't use this top

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.159 
I'll do because I don't use this top
line<00:06:34.169> is<00:06:34.470> I'll<00:06:34.710> probably<00:06:34.919> just<00:06:35.900> flip<00:06:36.900> it<00:06:37.050> over

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
line is I'll probably just flip it over

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.200 
line is I'll probably just flip it over
like<00:06:37.380> that<00:06:37.440> and<00:06:38.010> do<00:06:38.669> the<00:06:38.700> same

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
like that and do the same

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.820 
like that and do the same
that<00:06:40.050> way<00:06:40.850> but<00:06:41.850> now<00:06:42.150> I<00:06:42.479> just<00:06:43.259> have<00:06:43.620> that<00:06:43.770> in

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
that way but now I just have that in

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.909 
that way but now I just have that in
here<00:06:44.210> one<00:06:45.210> thing<00:06:45.449> that<00:06:45.600> I<00:06:45.630> like<00:06:46.229> about<00:06:46.470> the<00:06:46.740> Ark

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
here one thing that I like about the Ark

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.189 
here one thing that I like about the Ark
is<00:06:47.190> that<00:06:47.430> knees<00:06:47.699> are<00:06:47.970> easily<00:06:48.720> you<00:06:48.870> don't<00:06:49.050> have

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 
is that knees are easily you don't have

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.140 
is that knees are easily you don't have
to<00:06:49.350> open<00:06:49.710> you<00:06:50.100> don't<00:06:50.220> have<00:06:50.400> to<00:06:50.550> do<00:06:50.669> this<00:06:50.820> you

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
to open you don't have to do this you

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.029 
to open you don't have to do this you
just<00:06:52.370> tear<00:06:53.370> it<00:06:53.460> out<00:06:53.580> then<00:06:54.240> you<00:06:54.330> can<00:06:54.449> replace<00:06:54.720> it

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 
just tear it out then you can replace it

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.610 
just tear it out then you can replace it
occasionally<00:06:56.039> if<00:06:56.400> you<00:06:56.550> are<00:06:56.729> doing<00:06:56.970> that<00:06:57.090> a<00:06:57.150> lot

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
occasionally if you are doing that a lot

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.439 
occasionally if you are doing that a lot
these<00:06:58.620> things<00:06:58.919> will<00:06:59.220> get<00:06:59.460> if<00:06:59.820> you<00:07:00.000> can<00:07:00.210> see

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:00.449 
these things will get if you can see

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.150 
these things will get if you can see
here<00:07:00.720> they<00:07:00.870> do<00:07:00.930> get<00:07:01.199> a<00:07:01.259> little<00:07:01.500> bent<00:07:02.870> and<00:07:04.160> so

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
here they do get a little bent and so

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.400 
here they do get a little bent and so
they<00:07:05.430> don't<00:07:05.820> have<00:07:05.970> they're<00:07:06.270> sticky<00:07:06.690> or<00:07:06.930> not

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.410 
they don't have they're sticky or not

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.439 
they don't have they're sticky or not
sticky<00:07:07.800> but<00:07:07.979> like<00:07:08.130> they<00:07:08.280> won't<00:07:08.520> just<00:07:08.759> stick<00:07:09.330> in

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:09.449 
sticky but like they won't just stick in

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:11.689 
sticky but like they won't just stick in
there<00:07:09.600> very<00:07:09.750> well<00:07:09.810> but<00:07:10.770> that<00:07:11.160> really<00:07:11.430> only

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:11.699 
there very well but that really only

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:14.060 
there very well but that really only
happens<00:07:12.210> on<00:07:12.479> things<00:07:12.780> that<00:07:13.289> I've<00:07:13.500> noticed<00:07:13.680> on

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
happens on things that I've noticed on

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.159 
happens on things that I've noticed on
things<00:07:14.310> that<00:07:14.520> I<00:07:14.550> use<00:07:14.880> quite<00:07:15.180> a<00:07:15.300> bit<00:07:15.419> but<00:07:15.900> just

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:16.169 
things that I use quite a bit but just

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:17.600 
things that I use quite a bit but just
for<00:07:16.320> a<00:07:16.349> short<00:07:16.590> amount<00:07:16.830> of<00:07:16.949> time<00:07:17.009> so<00:07:17.400> they're

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.610 
for a short amount of time so they're

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.240 
for a short amount of time so they're
otherwise<00:07:18.090> anything<00:07:18.990> that<00:07:19.139> is<00:07:19.259> in<00:07:19.500> here<00:07:19.800> is<00:07:19.979> in

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.250 
otherwise anything that is in here is in

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.040 
otherwise anything that is in here is in
here<00:07:20.490> so<00:07:21.120> it<00:07:21.210> doesn't<00:07:21.240> bother<00:07:21.539> me<00:07:21.690> that<00:07:21.780> much

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
here so it doesn't bother me that much

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.200 
here so it doesn't bother me that much
that<00:07:22.229> it<00:07:22.380> does<00:07:22.590> that<00:07:22.669> anything<00:07:23.669> that<00:07:23.820> I<00:07:23.849> feel

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210 
that it does that anything that I feel

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.240 
that it does that anything that I feel
like<00:07:24.240> I'll<00:07:24.479> be<00:07:24.599> using<00:07:24.750> a<00:07:25.020> lot<00:07:25.289> that<00:07:26.070> I<00:07:26.099> don't

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250 
like I'll be using a lot that I don't

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.140 
like I'll be using a lot that I don't
want<00:07:26.580> it<00:07:26.669> to<00:07:26.789> come<00:07:26.940> out

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150 
want it to come out

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.879 
want it to come out
I<00:07:27.300> can<00:07:27.509> laminate<00:07:27.900> it<00:07:27.960> like<00:07:28.259> I<00:07:28.380> did<00:07:28.530> for<00:07:28.770> my

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:28.889 
I can laminate it like I did for my

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:33.110 
I can laminate it like I did for my
weekly<00:07:29.099> list<00:07:29.490> and<00:07:29.849> then<00:07:30.330> that<00:07:30.509> saves<00:07:30.810> that<00:07:32.120> in

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 
weekly list and then that saves that in

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.600 
weekly list and then that saves that in
my<00:07:33.539> projects<00:07:34.050> list<00:07:34.229> I<00:07:34.440> have<00:07:34.680> two<00:07:35.190> more<00:07:35.370> tabs

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.610 
my projects list I have two more tabs

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.909 
my projects list I have two more tabs
here<00:07:36.120> these<00:07:36.960> are<00:07:37.139> projects<00:07:37.710> that<00:07:37.740> are

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.360 
long-term and so I have separate
sections<00:07:40.169> in<00:07:40.349> here<00:07:40.560> they're<00:07:40.710> not<00:07:40.860> necessarily

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:41.370 
sections in here they're not necessarily

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.779
