obviously<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.230> start<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.830> need<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.099> get<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
obviously to start you need to get the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:01:16.290 
obviously to start you need to get the
water<00:00:32.640> RC<00:00:32.969> car<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.420> its<00:00:33.690> nice<00:00:33.960> package

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.210 

now<00:01:17.300> we're<00:01:17.480> left<00:01:17.660> with<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.320> best<00:01:18.560> RC<00:01:18.980> car

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
now we're left with the best RC car

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.810 
now we're left with the best RC car
China<00:01:19.550> can<00:01:19.790> produce<00:01:19.940> for<00:01:20.300> 1295<00:01:21.460> it's<00:01:22.460> actually

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
China can produce for 1295 it's actually

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.550 
China can produce for 1295 it's actually
quite<00:01:23.030> clever<00:01:23.270> as<00:01:23.600> you'll<00:01:23.870> see<00:01:24.020> you<00:01:24.110> only<00:01:24.290> take

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
quite clever as you'll see you only take

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.160 
quite clever as you'll see you only take
it<00:01:24.710> apart<00:01:24.980> on<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.030> bottom<00:01:26.330> of<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.480> car<00:01:26.690> you'll

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
it apart on the bottom of the car you'll

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.980 
it apart on the bottom of the car you'll
find<00:01:27.440> four<00:01:27.800> screws<00:01:28.190> that<00:01:28.490> hold<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:28.910> body<00:01:29.120> we

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
find four screws that hold the body we

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.370 
find four screws that hold the body we
need<00:01:30.080> to<00:01:30.170> take<00:01:30.350> these<00:01:30.560> off<00:01:31.540> actually<00:01:32.540> look<00:01:33.260> at

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
need to take these off actually look at

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.350 
need to take these off actually look at
it<00:01:33.440> there's<00:01:33.619> only<00:01:33.680> three<00:01:34.010> these<00:01:34.850> cars<00:01:35.119> keep

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
it there's only three these cars keep

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.940 
it there's only three these cars keep
getting<00:01:35.600> cheaper<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:35.990> cheaper<00:01:36.260> and<00:01:36.710> it's

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
getting cheaper and cheaper and it's

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.760 
getting cheaper and cheaper and it's
actually<00:01:37.280> pretty<00:01:38.030> impressive<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:39.560> first

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
actually pretty impressive so first

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.590 
actually pretty impressive so first
there's<00:01:39.979> one<00:01:40.010> here<00:01:40.310> at<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:40.490> back<00:01:40.670> then<00:01:41.570> you

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
there's one here at the back then you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.140 
there's one here at the back then you
need<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:41.930> take<00:01:42.140> out<00:01:42.320> these<00:01:42.619> two<00:01:42.680> here<00:01:43.369> inside

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
need to take out these two here inside

00:01:44.150 --> 00:02:54.990 
need to take out these two here inside
the<00:01:44.300> front<00:01:44.479> wheels

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.760 

now<00:02:56.000> that<00:02:56.180> remove<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.570> bottle<00:02:56.900> we<00:02:57.410> don't<00:02:57.620> need

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
now that remove the bottle we don't need

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.120 
now that remove the bottle we don't need
this

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
this

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.730 
this
but<00:02:59.060> hold<00:02:59.210> on<00:02:59.390> it's<00:02:59.990> a<00:03:00.080> nice<00:03:00.230> little<00:03:00.350> body<00:03:00.590> it

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
but hold on it's a nice little body it

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.240 
but hold on it's a nice little body it
might<00:03:00.890> be<00:03:01.040> useful<00:03:01.160> some<00:03:02.770> get<00:03:03.770> rid<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:03.980> some<00:03:04.220> of

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
might be useful some get rid of some of

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.300 
might be useful some get rid of some of
the<00:03:04.370> shiny<00:03:04.610> little<00:03:04.880> trim<00:03:05.180> here<00:03:06.310> because

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
the shiny little trim here because

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.890 
the shiny little trim here because
turtle<00:03:07.580> shells<00:03:07.790> don't<00:03:08.180> need<00:03:08.360> shiny<00:03:08.690> little

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
turtle shells don't need shiny little

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.640 
turtle shells don't need shiny little
trim<00:03:09.200> at<00:03:09.920> least<00:03:10.130> in<00:03:10.280> my<00:03:10.400> opinion<00:03:11.320> so<00:03:12.320> now<00:03:12.470> we're

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
trim at least in my opinion so now we're

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.160 
trim at least in my opinion so now we're
down<00:03:12.800> to<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.310> meat<00:03:13.490> of<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.880> RC<00:03:14.210> car<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:14.750> the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
down to the meat of the RC car and the

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.630 
down to the meat of the RC car and the
design<00:03:15.410> here<00:03:15.710> is<00:03:15.830> actually<00:03:16.160> quite<00:03:16.310> clever

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
design here is actually quite clever

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.360 
design here is actually quite clever
it's<00:03:17.300> divided<00:03:17.960> into<00:03:18.170> three<00:03:18.410> main<00:03:18.590> modules<00:03:19.130> all

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
it's divided into three main modules all

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.010 
it's divided into three main modules all
of<00:03:19.730> which<00:03:19.880> pretty<00:03:20.180> much<00:03:20.360> just<00:03:20.660> snapped

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
of which pretty much just snapped

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.990 
of which pretty much just snapped
together<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:22.100> have<00:03:22.310> in<00:03:22.490> the<00:03:22.550> center<00:03:22.850> the

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
together you have in the center the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.630 
together you have in the center the
actual<00:03:23.900> RC<00:03:24.350> controller<00:03:24.800> on<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.130> battery<00:03:25.490> box

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
actual RC controller on the battery box

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.760 
actual RC controller on the battery box
in<00:03:26.210> the<00:03:26.330> front<00:03:26.600> you<00:03:26.810> have<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.960> steering<00:03:27.380> module

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
in the front you have a steering module

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.070 
in the front you have a steering module
and<00:03:28.100> in<00:03:28.460> the<00:03:28.550> back<00:03:28.730> you've<00:03:29.600> got<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.900> rear

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
and in the back you've got the rear

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.030 
and in the back you've got the rear
wheels<00:03:30.350> in<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.590> drive<00:03:30.830> mode<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:33.530> real<00:03:33.710> wheels

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
wheels in the drive mode the real wheels

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.870 
wheels in the drive mode the real wheels
are<00:03:34.760> snapped<00:03:35.180> on<00:03:35.420> but<00:03:35.690> it's<00:03:35.810> underneath<00:03:36.880> this

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
are snapped on but it's underneath this

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.840 
are snapped on but it's underneath this
little<00:03:38.720> RC<00:03:39.020> controller<00:03:39.470> model<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.550> front

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
little RC controller model the front

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.140 
little RC controller model the front
wheels<00:03:41.090> I<00:03:42.130> believe<00:03:43.130> are<00:03:43.370> also<00:03:43.610> snapped<00:03:43.910> on

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
wheels I believe are also snapped on

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.730 
wheels I believe are also snapped on
we're<00:03:44.600> gonna<00:03:44.720> have<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:44.930> look<00:03:45.020> at<00:03:45.170> that<00:03:45.290> yes

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
we're gonna have to look at that yes

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.980 
we're gonna have to look at that yes
so<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.490> see<00:03:46.640> here<00:03:46.850> there's<00:03:47.060> two<00:03:47.210> snaps<00:03:47.510> one<00:03:47.900> at

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
so you see here there's two snaps one at

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.840 
so you see here there's two snaps one at
the<00:03:48.080> front<00:03:48.350> which<00:03:48.740> we<00:03:48.890> can<00:03:49.010> kind<00:03:49.220> of<00:03:49.280> pull<00:03:49.820> back

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
the front which we can kind of pull back

00:03:49.850 --> 00:04:01.809 
the front which we can kind of pull back
and<00:03:50.330> break<00:03:50.510> off<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:52.670> one<00:03:53.090> at<00:03:53.210> the<00:03:53.240> back

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.179 

I<00:04:02.349> think<00:04:03.349> it's<00:04:03.500> now<00:04:03.650> time<00:04:03.680> for<00:04:03.950> the

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:04.189 
I think it's now time for the

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.770 
I think it's now time for the
application<00:04:04.730> of<00:04:04.819> a<00:04:04.879> little<00:04:05.030> bit<00:04:05.150> of<00:04:05.209> priming

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.280 

there<00:04:08.780> we<00:04:08.930> go<00:04:09.079> just<00:04:09.609> pulled<00:04:10.609> out<00:04:11.049> the<00:04:12.049> front

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
there we go just pulled out the front

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.520 
there we go just pulled out the front
motor<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.920> front<00:04:13.189> wheels<00:04:14.109> now<00:04:15.109> just<00:04:15.379> for<00:04:15.500> the

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
motor the front wheels now just for the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.979 
motor the front wheels now just for the
sake<00:04:15.739> of<00:04:15.799> simplicity<00:04:16.549> here<00:04:17.150> we<00:04:17.419> can<00:04:17.570> actually

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
sake of simplicity here we can actually

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.789 
sake of simplicity here we can actually
detach<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.979> motor<00:04:19.190> from<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.030> model<00:04:20.590> so<00:04:21.590> pull

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
detach the motor from the model so pull

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.740 
detach the motor from the model so pull
this<00:04:21.889> little<00:04:22.070> clip<00:04:22.370> back<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.330> motor<00:04:23.539> will

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
this little clip back and the motor will

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.900 
this little clip back and the motor will
slide<00:04:23.990> out<00:04:24.199> and<00:04:25.009> then<00:04:25.130> we<00:04:25.190> now<00:04:25.340> have<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.759> whole

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
slide out and then we now have the whole

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.300 
slide out and then we now have the whole
front<00:04:26.180> steering<00:04:26.419> module<00:04:26.900> detached<00:04:27.710> from<00:04:28.100> the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
front steering module detached from the
