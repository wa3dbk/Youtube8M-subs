00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:12.120
 what cost today times good here 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.400
 Now go to the training what 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.130
 we train 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:22.199
 bush chest 56 shoulders 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:27.529
 exactly my favorite my strength 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.529
 Absolutely I am already crass types 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.300
 International cheese one looks like 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.489
 a lot of extra coach training today 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.590
 I seem to get no banks now 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.320
 first with a bike here for training 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.620
 drive then it's off the mixes 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.910
 the bus there again easter 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.430
 no idea what we have for one 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.140
 cocktail radio malady has television 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.140
 but it tingles easily 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.200
 Welcome to the breast training the faithful 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.600
 spectators know the first exercise 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.440
 Bench press second exercise maybe 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.110
 Not quite as standard fips third exercise 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.190
 short and the oblique bench press fourth 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.430
 Exercise overhead press fifth exercise 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.610
 Press dumbbell shoulder 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.940
 5 Now I would have got mixed up 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.420
 sixth exercise triceps bush downs at 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.220
 rope and then we have a seventh 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.890
 But they did not do that badly 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.780
 But there is still a bit the price 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.580
 to get 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.080
 flying on the cable train but we have 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.119
 not everything recorded but only that 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.659
 bench press and the overhead press so 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.069
 that currently my training plan 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.190
 this exercise have here five times since five 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:03.429
 I made it but of course it was 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.740
 not as easy as I would like 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.990
 So a bit more with the technology 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.820
 am playing because i am back from some 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.709
 People here and may have been 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.130
 I would like to have the technology 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.540
 I keep it where I am before 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.220
 130 practiced I 'll do that 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.170
 I just think so and make first 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.850
 just keep going no matter if there 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.160
 fold your wrists a little bit or 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.540
 so I just shit on it as long as I 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.530
 can push a lot and no pain 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.280
 then I will too 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.890
 keep going 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.739
 and here was the really blatant stefan 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.690
 has pushed more than me at the world 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.049
 press because I was just broken file 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.510
 after all after after it occurs 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:47.609
 the triceps of all the previous ones 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.130
 Exercise has been properly overloaded 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:53.049
 but in itself good in it the thing is me 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.790
 So tell me if that was a good training 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.660
 I do not know that I will see then 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.680
 because I weigh myself all 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.390
 I will write down when 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.590
 see next training because we are not 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.359
 at the next training my weights 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.100
 then I know that the training 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.920
 was good and the next and the next 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.170
 and so on and so on 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.520
 thanks for watching and have fun 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.590
 at the further video I have now 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.180
 just a really hard workout and 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.020
 I have nothing since this morning 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.750
 eaten 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.349
 I 'm really hungry and I'm really hungry 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.420
 was just shopping and yes how should i 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.030
 say do not prefer it in such a way 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.290
 situation to go shopping because you 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.290
 know what can happen then 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.780
 I split up a bit here 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.980
 are the good things so then come the 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.500
 medium medium foods so 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.739
 in my opinion come down here 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.420
 the bad foods 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.190
 I will have decided a bit 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.860
 made a bit of damage limitation 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.220
 here chips with only nine percent fat 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.160
 open chips then I have something here 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.410
 is also so mediocre because it is so poor 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.040
 and not only a lot sugared but 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.480
 the two things are my favorite 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.989
 favorite tie or respectively 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.359
 biscuits are really cool anyway because 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.459
 I will always have four cookies 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:19.030
 food in a link are in here 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.769
 and that has eight grams of fat and that 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.510
 I know that's what you think 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.250
 probably very rare here in Germany 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.979
 because that's what I think is a Polish one 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.340
 product is ok but of nestlÃ© 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.020
 and stands coco server that means that it 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.490
 A bar with white chocolate and 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.380
 coconut I think he is even still 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.580
 better the choreos that's just 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:43.539
 the hammer as you are I have now 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.910
 really clean for about a month 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:49.590
 You also ate based on the videos 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:52.120
 and then I thought okay 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.590
 It is the time where you come 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.600
 enjoy life again a bit 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.030
 That's why I'm going to be like this now 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.130
 make a little yes infection microns 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.650
 yes, I do not currently see any macros 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.840
 but I always have them indirectly in my head 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.760
 because we once a long time 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.410
 mikros has counted and knows that it 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.090
 she would always work like that 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.030
 bit in the head that one on his 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.020
 wise, you do not get too fat 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.690
 take the data 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.180
 that usually become so great at vip cm 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.550
 which already by sugar so in the form of 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.289
 sugar, which he does not like 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.259
 For example, strength will be good 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.120
 better of course, but that's just it 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:31.400
 concept and I will now 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.810
 make a little bit the brings my skin 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.240
 did not get any better either 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.270
 through better nutrition 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.830
 I'll just have to look at Monaco 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.419
 yes, I do not believe it to be me 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.819
 the diet is yes I will you 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.669
 Anyway, I'll do it 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:51.229
 to eat now 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:53.419
 Baguette cheese is so cool 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.310
 Who such a cheese is not now and then 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.770
 begrudge the missed what unfortunately I have to 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:02.659
 unfortunately , then I'll say sachs 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:05.750
 Can with tomatoes and salad so he 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:09.710
 Now come back to me then come 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:14.229
 probably a pack of chips and there 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.229
 I had to think that you are now 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:19.019
 then I turn later one oh 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:22.049
 yes, I almost forgot and left 

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:24.089
 not where it is piggy 

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:26.459
 if you are hungry I have 50 euro 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:28.709
 paid for this for this little bit 

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:30.360
 I will probably all of my 

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:32.369
 brother must hide because of it 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.649
 just on 2,200 calories 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:38.029
 that would be already asshole like them that 

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:38.029
 to rub everything under the nose somehow 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:47.279
 small protein shake with chocolate and 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:49.349

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:51.229
