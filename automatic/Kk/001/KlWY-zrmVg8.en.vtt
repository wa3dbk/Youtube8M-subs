00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
and of course on to one side of them ok

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.030 
and of course on to one side of them ok
because<00:05:10.720> it<00:05:10.900> cuts<00:05:11.050> down<00:05:11.260> as<00:05:11.470> options<00:05:11.800> and

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
because it cuts down as options and

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.010 
because it cuts down as options and
makes<00:05:12.220> it<00:05:12.370> a<00:05:12.639> safer<00:05:13.270> option<00:05:13.300> for<00:05:13.750> me<00:05:13.870> as<00:05:13.990> well

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
makes it a safer option for me as well

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.670 
makes it a safer option for me as well
and<00:05:14.470> as<00:05:14.860> he<00:05:15.010> comes<00:05:15.220> forward<00:05:15.520> punch<00:05:16.440> ok<00:05:17.440> and

and as he comes forward punch ok and

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.800 
and as he comes forward punch ok and
again<00:05:18.160> punch<00:05:18.700> and<00:05:19.030> then<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:19.390> can<00:05:19.540> pull<00:05:19.750> them

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
again punch and then I can pull them

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.870 
again punch and then I can pull them
don't<00:05:20.680> just<00:05:20.830> leave<00:05:20.980> it<00:05:21.160> loose<00:05:21.370> because<00:05:21.580> he<00:05:21.760> can

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
don't just leave it loose because he can

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.060
