 have served a good soloist I play six 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:55.489
 former professional fighters 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:01:01.420
 Benin yes it's true I am a preparer 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.420
 physical since 2005 2006 to be 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.860
 currently I taught maths I 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.960
 prepares some fighters is 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.590
 today especially we gathered here 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.840
 to talk about sport how beautiful is the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.450
 guide hero and spore 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.560
 it's a sport that I practice 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.140
 seriously for seven years and which one 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.950
 I try to develop in France by 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.950
 all possible means 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.380
 ok do you have both but how do you 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.299
 do it the first time you have it where you have it 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.180
 saw comments between contact with the 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.549
 quays of mails I think it should 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.380
 to be at the age of 9 I started 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.690
 I ended up in a room 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.799
 of weightlifting we saw people have 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.659
 used at home in Eastern Europe 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.759
 it is quite common to use 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.460
 different sports combat sports get 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.200
 speak forcefully the people the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.890
 use and mecatel m so I'm going I have 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.850
 used to use it and 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.909
 seriously really as a 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.970
 competitive discipline I started to 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.970
 use 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.510
 2007 in 2006 for executives like that has 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.760
 really none of his clips would have said 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.810
 okay we can parts as much 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.390
 served more as an accessory to your 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.300
 training and now it's become 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.819
 really a discipline a sport apart 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.250
 whole why for me yes it exists 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.620
 and as a discipline since 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.250
 its scope of wrinkles year for me yes 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.810
 this is the event thank you and so you 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.510
 obviously as a preparer 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.430
 physical that you that an important part 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.580
 in the physical preparation of theza 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.340
 head I already have already written some 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.530
 little article on this subject I am 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.400
 persuaded that the worry bike when 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.579
 the tool can be used to occupy at least 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.269
 80% of time spent preparing them 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:05.290
 are visible outside the practice 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:08.260
 mainly if we talk about mma they 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.150
 have 80% of time we find that with 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.099
 worry 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.650
 it's more than enough with it's a 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.590
 tool that is very suitable for all 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.659
 sports and for combat sports there 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.220
 there is a big job of force transfer 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.950
 from the bottom up which is very 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.420
 important it is for the hope of 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.560
 percussion the hope of grasping and 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.230
 that's why it's one of the tools 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.790
 the most privileged now in the 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.849
 preparation of physical preparation of 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.590
 fighters it has been handed over to the taste of 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.599
 day we will say assouline laziness 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.970
 in the United States but it's true when you 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.530
 were saying that in eastern countries 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.420
 it's something that's used 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.349
 for a very long time and who has ever 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.389
 stopped being used 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.870
 we have the impression that because we 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:56.280
 hears recently it's something 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.689
 something new but not at all the same 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.989
 in the eastern countries if we do they have 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:03.870
 never stopped using that's why 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:07.470
 that already bah at the age of 90 had 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.780
 already aware of that they have in the 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.210
 political system 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.730
 the cats is beautiful as 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.130
 competitive exists mostly alarmed 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.710
 yeah when you're going to talk about ballads 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.190
 soul and it's a former army that has 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.100
 brought 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.750
 it's really the best paid is the 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.180
 who is thanks to who it is 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.420
 develop is really he was able to propose 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.290
 to people to see this tool as something 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.990
 great thing 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.360
 I'm grateful for that I was 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.130
 obliged of him a senior in Russian or in 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.570
 English is that because it's 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.290
 customers in English is intense and the 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.580
 translated into Russian 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:48.150
 and yet he is Russian yeah that's 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.940
 thanks to him that today cape town 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.370
 beautiful grow worldwide 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.200
 thanks grace to the night that it was 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.460
 launched here we could talk to 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.100
 maybe a second person 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.680
 you can go finally this is it 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.180
 the second person is unique and a 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.310
 completely different approach to 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.440
 pavel what else is not at all 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.330
 oriented 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.419
 yes 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.340
 the difference between two sports we are going 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.560
 talk about that game yeah we 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.469
 will see the difference 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.020
 let's say from the near bows enough of 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:23.099
 not this week it's about 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.860
 to tire as much as possible 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.360
 we do an exercise in India by giving it 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.840
 and we try to get as tired as possible 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.639
 God's close to sports and youth 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.219
 it is to save for me that it is 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.629
 we do everything we can to avoid losing 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:38.370
 the strength to get the ten minutes 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:41.550
 gangs and regulatory this is where the 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.509
 difference between the masculine of 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.060
 the inspiration was completely 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.770
 different yeah it's a job that 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.659
 can say almost exactly opposite 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.020
 since I had once a lot who 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:54.719
 said that the movements of the rkc are 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.819
 intentionally ineffective so that this 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:58.319
 this is true it easier to 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:00.500
 to tire for me that they are 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:03.990
 get tired and so we can absolutely not 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.110
 with this approach the sphere of the gsp this 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.279
 is never going to keep pace with 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.819
 someone who uses the technique of 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:15.449
 crooked sport yes yes it's 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:17.490
 counterproductive and that's even it's not 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.210
 natural for a person had to do 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.389
 a movement 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.690
 who do not follow the cycle remain at the 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.759
 door 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.610
 yeah that's where this is the crucial point 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:29.919
 that they do not stay behind 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.620
 breathing cycle and let the 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:34.479
 movement wanted with no upside down ok 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.410
 we broke it adjusts our breathing 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.280
 another push to our movement 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.199
 eurosport went to the reverse the 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.419
 breathing that dictates to me the moment 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:45.069
 okay so much deposit she's going to get herself 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.289
 according to how I 'm going to breathe 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:49.120
 okay we're going to drink everything to 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:51.220
 the hour is that he is the lover especially 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.949
 the second this match are ripped off this is 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.229
 a guy like that would be ok bah is listening 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:59.039
 to get to work and who will we 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:07:01.419
 so explain the sne alger then 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:04.410
 possibly speak a little bit of a 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:07.660
 program or how to get to 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:11.699
 develop on this match a way 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.699
 effective at the dgid for video 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.840
 you
