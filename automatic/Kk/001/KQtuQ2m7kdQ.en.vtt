00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
is a more subtle proposition so it it

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.779 
is a more subtle proposition so it it
offers<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.960> little<00:00:58.230> finesse<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:59.309> explains

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
why it's a bit more expensive and why it

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.439 
why it's a bit more expensive and why it
has<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.190> worldwide<00:01:02.520> following<00:01:02.850> things<00:01:03.329> like

have the last three features that you

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.149 
have the last three features that you
mentioned<00:01:15.990> which<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> shame<00:01:16.439> but<00:01:16.979> then

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.950 
mentioned which is a shame but then
that's<00:01:17.520> reflected<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> price<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
that's reflected in the price the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.210 
that's reflected in the price the
implementation<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.619> touchscreen<00:01:20.040> technology

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.770 
implementation of touchscreen technology
on<00:01:20.549> these<00:01:20.670> two<00:01:20.820> devices<00:01:21.030> i<00:01:21.330> think<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.570> really

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
on these two devices i think is really

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.350 
on these two devices i think is really
important<00:01:22.229> because<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.590> more<00:01:23.040> readily

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
important because it more readily

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.700 
important because it more readily
emulates<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> experience<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.200> turning<00:01:25.500> pages

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
emulates the experience of turning pages

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.280 
emulates the experience of turning pages
and<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.939> tactile<00:01:27.360> nature<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.840> reading<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> book

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and the tactile nature of reading a book

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.770 
and the tactile nature of reading a book
but<00:01:28.560> while<00:01:28.920> i<00:01:28.950> do<00:01:29.040> find<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.549> grey<00:01:29.820> pink

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
but while i do find the grey pink

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.020 
but while i do find the grey pink
screens<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.439> these<00:01:31.560> two<00:01:31.740> devices<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.430> don't

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
screens on these two devices I don't

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.429 
screens on these two devices I don't
know<00:01:33.090> old-fashioned<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.200> there's

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
know old-fashioned if you like there's

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.929 
know old-fashioned if you like there's
there's<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.890> way<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.189> which<00:01:35.310> they<00:01:35.520> are<00:01:35.640> super

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
there's one way in which they are super

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.940 
there's one way in which they are super
futuristic<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.900> that's<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.350> terms<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
futuristic and that's in terms of the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.740 
futuristic and that's in terms of the
performance<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.369> their<00:01:38.490> battery<00:01:38.939> one<00:01:39.540> month

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
performance of their battery one month

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.050 
performance of their battery one month
for<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.140> two<00:01:40.530> months<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:41.189> not<00:01:41.430> quite<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> bar

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
for this two months it's not quite a bar
