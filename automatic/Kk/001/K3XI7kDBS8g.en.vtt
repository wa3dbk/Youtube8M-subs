00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.309 

everything<00:03:13.940> was<00:03:14.239> pretty<00:03:14.600> much<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:15.080> same

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
everything was pretty much the same

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.030 
everything was pretty much the same
throughout<00:03:15.799> all<00:03:17.230> 15<00:03:18.230> weeks<00:03:18.440> up<00:03:18.680> for<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:18.890> last

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.009 
throughout all 15 weeks up for the last
week<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.489> obviously<00:03:19.880> when<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:20.510> decided<00:03:20.900> to

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
week is obviously when I decided to

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.880 
week is obviously when I decided to
deplete<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:21.769> then<00:03:21.890> carve<00:03:22.190> up<00:03:22.400> but<00:03:23.890> moderate

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
deplete and then carve up but moderate

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.490 
deplete and then carve up but moderate
carbs<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.489> not<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:26.209> carb<00:03:26.510> sensitive<00:03:27.110> but

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
carbs to not to carb sensitive but

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.820 
carbs to not to carb sensitive but
protein<00:03:28.459> only<00:03:28.610> stays<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.090> same<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.830> just

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
protein only stays the same and just

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.130 
protein only stays the same and just
kind<00:03:31.069> of<00:03:31.190> slowly<00:03:31.880> cut<00:03:32.209> calories<00:03:32.420> coming<00:03:32.959> close

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
kind of slowly cut calories coming close

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:42.179
