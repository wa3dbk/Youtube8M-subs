is<00:00:48.989> really<00:00:49.410> slow<00:00:49.650> but<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.220> like<00:00:50.489> his<00:00:50.670> combo<00:00:51.000> I

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
is really slow but I do like his combo I

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.760 
is really slow but I do like his combo I
always<00:00:51.420> use<00:00:51.600> them<00:00:51.780> because<00:00:51.900> I<00:00:52.080> do<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.590> his

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
always use them because I do like his

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.710 
always use them because I do like his
combos<00:00:53.220> they<00:00:53.400> look<00:00:53.610> kind<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.880> cool<00:00:54.090> they<00:00:54.540> got<00:00:54.690> a

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
combos they look kind of cool they got a

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.810 
combos they look kind of cool they got a
lot<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:54.960> style<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.680> them<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.280> i<00:00:56.340> think<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
lot of style of them but i think the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.970 
lot of style of them but i think the
latest<00:00:57.150> up<00:00:57.240> cares<00:00:57.450> a<00:00:57.540> lot<00:00:57.630> of<00:00:57.840> style<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.320> has

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
latest up cares a lot of style and has

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.190 
latest up cares a lot of style and has
the<00:00:59.190> speed<00:00:59.520> necessary<00:00:59.850> maybe<00:01:00.810> a<00:01:00.900> lot<00:01:01.079> of

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
the speed necessary maybe a lot of

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.690 
the speed necessary maybe a lot of
characters<00:01:01.530> will<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.740> like<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.100> I'm<00:01:02.280> hoping
