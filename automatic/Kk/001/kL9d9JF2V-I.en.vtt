00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
a unique slingshot which I've made

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.100 
a unique slingshot which I've made

the<00:01:22.799> end<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:24.570> slingshot<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.049> summed<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.470> to

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the end the slingshot is summed up to

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.649 
the end the slingshot is summed up to
800<00:01:26.189> grit<00:01:26.430> apart<00:01:26.820> from<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> acrylic<00:01:27.479> which<00:01:27.630> is

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
800 grit apart from the acrylic which is

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.020 
800 grit apart from the acrylic which is
sums<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.740> thousand<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.909> that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
sums up to a thousand for it so that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.940 
sums up to a thousand for it so that
it's<00:01:30.150> got<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.540> good<00:01:30.840> c2<00:01:31.350> effect<00:01:31.710> which<00:01:31.920> you

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it's got that good c2 effect which you

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.280 
it's got that good c2 effect which you
can<00:01:32.250> see<00:01:32.460> here<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.960> entire<00:01:34.229> thing

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
can see here and then the entire thing

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.160 
can see here and then the entire thing
is<00:01:34.710> coated<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.280> three<00:01:36.030> layers<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.450> sunflower

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
is coated in three layers of sunflower

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.219 
is coated in three layers of sunflower
oil<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.710> then<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.909> coated<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.689> three<00:01:40.020> layers

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.550 
tutorial is also on the slingshot and
also<00:01:55.069> for<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.369> knife<00:01:55.780> so<00:01:56.780> now<00:01:56.929> let's<00:01:57.229> fire<00:01:57.439> the

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
also for the knife so now let's fire the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:39.250 
also for the knife so now let's fire the
slingshot

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.800 

-<00:02:39.739> this<00:02:39.920> world<00:02:40.220> is<00:02:40.550> still<00:02:40.760> hold<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.629> box

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
- this world is still hold and the box

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.570 
- this world is still hold and the box
this<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.530> where<00:02:43.740> they<00:02:43.860> came<00:02:44.040> out<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.280> as<00:02:44.550> you

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
this is where they came out and as you

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.340 
this is where they came out and as you
can<00:02:44.790> see<00:02:44.850> it's<00:02:45.180> full<00:02:45.450> loads<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.840> paper<00:02:46.050> out<00:02:46.200> the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
can see it's full loads of paper out the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.040 
can see it's full loads of paper out the
back

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
back

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.650 
back
the<00:02:48.410> syllables<00:02:48.890> will<00:02:49.040> survive<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.820> knife<00:02:50.510> on

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
the syllables will survive a knife on

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.240 
the syllables will survive a knife on
the<00:02:50.810> slingshot<00:02:51.260> from<00:02:51.380> usually<00:02:51.770> carve<00:02:52.040> through

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
the slingshot from usually carve through

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.210 
the slingshot from usually carve through
hardwood<00:02:52.850> like<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:54.080> it<00:02:54.650> can<00:02:54.800> easily<00:02:54.920> be

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
hardwood like this and it can easily be

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.680 
hardwood like this and it can easily be
used<00:02:55.430> for<00:02:55.670> whittling<00:02:56.120> in<00:02:56.270> case<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.570> don't

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
used for whittling in case you don't

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.850 
used for whittling in case you don't
have<00:02:56.780> another<00:02:57.050> knife<00:02:57.260> with<00:02:57.470> you

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
have another knife with you

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.560 
have another knife with you
so<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.580> knife<00:02:58.790> slingshots<00:02:59.300> a<00:02:59.390> really

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
so this knife slingshots a really

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.180 
so this knife slingshots a really
interesting<00:02:59.870> concept<00:03:00.320> and<00:03:00.710> I've<00:03:00.950> really

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
interesting concept and I've really

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.890 
interesting concept and I've really
enjoyed<00:03:01.220> making<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.240> hopefully<00:03:02.570> you'll

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
enjoyed making it and hopefully you'll

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.230 
enjoyed making it and hopefully you'll
enjoy<00:03:03.200> this<00:03:03.380> video<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.430> tutorial<00:03:05.060> and

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
enjoy this video and the tutorial and

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.840 
enjoy this video and the tutorial and
also<00:03:05.990> I'm<00:03:06.410> planning<00:03:06.770> to<00:03:06.800> take<00:03:07.040> this<00:03:07.280> nice

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
also I'm planning to take this nice

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.670 
also I'm planning to take this nice
little<00:03:08.090> shot<00:03:08.300> much<00:03:08.480> further<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.140> then

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
little shot much further and then

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.590 
little shot much further and then
attempt<00:03:10.280> using<00:03:10.730> different<00:03:11.300> design

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
attempt using different design

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.480 
attempt using different design
variations<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.590> see<00:03:12.740> which<00:03:12.920> one<00:03:13.130> comes<00:03:13.310> out

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
variations to see which one comes out

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.490 
variations to see which one comes out
with<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.790> best<00:03:14.000> result<00:03:14.360> but<00:03:14.570> this<00:03:15.080> was<00:03:15.320> just

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
with the best result but this was just

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.960 
with the best result but this was just
the<00:03:15.620> first<00:03:15.770> attempt<00:03:16.160> done<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.460> really<00:03:16.790> liked

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
the first attempt done I really liked

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.060 
the first attempt done I really liked
how<00:03:17.150> well<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.450> turned<00:03:17.480> out<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:18.200> made<00:03:18.890> this

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
how well it turned out I made this

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.140 
how well it turned out I made this
slingshot<00:03:19.310> because<00:03:19.790> I<00:03:19.850> had<00:03:19.970> a<00:03:20.000> lot

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
slingshot because I had a lot

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.120 
slingshot because I had a lot
