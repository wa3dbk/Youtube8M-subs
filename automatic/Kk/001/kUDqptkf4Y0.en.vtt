a<00:00:45.980> lot<00:00:46.910> more<00:00:47.179> efficient<00:00:47.750> than<00:00:47.960> studying<00:00:48.379> from

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
a book in my opinion Django did not read

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
music and as far as I know he didn't

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.450 
music and as far as I know he didn't
study<00:00:55.219> theory<00:00:55.760> on<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:57.379> other<00:00:57.530> hand<00:00:57.800> he<00:00:58.190> did

study theory on the other hand he did

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:29.310

a<00:02:27.050> good<00:02:27.290> example<00:02:27.770> of<00:02:28.070> a<00:02:28.220> tritone<00:02:28.730> substitute

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
a good example of a tritone substitute

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.520 
a good example of a tritone substitute
as<00:02:29.600> you<00:02:30.500> can<00:02:30.680> see<00:02:30.890> every<00:02:31.370> note<00:02:31.610> in<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.390> F<00:02:32.570> 7<00:02:33.350> 9

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
as you can see every note in the F 7 9

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.990 
as you can see every note in the F 7 9
lick<00:02:33.890> is<00:02:34.100> related<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.820> B<00:02:35.600> 7<00:02:35.989> sharp<00:02:36.830> 5<00:02:37.070> flat<00:02:37.760> 9

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
lick is related to B 7 sharp 5 flat 9

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.539 
lick is related to B 7 sharp 5 flat 9
sharp<00:02:38.510> 9<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:44.209> it<00:02:44.690> has<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.440> same<00:02:45.470> function<00:02:46.220> they

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
sharp 9 so it has the same function they

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:53.260 
sharp 9 so it has the same function they
both<00:02:46.940> want<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.480> go<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.750> E<00:02:47.930> minor
