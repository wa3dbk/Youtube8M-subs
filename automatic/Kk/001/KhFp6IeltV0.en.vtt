00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 And then people are talking about beauty. 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.750
 eduardo was welcomed to another video 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.030
 fifa 14 after three months without 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.900
 record 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.550
 I think it's time to go back to 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.710
 post videos on this channel with 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.939
 consistency 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.630
 in this video here I'll be in my 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.369
 goalkeeping career or to do is one of the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.539
 best moments of the match and I will 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:34.860
 comment on them over and over 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.850
 everything in the video only and do it and count the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.000
 video on youtube very simple because I 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.829
 I decided to use this method not 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.719
 I know the video is short and that's the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.789
 main objective of my opinion 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.940
 because a lot of the videos I do 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.800
 first train I made at that time 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.730
 they were very good and I tell you a lot 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.340
 nonsense and zucchini that I had not 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.979
 It is then a video was very very 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.750
 serious your comment many times and 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.220
 etc 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.030
 I'll give an example here I'll start 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.780
 in the race part hit a dangerous foul 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.479
 now Rafael took charge and did the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.240
 crossing header and I defended 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.759
 time and the team but managed to 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.220
 defender and defender took the ball after 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.790
 we had a lack to collect 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.340
 long distance basically the player 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.130
 made the pass to the manga and one received 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.600
 after the first they played in the world 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:45.649
 Rabbit arm it in defense very easy 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.960
 to the goalkeeper of the opposing team and 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:52.049
 crossed again he kicks and goes right 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.149
 of my beam going out if it were a 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.130
 goal probably would not get tbb 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.680
 meanwhile the boat and received the ball 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.409
 made the pass basso it again 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.840
 got to do 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.789
 another fine save our address 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.729
 rivals now 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.560
 end of first half 0 to 0 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.319
 a quick replacement in the team 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.560
 opponent who should be andré buru if I 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.230
 I think I told Rafael he received the ball and 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.580
 He made the pass to rego and back that did the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.310
 kick and I defended the kick and that's the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.120
 corner over the opponent 's charge 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.099
 first great defense even though I do 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.760
 meanwhile and then the other 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.950
 scoring hits rebate the ball kicked 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.440
 right of my race but the kick 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.319
 went straight to god sister made the pass 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.150
 for joão but only that preventing was 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.989

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.560

 position and hit all the steps and 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.980
 gave a kick 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:12.849

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.459

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.970
 Meanwhile, let's go to the second 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.829
 video match rely on verses 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.690

 season the flamengo is there in a shirt 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.799

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:37.959
 the everton of yellow and blue t-shirt 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:42.340
 there arises google will start this one 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:45.489
 game that was a disaster as the team of 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.200
 house in the following category rebound 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.810
 seven minutes and decided to make a 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.750
 has the wrong button and the player has passed 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.359
 I'm going to have a female son doing 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.530
 so I played in front of the area and 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.889
 zaga managed to take 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.810
 to the 32 minutes of new meazza managed to 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.910
 take one more chance 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.120
 Roberto received ball again from my 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:11.079
 goal to make the defense and kicked the ball 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.660
 to avoid any risk of 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.190
 go out and play 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.010
 usually he can get the ball 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.850
 but the team picks up the ball in 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:24.240
 then have the team play sequence 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.450
 managed to hit the ball doing those 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.720
 passes and sometimes makes it much easier 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.990
 ibagué received the ball on the field after 46 minutes. 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.440
 kicked was beaten on the beam and behind 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.900
 of their team managed to take the ball and 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:46.020
 with that it was the end of the first time 0 to 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:50.190
 0 until there was ever and everton to be 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:53.820
 quickly this part not only of its good 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.080
 moments even a look again at the 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.990
 other teams 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.500
 and then in the 58th minute I went to defend the 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.360
 ball 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.880
 the butter model did not let go and 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.070
 I got the danger out of a bat 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.570
 in the area of our own team and 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.750
 Yes, I 'm not mistaken, it was a moment. 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:13.800
 disastrous 73 minutes there in the area I 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.150
 I defended it was not there I think it was me now 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.340
 I kicked the ball forward 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.230
 a form was set for the team 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.430
 opponents they decided to make a 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.650
 rehearsed play 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.620
 he decided to make a rehearsed play 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.410
 wheel to hit another player called and 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.540
 player made the pass for him or if the 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.930
 ball was hitting the beam and iguatemi 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.180
 I managed to defend his race focuses on 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.810
 rebound the player stood alone in front 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.180
 the goal with the ball my back has fallen asleep 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.700
 slept a lot 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.460
 let's not take a look at these two 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:50.310
 players for a player and the player 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.980
 can pass straight through and make the goal 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.700
 look at this 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:59.730
 then the ball went back to 79 minutes. 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.830
 turn the ball in the area and castles 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:06.570
 managed to make a quiet defense 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:09.000
 goalkeeper of the German team 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.400
 the new guy who made the collection of 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.300
 I missed the kick I managed to defend the 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:18.270
 corner and this is one more corner 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:22.290
 disastrous I've ever seen the ball hit the 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:24.750
 player I jumped the next focus again 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:30.420
 do not bounce face alone with the goal 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:33.650
 fully open and that's 2 to 0 2 to 0 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:36.930
 or sell minutes the goal 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.590
 I found I was disappointed start to 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.330
 vacancy 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:43.830
 My car was left alone with the goal. 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:48.030
 fully open and I'm thinking about 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:52.730
 leave this team because we simply 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:55.920
 we did not score in both matches 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:07:00.000
 the defense overslept we lose 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:02.490
 that my team is not so strong and 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.160
 in context the other teams simply 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:08.340
 played extremely well against the 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:13.110
 other stronger teams is even losing 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:16.890
 in these games and fortunately I'm going out 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:19.740
 this team last season everton 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:24.210
 came in fifth place and got a 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.230
 excellent campaign and health 1 to 0 in 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.040
 castellan 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:32.520
 this is the example that says and we are going to 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:35.190
 the details of the match were 6.2 suffered 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.010
 two goals 2000 were defended stretches 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:40.230
 were neither informed nor kicked and kicked 

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.510
 I was out of position seven times and the 

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.830
 wall stayed in 76 

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.590
 This is it, I hope you have 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:50.540
 We'll see if the next match 

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.540
 Our team gets something
