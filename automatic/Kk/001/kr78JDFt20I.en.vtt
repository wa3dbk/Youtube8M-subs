00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.384
Forehand Net Deceptive Flick (I) What is it?

00:00:05.587 --> 00:00:09.682
Forehand net deceptive flick

00:00:10.252 --> 00:00:13.285
I would like to show that technique

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.488
It can be used in singles little more

00:00:17.488 --> 00:00:21.794
but also in doubles and mixed doubles it can be used

00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:27.785
there are many ways to lift shuttlecock from the net

00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:31.212
normal way is swing lift

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:36.659
but there is more advanced way to do it

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:42.810
I would like to show what I mean by deceptive forehand net

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.175
In order for you to see better I removed the net away

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:52.731
so net is here

00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:54.517
have a look at it please

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.765
hold

00:00:56.796 --> 00:00:57.499
hold

00:00:59.053 --> 00:00:59.845
hold

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.505
what I am trying to do is I show my opponents

00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:10.993
this posture first

00:01:12.378 --> 00:01:16.977
and then from this posture I change the shots

00:01:17.962 --> 00:01:19.538
ok this is possible

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.242
I call it hold the shuttlecock

00:01:24.089 --> 00:01:26.752
ok watch this so I am ready

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:28.937
shuttle is coming

00:01:28.937 --> 00:01:32.210
immediately I hold the shuttlecock

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.038
hold

00:01:34.654 --> 00:01:35.457
hold

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:43.250
when I am holding the shuttlecock

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.291
I am not only holding the shuttlecock

00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:51.101
when I am holding like that

00:01:51.655 --> 00:01:54.395
my opponent have to stop

00:01:55.211 --> 00:01:58.449
because he doesn't know what I am going to do

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:59.430
compare

00:02:08.247 --> 00:02:09.163
or

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:20.904
If I hit like that

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.801
my opponent can time it

00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:25.352
my hitting timing

00:02:25.737 --> 00:02:30.058
my opponent can see which direction I am hitting

00:02:30.058 --> 00:02:31.565
so he can predict

00:02:32.412 --> 00:02:33.844
compare again

00:02:33.844 --> 00:02:35.177
if I do that

00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:45.286
sometimes net

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:47.786
sometimes cross

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:50.453
sometimes flick

00:02:51.128 --> 00:02:52.787
sometimes flick

00:02:53.772 --> 00:02:55.153
so in this way

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.949
I have all 4 shots

00:02:59.088 --> 00:03:03.868
and I can choose at the last moment

00:03:05.288 --> 00:03:07.541
Let's say we are playing singles

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:12.408
I am hitting flick 2 different ways

00:03:12.408 --> 00:03:14.250
one normal lift

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.408
and another one hold and flick

00:03:17.408 --> 00:03:20.204
please see how much it changes

00:03:20.204 --> 00:03:21.564
ok go smash

00:03:21.564 --> 00:03:25.448
net I will lift normal way

00:03:26.064 --> 00:03:27.307
he will smash

00:03:27.392 --> 00:03:28.517
have a look please

00:03:33.337 --> 00:03:35.236
because I am doing that

00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:36.698
he can time it

00:03:37.098 --> 00:03:40.080
its not sharp so he can smash, one more

00:03:45.978 --> 00:03:49.538
In this he will do the net I will lift normal

00:03:49.538 --> 00:03:51.327
watch this please smash

00:03:51.811 --> 00:03:54.290
I do that normal lift like that

00:03:54.614 --> 00:03:55.669
he can smash

00:03:56.454 --> 00:03:57.819
same straight there

00:03:58.198 --> 00:03:59.628
yeah I do that

00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:04.717
yeah I do that

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.043
easy to smash

00:04:09.597 --> 00:04:14.065
please watch what happens if I hold and hit

00:04:22.523 --> 00:04:23.290
hold

00:04:25.743 --> 00:04:26.496
hold

00:04:27.609 --> 00:04:28.577
hold

00:04:30.359 --> 00:04:33.347
because I hold it he has to stop

00:04:33.886 --> 00:04:37.789
I am making him stop and then I hit it

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.185
so he will be late

00:04:43.218 --> 00:04:45.294
