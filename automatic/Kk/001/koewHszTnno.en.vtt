things<00:00:18.510> for<00:00:18.630> example<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.990> can't<00:00:19.320> run<00:00:19.619> fraps

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
things for example you can't run fraps

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.040 
things for example you can't run fraps
or<00:00:20.189> record<00:00:20.550> with<00:00:20.699> fraps<00:00:21.090> when<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.720> game<00:00:21.900> is

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050

or record with fraps when the game is
fullscreen<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:23.220> will<00:00:23.730> freeze<00:00:24.090> your

screen resolution and then what you want

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.900 
screen resolution and then what you want
to<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.829> want<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.100> drop<00:00:47.520> your<00:00:47.579> screen

resolution to a more acceptable level I

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.920 
resolution to a more acceptable level I
like<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:51.890> basically<00:00:52.890> because<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.489> want<00:00:53.670> to

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
like this basically because you want to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.600 
like this basically because you want to
pick<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.989> size<00:00:55.289> where<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.039> edges<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
pick a size where the edges of the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.790 
pick a size where the edges of the
screen<00:00:56.940> aren't<00:00:57.449> too<00:00:57.660> far<00:00:57.960> away<00:00:58.170> from<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.590> game

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
screen aren't too far away from the game

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.020 
screen aren't too far away from the game
window<00:00:59.160> because<00:00:59.399> we're<00:00:59.609> gonna<00:00:59.699> have<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.940> run

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
window because we're gonna have to run

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.380 
window because we're gonna have to run
the<00:01:00.180> game<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.629> windowed<00:01:00.899> mode<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:02.390> that

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
the game in windowed mode and that

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.910 
the game in windowed mode and that
causes<00:01:03.899> another<00:01:04.110> problem<00:01:04.500> which<00:01:04.589> I'll<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:04.860> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
causes another problem which I'll get to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.710 
causes another problem which I'll get to
in<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.129> bit<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.790> when<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.090> run<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> game<00:01:06.630> in

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
in a bit but when you run the game in

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.510 
in a bit but when you run the game in
windowed<00:01:07.020> mode<00:01:07.170> if<00:01:07.409> your<00:01:07.680> resolution<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.400> too

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
windowed mode if your resolution is too

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.880 
windowed mode if your resolution is too
high<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.729> window<00:01:09.150> will<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.330> quite<00:01:09.720> small<00:01:10.049> so

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
high the window will be quite small so

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.859 
high the window will be quite small so
basically<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.700> scroll<00:01:12.090> around<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> game

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
basically to scroll around in the game

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.810 
basically to scroll around in the game
you<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.470> move<00:01:13.860> your<00:01:14.040> mouse<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.460> edges

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
you have to move your mouse to the edges

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.270 
you have to move your mouse to the edges
of<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.060> screen<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.080> that's<00:01:16.320> quite<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.890> ways

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
of the screen so that's quite a ways

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.520 
of the screen so that's quite a ways
away<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.729> your<00:01:17.880> resolution<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.450> high<00:01:18.600> plus<00:01:18.990> it

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
away if your resolution is high plus it

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.990 
away if your resolution is high plus it
doesn't<00:01:19.830> look<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.159> good<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.460> yourself<00:01:20.610> when

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
doesn't look so good for yourself when

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.399 
doesn't look so good for yourself when
you're<00:01:21.119> playing<00:01:21.299> because<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.020> windows<00:01:22.320> so

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
you're playing because the windows so

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.870 
you're playing because the windows so
small<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.040> bit<00:01:23.159> harder<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.460> click<00:01:23.729> on

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
small so it's a bit harder to click on

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.370 
small so it's a bit harder to click on
things<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.869> set<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.200> that

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
things so I like to set it to that

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.560 
things so I like to set it to that
resolution<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.479> do

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
resolution but then what you have to do

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.020 
resolution but then what you have to do
is<00:01:27.659> go<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.810> advanced<00:01:28.350> settings<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.790> click

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
is go to advanced settings and you click

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.640 
is go to advanced settings and you click
on<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.350> want<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.500> go<00:01:31.590> to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
on that and then you want to go to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.109 
on that and then you want to go to
monitor<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.460> change<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.960> color<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:35.340> 16-bit

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
monitor and change the color to 16-bit

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.660 
monitor and change the color to 16-bit
this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.869> because<00:01:37.259> when<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.710> run<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.100> game<00:01:38.310> in

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
this is because when you run the game in

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.850 
this is because when you run the game in
windowed<00:01:39.150> mode<00:01:39.329> if<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.689> not<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:40.049> 16-bit<00:01:40.710> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
windowed mode if it's not on 16-bit it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.999 
windowed mode if it's not on 16-bit it
just<00:01:41.130> has<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.549> weird<00:01:41.850> purpley<00:01:42.689> black<00:01:43.320> kind

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
just has this weird purpley black kind

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.249 
just has this weird purpley black kind
of<00:01:44.130> effect<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.540> got<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.720> set<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.110> to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
of effect and so you got to set it to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.760 
of effect and so you got to set it to
16-bit<00:01:47.159> color<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.909> press<00:01:48.119> ok<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:49.500> will

16-bit color and press ok and that will

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.280 
16-bit color and press ok and that will
then<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.610> should<00:01:51.000> go<00:01:51.990> ahead<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.530> set<00:01:54.290> the
