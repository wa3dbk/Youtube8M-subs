00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
original network that it is on in our

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.630 
original network that it is on in our
case<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.229> Rogers<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.010> next<00:01:11.369> step<00:01:11.490> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
just to type in your imei that we just

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.350 
just to type in your imei that we just
obtained<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.400> below<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.850> will<00:01:14.970> give<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.270> an

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
obtained and below it will give you an

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.420 
obtained and below it will give you an
estimated<00:01:15.750> cost<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.530> delivery<00:01:16.979> date<00:01:17.189> and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
estimated cost and delivery date and

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.580 
estimated cost and delivery date and
this<00:01:17.610> varies<00:01:18.000> between<00:01:18.150> device<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.110> carrier

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
this varies between device and carrier

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.440 
this varies between device and carrier
so<00:01:20.250> after<00:01:20.400> your<00:01:20.610> device<00:01:20.820> has<00:01:20.850> been<00:01:21.000> unlocked

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
so after your device has been unlocked

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.090 
so after your device has been unlocked
within<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> estimated<00:01:22.350> delivery<00:01:22.590> window<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
within the estimated delivery window you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.770 
within the estimated delivery window you
should<00:01:23.490> receive<00:01:23.759> an<00:01:23.820> email<00:01:24.119> from<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
should receive an email from the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.480 
should receive an email from the
unlocking<00:01:25.259> company<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.830> which<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.250> are<00:01:26.340> ready

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
unlocking company in which we are ready

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.100 
unlocking company in which we are ready
to<00:01:26.580> actually<00:01:26.909> start<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.479> unlocking<00:01:27.960> process

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
to actually start the unlocking process

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.170 
to actually start the unlocking process
so<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> first<00:01:29.220> thing<00:01:29.310> we're<00:01:29.490> going<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.729> do<00:01:29.970> is

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
so the first thing we're going to do is

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.390 
so the first thing we're going to do is
remove<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.840> SIM<00:01:31.140> card<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:32.070> there<00:01:32.280> we

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
remove the SIM card and in there we

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.280 
remove the SIM card and in there we
currently<00:01:32.759> do<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.240> our<00:01:33.270> original<00:01:33.930> rogers

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
currently do have our original rogers

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.590 
currently do have our original rogers
sim<00:01:34.560> card<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.130> all<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.790> got<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.180> take

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
sim card and all you got to do is take

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.999 
sim card and all you got to do is take
out<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.900> sim<00:01:37.140> card<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.560> put<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.860> your

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
out that sim card and put in your

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.499 
out that sim card and put in your
foreign<00:01:38.369> sim<00:01:38.549> card<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.060> case<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.479> are

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
foreign sim card in this case we are

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.480 
foreign sim card in this case we are
hoping<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.930> use<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.110> device<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.159> telus

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
hoping to use this device on the telus

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.130 
hoping to use this device on the telus
network<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.119> put<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.479> your<00:01:42.570> tell<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> sim

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
network so you put in your tell a sim

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.410 
network so you put in your tell a sim
card<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:44.100> notification<00:01:44.490> should<00:01:45.119> pop<00:01:45.390> up

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
card and a notification should pop up

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.840 
card and a notification should pop up
telling<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.649> activation<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.399> required

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
telling you that activation is required

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.580 
telling you that activation is required
so<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.509> next<00:01:48.659> step<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.960> very<00:01:49.020> simple<00:01:49.439> just

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
so the next step is very simple just

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.080 
so the next step is very simple just
plug<00:01:49.890> your<00:01:49.920> device<00:01:50.070> into<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.640> computer<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
plug your device into the computer and

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.999 
plug your device into the computer and
as<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.540> may<00:01:51.659> notice<00:01:51.840> by<00:01:52.110> now<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> unlocking

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
as you may notice by now the unlocking

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.980 
as you may notice by now the unlocking
process<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.549> an<00:01:53.729> iPhone<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.390> quite<00:01:54.720> different

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
process on an iPhone is quite different

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.899 
process on an iPhone is quite different
compared<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.979> an<00:01:56.189> Android<00:01:56.640> device

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
compared to an Android device

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.090 
compared to an Android device
immediately<00:01:57.570> after<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.170> has<00:01:58.320> detected<00:01:58.860> that

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
immediately after it has detected that

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.010 
immediately after it has detected that
you<00:01:59.310> did<00:01:59.490> put<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.000> sim<00:02:00.299> card<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.899> is

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
you did put in a sim card that is

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.420 
you did put in a sim card that is
different<00:02:01.229> from<00:02:01.350> its<00:02:01.590> original<00:02:01.649> carrier<00:02:02.159> it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
different from its original carrier it

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.709 
different from its original carrier it
should<00:02:02.670> bring<00:02:02.790> up<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.060> page<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.299> says

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
should bring up a page that says

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.870 
should bring up a page that says

pretty<00:02:21.340> much<00:02:21.430> making<00:02:21.849> it<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.239> factory<00:02:22.659> unlock

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
pretty much making it a factory unlock

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.960 
pretty much making it a factory unlock
