that did not benefit because they might

that did not benefit because they might

what we continue to need is an

what we continue to need is an

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
don't see that test occurring in the

don't see that test occurring in the
next<00:03:29.480> five<00:03:30.049> years<00:03:30.079> certainly<00:03:31.660> but<00:03:32.660> one<00:03:32.989> would

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
next five years certainly but one would

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.229 
next five years certainly but one would
hope<00:03:33.319> in<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.680> next<00:03:33.799> ten<00:03:34.400> years<00:03:34.700> one<00:03:35.000> might

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
hope in the next ten years one might

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.170 
hope in the next ten years one might
have<00:03:35.480> that<00:03:35.720> test<00:03:36.130> so<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:37.160> many<00:03:37.819> of<00:03:38.060> the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
have that test so that many of the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.210 
have that test so that many of the
people<00:03:38.359> we<00:03:38.750> now<00:03:38.959> treat<00:03:39.470> with<00:03:39.739> adjuvant

people we now treat with adjuvant
chemotherapy<00:03:40.690> we<00:03:41.690> would<00:03:41.870> prove<00:03:42.169> don't

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
chemotherapy we would prove don't

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.099 
chemotherapy we would prove don't
benefit<00:03:43.400> by<00:03:43.609> it<00:03:43.639> and<00:03:43.970> therefore<00:03:44.150> we<00:03:44.629> wouldn't

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
benefit by it and therefore we wouldn't
