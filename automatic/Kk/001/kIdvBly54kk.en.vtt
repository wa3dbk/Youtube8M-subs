00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.660
 hello to you serzh and 121 and today 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.090
 we have another duel release today 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.460
 We will consider two Soviet tanks IS-3 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.230
 and British heavy tank caernarvon 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.270
 last video I talked about 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.800
 technical characteristics of the tank is-3 about 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.199
 strengths and weaknesses 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.270
 so this time I will talk about 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.529
 british tanks carnarvon with which i 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.980
 to fight 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.600
 to the advantages it should be attributed to good 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.090
 the dynamics there are very good to overclock 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.479
 maintaining speed while speed 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.540
 turning the tower and the hull are very good and 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:45.210
 its almost impossible to spin on 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.049
 heavy tank and medium tank is also not 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.299
 always it succeeds the instrument does not have 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:56.280
 good damage but rate of fire 

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:58.860
 it compensates well for booking 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.710
 the frontal part of the tank is 130 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.280
 millimeters in the case of 152 millimeters in 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.949
 the tower 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.979
 tank side and stern armor 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.310
 so good and there often 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.380
 breaks through with lower level weapons and 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.109
 artillery able to inflict full damage 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.609
 breaking through high-explosive fragmentation shells well 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.609
 well let's see a duel 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.149
 as you see i'm in a position for 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.280
 fountain and see what to do my 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.619
 the enemy since his cannon 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.729
 recharged faster then he will have to 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.729
 get out at me more often and try to break through 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.160
 Here we see that the enemy to leave with 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.100
 right side i do damage to the board 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.900
 but he also punches me on board 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.900
 part of the tank over here through the bulwark 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.650
 the enemy is trying to spin me I 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.440
 I try to tighten the body 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.570
 but he punches me in the side why is it 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.950
 happened because this part 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.390
 the fountain prevented me from driving first and 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.640
 immediately turn around and I had to 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.740
 first turn the body through 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.370
 forward then take it back I lost 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.260
 time i see the opponent trying 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.420
 substitute portal 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.240
 remove the tank side and put 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.459
 forehead and to punch the opponent into the bottom 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.500
 Bronelist contributed I have to drive off 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.760
 back since the angles deny tips 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.160
 guns that is how gun 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.090
 goes down not very good 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.900
 I give back and punch the enemy in the forehead 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.680
 the frontal part of the tank makes its way from IS-3 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.680
 general without problems 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.130
 and then substitute the angle there under 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.060
 right angle and the enemy can not me 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.060
 punch in board 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.340
 also very good tactic on IS-3 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:03.340
 combat british tank to norman 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.709
 is to grind the sides as you see 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.599
 it's very difficult for the enemy to target our 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.900
 side of the only thing that can 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:14.670
 become the top of the tank or the tower 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.730
 here this part of the tower is very vulnerable to 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.669
 to very vulnerable well makes its way but 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.500
 if we go back and forth 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:25.269
 attracted to the board of the enemy then to him 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.150
 it will be very difficult to punch us and 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.780
 often shells will hit the board 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.769
 in the sides of the tower and simply will be held 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.739
 one bounce 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.900
 if the enemy will shoot at the top 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.030
 part of the tank then punch you of course 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.419
 will be but not always because it will be very 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.430
 hard to target this part of the tank 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:48.030
 The vow of pickup angles is not always 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.030
 grab 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:56.000
 as we see the enemy does not fall 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.580
 I inflict damage to the board and continue 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.300
 ride along the enemy tank again 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.300
 ricochet happens I recharge 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.790
 once again like our uranium in the side 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.439
 the enemy also punches me in the side 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.169
 since i'm too far away from 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:19.620
 enemy tank is generally the same 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:25.560
 The problem also arose in a duel with the Chinese 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:28.880
 110 d tanks which is great with 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.880
 dedicated to the last issue 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:37.380
 what do we see in an enemy tank 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:39.530
 I have 66 left half and it remains 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.330
 just pierce the enemy tank once 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.940
 in general, I can exchange without problems 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.580
 your hp 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.070
 having shot a memory pam more than once 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.690
 the enemy will be unprofitable 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.390
 situations as we will be 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.980
 where we need and its problems 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.980
 almost 100% probability 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.220
 I'm waiting for recharge 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.120
 and move away from the enemy tank 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.139
 and I 'm breaking and it's a victory 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.730
 attention subscribe to our channel and 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:23.140
 soon you can see other videos 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.140
 dedicated to this game
