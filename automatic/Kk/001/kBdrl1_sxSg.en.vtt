00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.840
 And then everyone here is talking about beauty. 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.340
 kingston in another video bringing games 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.949
 snows to the channel 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.010
 This time I decided to bring several 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.160
 scenarios and more this time brought seven 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.560
 games we read to you who want to 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.180
 have fun but have not noticed 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.010
 I'm back after the channel 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.949
 four days in videos 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.660
 so yeah your despair is over the channel 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.120
 will work again 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.129
 I had to 9 at the latest that there the bug 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.129
 to talk in the next video since the theme 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.440
 of today are seven lightweight games for fish 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.690
 chicken remembering that they are all fps 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:59.280
 none that have action and adventure of the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:01:00.000
 genre fps fps good that came in seventh 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.090
 place 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.080
 It's the bling point It's a game 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.080
 very good 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:15.689
 nice graphics okay but the problem 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:18.180
 point blank game crap because 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:24.470
 when you normally enter you already 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.470
 born a guy there was playing and was born 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.729
 there 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.320
 so it stays in the last place 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:42.240
 The reason for playing the gameplay a lot 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.079
 acceptable good and the game is 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.399
 very good 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.450
 it's worth you're imagining the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:52.549
 problem are hackers because of 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.549
 hackers this game is in seventh place 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:03.619
 the fire is a great channel of several videos 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.619
 some nor 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.290
 He even laughs very fast and did not stay long. 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.780
 and that's why I discovered that the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.450
 crossfire is a game that has very fast 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.880
 so if you want to download 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.860
 worth it was reason for graphics 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.989
 gameplay looks very much like 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.019
 strange but it's a very good game 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.790
 considerable is one of the best I've ever 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.760
 I played at least for myself is one of the 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.550
 better and his problem is the hacker 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.190
 so if you want to download it to judge 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.110
 worth but it is already warning that has 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.850
 hacker for you then never won there 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.019
 But the club did not tell me what to do. 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.440
 no hacker 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.910
 So I'm going to download good pretensions. 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.000
 next to what came in fifth place 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.209
 It's how strange I was to 1.6 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.170
 strange that it is already the whole saga with 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.330
 striker are great great games already 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.099
 brought when I joined the non channel 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.709
 was one with six meters 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.349
 It's a great game he does not have a hacker. 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.450
 less is not much if you have another 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.739
 in throwing you into the hardest thing that 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.750
 you will find 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.060
 so it's worth you to download at least 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.070
 I did not find it fast because I move to 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.690
 You have all tested 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.750
 so that's why I 'm bringing 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.690
 these games that I think are very good and will 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.239
 there is strike 1.6 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.090
 it has a good graphics gameplay 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.819
 I 'm not very good but it 's a great game. 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.600
 for reasons of arms to arms 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.299
 they are good so that's why 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.209
 I left the Troicki context for 6 in 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.489
 fifth place 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.250
 so how much does the tracks horns it 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.720
 in the fourth because the context that arises 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.060
 because the context that emerges is 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.980
 almost 1.6 only with graphics 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.389
 better better weapons, right? 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.370
 when everyone knows when 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.750
 betrayals you can find a 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.970
 online system 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.519
 so that's why the game becomes good not 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.530
 have fast and if you have you can play there 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.530
 against bout that is also cool zinho 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.930
 also extreme okay so I have brought 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.780
 how much straight flush for the channel then 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.139
 for this reason I think one of the three 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.860
 bears in this stay 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.389
 Let's go to the next place. 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.099
 The next one you'll see is a 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.650
 surprise 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:34.479
 the son of play suffers who does not have 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.479
 Money is buying to see the son of 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.599
 340 Son of a Factoring Father 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:47.389
 the tri is a great game looks very much like 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:49.729
 the new bellfield because it's always had 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.680
 that same 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.110
 the game is very good it may not be very 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.949
 known or many may not play at 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.689
 what do i see 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.360
 but it's a great game worth you 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:01.969
 low has no hacker is the best of everything 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.050
 then it is worth you download the chart 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:05.029
 great 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.500
 so that's why the kid son of staying 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:10.669
 in third 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.650
 so let's go to the next shot block 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.319
 is in second place but per kilo and 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.839
 xote and did not see the son of play for clean 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:20.569
 the black shot i left second because 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:21.979
 I played a lot, I really enjoyed seeing him. 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.680
 son of play for free 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.740
 he is not at least not system 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.960
 windows 8 for all play for free is 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.900
 A great game, yes, but I could not. 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.729
 download with 118 i'm god serve and the 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:40.069
 7 and I do not have any more then 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.500
 xote rotated in the middle that hi 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:44.870
 I found it very good and it is lighter still 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.539
 that the play was so worth it 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.460
 download a package does not have hackers 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:53.210
 very good gameplay and graphics 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:57.469
 considered one worth downloading 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:59.029
 No strong team and we are going to the first team. 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:02.689
 place 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:06.860
 The first gets elite forces Great Game 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:08.990
 and if it looks a lot like br okay then 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.610
 Great game too you can equip 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.610
 shape the way you want it 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:20.060
 in mines and many other things but after 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:21.800
 very good does not have several types of mode 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.370
 game as you destroy yourself and 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.409
 multicore TechNet're so why this 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.720
 reason I think he deserves the first 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:33.440
 setting the game 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:37.070

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.870
 many fps but are not light head 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:26.180
 behind and ends up getting the person's needs 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:29.090
