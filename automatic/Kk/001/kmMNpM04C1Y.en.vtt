people will be really excited to be able

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.610 
people will be really excited to be able
to<00:03:44.160> delve<00:03:44.490> deeper<00:03:44.820> into<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:45.120> world<00:03:45.300> and<00:03:45.620> to

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
to delve deeper into the world and to

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.830 
to delve deeper into the world and to
interact<00:03:47.190> with<00:03:47.670> these<00:03:47.820> these<00:03:48.240> plans<00:03:48.570> these

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
interact with these these plans these

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.140 
interact with these these plans these
animals<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.500> see<00:03:49.710> how<00:03:49.890> they<00:03:50.100> how<00:03:50.640> they<00:03:50.670> react

animals and see how they how they react

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.970 
animals and see how they how they react
with<00:03:51.360> you<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.780> think<00:03:51.990> the<00:03:52.380> game<00:03:52.560> gives<00:03:52.800> them

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
with you and I think the game gives them

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.250 
with you and I think the game gives them
that<00:03:53.010> opportunity<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.880> be<00:03:54.000> able<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.600> have<00:03:55.140> this

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
that opportunity to be able to have this

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.170 
that opportunity to be able to have this
interaction<00:03:55.710> so<00:03:56.250> if<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.400> let<00:03:56.610> bill<00:03:56.760> one<00:03:56.970> world

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
interaction so if you let bill one world

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.890 
interaction so if you let bill one world
and<00:03:57.690> create<00:03:57.990> to<00:03:58.260> two<00:03:59.100> ways<00:03:59.340> of<00:03:59.610> enjoying

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
and create to two ways of enjoying

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.820 
and create to two ways of enjoying
simultaneously<00:04:00.900> separately<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.740> in

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
simultaneously separately and in

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.040 
simultaneously separately and in
parallel<00:04:02.130> I<00:04:02.520> think<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.450> thing<00:04:03.570> that<00:04:03.630> sets<00:04:03.930> the

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
parallel I think the thing that sets the

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.890 
parallel I think the thing that sets the
avatar<00:04:04.410> game<00:04:04.550> apart<00:04:05.550> is<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:06.210> the<00:04:06.510> sensory

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
avatar game apart is that is the sensory

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.750 
avatar game apart is that is the sensory
nature<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.530> experience<00:04:07.920> I<00:04:08.220> also<00:04:08.430> feel

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
nature of the experience I also feel

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.910 
nature of the experience I also feel
like<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.300> game<00:04:09.510> is<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:10.170> true<00:04:10.590> in<00:04:10.740> Spirit

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
like that the game is is true in Spirit

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.180 
like that the game is is true in Spirit
