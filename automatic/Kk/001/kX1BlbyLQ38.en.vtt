00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.179
 bit abroad with the press when I took over it will play 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.279
 I play a good performance to see the Hungarian music 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.210
 why new festival only budapest 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.120
 well i'm not much i know there are plans in the many 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.210
 not the test and do 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.110
 and 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.060
 with 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.320
 can do even better 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.780
 when it comes to seeing, I don't get much further than anyone else 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.020
 important point 6 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.130
 kenny and does and doesn't know cuijk let's dance event manager becomes brands 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.469
 has also been a kind of quote 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.900
 also not but after that the festival the party is designated 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.360
 been the normal person 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.450
 and that goes according to the fund we are not going 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.140
 People have never been right that you don't like AMD 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.310
 super the farmer 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.540
 that's what it was called and to the other bands because they don't know but it is 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.380
 always interesting to check what is nervous 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.850
 very nice video 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.180
 stabbing the sand for more than twenty 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.180
 nice to see what progress has been made last year 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.570
 the employees were killed 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.240
 location and play 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.510
 play now matters 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.580
 after the release of your debut album london anp you performed a lot 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.110
 a report from an album that doesn't mind 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.110
 This is how a big statement is led 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.590
 where that would play out years in itself 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.430
 that is finally we mainly self-financed stand I wanted very 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.560
 like it is the middle between a quality and one and the people 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.530
 and of course there is just not that much stage there 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.810
 they did try to play as much as possible and we had more 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.850
 Want to play were not too inconvenient for a 2 second time penalty 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.700
 10 yes no with the structure actually falling as expected 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.019
 10 if there is with the new construction site 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.069
 then you are poor animals raging at the end of the year 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.719
 so it will be released next year 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:22.679
 to do 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.859
 that is not for nothing less 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.909
 experimental than this 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.959
 because it makes the things that I play on stage the backs pmt the things 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:32.989
 they just come 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.500
 the audience was often not so good what to do with it but quietly too 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:37.549
 make it 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.889
 I really enjoy interacting with the audience every time the new album 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.029
 as focused on songs and 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.729
 continue after a little more conversation 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.119
 the beats and each other things and 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.180
 9 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.969
 the vvv so there is more 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.489
 we will be more intertwined in a cell 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.659
 be a first part of instead of leading the number 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.799
 the cows for your pressure to at least the responses to the signatories 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.769
 no absolutely not from stable ebit the target audience although the responses are very good 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.499
 have not been that we have the car 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:12.110
 the world is changing 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.350
 180 c 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.850
 no but the reactions were very good to be able to go outside the netherlands 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.529
 play 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:19.909
 that delivers 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.479
 yet, however, were a step further jamaica I think even that it is fisherman 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.439
 we need a new record to be able to go abroad even more 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.859
 play and 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.689
 daan 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.979
 And that is then it won't be handy if Greece needs something 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.390
 easily resisted 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.719
 and then the previous month 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:42.419
 no if the maybe also a few man is usually question that there is 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.039
 are irreplaceable 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:45.559
 definitely not the moment 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.140
 search for interesting one 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.439
 he says to all of them together 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.589
 don't you go alone with the plague 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:54.139
 to also 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.440
 I like this opinion and I can't get it to work 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.389
 the question 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:03:59.319
 but do it 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.109
 I hope so 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.349
 it's a good time and of course that has a lot of little things in it 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.909
 is the sign of the biggest fish 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.859
 no i would really like to be smart at them 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.509
 brewer 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:15.759
 very tempting is welcome in the meantime to go in the direction of them the computer 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:19.949
 games that do things like a volvo junkie xl so sometimes you can 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.330
 very electronic is right because cutting and pasting 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.229
 why 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.449
 gradually 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.139
 on the one hand it is very nice when sales are the music 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:31.960
 that makes 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.800
 can be used in that kind of series or 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.949
 different games 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.480
 on the other hand, that's why I don't think so much to do except on 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.250
 kept an eye on the world 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.300
 specially write music for 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.539
 commercially many games and movies 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.539
 that is why I want to find it very interesting right now 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.279
 I have to do it in order to live from it I do it also increases 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.860
 but not so much the plus 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.509
 the plate was made 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.490
 I actually prefer to work live music 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.970
 what will the samples how much money is needed to get well 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.539
 not because of what we cannot pay 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.330
 the then was invited to have music because 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
 those assignments can also occasionally 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.350
 they are not quite evident to say this is something with specific role of wanting this 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.029
 have the city 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:30.349
 but now you're really sitting 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.409
 in vases you can probably take on the next plate 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:35.439
 the work is warm 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.339
 then you also have to say things to 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:38.589
 that seems to me 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:41.939
 how annoying sure chinese macro can talk new 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:45.129
 form of a few houses 9 no too small 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.089
 Well that is not too bad 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:52.389
 and that of being so smart to have a number of assignments in the past year 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:53.150
 doable 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.150
 the public finances are not known 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:00.259
 now I have more time to work an album 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.059
 working group can now really lock myself up for a few months 

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:06.580
 as much as possible 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.469
 No 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:10.729
 years sometimes you have indeed had a firearm located hongkong boat van 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.330
 to see that makes sense though 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.420
 it is also nice to be able to do something else not alone 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.729
 but with those that are built 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.550
 pauwels and vantornout 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.909
 it is also that there and ends up sometimes good again 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.229
 Nope 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.400
 perfect match to come for the wateringse 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.420
 Habitat him just a clip also some more guests to get people 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:34.860
 in front of 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.860
 focus more yes i am i am approaching my son at the moment i have taken 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.869
 stock markets 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:46.709
 after all, and have found singers of hers to come up with for free 

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:50.269
 and so i am looking around and approaching people 

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:51.779
 really like to 

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:54.779
 feyenoord 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.550
 he has nothing to do with the fixed formats of other options 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.210
 the veil 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.839
 no that is not too long anyway 

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.210
 2 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.630
 the third a new system 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.260
 what to do with it because that audience is now also covered with model number 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.610
 for example story play half of the album in the studio somewhere and then 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.229
 then head off 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:17.969
 but maybe that on my are enough it depends a bit 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:21.050
 of us sounds good and 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.129
 how much time back 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:25.379
 tonight a place on the podium 

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:26.969
 the great galaxy 

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:29.969
 but good luck and during both incidents 

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.960
 No 

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:43.119
 oh yes my
