things to think about so the first thing

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.340 
things to think about so the first thing
is<00:00:26.130> before<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.430> start<00:00:26.490> editing<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.060> page

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
is before you start editing a page

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.720 
is before you start editing a page
because<00:00:28.350> the<00:00:28.650> application<00:00:29.340> thinks<00:00:29.640> you're

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
because the application thinks you're

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.180 
because the application thinks you're
about<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.390> put<00:00:30.600> in<00:00:30.750> some<00:00:30.930> data<00:00:31.099> obviously<00:00:32.099> it

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.190

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
got some mandatory fields so before you

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.110 
got some mandatory fields so before you
start<00:00:34.110> messing<00:00:34.200> about<00:00:34.440> with<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.970> do

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
start messing about with it and you do

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.310 
start messing about with it and you do
need<00:00:36.240> to<00:00:36.360> complete<00:00:36.480> these<00:00:36.840> otherwise<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
need to complete these otherwise the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.790 
need to complete these otherwise the
validation<00:00:37.830> on<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> page<00:00:38.250> kicks<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.800> it

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
validation on the page kicks in and it

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.330 
validation on the page kicks in and it
kind<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.130> gets<00:00:41.340> stuck<00:00:41.400> so<00:00:42.739> let's<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:43.980> put<00:00:44.160> in

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
kind of gets stuck so let's just put in

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.400 
kind of gets stuck so let's just put in
a<00:00:44.430> few<00:00:44.480> dummy<00:00:45.480> values<00:00:45.900> so<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> page

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
a few dummy values so the page

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.860 
a few dummy values so the page
validation<00:00:47.040> doesn't<00:00:47.190> fire<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:48.420> let's<00:00:48.720> go

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
validation doesn't fire so now let's go

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.740 
validation doesn't fire so now let's go
to<00:00:48.930> administration<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.480> customize<00:00:51.480> new

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
to administration and customize new

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.190 
to administration and customize new
person<00:00:52.140> page<00:00:52.940> we<00:00:53.940> get<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.090> pop<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.450> asking<00:00:54.660> what

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
level we'd like to customize this so it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.720 
level we'd like to customize this so it
already<00:00:57.360> knows<00:00:57.720> that<00:00:57.960> we've<00:00:58.110> chosen<00:00:58.320> a

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
already knows that we've chosen a
