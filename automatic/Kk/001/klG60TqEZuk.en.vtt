00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
it so anyway as I was then the barbs for

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.849 
it so anyway as I was then the barbs for
the<00:00:15.839> cpu<00:00:16.590> block<00:00:16.619> or<00:00:17.160> on<00:00:17.699> route<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.720> that's<00:00:19.650> why

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
the cpu block or on route so that's why

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.140 
the cpu block or on route so that's why
I've<00:00:19.980> held<00:00:20.220> off<00:00:20.400> putting<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.789> rest<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.090> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
water pulling in I've also going to get

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.750 
water pulling in I've also going to get
a<00:00:23.789> new<00:00:23.970> pump<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.869> one<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.080> add<00:00:25.820> was<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:28.760> Aqua

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
a new pump the one I add was the Aqua

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.240 
a new pump the one I add was the Aqua
cool<00:00:30.769> this<00:00:31.769> thing<00:00:32.099> here<00:00:32.989> which<00:00:34.190> works<00:00:35.750> but

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
cool this thing here which works but

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.560 
cool this thing here which works but
aesthetically<00:00:39.950> not<00:00:40.950> really<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.670> coming<00:00:42.420> with

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
aesthetically not really in coming with

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.660 
aesthetically not really in coming with
the<00:00:42.690> bill<00:00:42.870> done<00:00:43.110> doing<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:45.420> has<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.750> go<00:00:45.899> and

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
the bill done doing so it has to go and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.040 
the bill done doing so it has to go and
I'm<00:00:47.670> replacing<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.329> with<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:49.520> phobia<00:00:50.989> phobia<00:00:51.989> I

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
I'm replacing it with a phobia phobia I

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.760 
I'm replacing it with a phobia phobia I
think<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> phobia<00:00:54.170> fairly<00:00:55.170> cheap<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.590> but

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
think it's a phobia fairly cheap one but

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.910 
think it's a phobia fairly cheap one but
it<00:00:55.860> does<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.280> good<00:00:56.760> add<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.620> 2.8<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.359> 600

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
it does is good add on it 2.8 and 600

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.160 
it does is good add on it 2.8 and 600
liters<00:01:01.920> an<00:01:02.100> hour<00:01:02.250> which<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.730> fine<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.510> what

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
liters an hour which is fine for what

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.980 
liters an hour which is fine for what
for<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.439> loop<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.860> fine<00:01:05.159> at<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.400> moment

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
for this loop is fine at the moment

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.330 
for this loop is fine at the moment
because<00:01:06.990> I'm<00:01:07.229> not<00:01:07.439> pulling<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.950> graphics

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
because I'm not pulling the graphics

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.649 
because I'm not pulling the graphics
card<00:01:08.549> yet<00:01:08.909> although<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.720> really<00:01:10.229> want<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:11.659> money

card yet although I really want to money
of<00:01:13.350> course<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.490> big<00:01:14.670> factor<00:01:15.060> here<00:01:15.090> at<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
of course is the big factor here at the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.270 
of course is the big factor here at the
moment<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.560> card<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.460> there<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.900> 7970<00:01:19.530> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
moment the card in there is the 7970 and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.499 
moment the card in there is the 7970 and
the<00:01:21.500> cooler<00:01:22.500> that's<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.330> awesome<00:01:24.330> I

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
have to say it's the gigabyte windforce

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.080 
have to say it's the gigabyte windforce
one<00:01:29.329> and<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.750> keeps<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.520> ridiculously<00:01:32.520> cool<00:01:32.820> I

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090

full load it doesn't go above 58 which I

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.520 
full load it doesn't go above 58 which I

on the on the memory obviously that's
times<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.810> yeah<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.740> sort<00:01:56.189> of

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
times for so yeah so you can sort of

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.730 
times for so yeah so you can sort of
imagine<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.090> water<00:01:57.299> cooling<00:01:57.740> go

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
imagine it with the water cooling go

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.880 
imagine it with the water cooling go
around<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> front<00:01:59.100> here<00:01:59.579> we've<00:01:59.790> got

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
around the front here we've got

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.310 
around the front here we've got
the<00:02:01.729> aqua<00:02:02.720> cool<00:02:04.180> is<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:05.300> out<00:02:05.450> graphical<00:02:06.170> or

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
the aqua cool is it out graphical or

the aqua cool is it out graphical or
alpha<00:02:06.710> cool<00:02:07.330> remember<00:02:09.490> they<00:02:10.490> raced<00:02:10.850> double

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
alpha cool remember they raced double

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.640

bay rays below that there's the v12
which<00:02:18.650> unfortunately<00:02:19.100> is<00:02:19.760> playing<00:02:20.270> up<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:21.320> I'm

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
which unfortunately is playing up so I'm

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.590 
which unfortunately is playing up so I'm
going<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:21.830> have<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.010> replace<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:23.510> I'm

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
going to have to replace that and I'm

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.030 
going to have to replace that and I'm
probably<00:02:23.810> going<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.140> replace<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.650> with<00:02:24.800> the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
probably going to replace it with the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.890 
probably going to replace it with the
BET<00:02:25.880> Phoenix<00:02:26.680> recon<00:02:27.760> which<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.150> new<00:02:29.420> one

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.540 
black mattresses match of some sort
which<00:05:35.570> will<00:05:35.810> hide<00:05:36.080> the<00:05:36.500> radiator<00:05:37.130> and<00:05:37.400> make<00:05:37.520> a

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
which will hide the radiator and make a

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.570 
which will hide the radiator and make a
feature<00:05:37.820> of<00:05:38.030> it<00:05:38.380> and<00:05:39.380> what<00:05:39.770> necessarily<00:05:40.370> hide

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
feature of it and what necessarily hide

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.930 
feature of it and what necessarily hide
is<00:05:40.789> a<00:05:40.820> bit<00:05:41.090> big<00:05:41.270> to<00:05:41.300> hide<00:05:41.570> and<00:05:42.580> but<00:05:43.580> it<00:05:43.760> will

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
is a bit big to hide and but it will

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.210 
is a bit big to hide and but it will
make<00:05:44.210> a<00:05:44.240> feature<00:05:44.479> of<00:05:44.720> it<00:05:44.900> so<00:05:45.140> hopefully<00:05:45.890> it

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
make a feature of it so hopefully it

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.510 
make a feature of it so hopefully it
won't<00:05:46.550> look<00:05:46.729> too<00:05:47.000> bad<00:05:47.830> these<00:05:48.830> here<00:05:49.280> these

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
won't look too bad these here these

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.360 
won't look too bad these here these

same<00:05:59.720> with<00:05:59.990> the<00:06:00.380> back<00:06:00.560> of<00:06:00.770> this<00:06:00.919> i'm<00:06:01.130> going<00:06:01.250> to

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
same with the back of this i'm going to

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.950
