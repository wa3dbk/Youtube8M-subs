00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.580 
there we go see that yeah there are the
dimensions<00:00:20.910> were<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.270> little<00:00:21.540> bit<00:00:21.930> different

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
dimensions were a little bit different

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.200 
dimensions were a little bit different
than<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.770> last<00:00:22.830> time<00:00:23.190> when<00:00:23.730> i<00:00:23.760> did<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
than the last time when i did the

than the last time when i did the
bracket<00:00:24.930> for<00:00:25.110> the<00:00:26.180> tripe<00:00:27.180> because<00:00:28.189> well<00:00:29.189> quiet

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
bracket for the tripe because well quiet

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.400 
bracket for the tripe because well quiet
because<00:00:30.270> this<00:00:30.480> disc<00:00:30.840> right<00:00:30.990> here<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.380> actually

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
because this disc right here is actually

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.440 
because this disc right here is actually
a<00:00:31.680> little<00:00:31.920> bigger<00:00:32.160> than<00:00:32.400> the<00:00:32.520> other<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:32.879> so

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
a little bigger than the other one is so

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.260 
a little bigger than the other one is so
i<00:00:33.480> had<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.020> raise<00:00:34.379> these<00:00:34.620> bolt<00:00:34.950> holes<00:00:35.190> up<00:00:35.940> by

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
i had to raise these bolt holes up by

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.900 
i had to raise these bolt holes up by
liking<00:00:36.600> about<00:00:37.230> an<00:00:37.440> eighth<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.680> an<00:00:37.800> inch<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.220> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
liking about an eighth of an inch so and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.890 
liking about an eighth of an inch so and
she<00:00:39.150> rotates<00:00:39.570> now<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:40.320> look<00:00:41.070> at<00:00:41.370> yay<00:00:42.620> yay<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.900> I

she rotates now we look at yay yay and I

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.540 
she rotates now we look at yay yay and I
then<00:00:46.290> aligned<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.370> sprocket<00:00:48.199> with<00:00:49.199> the<00:00:50.129> this

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
then aligned the sprocket with the this

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.219 
then aligned the sprocket with the this
sprocket<00:00:50.820> right<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.870> i<00:00:51.900> got<00:00:52.050> those

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
sprocket right here so i got those

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:53.479 
sprocket right here so i got those
aligned<00:00:52.589> up<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.979> then<00:00:53.070> i<00:00:53.129> whipped<00:00:53.339> out<00:00:53.430> my

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
aligned up and then i whipped out my

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.610 
aligned up and then i whipped out my
tape<00:00:54.300> measure<00:00:54.330> and<00:00:54.690> measure<00:00:54.839> this<00:00:55.350> distance

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
tape measure and measure this distance

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.600 
tape measure and measure this distance
here<00:00:56.190> came<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:56.909> like<00:00:57.030> 11<00:00:57.540> and<00:00:58.610> 58

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
here came out to be like 11 and 58

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.390 
here came out to be like 11 and 58
something<00:01:00.030> like<00:01:00.150> that<00:01:00.360> and<00:01:00.659> i<00:01:01.440> cut<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.890> one

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
inch spacer that's going to go inside it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.490 
inch spacer that's going to go inside it
here<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.190> then<00:01:05.820> i<00:01:05.909> cut<00:01:06.120> the<00:01:06.240> spacer<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:06.840> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
here and then i cut the spacer for that

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
pieces that cut for the filler bars that

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.190 
pieces that cut for the filler bars that
are<00:01:29.040> going<00:01:29.160> to<00:01:29.220> go<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.490> there<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.990> took<00:01:30.990> my

see<00:01:44.160> what<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.490> looks<00:01:44.550> like<00:01:44.970> when<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.570> get<00:01:45.780> this

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
see what this looks like when I get this

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.920 
see what this looks like when I get this
all<00:01:46.200> assembled<00:01:46.830> so<00:01:47.130> tomorrow<00:01:47.850> I'm<00:01:48.300> going<00:01:48.750> to

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
all assembled so tomorrow I'm going to

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.860 
all assembled so tomorrow I'm going to
be<00:01:49.020> taking<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.070> rear<00:01:50.490> wheels<00:01:50.820> off<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
be taking the rear wheels off of the

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.190 
be taking the rear wheels off of the
quad<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.860> then<00:01:53.040> putting<00:01:53.340> them<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.730> here

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
quad and then putting them on here

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.510 
quad and then putting them on here
because<00:01:55.200> we<00:01:55.410> haven't<00:01:55.770> been<00:01:55.890> able<00:01:56.010> to<00:01:56.190> order

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
because we haven't been able to order

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.610 
because we haven't been able to order
for<00:01:57.300> those<00:01:57.870> tires<00:01:58.320> for<00:01:58.740> some<00:01:58.890> more<00:01:59.100> tires<00:01:59.400> yet

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
for those tires for some more tires yet

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.720 
for those tires for some more tires yet
and<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.670> once<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.000> put<00:02:03.510> those<00:02:03.660> tires<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.730> I'll

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
and so once I put those tires on I'll

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.310 
and so once I put those tires on I'll
then<00:02:05.940> put<00:02:06.090> those<00:02:06.240> spaces<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.930> see<00:02:07.080> what<00:02:07.110> it

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
then put those spaces in to see what it

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.600 
then put those spaces in to see what it
looks<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.980> then<00:02:08.220> I'll<00:02:08.310> be<00:02:08.400> able<00:02:08.460> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
looks like and then I'll be able to

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.750 
looks like and then I'll be able to
judge<00:02:09.180> the<00:02:09.390> spacing<00:02:09.900> between<00:02:09.930> here<00:02:10.650> and<00:02:10.830> there

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
judge the spacing between here and there

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.240 
judge the spacing between here and there
and<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.240> end<00:02:12.390> piece<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.960> also<00:02:13.410> because<00:02:14.100> since

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
and the end piece is also because since

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.040 
and the end piece is also because since
its<00:02:14.400> actual<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.000> long<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.510> axle<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:15.900> going

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
its actual it so long the axle is going

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.680 
its actual it so long the axle is going
to<00:02:16.110> stick<00:02:16.440> out<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> real<00:02:16.950> far<00:02:17.310> away<00:02:17.480> no<00:02:18.480> probably

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
to stick out a real far away no probably

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.850 
to stick out a real far away no probably
about<00:02:18.840> maybe<00:02:19.110> an<00:02:19.290> inch<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.590> half<00:02:19.620> two

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
about maybe an inch and a half two
