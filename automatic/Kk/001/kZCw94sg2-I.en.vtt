which is completely understandable I
know<00:01:09.539> it<00:01:09.899> isn't<00:01:10.020> easy<00:01:10.670> even<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:12.210> through

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420

know it isn't easy even going through
multiple<00:01:12.630> translations<00:01:13.319> it's<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.399> a<00:01:14.520> bit<00:01:14.670> of

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
multiple translations it's it's a bit of

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.239 
multiple translations it's it's a bit of
work<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.179> then<00:01:15.240> even<00:01:15.869> at<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:17.159> know

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:17.249 
work and then even at that you know

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:19.129 
work and then even at that you know
you're<00:01:17.819> almost<00:01:18.149> certain<00:01:18.719> that<00:01:18.749> there<00:01:19.020> are

looking at when we look up at the moon
is<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> projection<00:01:34.529> of<00:01:34.740> some<00:01:35.700> sort<00:01:36.060> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
is a projection of some sort and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.649 
is a projection of some sort and
possibly<00:01:37.109> has<00:01:37.319> something<00:01:37.770> behind<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.659> people

thing you see there and there is a

thing you see there and there is a
distance<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.509> thing<00:01:45.959> but<00:01:46.590> there<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.859> a

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:46.889 
distance to that thing but there is a

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:49.399 
distance to that thing but there is a
bit<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.369> maybe<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.819> facade<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.719> a<00:01:48.929> good<00:01:49.200> way<00:01:49.349> to

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
bit of maybe a facade is a good way to

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.249 
bit of maybe a facade is a good way to
describe<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.279> is<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:51.450> i<00:01:51.659> believe<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:52.229> are

eagle-eyed people at the right phase
where<00:02:03.029> the<00:02:03.149> shadows<00:02:03.539> are<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:04.200> right<00:02:04.439> are

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
where the shadows are just right are

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.949 
where the shadows are just right are
ever<00:02:05.130> gonna<00:02:05.279> see<00:02:05.579> mentalists<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.599> what<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.840> did

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
ever gonna see mentalists so what I did

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.400 
ever gonna see mentalists so what I did
was<00:02:07.889> I<00:02:08.190> chose<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:09.000> Aristarchus<00:02:09.750> crater<00:02:09.840> which

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
was I chose the Aristarchus crater which

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.270 
was I chose the Aristarchus crater which
is<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.890> well-known<00:02:11.670> naked-eye<00:02:12.390> object<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:14.010> here

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
is a well-known naked-eye object so here

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.580 
is a well-known naked-eye object so here
I've<00:02:14.879> put<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.329> in<00:02:15.540> white<00:02:15.840> because<00:02:16.200> they're<00:02:16.560> a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
I've put it in white because they're a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.259 
I've put it in white because they're a
star<00:02:16.890> kiss<00:02:17.129> is<00:02:17.340> why<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.549> I'll<00:02:17.730> measure<00:02:17.970> what

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
star kiss is why it I'll measure what

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.160 
star kiss is why it I'll measure what
I've<00:02:18.390> done<00:02:18.599> real<00:02:19.049> quick<00:02:19.290> here<00:02:19.500> for<00:02:19.799> you<00:02:21.170> it's

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
I've done real quick here for you it's

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.550 
I've done real quick here for you it's
roughly<00:02:22.950> 40<00:02:23.909> some<00:02:24.150> miles<00:02:24.510> across<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.319> you<00:02:25.439> can

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
roughly 40 some miles across and you can

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.289 
roughly 40 some miles across and you can
see<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.920> red<00:02:26.099> ring<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.549> middle<00:02:26.849> is<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
see that red ring in the middle is the

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.589 
see that red ring in the middle is the
old<00:02:27.540> crater<00:02:28.379> size<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.010> used<00:02:29.599> for

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
old crater size that I used for

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.440 
old crater size that I used for
mentalists<00:02:31.230> now<00:02:32.129> this<00:02:32.579> is<00:02:32.790> quite<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.180> bit

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
mentalists now this is quite a bit

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.899 
mentalists now this is quite a bit
bigger<00:02:33.780> than<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.590> actually<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.250> crater<00:02:35.549> is

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
bigger than the actually the crater is

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.369 
bigger than the actually the crater is
and<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.329> reason<00:02:36.480> I'm<00:02:36.689> doing<00:02:36.719> that<00:02:36.989> is<00:02:37.170> because

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
and the reason I'm doing that is because

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.160 
and the reason I'm doing that is because
in<00:02:37.950> certain<00:02:38.280> views<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.420> white<00:02:39.719> that<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.049> see

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
in certain views the white that you see

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.440 
in certain views the white that you see
around<00:02:40.590> near<00:02:40.829> historic<00:02:41.310> excuse<00:02:42.299> me

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
around near historic excuse me

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.479 
around near historic excuse me
Aristarchus<00:02:43.140> goes<00:02:43.319> beyond<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:44.010> crater<00:02:44.280> edge

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
Aristarchus goes beyond the crater edge

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.819 
Aristarchus goes beyond the crater edge
so<00:02:45.120> let's<00:02:45.329> just<00:02:45.599> do<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.019> same<00:02:46.230> experiment

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
so let's just do the same experiment

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.860 
so let's just do the same experiment
real<00:02:47.010> quick<00:02:47.250> we'll<00:02:47.549> go<00:02:47.730> up

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
real quick we'll go up

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.170 
real quick we'll go up
that's<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.530> roughly<00:02:50.219> the<00:02:50.340> same<00:02:50.489> size<00:02:50.760> as<00:02:50.819> the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
that's the roughly the same size as the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.390 
that's the roughly the same size as the
white<00:02:51.360> mass<00:02:51.629> you<00:02:51.900> see<00:02:52.110> we're<00:02:52.379> at<00:02:52.500> 40,000<00:02:53.370> feet

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
white mass you see we're at 40,000 feet

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.000 
white mass you see we're at 40,000 feet
the<00:02:53.879> moon<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.719> roughly<00:02:55.019> six<00:02:55.409> times<00:02:55.709> further

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
the moon is roughly six times further

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.479 
the moon is roughly six times further
away<00:02:56.219> and<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:57.329> can<00:02:57.510> barely<00:02:57.840> detect<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.980> tiny

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
away and you can barely detect a tiny

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.530 
away and you can barely detect a tiny
dot<00:02:59.790> down<00:03:00.030> there<00:03:00.299> so

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
dot down there so

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.149 
dot down there so
there's<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.989> same<00:03:01.200> thought<00:03:02.010> experiment<00:03:04.159> okay

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
there's the same thought experiment okay

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.640 
there's the same thought experiment okay
and<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.790> here<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.480> Wikipedia<00:03:07.079> entry<00:03:07.109> that

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
and so here is the Wikipedia entry that

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.860 
and so here is the Wikipedia entry that
tells<00:03:07.859> you<00:03:08.099> that<00:03:08.129> Aristarchus<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.209> in<00:03:09.359> fact<00:03:09.629> a

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
tells you that Aristarchus is in fact a

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.530 
tells you that Aristarchus is in fact a
naked-eye<00:03:10.349> object<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:11.670> gives<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.239> distance

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
naked-eye object it gives the distance

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.149 
naked-eye object it gives the distance
for<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.780> crater<00:03:13.109> you'll<00:03:13.290> notice<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.769> I<00:03:13.859> made

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
for the crater you'll notice that I made

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.759 
for the crater you'll notice that I made
my<00:03:15.019> measurement<00:03:16.019> of<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.200> crater<00:03:16.469> a<00:03:16.530> bit

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
my measurement of the crater a bit

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.949 
my measurement of the crater a bit
bigger<00:03:17.069> just<00:03:17.939> because<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.299> know<00:03:18.359> that<00:03:18.840> the

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
bigger just because I know that the

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.750 
bigger just because I know that the
white<00:03:19.140> area<00:03:19.439> that<00:03:19.590> you<00:03:19.680> see<00:03:19.709> goes<00:03:20.189> out<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.430> bit

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
white area that you see goes out a bit

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.210 
white area that you see goes out a bit
beyond<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.269> crater<00:03:21.629> so<00:03:22.439> there<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.769> is<00:03:22.829> there's

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
beyond the crater so there it is there's

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.229 
beyond the crater so there it is there's
the<00:03:23.400> update<00:03:23.700> on<00:03:23.819> that<00:03:24.030> portion<00:03:25.790> okay<00:03:26.790> also<00:03:27.030> I

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
the update on that portion okay also I

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.210 
the update on that portion okay also I
would<00:03:27.599> like<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.930> mention<00:03:28.109> that<00:03:28.620> if<00:03:28.799> you<00:03:28.829> use

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
would like to mention that if you use

a lot of comments that I'd like to say

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.550 
a lot of comments that I'd like to say
something<00:03:41.430> too<00:03:41.700> but<00:03:41.849> I<00:03:41.879> just<00:03:41.970> can't<00:03:42.569> but

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
something too but I just can't but

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.479 
something too but I just can't but
moving<00:03:43.859> forward<00:03:44.069> as<00:03:44.549> far<00:03:45.359> as<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.980> moon<00:03:47.220> being

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
moving forward as far as the moon being

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.509 
moving forward as far as the moon being
an<00:03:47.669> illusion<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:49.019> is<00:03:49.079> a<00:03:49.260> lot<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.709> absorb<00:03:49.829> it's

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
an illusion it is a lot to absorb it's

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.270 
an illusion it is a lot to absorb it's
where<00:03:50.849> I'm<00:03:51.120> at<00:03:51.389> and<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:52.709> shouldn't<00:03:52.950> accept

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
where I'm at and you shouldn't accept

where I'm at and you shouldn't accept
what<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:53.760> tell<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.209> just<00:03:54.450> because<00:03:54.780> I've<00:03:54.930> told

what I tell you just because I've told
you<00:03:55.439> that<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:55.829> think<00:03:56.159> it's<00:03:56.310> correct<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.819> should

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
you that I think it's correct you should

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.449 
you that I think it's correct you should
look<00:03:57.180> into<00:03:57.389> it<00:03:57.859> consider<00:03:58.859> the<00:03:59.099> things<00:03:59.250> that

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
look into it consider the things that

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.119 
look into it consider the things that
are<00:03:59.579> being<00:03:59.730> said<00:03:59.819> a<00:04:00.359> lot<00:04:01.319> of<00:04:01.439> people<00:04:01.739> consider

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
are being said a lot of people consider

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.149 
are being said a lot of people consider
that<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.700> used<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.720> Russian<00:04:04.169> research<00:04:04.829> as

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
that I used the Russian research as

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.360 
that I used the Russian research as
proof<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.269> that's<00:04:06.569> not<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.959> case<00:04:07.169> what<00:04:07.979> I<00:04:08.010> did

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
proof and that's not the case what I did

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.059 
proof and that's not the case what I did
is<00:04:08.729> I<00:04:08.790> had<00:04:09.090> confirmation<00:04:09.810> on<00:04:10.169> many<00:04:10.440> levels<00:04:10.709> but

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
is I had confirmation on many levels but

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.520 
is I had confirmation on many levels but
none<00:04:11.310> of<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.519> could<00:04:11.699> go<00:04:11.819> public<00:04:12.030> so<00:04:12.959> when<00:04:13.500> I

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
none of it could go public so when I

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.710 
none of it could go public so when I
read<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:14.129> Russian<00:04:14.519> stuff<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:15.090> everything

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
read the Russian stuff and everything

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.479 
read the Russian stuff and everything
about<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.320> lunar<00:04:16.500> wave<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.130> Russian

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
about the lunar wave and the Russian

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.699 
about the lunar wave and the Russian
stuff<00:04:17.729> lines<00:04:18.120> up<00:04:18.329> perfectly<00:04:18.840> with<00:04:18.959> what<00:04:19.409> I<00:04:19.440> had

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
stuff lines up perfectly with what I had

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.319 
stuff lines up perfectly with what I had
come<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:19.949> know<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.430> actually<00:04:20.609> quite<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.150> bit

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
come to know is actually quite a bit

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.290 
come to know is actually quite a bit
more<00:04:21.510> specific<00:04:22.159> that<00:04:23.159> is<00:04:23.430> why<00:04:23.639> I<00:04:23.669> used<00:04:24.060> it

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
more specific that is why I used it

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.750 
more specific that is why I used it
having<00:04:24.780> said<00:04:25.020> that<00:04:25.050> there<00:04:25.650> is<00:04:25.830> so<00:04:26.130> much<00:04:26.400> in

having said that there is so much in
that<00:04:27.090> restaurant<00:04:27.449> research<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:28.260> I'm

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
that restaurant research that I'm

on<00:04:52.349> this<00:04:52.560> but<00:04:53.280> so<00:04:53.849> there<00:04:54.060> it<00:04:54.150> is<00:04:54.180> I<00:04:54.510> just<00:04:54.570> want

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
on this but so there it is I just want

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.839 
on this but so there it is I just want
to<00:04:54.960> be<00:04:55.020> perfectly<00:04:55.409> clear<00:04:55.740> I<00:04:55.949> do<00:04:56.039> believe<00:04:56.580> the

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
to be perfectly clear I do believe the

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.210 
to be perfectly clear I do believe the
moon<00:04:57.030> is<00:04:57.270> an<00:04:57.870> illusion<00:04:58.409> the<00:04:58.530> part<00:04:58.740> we<00:04:58.860> see<00:04:59.039> a

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
moon is an illusion the part we see a

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.550 
moon is an illusion the part we see a
projection<00:04:59.820> and<00:05:00.240> it<00:05:00.509> does<00:05:00.780> have<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.080> distance

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
projection and it does have a distance

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.710 
projection and it does have a distance
from<00:05:01.710> us<00:05:01.889> and<00:05:02.159> I<00:05:02.639> am<00:05:02.759> reasonably<00:05:03.240> sure<00:05:03.479> there

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
from us and I am reasonably sure there

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.719 
from us and I am reasonably sure there
is<00:05:03.840> something<00:05:04.259> behind<00:05:04.440> that<00:05:04.949> which<00:05:05.310> is<00:05:05.520> a

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
is something behind that which is a

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.360 
is something behind that which is a
control<00:05:06.150> system<00:05:06.659> so<00:05:07.320> just<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:07.830> be<00:05:08.009> upfront

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
control system so just to be upfront

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.519 
control system so just to be upfront
about<00:05:08.940> it<00:05:09.240> there<00:05:09.659> it<00:05:09.750> is<00:05:09.870> and<00:05:10.139> I<00:05:10.200> think<00:05:10.409> the

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:10.529 
about it there it is and I think the

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:12.350 
about it there it is and I think the
next<00:05:10.770> few<00:05:10.950> clips<00:05:11.250> are<00:05:11.550> going<00:05:11.909> to<00:05:12.000> be<00:05:12.090> just

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
next few clips are going to be just

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.030 
next few clips are going to be just
typical<00:05:12.779> crow<00:05:13.050> clips<00:05:13.380> and

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
typical crow clips and

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.770 
typical crow clips and
I'm<00:05:14.370> gonna<00:05:14.550> back<00:05:14.820> off<00:05:14.850> and<00:05:15.240> let<00:05:15.360> this<00:05:15.510> settle

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
I'm gonna back off and let this settle

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.960 
I'm gonna back off and let this settle
in<00:05:15.960> a<00:05:15.990> bit<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.440> know<00:05:16.710> it's<00:05:16.920> been<00:05:17.100> a<00:05:17.130> bit<00:05:17.310> much<00:05:17.520> but

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
in a bit I know it's been a bit much but

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.870 
in a bit I know it's been a bit much but
you<00:05:18.600> know<00:05:18.720> it'll<00:05:19.230> live<00:05:19.590> herb<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:19.890> live<00:05:20.340> or<00:05:20.550> die

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
you know it'll live herb I live or die

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.470 
you know it'll live herb I live or die
by<00:05:21.630> the<00:05:21.690> rules<00:05:21.990> of<00:05:22.170> truth<00:05:22.500> if<00:05:22.770> I<00:05:23.340> am<00:05:23.460> wrong<00:05:23.700> then

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
by the rules of truth if I am wrong then

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.750 
by the rules of truth if I am wrong then
it<00:05:24.660> will<00:05:24.810> be<00:05:24.960> exposed<00:05:25.470> as<00:05:25.770> flat<00:05:26.070> wrong<00:05:26.310> at<00:05:26.550> some

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
it will be exposed as flat wrong at some

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.900 
it will be exposed as flat wrong at some
point<00:05:27.060> and<00:05:27.270> I<00:05:27.420> will<00:05:27.600> accept<00:05:27.930> that<00:05:28.280> if<00:05:29.280> it<00:05:29.730> has

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
point and I will accept that if it has

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.030 
point and I will accept that if it has
some<00:05:30.210> truth<00:05:30.450> to<00:05:30.660> it<00:05:30.810> then<00:05:31.080> it<00:05:31.230> should<00:05:31.260> survive

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
some truth to it then it should survive

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.520 
some truth to it then it should survive
and<00:05:32.460> become<00:05:33.210> something<00:05:33.510> else<00:05:33.780> at<00:05:34.050> some<00:05:34.230> point

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
and become something else at some point

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.460 
and become something else at some point
so<00:05:35.190> it's<00:05:35.880> not<00:05:36.030> an<00:05:36.180> easy<00:05:36.270> thing<00:05:36.390> to<00:05:36.600> do<00:05:36.900> to<00:05:37.290> say

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
so it's not an easy thing to do to say
