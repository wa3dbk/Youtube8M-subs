00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello everyone and 10h01 pilar I am 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.870
 for the rest of the secret so I'm going 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.670
 explain to you some of the simplest 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.799
 small steps that I have not necessarily 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.480
 specified then for the table for 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.400
 richthofen the table there is the antenna 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.320
 to add the antenna and the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.970
 string does it always need there added 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.010
 without even table hours except put on 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.180
 those of origin be seven 2010 depends 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.900
 in what support at the end the flowers 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.439
 then we do that of a risk after 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.699
 two draws 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.120
 there are people who asked me when 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.329
 I have the whirlwind of yesteryear in the middle 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.489
 from them it's very simple just 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.430
 game besides fountain that's just in 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.770
 outside the mansion and you have to fart with 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.200
 our friend the bay who have lots of bugs 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.649
 who thought they were obliged to 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.829
 go out 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.420
 and that's you I was just 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.260
 small and finally the lantern of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.820
 blades will stop and come in bugs mode 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.149
 and then you swing a pomegranate 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.439
 suzanne destroy static 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.110
 after we arrive at this state you like 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.479
 this death I mean how to describe 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.430
 how to decipher this sequence because 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.860
 was when this poet of different leads 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.720
 then I'll just say that you 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.540
 words that I used to you after 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.670
 deciphering stuff then already in the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.729
 tunnels there are five that I slap you 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:30.659
 soon show you and everyone all 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:33.200
 17-17 letter evans said this letter to 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.390
 17 stuff there for its strict no luck 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.009
 after me the first one actually has it 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.720
 written in coded language bird btp is the 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.490
 second i wrote only one china 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.939
 thanks exhibited does not write tape 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.619
 bin archives so in fact it's very 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.210
 simple who take your thing 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.409
 take five years you write them but 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.960
 on paper look for example there 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.420
 the last two there it's all gone 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.829
 the two goddesses and saw that there is because this 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.189
 word that ends with 2 is low and 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.350
 that one 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.100
 after him finished with a laugh but after he 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.060
 there are two who finishes his class 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.220
 my faith after you have to go off 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.310
 so just want to clarify that I saw 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.900
 on the internet you this part there all 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.850
 the stages by the way 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:27.100
 had put before lg zombies those who 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:29.200
 see it then it smells the pines it's 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.489
 not that one that's the spirit that is 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.640
 in fact why they must leave 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.310
 mean orders mats and actually 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.319
 lies the knows the two who are not going 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.269
 turned he found himself before a 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.680
 the other side 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.450
 to yes so I said yes I had 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.310
 found this video some except that it 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.600
 had no explanation of comments 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.900
 he just said he dissolved and spolient 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.780
 look at the echoes I looked at he managed 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.040
 Japan of the coup I tried I understood 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.620
 that we had to decipher the stuff and 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:09.459
 yes that's what I started I'm 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:13.720
 there lol ah no there are many others 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:21.150
 side this side nothing next to that side 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:21.150
 and the other suspect on that side being 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:37.260
 it is necessary for the energy coming then 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.879
 if you have them 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.370
 it is better not to try to 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:58.950
 to deepen the question I do not know but 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:04:04.890
 we 'll go get the parts and a 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:07.260
 blue in the departure corner I believe it 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:13.829
 is gone that makes the fast for the 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:16.889
 to heat up and that's what it was 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.539
 state of looting this is I explain you 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.209
 you exercise on a few small points 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.669
 that I had badly explained to the 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.449
 court 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.449
 otherwise it here
