tutorial for you guys today it's gonna

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.260 
tutorial for you guys today it's gonna
be<00:00:15.830> how<00:00:15.950> to<00:00:16.010> create<00:00:16.279> gravity<00:00:16.580> within<00:00:16.910> cinema

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
be how to create gravity within cinema

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.820 
be how to create gravity within cinema
40<00:00:17.599> and<00:00:17.990> we're<00:00:18.200> gonna<00:00:18.320> be<00:00:18.380> showing<00:00:18.590> you<00:00:18.650> how<00:00:18.680> to

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
40 and we're gonna be showing you how to

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.249 
40 and we're gonna be showing you how to
create<00:00:19.099> something<00:00:19.460> like<00:00:19.490> this

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:20.259 
create something like this

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.710 
create something like this
just<00:00:21.259> a<00:00:21.380> simple<00:00:21.710> gravity<00:00:22.480> you<00:00:23.480> know<00:00:23.599> we're

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
just a simple gravity you know we're

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.560 
just a simple gravity you know we're
gonna<00:00:23.869> be<00:00:23.930> using<00:00:24.050> some<00:00:24.380> tags<00:00:25.160> today<00:00:25.540> one<00:00:26.540> of

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
gonna be using some tags today one of

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.389 
gonna be using some tags today one of
the<00:00:26.689> tags<00:00:26.930> is<00:00:27.169> actually<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:27.919> only<00:00:28.040> time<00:00:28.250> I'm

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:28.399 
the tags is actually the only time I'm

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.880 
the tags is actually the only time I'm
using<00:00:28.579> today<00:00:28.730> is<00:00:28.849> dynamics<00:00:29.419> tag<00:00:29.660> and<00:00:29.930> so<00:00:30.710> we're

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
using today is dynamics tag and so we're

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.580 
using today is dynamics tag and so we're
gonna<00:00:30.980> do<00:00:31.279> is<00:00:31.520> uh<00:00:31.880> you're<00:00:32.870> gonna<00:00:32.989> create<00:00:33.380> a

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
gonna do is uh you're gonna create a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.729 
gonna do is uh you're gonna create a
plane<00:00:34.309> first<00:00:35.030> in<00:00:35.420> cinema<00:00:35.930> 4d<00:00:36.079> go<00:00:36.500> to<00:00:36.590> the

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
plane first in cinema 4d go to the

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.160 
plane first in cinema 4d go to the
objects<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:37.550> then<00:00:37.730> get<00:00:37.850> a<00:00:37.880> plane<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:41.019> so<00:00:42.019> this

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
objects and then get a plane and so this

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.299 
objects and then get a plane and so this
is<00:00:42.260> how<00:00:42.350> you<00:00:42.410> create<00:00:42.530> gravity<00:00:42.980> just<00:00:43.129> got<00:00:43.280> a

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
is how you create gravity just got a

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.889 
is how you create gravity just got a
creative<00:00:43.609> plane<00:00:43.850> first<00:00:44.120> make<00:00:44.449> kind<00:00:44.660> of<00:00:44.719> big

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
creative plane first make kind of big

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.459 
creative plane first make kind of big
and<00:00:45.050> then<00:00:45.859> go<00:00:46.699> to<00:00:46.760> mograph<00:00:47.239> mo<00:00:47.780> text<00:00:48.289> anna

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
and then go to mograph mo text anna

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:49.990 
and then go to mograph mo text anna
create<00:00:48.980> your<00:00:49.129> text

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
create your text

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.930 
create your text
alright<00:00:50.750> simple<00:00:51.710> as<00:00:51.859> that<00:00:52.100> create<00:00:52.670> your<00:00:52.730> text

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
alright simple as that create your text

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.750 
alright simple as that create your text
and<00:00:53.300> then<00:00:53.899> just<00:00:54.260> for<00:00:54.440> today<00:00:54.559> i'm<00:00:55.010> gonna<00:00:55.190> rotate

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
and then just for today i'm gonna rotate

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.459 
and then just for today i'm gonna rotate
a<00:00:55.999> little<00:00:56.059> bit<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:56.629> just<00:00:56.660> show<00:00:57.199> you<00:00:57.230> how<00:00:57.320> it

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
a little bit and just show you how it

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.799 
a little bit and just show you how it
works<00:00:57.649> but<00:00:58.399> anyways<00:00:58.999> now<00:00:59.120> go<00:00:59.390> to<00:00:59.449> your<00:00:59.480> plane

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
works but anyways now go to your plane

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.459 
works but anyways now go to your plane
from<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.739> plane<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:01.370> click<00:01:01.760> on<00:01:01.909> tags

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
from the plane and click on tags

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.890 
from the plane and click on tags
dynamics<00:01:03.469> tags<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:03.980> imax<00:01:04.339> body<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:05.000> then<00:01:05.570> put

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
dynamics tags and imax body and then put

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.460 
dynamics tags and imax body and then put
on<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.050> mo<00:01:06.200> text<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:07.520> go<00:01:07.700> to<00:01:07.760> tags<00:01:08.470> dynamics

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
on the mo text and go to tags dynamics

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.359 
on the mo text and go to tags dynamics
tags<00:01:09.700> dynamics<00:01:10.700> party<00:01:10.939> and<00:01:11.899> now<00:01:12.470> anyways<00:01:12.920> when

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
tags dynamics party and now anyways when

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.719 
tags dynamics party and now anyways when
we<00:01:13.399> go<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:13.670> 0<00:01:14.000> frame<00:01:14.329> right<00:01:14.720> here<00:01:14.750> go<00:01:15.649> play<00:01:15.979> your

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
we go to 0 frame right here go play your

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.450 
we go to 0 frame right here go play your
text<00:01:17.210> will<00:01:17.390> fall<00:01:17.659> like<00:01:18.649> so<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.420> then<00:01:20.420> um<00:01:20.659> as

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
text will fall like so and then um as

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.100 
text will fall like so and then um as
you<00:01:22.460> go<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:23.540> will<00:01:25.030> as<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:26.750> can<00:01:26.930> mess<00:01:27.079> around

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
you go you will as you can mess around

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.039 
you go you will as you can mess around
the<00:01:27.500> physics<00:01:28.070> in<00:01:28.189> here<00:01:28.369> down<00:01:29.060> in<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.270> click<00:01:29.990> on

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
the physics in here down in the click on

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.469 
the physics in here down in the click on
the<00:01:30.170> tag<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:30.770> go<00:01:30.890> out<00:01:31.040> of<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.280> options<00:01:31.610> you

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
the tag you go out of the options you

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.880 
the tag you go out of the options you
can<00:01:32.689> um<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:34.270> can<00:01:35.289> you<00:01:36.289> know<00:01:36.409> mess<00:01:36.619> with<00:01:36.770> the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
can um you can you know mess with the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.830 
can um you can you know mess with the
balance<00:01:37.280> I<00:01:37.399> can<00:01:37.549> turn<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.789> bounce<00:01:37.969> way<00:01:38.270> up<00:01:38.479> and

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
balance I can turn the bounce way up and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.609 
balance I can turn the bounce way up and
uh<00:01:39.670> now<00:01:40.780> as<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:41.899> see<00:01:42.079> it's<00:01:42.259> kind<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:42.439> like<00:01:42.560> a

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
uh now as you see it's kind of like a

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.740 
uh now as you see it's kind of like a
ball<00:01:42.799> I<00:01:43.100> could<00:01:43.939> turn<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.149> balance<00:01:44.450> down<00:01:44.600> to

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
ball I could turn the balance down to

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.690 
ball I could turn the balance down to
about<00:01:44.930> twenty<00:01:45.439> this<00:01:46.039> looks<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.430> little<00:01:46.520> bit

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
about twenty this looks a little bit

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.050 
about twenty this looks a little bit
more<00:01:46.880> realistic<00:01:47.180> I<00:01:47.450> guess<00:01:47.630> watch<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:49.060> then

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
more realistic I guess watch and then

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.840 
more realistic I guess watch and then
you<00:01:50.240> can<00:01:50.359> turn<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.659> friction<00:01:51.109> up<00:01:51.770> more<00:01:52.549> so

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
you can turn the friction up more so

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.139 
you can turn the friction up more so
that<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:53.090> doesn't<00:01:53.329> slide<00:01:53.630> it's<00:01:54.020> easily<00:01:55.149> see

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
that it doesn't slide it's easily see

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.709 
that it doesn't slide it's easily see
and<00:01:56.509> then<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.170> collision<00:01:57.740> noise<00:01:58.030> not<00:01:59.030> sure<00:01:59.420> what

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
and then a collision noise not sure what

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.120 
and then a collision noise not sure what
this<00:01:59.960> does<00:02:00.229> but<00:02:01.130> um<00:02:02.170> anyways<00:02:03.170> yeah<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:03.649> then

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
this does but um anyways yeah and then

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.179 
this does but um anyways yeah and then
you<00:02:04.520> can<00:02:04.700> also<00:02:05.090> just<00:02:05.869> mess<00:02:06.079> with<00:02:06.289> the<00:02:06.439> size<00:02:06.679> and

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
you can also just mess with the size and

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.279 
you can also just mess with the size and
the<00:02:07.280> balance<00:02:07.640> all<00:02:08.450> this<00:02:08.600> different<00:02:08.780> stuff<00:02:08.929> and

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
the balance all this different stuff and

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.520 
the balance all this different stuff and
the<00:02:09.800> mass<00:02:10.009> you<00:02:10.340> can<00:02:10.810> turn<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.900> mass<00:02:12.080> up<00:02:12.350> so

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
the mass you can turn the mass up so

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.560 
the mass you can turn the mass up so
that<00:02:12.710> it<00:02:12.980> rotates<00:02:13.490> faster<00:02:14.120> I'm<00:02:14.240> pretty<00:02:14.450> sure

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
that it rotates faster I'm pretty sure

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.960 
that it rotates faster I'm pretty sure
that's<00:02:14.660> what<00:02:14.840> happens<00:02:15.910> but<00:02:16.960> you<00:02:17.960> can

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
that's what happens but you can

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.110 
that's what happens but you can
mess<00:02:19.870> with<00:02:19.990> all<00:02:20.230> these<00:02:20.380> physics<00:02:20.770> settings<00:02:21.120> in

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
mess with all these physics settings in

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.670 
mess with all these physics settings in
your<00:02:22.270> tags<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:24.660> yeah<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:28.200> just<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.470> messing

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
your tags and yeah so just just messing

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.660 
your tags and yeah so just just messing
around<00:02:29.710> with<00:02:29.890> these<00:02:29.980> settings<00:02:30.220> ain't<00:02:30.580> no

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
around with these settings ain't no

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.270 
around with these settings ain't no
you'll<00:02:31.390> get<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.840> right<00:02:32.050> gravity<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:33.190> all

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
you'll get the right gravity and all

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.560 
you'll get the right gravity and all
that<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:34.530> yeah<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.890> force<00:02:36.190> can<00:02:37.060> always<00:02:37.330> just

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
that and yeah the force can always just

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.040 
that and yeah the force can always just
the<00:02:37.720> soft<00:02:37.960> body<00:02:38.200> even<00:02:39.160> turn<00:02:39.310> soft<00:02:39.640> body<00:02:40.050> I'm

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
the soft body even turn soft body I'm

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.190 
the soft body even turn soft body I'm
not<00:02:41.680> sure<00:02:41.770> what<00:02:41.890> this<00:02:41.980> does<00:02:42.190> but<00:02:42.670> um<00:02:42.880> I<00:02:43.210> guess

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
not sure what this does but um I guess

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.020 
not sure what this does but um I guess
it<00:02:44.470> spaz<00:02:44.710> is<00:02:44.920> out<00:02:45.100> all<00:02:45.580> right

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
it spaz is out all right

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.270 
it spaz is out all right
well<00:02:46.690> anyways<00:02:46.990> that's<00:02:47.950> how<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.100> create

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
well anyways that's how you create

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.790 
well anyways that's how you create
gravity<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:49.030> maybe<00:02:49.900> if<00:02:50.080> any<00:02:50.230> if<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.590> guys

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
gravity and maybe if any if you guys

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.510 
gravity and maybe if any if you guys
need<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> more<00:02:51.190> advanced<00:02:51.400> tutorial<00:02:52.410> then<00:02:53.520> just

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
need a more advanced tutorial then just

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.160 
need a more advanced tutorial then just
feel<00:02:54.700> free<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:54.940> ask<00:02:55.420> in<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.630> comments<00:02:56.080> but

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
feel free to ask in the comments but

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.760 
feel free to ask in the comments but
this<00:02:56.290> is<00:02:56.380> basic<00:02:56.710> gravity<00:02:57.070> in<00:02:57.360> cinema<00:02:58.360> 4d<00:02:58.740> so<00:02:59.740> uh

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
this is basic gravity in cinema 4d so uh

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.770 
this is basic gravity in cinema 4d so uh
I<00:03:00.280> don't<00:03:00.940> know<00:03:01.060> what<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.240> heck<00:03:01.360> is<00:03:01.480> going<00:03:01.720> on

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
I don't know what the heck is going on

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.250 
I don't know what the heck is going on
right<00:03:01.840> now<00:03:01.960> but<00:03:02.550> that<00:03:03.550> is<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:05.190> what<00:03:06.900> yeah<00:03:07.900> that's

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
right now but that is a what yeah that's

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.450 
right now but that is a what yeah that's
how<00:03:08.380> you<00:03:08.410> create<00:03:08.560> gravity<00:03:08.800> so<00:03:09.100> thanks<00:03:09.310> guys

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
how you create gravity so thanks guys

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.330 
how you create gravity so thanks guys
and<00:03:09.640> see<00:03:10.060> you<00:03:10.240> later
