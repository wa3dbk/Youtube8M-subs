00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.050 
double on an 11 that's a pretty good
hand<00:01:44.690> 11<00:01:45.470> is<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.620> most<00:01:46.070> common<00:01:46.550> hand<00:01:46.790> that

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
hand 11 is the most common hand that

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.000

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
people will double down on because 10 is

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.160 
people will double down on because 10 is
the<00:01:49.310> is<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.790> most<00:01:49.970> common<00:01:50.360> card<00:01:50.570> in<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.930> deck

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.420 
so if you double on 11 and catch a 10
for<00:01:54.560> 21<00:01:55.040> you're<00:01:55.580> doing<00:01:55.940> pretty<00:01:56.090> good
