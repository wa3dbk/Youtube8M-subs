work<00:03:46.629> themselves<00:03:46.870> out<00:03:47.939> just<00:03:48.939> takes<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.209> little

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
work themselves out just takes a little

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.649 
work themselves out just takes a little
time<00:03:49.890> that's<00:03:50.890> very<00:03:51.189> good<00:03:51.340> that's<00:03:51.400> been<00:03:51.700> three

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
time that's very good that's been three

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.420 
time that's very good that's been three
minutes<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.140> 50<00:03:53.409> seconds<00:03:53.799> since<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.069> started

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
minutes and 50 seconds since you started

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.630 
minutes and 50 seconds since you started
out<00:03:54.579> I'll<00:03:55.209> see<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.799> this<00:03:57.129> will<00:03:57.370> take<00:03:57.519> some

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
out I'll see that it this will take some

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.699 
out I'll see that it this will take some
getting<00:03:57.909> used<00:03:57.939> to

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
getting used to

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.509 
getting used to
definitely<00:03:59.709> takes<00:03:59.890> some<00:03:59.920> getting<00:04:00.280> used<00:04:00.459> to

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
definitely takes some getting used to

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.160 
definitely takes some getting used to
but<00:04:00.760> I<00:04:00.879> can<00:04:01.060> see<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.299> possibilities<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:02.049> the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
but I can see the possibilities of the

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.800 
but I can see the possibilities of the
comfort<00:04:02.909> probably<00:04:03.909> like<00:04:04.090> right<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.480> lot

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
comfort probably like right a lot

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.990 
comfort probably like right a lot

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
at first it's a very awkward machine but

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.290 
at first it's a very awkward machine but
after<00:07:12.219> two<00:07:12.490> or<00:07:12.639> three<00:07:12.699> minutes<00:07:13.030> you<00:07:13.240> start

getting a feel for it and actually I
think<00:07:15.550> it's<00:07:15.940> better<00:07:16.150> than<00:07:16.509> robbing<00:07:17.050> a<00:07:17.259> rotting

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860
