so<00:04:22.200> now<00:04:22.290> we'll<00:04:22.470> let<00:04:22.590> this<00:04:22.740> stand<00:04:23.010> for<00:04:23.520> 10

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
so now we'll let this stand for 10

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.490 
so now we'll let this stand for 10
minutes<00:04:24.120> we'll<00:04:24.510> check<00:04:24.720> it<00:04:24.840> again<00:04:25.020> we<00:04:25.170> need<00:04:25.200> the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
minutes we'll check it again we need the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.800 
minutes we'll check it again we need the
liquids<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:26.070> rehydrate<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.730> bread<00:04:27.060> so<00:04:27.630> that

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
liquids to rehydrate the bread so that

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.020 
liquids to rehydrate the bread so that
we<00:04:28.080> can<00:04:28.290> mold<00:04:28.890> them<00:04:29.130> into<00:04:29.160> individual

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
we can mold them into individual

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.820 
we can mold them into individual
portions<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.630> then<00:04:30.870> they<00:04:30.990> are<00:04:31.200> going<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.680> be

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
portions and then they are going to be

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.640 
portions and then they are going to be
cooked<00:04:32.100> so<00:04:33.000> now<00:04:33.150> we've<00:04:33.330> let<00:04:33.630> this<00:04:33.810> sit<00:04:34.260> for<00:04:34.290> 10

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
cooked so now we've let this sit for 10

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.440 
cooked so now we've let this sit for 10
minutes<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:35.160> rehydrate<00:04:35.700> this<00:04:36.120> is<00:04:36.240> what<00:04:36.390> it

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
minutes to rehydrate this is what it

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.920 
minutes to rehydrate this is what it
looks<00:04:36.630> like<00:04:36.780> it's<00:04:37.470> nice<00:04:37.680> and<00:04:37.710> soft<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.930> weak

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
looks like it's nice and soft and weak

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.390 
looks like it's nice and soft and weak
on<00:04:40.080> we're<00:04:40.410> going<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.770> now<00:04:40.860> form<00:04:41.160> them<00:04:41.280> into

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
on we're going to now form them into

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.170 
on we're going to now form them into
little<00:04:41.850> patties<00:04:42.090> as<00:04:43.490> we've<00:04:44.490> done<00:04:44.640> some<00:04:44.910> here

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
little patties as we've done some here

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.580 
little patties as we've done some here
and<00:04:46.430> with<00:04:47.430> this<00:04:47.550> procedure<00:04:48.080> we<00:04:49.080> recommend

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
and with this procedure we recommend

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.560 
and with this procedure we recommend
that<00:04:50.150> you<00:04:51.150> do<00:04:51.300> this<00:04:51.420> a<00:04:51.480> day<00:04:51.750> in<00:04:51.900> advance<00:04:53.570> the

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
that you do this a day in advance the

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.570 
that you do this a day in advance the
longer<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:55.170> sits<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:56.190> better<00:04:56.220> it<00:04:56.520> will

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
longer that it sits the better it will

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.300 
longer that it sits the better it will
be<00:04:56.900> because<00:04:57.900> we<00:04:58.140> are<00:04:58.200> then<00:04:58.380> going<00:04:58.410> to<00:04:58.680> cook

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
be because we are then going to cook

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.250 
be because we are then going to cook
them<00:04:59.750> and<00:05:01.160> it<00:05:02.160> will<00:05:02.340> hold<00:05:02.730> them<00:05:02.940> it<00:05:03.900> will<00:05:04.050> help

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
them and it will hold them it will help

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.680 
them and it will hold them it will help
it<00:05:04.530> stay<00:05:05.010> together<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.940> longer<00:05:06.210> that<00:05:06.240> it<00:05:06.390> sits

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
it stay together the longer that it sits

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.710 
it stay together the longer that it sits
so<00:05:07.560> once<00:05:08.220> they're<00:05:08.370> molded<00:05:08.730> will<00:05:09.360> place<00:05:09.570> them

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
so once they're molded will place them

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.020 
so once they're molded will place them
in<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.930> refrigerator<00:05:10.050> covered<00:05:10.710> for<00:05:11.610> 24<00:05:12.000> hours

roughly<00:06:08.990> five<00:06:09.230> minutes<00:06:09.560> we<00:06:10.010> flipped<00:06:10.280> them

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
roughly five minutes we flipped them

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.560 
roughly five minutes we flipped them
over<00:06:10.520> this<00:06:10.880> is<00:06:11.030> the<00:06:11.120> color<00:06:11.330> that<00:06:11.390> we're

color<00:06:14.150> nice<00:06:14.630> light<00:06:14.960> brown<00:06:15.230> we're<00:06:16.010> going<00:06:16.130> to<00:06:16.250> do

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
color nice light brown we're going to do

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.010 
color nice light brown we're going to do
the<00:06:16.610> other<00:06:16.730> side<00:06:16.940> roughly<00:06:17.300> five<00:06:17.540> minutes<00:06:17.870> then

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
the other side roughly five minutes then

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.580 
the other side roughly five minutes then
into<00:06:18.320> the<00:06:18.410> oven<00:06:18.560> again<00:06:19.250> at<00:06:19.400> three<00:06:19.490> degrees<00:06:20.590> for

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
into the oven again at three degrees for

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.780 
into the oven again at three degrees for
roughly<00:06:21.830> another<00:06:22.010> five<00:06:22.280> minutes<00:06:22.490> and<00:06:22.640> we<00:06:22.760> will

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790 
roughly another five minutes and we will

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.450 
roughly another five minutes and we will
check<00:06:23.060> it<00:06:23.270> to<00:06:23.360> make<00:06:23.390> sure<00:06:23.510> it<00:06:23.780> reads<00:06:23.990> 165<00:06:24.860> on

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
check it to make sure it reads 165 on

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.040 
check it to make sure it reads 165 on
the<00:06:25.550> thermometer<00:06:25.790> so<00:06:26.450> it's<00:06:26.570> been<00:06:26.690> roughly

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
the thermometer so it's been roughly

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.100 
the thermometer so it's been roughly
five<00:06:27.320> minutes<00:06:27.590> we're<00:06:27.710> going<00:06:27.800> to<00:06:27.890> pull<00:06:28.100> out<00:06:28.340> our

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
five minutes we're going to pull out our

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.050 
five minutes we're going to pull out our
stuffing<00:06:30.110> and<00:06:30.290> we're<00:06:30.530> going<00:06:30.740> to<00:06:30.830> check<00:06:31.760> it<00:06:31.940> to

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
stuffing and we're going to check it to

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:39.900 
stuffing and we're going to check it to
see<00:06:32.090> if<00:06:32.300> we're<00:06:33.880> 165<00:06:34.880> degrees<00:06:36.880> and<00:06:38.020> yes<00:06:39.020> we<00:06:39.170> are

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
see if we're 165 degrees and yes we are

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.160 
see if we're 165 degrees and yes we are
so<00:06:40.910> we'll<00:06:41.030> pull<00:06:41.180> these<00:06:41.270> out<00:06:41.420> onto<00:06:41.930> a<00:06:43.060> tray<00:06:44.170> with

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.170 
so we'll pull these out onto a tray with

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:52.450 
so we'll pull these out onto a tray with
towel<00:06:45.410> papers<00:06:45.800> subs<00:06:46.100> orb<00:06:46.340> some<00:06:46.610> of<00:06:46.730> the<00:06:46.850> oil

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:56.569 
and that is how you make our stuffing

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:58.689 
and that is how you make our stuffing
