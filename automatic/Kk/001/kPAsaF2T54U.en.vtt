00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
of the game you see it's a perfect

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.080 
of the game you see it's a perfect
rectangle<00:00:56.930> it's<00:00:57.320> two<00:00:57.590> perfect<00:00:58.130> squares<00:00:58.370> next

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
rectangle it's two perfect squares next

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.120 
rectangle it's two perfect squares next
to<00:00:59.270> each<00:00:59.420> other<00:00:59.690> there's<00:01:00.320> all<00:01:00.560> these<00:01:00.800> perfect

to each other there's all these perfect

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.460 
to each other there's all these perfect
angles<00:01:01.730> that<00:01:01.910> are<00:01:01.970> triangles<00:01:02.720> and<00:01:02.990> these

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
angles that are triangles and these

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.920 
angles that are triangles and these
balls<00:01:03.740> are<00:01:03.950> perfectly<00:01:04.400> round<00:01:04.699> when<00:01:05.600> you<00:01:05.690> take
