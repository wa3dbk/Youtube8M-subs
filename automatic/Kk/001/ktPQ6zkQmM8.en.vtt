00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
that the provider meetings in our clinic

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.139 
that the provider meetings in our clinic
we<00:00:31.199> talk<00:00:31.560> about<00:00:31.769> sending<00:00:32.279> postcards<00:00:32.669> out<00:00:33.000> to

we talk about sending postcards out to

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.090 
we talk about sending postcards out to
patient<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.719> get<00:00:33.899> them<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.200> come<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.739> for<00:00:35.010> their

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
annual physicals and we assume that this

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.389 
annual physicals and we assume that this
practice<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.570> beneficial<00:00:40.530> for<00:00:40.710> our<00:00:41.070> patients

practice is beneficial for our patients

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.150 
practice is beneficial for our patients
now<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.510> course<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:43.020> beneficial<00:00:43.829> for

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
now of course it's beneficial for

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.860 
now of course it's beneficial for
keeping<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> clinic<00:00:45.180> running<00:00:45.570> because

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
keeping the clinic running because

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.110 
keeping the clinic running because

without seeing those patients the clinic

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.170 
without seeing those patients the clinic

keep sending out notices about how we

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.319 
keep sending out notices about how we

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
and that's the mantra for why we need to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.590 
and that's the mantra for why we need to
run<00:01:00.750> tests<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.379> put<00:01:01.500> people<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.980> drugs<00:01:02.600> well
