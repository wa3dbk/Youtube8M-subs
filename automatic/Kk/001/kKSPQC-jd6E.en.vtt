00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.920 
to worry about weather or time of day
and<00:00:40.980> something<00:00:41.879> that's<00:00:42.030> very<00:00:42.149> interesting<00:00:42.809> is

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
and something that's very interesting is

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.510 
and something that's very interesting is
it<00:00:43.050> down<00:00:43.230> below<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.620> hippy<00:00:43.980> camp<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.460> can

it down below at the hippy camp you can

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.850 
it down below at the hippy camp you can
actually<00:00:44.730> find<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> words<00:00:45.420> beam<00:00:45.690> me<00:00:45.840> up<00:00:45.870> and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
actually find the words beam me up and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.770 
actually find the words beam me up and
if<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.219> land<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> right<00:00:47.820> spot<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.360> UFO

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
if you land on the right spot on the UFO

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.810 
if you land on the right spot on the UFO
here<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.469> actually<00:00:49.590> start<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.129> levitate<00:00:50.550> so

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
here you actually start to levitate so

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.360 
here you actually start to levitate so
something<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.600> think<00:00:51.750> about<00:00:52.370> another

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
something to think about another

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.040 
something to think about another
interesting<00:00:53.610> thing<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.870> is

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
interesting thing is that this is

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.840 
interesting thing is that this is
actually<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> same<00:00:55.739> model<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.250> used<00:00:56.489> as<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
actually the same model they used as the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.479 
actually the same model they used as the
Mount<00:00:57.090> chiliad<00:00:57.270> UFO<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:59.190> not<00:00:59.370> really

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
Mount chiliad UFO and I'm not really

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.709 
Mount chiliad UFO and I'm not really
sure<00:00:59.670> what<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.910> make<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.300> maybe<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
sure what to make of that maybe the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.049 
sure what to make of that maybe the
Mount<00:01:00.899> chiliad<00:01:01.079> UFO<00:01:01.710> was<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.190> hint<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.910> to

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
Mount chiliad UFO was just a hint as to

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.359 
Mount chiliad UFO was just a hint as to
what<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:03.539> need<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.899> looking<00:01:04.170> for<00:01:04.439> because

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
what we need to be looking for because

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.039 
what we need to be looking for because
if<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.640> notice<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.119> Mount<00:01:06.420> chiliad<00:01:06.600> one

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
if you notice the Mount chiliad one

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.350 
if you notice the Mount chiliad one
isn't<00:01:07.439> solid<00:01:07.619> whereas<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.700> one<00:01:08.909> actually<00:01:09.119> is

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
isn't solid whereas this one actually is

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.140 
isn't solid whereas this one actually is
so<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.110> believe<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:10.979> need<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.159> find<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.490> third<00:01:11.520> UFO

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
so I believe we need to find a third UFO

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.420 
so I believe we need to find a third UFO
in<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> sky<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.320> put<00:01:13.890> all<00:01:14.010> three<00:01:14.189> characters

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
in the sky and put all three characters

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.950 
in the sky and put all three characters
underneath<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:15.420> maybe<00:01:15.630> something

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
underneath and then maybe something

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.109 
underneath and then maybe something
happens<00:01:16.409> then<00:01:16.619> that's<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.460> my<00:01:17.700> theory<00:01:18.090> I

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
happens then that's just my theory I

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.120 
happens then that's just my theory I
might<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.509> wrong<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.380> let<00:01:19.740> me<00:01:19.830> know<00:01:19.920> what<00:01:20.040> you

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
might be wrong but let me know what you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.649 
might be wrong but let me know what you
guys<00:01:20.250> think<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.610> comments<00:01:21.030> below<00:01:21.090> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
guys think in the comments below and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.810 
guys think in the comments below and
I'll<00:01:21.810> talk<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.380> next<00:01:22.590> video
