00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
you're also going to have to attach the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.200 
you're also going to have to attach the
two<00:00:57.630> pieces<00:00:58.110> of<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.440> upper<00:00:58.710> arm<00:00:58.920> armor<00:00:59.550> by<00:01:00.150> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
two pieces of the upper arm armor by the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.410 
two pieces of the upper arm armor by the
edges<00:01:00.720> using<00:01:00.990> hot<00:01:01.410> glue<00:01:01.440> as<00:01:01.950> shown

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.170 

after<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.650> will<00:01:07.860> curve<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.610> pieces<00:01:09.000> of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
after that you will curve the pieces of

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.870 
after that you will curve the pieces of
armor<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> nice<00:01:11.580> round

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
armor so that they have a nice round

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.580 
armor so that they have a nice round
shape<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.390> go<00:01:12.510> around<00:01:12.840> your<00:01:13.050> arm<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
shape to go around your arm and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.920 
shape to go around your arm and
shoulders<00:01:14.159> then<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.970> will<00:01:15.180> make<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.630> nice

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
shoulders then you will make a nice

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.700 
shoulders then you will make a nice
mixture<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.920> glue<00:01:17.250> water<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.270> newspaper<00:01:18.780> then

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
mixture of glue water and newspaper then

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.460 
mixture of glue water and newspaper then
you're<00:01:20.250> going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.700> cover<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.360> entire<00:01:21.470> armor

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
you're going to cover the entire armor

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.130 
you're going to cover the entire armor
back<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.979> front<00:01:23.460> each<00:01:23.759> piece<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
back and front each piece with the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.130 
back and front each piece with the
newspaper<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:26.729> give<00:01:26.940> it<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.330> nice<00:01:27.509> thickness

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
newspaper to give it a nice thickness

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.890 
newspaper to give it a nice thickness
and<00:01:28.410> texture<00:01:28.830> when<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.850> dries<00:01:30.270> you're<00:01:30.690> going

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
and texture when this dries you're going

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.680 
and texture when this dries you're going
to<00:01:31.050> draw<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.770> pattern<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.460> will<00:01:33.030> put<00:01:33.330> a<00:01:33.479> link

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
to draw on the pattern I will put a link

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.219 
to draw on the pattern I will put a link
to<00:01:33.900> some<00:01:34.140> nice<00:01:34.580> pattern<00:01:35.580> designs<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
to some nice pattern designs in the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.450 
to some nice pattern designs in the
description

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.160 

so<00:01:42.460> next<00:01:42.760> what<00:01:43.000> you're<00:01:43.090> going<00:01:43.150> to<00:01:43.420> do<00:01:43.570> is<00:01:43.900> use

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
so next what you're going to do is use

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.860 
so next what you're going to do is use
the<00:01:44.320> hot<00:01:44.500> glue<00:01:44.740> gun<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:45.250> fill<00:01:46.000> in<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.390> design

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
the hot glue gun and fill in the design

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.080 
the hot glue gun and fill in the design
that<00:01:47.140> you<00:01:47.260> drew<00:01:47.500> on<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:48.010> armor<00:01:48.400> so<00:01:48.640> that<00:01:48.850> it's

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
that you drew on the armor so that it's

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.450 
that you drew on the armor so that it's
3d<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:49.810> it<00:01:49.990> pops<00:01:50.260> then<00:01:50.950> you're<00:01:51.160> going<00:01:51.340> to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
3d and it pops then you're going to

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.000 
3d and it pops then you're going to
paint<00:01:51.760> the<00:01:51.940> armor<00:01:52.360> over<00:01:52.570> in<00:01:52.930> black<00:01:53.170> paint<00:01:53.470> for

the shoulder piece I used poster paint
and<00:01:56.380> for<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.490> upper<00:01:58.360> arm<00:01:58.540> piece<00:01:58.810> I<00:01:59.020> use<00:01:59.260> spray

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
and for the upper arm piece I use spray

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.290 
and for the upper arm piece I use spray
paint<00:01:59.710> this<00:02:00.310> is<00:02:00.520> just<00:02:00.760> to<00:02:00.880> show<00:02:00.910> that<00:02:01.060> it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
paint this is just to show that it

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.690 
paint this is just to show that it
doesn't<00:02:01.479> really<00:02:01.960> matter<00:02:02.260> which<00:02:02.710> type<00:02:03.460> of

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
doesn't really matter which type of

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.450 
doesn't really matter which type of
paint<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.180> use<00:02:04.210> however<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.500> recommend<00:02:05.860> spray

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
paint you use however I recommend spray

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.180 
paint you use however I recommend spray
paint<00:02:06.729> because<00:02:07.150> it<00:02:07.450> is<00:02:07.660> easier<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.800> way

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
paint because it is easier and way

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.910 
paint because it is easier and way
faster

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.270 

now<00:02:14.580> once<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.240> black<00:02:15.450> paint<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:16.020> dry<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.470> are

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
now once the black paint is dry you are

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.000 
now once the black paint is dry you are
going<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.760> take<00:02:17.940> your<00:02:18.150> gold<00:02:18.420> paint<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.140> use<00:02:19.740> a

going to take your gold paint and use a

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.010 
going to take your gold paint and use a
method<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.520> believe<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.940> called<00:02:21.120> dry<00:02:21.540> brushing

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
method I believe is called dry brushing

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.350 
method I believe is called dry brushing
where<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.290> take<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.560> dry<00:02:22.950> brush<00:02:23.430> with<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> gold

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
where you take a dry brush with the gold

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.360 
where you take a dry brush with the gold
