 first time for ten minutes to the side 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:43.060
 After this time, e-mail gives the

 dissolved yeast 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.550

 and offers the dough with a

 kitchen machine or hands up 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.450
 it from edge to ash dissolves 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.370
 is covered with plastic wrap 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.590
 her the dough after a 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.340
 warm dark place where he spent two hours 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.340
 have to go 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.390
 anyway by kneading rolled after tg 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.390
 time to 3 to 4 mm 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.410
 But make sure that he from the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.740
 width afterwards approximately in the brut form 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.450
 fits her wanted to use for the ten

 filling mixes the brown sugar with 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.350
 common cinnamon 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.320
 and paint the unrolled dough thinly 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.180
 with water so that the sugar too 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.650
 sticking instead of water could 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.180
 Incidentally, take soft butter 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.490
 making the oars even more juicy 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.140
 then distributed sugar on it 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.140
 and skin dough gently on 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.200
 So you give the parts then in the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.849
 baking paper designed bread shape and lass 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.890
 the whole another two hours go 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.150
 so that the dough does not dry out 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:06.840
 best cover him with ease 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:08.550
 fresh foil from when the boat is still 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.400

 180 degrees circulating around 25 minutes 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.209
 baked golden brown 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.280
 best of all, it tastes fresh 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.170
 the oven or lukewarm with butter since that 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.670
 dries quickly centro should it be so 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.260
 be baked fresh as possible 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.549
 otherwise it will taste the next day 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.549
