00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
game is gonna go uh yeah I mean I'm

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.130 
game is gonna go uh yeah I mean I'm
thinking<00:00:50.070> about<00:00:50.280> MCS<00:00:51.180> reaction<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.870> I

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
thinking about MCS reaction to that I

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.110 
thinking about MCS reaction to that I
just<00:00:52.410> he<00:00:52.680> plays<00:00:52.980> his<00:00:53.160> three<00:00:53.370> gate<00:00:53.550> like<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> for

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
just he plays his three gate like a for

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.500 
just he plays his three gate like a for
gate<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.559> if<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.340> situation<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.270> I'm

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
gate and if the situation like I'm

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.660 
gate and if the situation like I'm
trying<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.289> imagine<00:00:58.500> what<00:00:58.949> he<00:00:59.100> does<00:00:59.280> versus<00:00:59.640> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
trying to imagine what he does versus a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.459 
trying to imagine what he does versus a
three<00:00:59.940> gate<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.719> he<00:01:00.780> does<00:01:00.899> versus<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> for

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
three gate and what he does versus a for

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.229 
three gate and what he does versus a for
gate<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.800> if<00:01:02.010> he's<00:01:02.399> playing<00:01:02.699> against<00:01:03.030> another

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
gate so if he's playing against another

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.640 
gate so if he's playing against another
three<00:01:03.420> gate<00:01:03.600> he<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:03.960> does<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.320> exact<00:01:04.619> same

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
three gate he just does the exact same

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.560 
three gate he just does the exact same
thing<00:01:04.979> he<00:01:05.070> did<00:01:05.100> anyways<00:01:05.850> where<00:01:06.180> he<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.420> plays

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
thing he did anyways where he just plays

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.670 
thing he did anyways where he just plays
aggressive<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.080> he<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.320> tries<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.590> out

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
aggressive and he just tries to out

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.170 
aggressive and he just tries to out
micros<00:01:08.070> opponent<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.549> if<00:01:08.670> he's<00:01:08.790> doing<00:01:08.970> in

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
micros opponent but if he's doing in

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.060 
micros opponent but if he's doing in
versus<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.720> gate<00:01:09.900> he's<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.890> all<00:01:11.040> right

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
versus a for gate he's like all right

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.730 
versus a for gate he's like all right
he's<00:01:11.549> got<00:01:11.760> four<00:01:12.060> gates<00:01:12.299> I'm<00:01:12.600> going<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.020> warp<00:01:13.590> in

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
he's got four gates I'm going to warp in

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.740 
he's got four gates I'm going to warp in
everything<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.280> my<00:01:14.400> main<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.600> like

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
everything to my main and just like

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.390 
everything to my main and just like
scratch<00:01:16.049> my<00:01:16.229> pylons<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.920> consider<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
scratch my pylons just consider it a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.480 
scratch my pylons just consider it a
wash<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.900> option<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.380> there<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.400> if

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
wash but the option is there so that if

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.310 
wash but the option is there so that if
he<00:01:20.580> feels<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:20.939> playing<00:01:21.360> super<00:01:21.930> aggressive

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
he feels like playing super aggressive

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.929 
he feels like playing super aggressive
versus<00:01:22.710> someone<00:01:22.860> who<00:01:23.009> happens<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.640> go<00:01:23.729> three

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
versus someone who happens to go three

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.700 
versus someone who happens to go three
gate<00:01:24.119> or<00:01:24.240> anything<00:01:24.540> less<00:01:24.750> he<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.229> do

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
gate or anything less he can just do

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.100 
gate or anything less he can just do
that<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> worst<00:01:26.280> case<00:01:26.490> scenario<00:01:26.850> he<00:01:27.110> loses

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
that in the worst case scenario he loses

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.660 
that in the worst case scenario he loses
obviously<00:01:28.590> that's<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> worst<00:01:29.070> case<00:01:29.280> scenario

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
obviously that's the worst case scenario

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.359 
obviously that's the worst case scenario
but<00:01:29.790> um<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.720> if<00:01:31.229> he<00:01:31.470> if<00:01:31.710> he<00:01:31.829> holds<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
but um but if he if he holds it the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.890 
but um but if he if he holds it the
worst<00:01:32.520> thing<00:01:32.670> he<00:01:32.759> loses<00:01:33.030> his<00:01:33.150> two<00:01:33.299> pylons<00:01:33.630> in

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
worst thing he loses his two pylons in

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.800 
worst thing he loses his two pylons in
the<00:01:34.020> trade<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.509> think<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> pretty

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the trade so I think it's a pretty

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.080 
the trade so I think it's a pretty
interesting<00:01:37.079> way<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.710> look<00:01:37.860> at<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.159> pvp<00:01:38.880> or

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
interesting way to look at a pvp or

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.450 
interesting way to look at a pvp or

at<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.759> forge<00:02:10.030> like<00:02:10.240> oh<00:02:10.450> really<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:11.410> what

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
at the forge like oh really that what

at the forge like oh really that what
you're<00:02:11.620> going<00:02:11.740> to<00:02:11.800> do<00:02:11.890> with<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.040> thing<00:02:13.800> this

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
you're going to do with that thing this

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.910 
you're going to do with that thing this
is<00:02:14.980> rough<00:02:15.900> yeah<00:02:16.900> not<00:02:17.110> much<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.440> would<00:02:17.740> you

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
is rough yeah not much you would you

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.260 
is rough yeah not much you would you
would<00:02:18.010> imagine<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.580> probe<00:02:18.850> could<00:02:19.060> fit

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
would imagine that a probe could fit

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
would imagine that a probe could fit
through<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.540> right<00:02:19.750> there<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.020> look<00:02:20.170> at

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
through that right there and look at

through that right there and look at
that<00:02:20.380> too<00:02:20.470> like<00:02:20.590> how<00:02:20.740> can<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.950> probe<00:02:21.160> not<00:02:21.400> fit

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
that too like how can a probe not fit

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.480 
that too like how can a probe not fit
through<00:02:21.940> there<00:02:22.440> anyways<00:02:23.440> zille<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.340> out
