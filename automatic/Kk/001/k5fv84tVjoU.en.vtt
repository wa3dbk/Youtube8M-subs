to<00:01:46.590> show<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.830> steps<00:01:47.280> because<00:01:47.750> I've<00:01:48.750> already

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
signed up for mine and to use this you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.910

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
have to select a membership plan but I

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.800 
have to select a membership plan but I
recommend<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.850> use<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.390> free<00:02:00.570> plan

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
recommend that you use a free plan

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.670 
recommend that you use a free plan
because<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.980> higher<00:02:02.430> plans<00:02:02.780> don't<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:04.170> much

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
because the higher plans don't have much

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.540 
because the higher plans don't have much
special<00:02:05.070> stuff<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:06.150> just<00:02:06.180> use<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:06.630> free<00:02:06.780> one

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
special stuff so just use the free one

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:19.180 
special stuff so just use the free one
it'll<00:02:08.550> save<00:02:08.820> you<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> lot<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.480> time<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.080> money

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:27.380
