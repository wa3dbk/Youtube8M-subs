hey<00:00:00.240> guys<00:00:00.420> this<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:00.780> Theo<00:00:01.079> Joe<00:00:01.290> tech<00:00:01.589> I<00:00:01.800> thought

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hey guys this is Theo Joe tech I thought

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.679 
hey guys this is Theo Joe tech I thought
a<00:00:02.280> cool<00:00:02.520> topic<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:03.030> talk<00:00:03.179> about<00:00:03.360> would<00:00:03.600> be

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
a cool topic to talk about would be

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.630 
a cool topic to talk about would be
computer<00:00:04.170> power<00:00:04.350> and<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:04.799> there<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.009> limit<00:00:05.339> to

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
computer power and is there a limit to

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.249 
computer power and is there a limit to
it<00:00:05.790> now<00:00:06.270> you<00:00:06.330> probably<00:00:06.750> have<00:00:06.960> heard<00:00:07.109> of

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
it now you probably have heard of

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.950 
it now you probably have heard of
Moore's<00:00:07.710> law<00:00:08.040> which<00:00:08.760> states<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.300> computer

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
Moore's law which states that computer

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.100 
Moore's law which states that computer
power<00:00:10.170> doubles<00:00:10.830> about<00:00:11.130> every<00:00:11.429> two<00:00:11.940> years<00:00:12.269> this

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
power doubles about every two years this

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.530 
power doubles about every two years this
law<00:00:13.380> actually<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:14.160> talking<00:00:14.549> about<00:00:14.610> transistor

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
law actually is talking about transistor

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.990 
law actually is talking about transistor
density<00:00:15.570> because<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.500> CPUs<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.250> actual<00:00:17.699> power

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
density because in CPUs the actual power

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.300 
density because in CPUs the actual power
of<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> CPU<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.930> pretty<00:00:19.560> much<00:00:19.710> determined<00:00:19.890> by

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
of the CPU is pretty much determined by

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.640 
of the CPU is pretty much determined by
the<00:00:20.369> number<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.910> transistors<00:00:21.410> that's<00:00:22.410> why<00:00:22.590> you

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
the number of transistors that's why you

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.160 
the number of transistors that's why you
can<00:00:22.949> see<00:00:23.189> really<00:00:23.460> old<00:00:23.730> CPUs<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
can see really old CPUs that have the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.109 
can see really old CPUs that have the
same<00:00:25.380> frequency<00:00:26.099> like<00:00:26.430> three<00:00:26.760> point<00:00:27.029> 0

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
same frequency like three point 0

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.060 
same frequency like three point 0
gigahertz<00:00:27.510> but<00:00:28.260> there<00:00:28.590> are<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> lot<00:00:28.830> weaker

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
gigahertz but there are a lot weaker

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.820 
gigahertz but there are a lot weaker
than<00:00:29.340> today's<00:00:29.670> CPUs<00:00:30.630> obviously<00:00:31.289> because<00:00:31.619> they

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
than today's CPUs obviously because they

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.540 
than today's CPUs obviously because they
have<00:00:31.980> way<00:00:32.369> fewer<00:00:32.940> transistors<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.680> CEO<00:00:35.130> of

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
have way fewer transistors so the CEO of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.610 
have way fewer transistors so the CEO of
Intel<00:00:36.149> actually<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:36.719> point<00:00:36.960> said<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.500> at

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
Intel actually one point said that at

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.100 
Intel actually one point said that at
this<00:00:37.770> point<00:00:38.180> computer<00:00:39.180> power<00:00:39.420> really<00:00:39.809> only

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
this point computer power really only

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.150 
this point computer power really only
doubles<00:00:40.710> about<00:00:41.460> once<00:00:41.790> every<00:00:42.030> 2.5<00:00:42.960> years<00:00:43.590> so

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
doubles about once every 2.5 years so

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.860 
doubles about once every 2.5 years so
that's<00:00:44.430> kind<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> cadence<00:00:45.450> who<00:00:45.600> are<00:00:45.690> in

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
that's kind of the cadence who are in

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.720 
that's kind of the cadence who are in
right<00:00:46.050> now<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.559> let's<00:00:47.010> talk<00:00:47.160> more<00:00:47.370> about<00:00:47.489> how

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
right now and let's talk more about how

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.700 
right now and let's talk more about how
computer<00:00:48.180> power<00:00:48.329> actually<00:00:48.780> increases<00:00:49.260> now<00:00:49.500> as

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
computer power actually increases now as

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.920 
computer power actually increases now as
I<00:00:50.100> said<00:00:50.160> before<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.850> all<00:00:50.940> about<00:00:51.120> transistors

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
I said before it's all about transistors

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.639 
I said before it's all about transistors
in<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.530> CPU<00:00:53.120> basically<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.809> transistor<00:00:55.469> get

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
in a CPU basically as the transistor get

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.410 
in a CPU basically as the transistor get
smaller<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.160> fit<00:00:56.489> more<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.239> do

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
smaller you can fit more in it can do

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.900 
smaller you can fit more in it can do
more<00:00:57.660> stuff<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.800> same<00:00:59.010> amount<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.550> space

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
more stuff in the same amount of space

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.330 
more stuff in the same amount of space
but<00:01:00.390> obviously<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.500> super<00:01:02.039> small

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
but obviously if you get super small

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.490 
but obviously if you get super small
there's<00:01:03.030> going<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.239> be<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.390> limit<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.960> how<00:01:03.989> small

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
there's going to be a limit to how small

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.859 
there's going to be a limit to how small
you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.100> make<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.400> transistor<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:06.600> are<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:06.720> at

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
you can make a transistor what are we at

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.859 
you can make a transistor what are we at
now<00:01:06.900> about<00:01:07.290> 14<00:01:07.860> nanometer<00:01:08.869> architecture

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
now about 14 nanometer architecture

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.630 
now about 14 nanometer architecture
they're<00:01:10.470> probably<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.070> push<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.460> down

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
they're probably going to push it down

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.929 
they're probably going to push it down
to<00:01:11.880> 10<00:01:12.180> pretty<00:01:12.570> soon<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.400> get<00:01:14.520> small

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
to 10 pretty soon but you get small

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.640 
to 10 pretty soon but you get small
enough<00:01:15.210> you're<00:01:15.960> not<00:01:16.110> going<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> be<00:01:16.439> able<00:01:16.470> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
enough you're not going to be able to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.710 
enough you're not going to be able to
get<00:01:16.830> any<00:01:17.009> smaller<00:01:17.400> because<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
get any smaller because there is a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.289 
get any smaller because there is a
fundamental<00:01:19.350> limit<00:01:20.009> which<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.820> size<00:01:21.030> of

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
fundamental limit which is the size of

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.140 
fundamental limit which is the size of
an<00:01:21.420> atom<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.960> even<00:01:22.890> bigger<00:01:23.250> than<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.549> once

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
an atom and even bigger than that once

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.789 
an atom and even bigger than that once
you<00:01:24.330> get<00:01:24.509> really<00:01:24.780> small<00:01:24.930> down<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.530> size<00:01:25.710> of

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
you get really small down to the size of

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.380 
you get really small down to the size of
a<00:01:25.860> couple<00:01:26.189> atoms<00:01:26.460> you're<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.060> get<00:01:27.180> some

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
a couple atoms you're going to get some

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.149 
a couple atoms you're going to get some
atomic<00:01:27.750> forces<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.890> are<00:01:28.979> going<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
atomic forces that are going to

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.120 
atomic forces that are going to
interfere<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:30.390> how<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.200> transistor<00:01:31.890> would

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
interfere with how the transistor would

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.819 
interfere with how the transistor would
be<00:01:32.310> able<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.970> operate<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:34.290> transistor

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
be able to operate but transistor

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.350 
be able to operate but transistor
density<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.340> only<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:35.640> option<00:01:35.850> for

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
density is only one option for

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.480 
density is only one option for
increasing<00:01:36.810> computer<00:01:37.229> power<00:01:37.470> obviously<00:01:38.070> you

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
increasing computer power obviously you

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.069 
increasing computer power obviously you
can't<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:39.060> any<00:01:39.240> smaller<00:01:39.540> than<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.840> certain

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
can't get any smaller than a certain

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.160 
can't get any smaller than a certain
point<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.159> can<00:01:41.490> increase<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.630> actual

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
point but you can increase the actual

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.359 
point but you can increase the actual
size<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:45.090> CPU<00:01:45.780> itself<00:01:46.040> using<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.130> same

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
size of the CPU itself using the same

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.039 
size of the CPU itself using the same
density<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.210> getting<00:01:48.479> add<00:01:48.630> more

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
density so you getting add more

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.899 
density so you getting add more
transistors<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:50.130> would<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.729> be

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
transistors it would just have to be

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.090 
transistors it would just have to be
bigger<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:51.840> could<00:01:51.960> also<00:01:52.079> see<00:01:52.439> higher

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
bigger we could also see higher

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.550 
bigger we could also see higher
gigahertz<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.360> higher<00:01:54.509> frequencies<00:01:55.229> to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
gigahertz and higher frequencies to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.859 
gigahertz and higher frequencies to
improve<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.490> processing<00:01:57.149> speed<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.659> number

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
improve the processing speed the number

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.569 
improve the processing speed the number
of<00:01:57.990> operations<00:01:58.590> per<00:01:58.799> second<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.430> could

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
of operations per second so you could

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.550 
of operations per second so you could
have<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.759> same<00:02:00.000> number<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.329> transistors<00:02:00.750> but

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
have the same number of transistors but

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.170 
have the same number of transistors but
make<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.829> more<00:02:02.040> powerful<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:02.850> figure<00:02:03.060> out

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
make it more powerful if we figure out

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.899 
make it more powerful if we figure out
how<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> increase<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.649> frequency<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.549> I'm

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
how to increase the frequency and I'm

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.399 
how to increase the frequency and I'm
sure<00:02:06.060> we'll<00:02:06.240> start<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.509> see<00:02:06.570> some<00:02:06.689> crazy<00:02:07.079> new

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
sure we'll start to see some crazy new

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.800 
sure we'll start to see some crazy new
technologies<00:02:07.979> altogether<00:02:08.429> such<00:02:09.000> as<00:02:09.209> quantum

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
technologies altogether such as quantum

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.500 
technologies altogether such as quantum

or<00:02:22.470> both<00:02:23.430> at<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.030> same<00:02:24.270> time<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.380> don't

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
or both at the same time so I don't

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.350 
or both at the same time so I don't
really<00:02:25.860> know<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.310> specifics<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.000> but

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
really know the specifics of that but

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.720 
really know the specifics of that but
that<00:02:27.510> would<00:02:27.630> be<00:02:27.660> able<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.730> exponentially

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
that would be able to exponentially

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.910 
that would be able to exponentially
increase<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.300> power<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:31.200> computer<00:02:31.650> if<00:02:31.800> we

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
increase the power of a computer if we

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.340 
increase the power of a computer if we
can<00:02:32.100> get<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.790> technology<00:02:33.450> working<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.020> as<00:02:34.320> a

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
can get that technology working and as a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.440 
can get that technology working and as a
side<00:02:34.620> note<00:02:34.650> there<00:02:34.950> are<00:02:34.980> actually<00:02:35.820> some

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
side note there are actually some

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.390 
side note there are actually some
quantum<00:02:37.170> computers<00:02:37.620> being<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:37.950> development

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
quantum computers being in development

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.610 
quantum computers being in development
that<00:02:38.730> do<00:02:39.120> work<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.870> are<00:02:40.050> able<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.380> calculate

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
that do work and are able to calculate

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.790 
that do work and are able to calculate
very<00:02:41.550> basic<00:02:41.940> operations<00:02:42.450> but<00:02:42.720> nothing<00:02:43.560> that

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
very basic operations but nothing that

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.830 
very basic operations but nothing that
is<00:02:44.220> actually<00:02:44.580> useful<00:02:44.790> at<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.210> point<00:02:45.480> so

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
is actually useful at this point so

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.390 
is actually useful at this point so
Moore's<00:02:46.170> law<00:02:46.380> has<00:02:46.560> pretty<00:02:46.740> much<00:02:46.950> been<00:02:47.130> true

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
Moore's law has pretty much been true

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.340 
Moore's law has pretty much been true
for<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.670> past<00:02:47.880> several<00:02:48.120> decades<00:02:48.390> but<00:02:48.930> I'd

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
for the past several decades but I'd

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.230 
for the past several decades but I'd
imagine<00:02:49.980> we're<00:02:50.370> going<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.520> start<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.940> see<00:02:51.120> it

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
imagine we're going to start to see it

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.060 
imagine we're going to start to see it
not<00:02:51.450> hold<00:02:51.780> true<00:02:51.870> for<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.290> while<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.680> might<00:02:52.800> slow

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
not hold true for a while it might slow

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.430 
not hold true for a while it might slow
down<00:02:53.190> but<00:02:54.090> obviously<00:02:54.630> computer<00:02:55.110> power<00:02:55.290> is

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
down but obviously computer power is

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.040 
down but obviously computer power is
never<00:02:55.650> going<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:55.860> stop<00:02:55.920> improving<00:02:56.550> as

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
never going to stop improving as

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.630 
never going to stop improving as
technology<00:02:58.050> moves<00:02:58.230> forward<00:02:58.770> we<00:02:59.220> just<00:02:59.459> might

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
technology moves forward we just might

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.199 
technology moves forward we just might
not<00:02:59.820> be<00:03:00.240> able<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.480> get<00:03:00.600> past<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.190> fundamental

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
not be able to get past that fundamental

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.640 
not be able to get past that fundamental
transistor<00:03:03.209> density<00:03:03.260> it's<00:03:04.260> simply<00:03:04.560> because

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
transistor density it's simply because

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.560 
transistor density it's simply because
of<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.250> atoms<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.760> can't<00:03:05.970> get<00:03:06.120> smaller<00:03:06.360> than

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
of the atoms you can't get smaller than

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.180 
of the atoms you can't get smaller than
an<00:03:06.720> atom<00:03:06.840> but<00:03:07.350> as<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.590> mentioned<00:03:07.620> there's<00:03:08.070> going

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
an atom but as I mentioned there's going

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.410 
an atom but as I mentioned there's going
to<00:03:08.250> be<00:03:08.280> other<00:03:08.400> stuff<00:03:08.670> we<00:03:08.790> can<00:03:08.880> do<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.180> improve

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
to be other stuff we can do to improve

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.050 
to be other stuff we can do to improve
efficiency<00:03:10.110> even<00:03:10.380> in<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.680> software<00:03:11.070> side<00:03:11.400> so

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
efficiency even in the software side so

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.910 
efficiency even in the software side so
I'm<00:03:12.240> not<00:03:12.390> too<00:03:12.450> worried<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:13.140> think<00:03:13.380> we're<00:03:13.800> going

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
I'm not too worried I think we're going

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.890 
I'm not too worried I think we're going
to<00:03:13.980> start<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.310> see<00:03:14.459> some<00:03:14.490> amazing<00:03:15.120> technology

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
to start to see some amazing technology
