00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:10.969
 hello so swells 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.129
 today I would like to show you how 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.709
 do this haircut she does 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.970
 very fast in just a couple of seconds and it 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.120
 very simple performance 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.070
 if you are interested to stay in the Well 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:28.820
 let's start first thing we do 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:31.250
 parting on the tank if you want your 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.250
 hairstyle was more spectacular pain 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.329
 curvy volumetric then i advise you to do 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.329
 started a little behind 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.150
 we all prepared hair weaving and 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.650
 let's start leading first thing we 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:25.640
 we take a lock of hair from a part we divide it 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.360
 in half then lay down crosswise 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.420
 from face this scheme will be a bit like 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.210
 on the French braid scheme each time 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.110
 and we will add strand again 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.660
 cross again add that is 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.960
 cross over and thereby have us 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:48.200
 It turns out such a flagellum Nikas each 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.650
 at once we will pick up the strand and so 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.650
 weave to the end 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.060
 when we ran out of hair we just 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.060
 continue to weave ordinary good 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.769
 This hairstyle is perfect for 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.010
 girls who have separated bangs like 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.810
 me you just feed her into this flagella 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:47.489
 but we will not interfere and nowhere 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:49.950
 I get out and that's my hairstyle 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.959
 it turned out for a couple of seconds it was 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.700
