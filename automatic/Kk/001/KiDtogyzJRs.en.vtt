00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
now Stieg Larsson's seems to have wanted

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.730 
now Stieg Larsson's seems to have wanted
to<00:01:24.360> expose<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.869> lot<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> dangers<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
to expose a lot of the dangers that

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.920 
to expose a lot of the dangers that
women<00:01:26.159> face<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.580> society<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.810> those

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
women face in society and how those

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.990 
women face in society and how those
dangers<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.560> often<00:01:28.799> ignored<00:01:29.250> even<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
dangers are so often ignored even to the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.789 
dangers are so often ignored even to the
point<00:01:30.240> where<00:01:30.450> these<00:01:30.869> women<00:01:31.320> will<00:01:31.439> lose<00:01:31.560> their

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
point where these women will lose their

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.100 
point where these women will lose their
lives<00:01:32.040> because<00:01:32.280> no<00:01:32.579> one<00:01:32.700> will<00:01:32.790> help<00:01:32.970> them<00:01:33.240> this

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
lives because no one will help them this

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.749 
lives because no one will help them this
so<00:01:34.320> there's<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.590> strong<00:01:34.890> feminist<00:01:35.220> message

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
so there's a strong feminist message

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.240 
so there's a strong feminist message
here<00:01:36.030> about<00:01:36.210> gendered<00:01:36.930> injustice<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.040> I

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
here about gendered injustice and I

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.460 
here about gendered injustice and I
really<00:01:38.490> appreciate<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.869> drawback<00:01:40.140> to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470

really appreciate that one drawback to
the<00:01:40.560> story<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.189> when<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.509> narrative

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the story is that when the narrative

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.109 
the story is that when the narrative
switches<00:01:43.439> over<00:01:43.619> from<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.490> murder<00:01:44.729> mystery

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
switches over from the murder mystery

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.920 
switches over from the murder mystery
back<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.899> libel<00:01:46.229> mystery<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:47.119> I<00:01:48.119> just

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
back to the libel mystery I I just

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.670
