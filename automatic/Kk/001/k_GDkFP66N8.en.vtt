00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 for a match of assistance from 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.650
 service for a blind person to 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.839
 a person who is in a wheelchair 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.820
 it's just that equivalent to your chair 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.200
 of wheels to your oxygen tank in 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.210
 mexico despite the fact that the general law of 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.230
 inclusion of people with disabilities 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.059
 protect the assistance projects and 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.260
 he contemplates a return of knowledge 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.609
 the law itself is no longer the lack of 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.680
 culture of the people complicates the matter 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.369
 pension that there is a story that tries 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.369
 change the things 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.949
 this is the story that consumes the 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.949
 little diego and his people 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.559
 in this year I have learned that there are hundreds 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.720
 that do not have goals my dates of 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.550
 Chilean expiration the way more 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.739
 direct to success that love does not 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.660
 buy with money a school is more than 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.920
 a building that is the best and 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.920
 unconditional friend of man 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.510
 these are the words that a father 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.309
 he writes to one that his son of ten 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.149
 years was diagnosed with an aggressive 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.149
 type diabetes 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.120
 there is something wrong 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.130
 of the office with a diagnosis for 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.130
 the rest of your life 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.780
 you spend a flight period where you have 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.860
 to accept that your whole life changed 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.860
 I do not get off 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.499
 I feel tired 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.429
 suddenly with what they see all black from 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.470
 white then as of today 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.420
 I get it 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.680
 the diagnosis that changed the life that 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.460
 he puts his constant to the patient 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.460
 intermittent 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.340
 and I common 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.680
 first with the essential food and 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.910
 try to take away everything they are 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.220
 flours 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.030
 everything all everything is obvious to eliminate 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.160
 then on the other hand I became obsessed with 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.990
 look for the finest needle in the world 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.990
 whole what was better 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.210
 once they had managed to bring 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.550
 from the most remote corner of the world the 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.410
 best team for diego lateral and 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.630
 We are inventing technology every minor 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.470
 concern 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.410
 among those things I become obsessed with 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.800
 get him a medical alert I do not know 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:42.200
 where where I saw it where I heard it as 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.900
 I knew but I knew that it existed here in 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.910
 mexico that we spend but delayed in 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.220
 that and there's no one to teach you to 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.680
 train dogs for medical alert 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.780
 well diego and I say of Mexicans a 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.120
 trained black labrador on request and 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.910
 under the risk of expressive sara and 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.280
 specifically to live 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.300
 life and now it is not understood without the 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.300
 four legs but how 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.269
 for swimming they have kind of 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.269
 now 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.600
 the house of those who are going to Mexico in the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.240
 airplane 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.010
 I was on the plane with Diego and we're going 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.990
 the school of diego has become 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.560
 pioneer in the subject to lend more routes 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.560
 faces 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.010
 the lady will be every time mom of diego 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.010
 and he came with me to practice theory 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.530
 this project but the coaches 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.709
 first with me criminals and we talked 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.450
 since I can explain a little bit the 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.769
 collage that we were communicating all 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.620
 that part they passed me information 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:55.310
 We send a letter to the troops of how 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.500
 do all this process and well then 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.040
 we started talking to each staff 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.260
 then parents and it is part of the living room 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.450
 part of diego's life 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.450
 and then it is something much more natural not 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.350
 the lack of knowledge on the subject of 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.590
 Soil assistance for many has 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.440
 complicated the process there are very many 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.090
 places that have opened me at the time 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.300
 in which I have explained to them we have 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.700
 open the doors of the place but 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:32.409
 many others that even barely 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:34.629
 they feel but they tell us no and no 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:37.089
 all societies and authorities 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:39.999
 service environment mexico should 

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:42.419
 have access to all places is your 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:42.419
 eyes 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.010
 medical with a low chemical one 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.790
 chemical alteration for all 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.720
 spaces of mexico 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:59.780
 and protect the assistance dogs 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.910
 these gifts of service but people do not 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.230
 has the culture pitingo is not a 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:09.440
 Viking mascot helps the 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.800
 my son's integrity be safe that 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.340
 he has already saved my son's life and I 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.530
 I think that does not have the price 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.600
 with an effectiveness of 95 percent 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.490
 Viking has detected the changes in the 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.470
 diego glucose levels does not matter 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:27.100
 the time or the place 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:31.120
 and I start to see everywhere and from 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:35.650
 suddenly like that is the one for and I know what 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.420
 think and if as if I read it but not 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.820
 you know it's me I keep seeing myself I'm 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.820
 putting then he already thought it over 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.790
 clothes of service has to be at 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.460
 side of you or you can be quick but 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.820
 until your side the greatest fear of 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.940
 the father of a diabetic child is that 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.430
 may have severe hypoglycaemia in 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.680
 the nights I do not even wake up 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.949
 when it barks and that takes time because it arrives 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.080
 very deep and suddenly like that I 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:12.389
 I'm awake and I'm a dad and my mom 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.389
 living injecting me 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.320
 in the family 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.150
 obstacle have been a pretext for not 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.160
 get ahead for me try to put a 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.820
 bit in society and leave 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.820
 literally 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.500
 and in the end as also says the father of 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.190
 day with the same letter and you have to start 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.190
 at once 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.370
 Beijing has literally saved him the 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.590
 Diego's life on several occasions Carlos 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.660
 is the first medical alert dog in 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.550
 mexico only 70 in the world there are very 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.199
 few in the whole world and well then 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.820
 now he is doing little by little everything 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:00.229
 that can so that they go including 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.139
 these little sticks in daily life like 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:05.540
 david that then the dog gets to 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:07.040
 bark so loud when it detects that 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.280
 there is the problem 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.590
 Exactly knows her calm or how she knows that 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.210
 and to whom they take insulins mini 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.800
 tomorrow we will see how Diego will be trained 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.510
 because it 's the first one and they did it 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.970
 at the risk of being a viking 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.520
 is at risk of living at two a diego 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.560
 and I Viking because they had to fit 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.270
 to be together viking has a 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.160
 toy on the back in their villages a 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.199
 deposit that exactly then not 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.479
 put aside until someone gives his 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:34.400
 little game that means that o diego 

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:36.860
 he already reacted he injected himself and gave it to him or 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.870
 that if diego is passed out an adult 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.960
 come inject Diego and give him the 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.940
 little toy 

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:48.569
 to training because it was a puppy 

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:48.569
 street and mistreat the go
