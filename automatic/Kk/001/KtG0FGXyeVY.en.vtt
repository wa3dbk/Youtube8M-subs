where you parked your car then you're

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.800 
where you parked your car then you're

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
all the water that you need in with you

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.509 
all the water that you need in with you
I<00:00:21.539> did<00:00:22.199> used<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.010> when<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.220> first

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
I did used to do that when I first

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.340 
I did used to do that when I first
started<00:00:23.670> camping<00:00:24.420> just<00:00:24.630> because<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.019> seemed

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
started camping just because it seemed

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.380 
started camping just because it seemed
like<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.710> most<00:00:25.920> comfortable<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.760> safest<00:00:27.240> way

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
like the most comfortable and safest way

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.950 
like the most comfortable and safest way
to<00:00:27.570> go<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.650> had<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> couple<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.849> 5-gallon<00:00:30.179> jugs

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
to go I had a couple of 5-gallon jugs

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.650 
to go I had a couple of 5-gallon jugs
and<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.920> would<00:00:32.070> fill<00:00:32.309> them<00:00:32.489> before<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:32.969> left<00:00:33.270> and

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
and I would fill them before I left and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.799 
and I would fill them before I left and
it<00:00:34.290> meant<00:00:34.710> taking<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.309> lot<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.820> breaks<00:00:36.149> when

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it meant taking a lot of breaks when

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.410 
it meant taking a lot of breaks when
when<00:00:37.320> we<00:00:37.469> were<00:00:37.620> hiking<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:38.910> at<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.239> same

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
them and hang them from trees and then

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.060 
them and hang them from trees and then
you've<00:00:54.120> got<00:00:54.329> running<00:00:54.629> water<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.500> that's<00:00:55.800> kind

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
you've got running water so that's kind

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
of neat any water that you find when

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.229 
of neat any water that you find when
you're<00:00:57.960> camping<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.770> river<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.550> lake<00:00:59.609> or<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
you're camping in a river or lake or a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.110 
you're camping in a river or lake or a
stream<00:01:00.829> you're<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.850> able<00:01:02.940> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
stream you're not going to be able to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.939 
stream you're not going to be able to
drink<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.229> filled<00:01:04.439> with<00:01:04.680> bacteria

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
drink because it's filled with bacteria

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.179 
drink because it's filled with bacteria
and<00:01:05.580> viruses<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.960> boil<00:01:07.229> all<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.950> water

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
and viruses you can boil all that water

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.520 
and viruses you can boil all that water
so<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.000> boil<00:01:09.240> water<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:09.960> five<00:01:10.170> minutes

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
so if you boil water for five minutes

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.340 
so if you boil water for five minutes
then<00:01:11.189> it's<00:01:11.369> safe<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.970> drink<00:01:12.270> thing<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.140> then

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
then it's safe to drink thing is then

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.070 
then it's safe to drink thing is then
you've<00:01:13.530> got<00:01:13.740> hot<00:01:14.010> water<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:15.420> also<00:01:15.900> we're

want to drink so it's it's not very

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.070 
want to drink so it's it's not very
practical<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.759> do<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.630> done<00:01:24.810> if

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
practical to do but it can be done if

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.200 
practical to do but it can be done if
you<00:01:25.110> boil<00:01:25.439> your<00:01:25.590> water<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.580> should<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.970> plan

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
on bringing something to store the water

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.760 
on bringing something to store the water
in<00:01:29.579> once<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.150> boiled<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.049> let<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.530> cool

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
in once it's boiled and and let it cool

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.710 
in once it's boiled and and let it cool
the<00:01:32.310> other<00:01:32.430> thing<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.880> invest<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.689> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
purifier or filter and you're looking at

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.280 
purifier or filter and you're looking at
spending<00:01:36.960> between<00:01:37.520> 50<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.549> 200<00:01:39.030> bucks<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:40.020> on

spending between 50 and 200 bucks on on
something<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.759> that's<00:01:42.240> probably

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
something like that but that's probably

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.410 
something like that but that's probably
the<00:01:43.049> safest<00:01:43.770> most<00:01:44.040> reliable<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.970> most

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the safest most reliable and most

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.770

you to drink there's lots of different
options<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> market<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:57.000> one<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.360> I

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
options on the market the one that I

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.200 
options on the market the one that I
have<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> pump<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.280> filter<00:01:59.729> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
have is a pump so it's a filter the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.060 
have is a pump so it's a filter the
water<00:02:00.420> runs<00:02:00.750> through<00:02:00.869> tube<00:02:01.350> through<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
water runs through tube through the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.450 
water runs through tube through the
filter<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.790> into<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:04.590> container<00:02:05.250> you're

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
filter and into the container you're

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.969 
filter and into the container you're
going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> use<00:02:05.909> for<00:02:06.210> drinking<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.799> have

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
going to use for drinking but you have

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.760 
going to use for drinking but you have
to<00:02:08.129> pump<00:02:08.399> all<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.030> water<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.690> that's<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.560> part

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
to pump all the water so that's the part

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.860 
to pump all the water so that's the part
that's<00:02:10.830> that's<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.670> downside<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.510> filter

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
that's that's the downside to the filter

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.790 
that's that's the downside to the filter
that<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.080> have

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
that I have

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.470 
that I have
on<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.400> other<00:02:14.520> hand<00:02:14.880> there's<00:02:15.120> something

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
on the other hand there's something

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.020 
on the other hand there's something
called<00:02:15.630> like<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> SteriPEN<00:02:16.470> which<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.490> awesome

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
called like a SteriPEN which is awesome

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.720 
called like a SteriPEN which is awesome
and<00:02:18.210> it's<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.900> basically<00:02:19.610> sterilizing<00:02:20.610> all

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
and it's it's basically sterilizing all

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.180 
and it's it's basically sterilizing all
the<00:02:20.910> water<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.270> it's<00:02:21.720> placed<00:02:22.110> into<00:02:22.680> that's

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
the water that it's placed into that's

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.970 
the water that it's placed into that's
on<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.580> expensive<00:02:24.240> end<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.630> spectrum

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
on the expensive end of the spectrum

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.910 
on the expensive end of the spectrum
lastly<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.130> should<00:02:26.160> probably<00:02:26.550> plan<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.570> a

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
lastly you should probably plan for a

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.610 
lastly you should probably plan for a
last<00:02:29.000> worst-case<00:02:30.000> scenario<00:02:30.570> situation<00:02:31.410> and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
last worst-case scenario situation and

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.560 
last worst-case scenario situation and
bring<00:02:31.950> some<00:02:32.220> iodine<00:02:32.580> tablets

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
bring some iodine tablets

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.920 
bring some iodine tablets
they'll<00:02:33.980> purify<00:02:34.980> any<00:02:35.250> water<00:02:35.750> they're<00:02:36.750> going

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
they'll purify any water they're going

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.720 
they'll purify any water they're going
to<00:02:36.990> make<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.290> water<00:02:37.470> taste<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:38.010> iodine<00:02:38.370> and

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
to make the water taste like iodine and

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.760 
to make the water taste like iodine and
it's<00:02:38.880> also<00:02:39.060> not<00:02:39.330> safe<00:02:39.690> for<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.050> consume

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
it's also not safe for you to consume

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.790 
it's also not safe for you to consume
large<00:02:41.220> amounts<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.850> iodine<00:02:42.050> so<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.290> tablets

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
large amounts of iodine so the tablets

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.520 
large amounts of iodine so the tablets
like<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.190> are<00:02:44.340> just<00:02:44.610> used<00:02:44.910> in<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.570> emergency

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
like that are just used in in emergency

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.800 
like that are just used in in emergency
situations<00:02:47.280> when<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.000> comes<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.390> purifying
