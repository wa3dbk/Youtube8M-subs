 they have a point in common 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.790
 d pola already know that to inspire me many times what I do is give me a 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.550
 I walked through the Tarragona market and had gone with the intention of buying 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.960
 some meat but in the end I saw that there was nice and that says it's from here 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.660
 you already know that I had red I prefer not to consume so I have not bought and I'm going to 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.720
 do it marinated c very simple first thing we do but go well 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.270
 the skin of a lemon you already know that what interests us is the most 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.470
 yellow since white has a somewhat unpleasant taste after we go to 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.690
 add a couple of garlic cloves, finely chopped, add salt and pepper 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.630
 we have a good squirt of olive oil 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.170
 and we mix it well 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.440
 and with this we are going to marinate the two loins of bonito come training the skin well 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.080
 he's going to be on his back and then we're like that on his stomach 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.060
 Dec 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.060
 we discover with film paper 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.590
 if we leave them in the fridge between half an hour 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.160
 while we are going to chop this onion that I have been sent from ebro sources 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.350
 now that they have got 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.060
 Protected designation of origin is cut in julienne and we are going to put it 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.060
 in water 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.170
 and we also take advantage of and treat the lettuce that we have also prospered 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.659
 well past half an hour and now let's do it is pretty grilled with 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.930
 the game well high 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.980
 with the skin down and adding the juices of the marinade above was 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.540
 so fast so that everything is fine on the part of the skin while 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.300
 we just prepared the salad, we drained the onion and the churra 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.389
 and we line it up with salt pepper olive pt 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:28.119
 and since we have lemon, we take advantage of it 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.670
 efe 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.889
 efe 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:38.609
 we mix well and we will add more olives that we like the most 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:50.869
 for the nice if you do it for a long time will be dry and if you do little will be given 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.529
 raw inside but that is rich 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:57.809
 it's a matter of taste to be just very past then I recommend that what 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:01.019
 will have done and mix it is a little bit with salad 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.229
 and so it will not be dry 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:07.479
 Well I hope you have a hug or see you later 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:14.569
 two
