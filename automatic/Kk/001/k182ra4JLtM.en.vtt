00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.400
 muesli is usually prepared 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.720
 last night and let me rest in the fridge 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.830
 I find this version a bit heavy 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.379
 undigested 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.440
 so mine will be much lighter 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.969
 let's start yogurt with yogurt 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.770
 live lactic acid bacteria are the best 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.810
 they are rich in calcium enzymes and 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.840
 probiotics that help the body ad 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.540
 absorb a lot of nutrients 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.700
 people especially children accompanies 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.900
 muesli with milk but yogurt is 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.450
 a better alternative 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.640
 I like to prepare it for about ten minutes 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.039
 before serving it to prevent it 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.679
 get heavy this is done 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:43.140
 apple juice is great for sweetening 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:48.370
 the month they need a couple of spoons 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.850
 go a well mixed add the i 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.850
 oatmeal 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.790
 for now nor use only two thirds like this 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.950
 will absorb the yogurt and increase in 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:04.020
 tommy then I'll add the rest at the end 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.700
 the vein a low glycemic index then 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.550
 is able to release slowly 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.200
 energy until lunchtime 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.950
 this is the consistency that I like about 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.950
 plus add the rest of the flakes 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.160
 I hope a crisp note now stir 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.550
 gently 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:29.520
 take a pan the almonds do 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.310
 fine posting them still become 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.300
 more good put it in the pan and toast 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.259
 they will add a touch of 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.259
 crunchiness with our muesli 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.740
 position them so that the toasting 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.090
 be homogeneous put them on a plate the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.790
 nice to compose yours yourselves 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.180
 muesli and that you have the control but 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.280
 now and raspberry strawberries and so on 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.229
 wild berries not only good but 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.700
 they are rich in antioxidants and vitamins 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.880
 cek 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:08.069
 now cover your nesli with me 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.960
 blackberries are generous and sweet 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:15.500
 prickly 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:19.680
 finally add the toasted almonds 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.580
 I want it to be very crunchy then 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.580
 already abundant 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.560
 my exquisite little sun but you 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.930
 will fill with energy 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.730
 here's how they eat they know not at breakfast 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.180
 there really is no better way to start 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.180
 the day
