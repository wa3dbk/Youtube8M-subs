I think that if you've been sticking to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.209 
I think that if you've been sticking to
the<00:00:39.840> same<00:00:40.020> style<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.680> really<00:00:41.010> long<00:00:41.160> time

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
you should absolutely change it up some

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.069 
you should absolutely change it up some
face<00:00:44.160> framing<00:00:44.520> layers<00:00:44.850> are<00:00:45.149> actually<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> great

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
alternative to just one length hair a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.569 
alternative to just one length hair a

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
and when you do that super super dark

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.990 
and when you do that super super dark
contrast<00:03:34.470> on<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.919> skin<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.489> can<00:03:35.639> make<00:03:35.819> you

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
contrast on the skin it can make you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.120 
contrast on the skin it can make you
look<00:03:36.239> kind<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.690> sickly<00:03:37.109> but<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:37.769> nice

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
look kind of sickly but a nice

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.900 
look kind of sickly but a nice
in-between

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
in-between

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.940 
in-between
where<00:03:39.239> you're<00:03:39.389> still<00:03:39.630> warming<00:03:40.290> up<00:03:40.440> your<00:03:40.650> hair

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
where you're still warming up your hair

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.569 
where you're still warming up your hair
to<00:03:41.730> counterbalance<00:03:42.630> your<00:03:43.079> paleness<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:44.010> think

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
to counterbalance your paleness I think

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.009

it'll<00:03:44.700> look<00:03:44.790> really<00:03:45.030> good<00:03:45.329> but<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:45.690> just

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
it'll look really good but I just

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.710 
it'll look really good but I just
wouldn't<00:03:46.230> go<00:03:46.470> as<00:03:46.650> dark<00:03:47.400> as<00:03:47.609> you're<00:03:47.940> wanting<00:03:48.389> so
