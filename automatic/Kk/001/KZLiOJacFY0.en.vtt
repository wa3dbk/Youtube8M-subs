00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
getting so many different variations

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.830 
getting so many different variations
with<00:03:12.830> whether<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:13.250> be<00:03:13.280> snake<00:03:13.640> bites<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.270> then

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
with whether it be snake bites and then

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.930 
with whether it be snake bites and then
you've<00:03:14.959> got<00:03:15.170> from<00:03:15.620> snake<00:03:15.860> bites<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.430> Fish<00:03:16.670> Face

you've got from snake bites to Fish Face

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.510 
you've got from snake bites to Fish Face
to<00:03:17.240> then<00:03:17.660> again<00:03:17.959> when<00:03:18.260> you<00:03:18.350> get<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.500> snake<00:03:19.070> weap

to then again when you get to snake weap
they're<00:03:19.700> also<00:03:20.300> distinct<00:03:21.050> from<00:03:21.110> one<00:03:21.350> another

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
they're also distinct from one another

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.150 
they're also distinct from one another
in<00:03:21.920> character<00:03:22.760> models<00:03:23.740> having<00:03:24.740> a<00:03:24.830> look<00:03:24.920> at<00:03:25.040> his

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
in character models having a look at his

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.490 
in character models having a look at his
face<00:03:25.340> though<00:03:25.670> just<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:26.510> really<00:03:26.750> fun<00:03:27.110> looking

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
face though just a really fun looking

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.390 
face though just a really fun looking
face<00:03:27.709> on<00:03:27.980> snake<00:03:28.370> weed<00:03:29.650> he's<00:03:30.650> very<00:03:31.130> you<00:03:31.370> can

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
face on snake weed he's very you can

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.970 
face on snake weed he's very you can
tell<00:03:31.640> he's<00:03:31.790> very<00:03:32.030> plant<00:03:32.540> based<00:03:32.840> there's<00:03:33.740> his

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
tell he's very plant based there's his

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.210 
tell he's very plant based there's his
antennas<00:03:34.430> up<00:03:34.580> at<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.730> top<00:03:34.940> there<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.980> guess<00:03:36.980> you

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
antennas up at the top there I guess you

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.400 
antennas up at the top there I guess you
can<00:03:37.459> somewhat<00:03:38.060> rotate<00:03:38.570> them<00:03:38.780> due<00:03:39.020> to<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.290> way

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
can somewhat rotate them due to the way

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.040 
can somewhat rotate them due to the way
that<00:03:39.440> you<00:03:39.620> pegged<00:03:39.950> them<00:03:40.100> into<00:03:40.280> place<00:03:40.900> he<00:03:41.900> does

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
that you pegged them into place he does

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.420 
that you pegged them into place he does
actually<00:03:42.200> have<00:03:42.500> pretty<00:03:42.800> good<00:03:43.070> articulation

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
actually have pretty good articulation

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.650 
actually have pretty good articulation
all<00:03:44.030> around

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
all around

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.350 
all around
I<00:03:44.890> like<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.010> coloring<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.850> green<00:03:47.180> that

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
I like the coloring of the green that

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.759 
I like the coloring of the green that
they<00:03:47.450> use<00:03:47.630> they<00:03:47.810> got<00:03:47.959> this<00:03:48.080> nice<00:03:48.320> lighter

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
they use they got this nice lighter

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.610 
they use they got this nice lighter
green<00:03:49.250> around<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.820> upper<00:03:50.180> torso<00:03:50.540> section<00:03:51.080> and

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
green around the upper torso section and

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.080 
green around the upper torso section and
then<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.010> majority<00:03:52.160> of<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.610> figure<00:03:52.880> is<00:03:53.060> just

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
then the majority of the figure is just

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.190 
then the majority of the figure is just
this<00:03:53.630> this<00:03:54.230> nice<00:03:54.530> green<00:03:55.360> coloring<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.570> also

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
this this nice green coloring I also

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.180 
this this nice green coloring I also

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
like the fact that he's got the little

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.280 
like the fact that he's got the little
pink<00:03:58.519> on<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:58.700> insides<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.300> his<00:03:59.420> legs<00:03:59.720> and<00:03:59.959> also

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290
