alright<00:00:08.639> since<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:09.090> tested<00:00:09.690> my<00:00:09.840> electronics

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179 
alright since I tested my electronics

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.160 
alright since I tested my electronics
now<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.630> only<00:00:12.780> thing<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.530> left<00:00:13.860> is

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
now the only thing that is left is

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.450 
now the only thing that is left is
finding<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.199> city<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:17.190> pomona<00:00:17.880> plane<00:00:18.359> which

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
finding the city of pomona plane which

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.460

centimeter from the leading edge so it

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.770 
centimeter from the leading edge so it
for<00:01:43.890> unless<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.520> mean<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:44.850> clear<00:01:45.090> idea<00:01:45.570> that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
for unless I mean it's clear idea that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.620 
for unless I mean it's clear idea that
it<00:01:45.960> stays<00:01:46.320> heavy<00:01:46.649> because<00:01:47.299> nothing's<00:01:48.299> inside

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
it stays heavy because nothing's inside

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.899 
it stays heavy because nothing's inside
with<00:01:48.780> useless<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.860> all<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.460> do<00:01:50.670> now<00:01:50.880> is

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
with useless so all I have to do now is

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.230 
with useless so all I have to do now is
installed<00:01:51.810> electronics<00:01:52.579> and<00:01:53.579> see<00:01:54.180> how

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
installed electronics and see how

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.560 
installed electronics and see how
how<00:01:55.630> it<00:01:55.840> behaves<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:56.470> if<00:01:57.070> I<00:01:57.579> need<00:01:57.790> to<00:01:57.820> it<00:01:58.270> just

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
how it behaves and if I need to it just

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.749 
how it behaves and if I need to it just
I<00:01:59.320> mean<00:02:00.130> my<00:02:00.700> battery<00:02:01.119> inside<00:02:01.509> there<00:02:02.759> because

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
I mean my battery inside there because

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.820 
I mean my battery inside there because
we<00:02:04.090> know<00:02:04.210> that<00:02:04.240> doesn't<00:02:04.659> believe<00:02:05.409> will<00:02:05.649> be<00:02:05.680> the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
we know that doesn't believe will be the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.570 
we know that doesn't believe will be the
more<00:02:06.070> heavier<00:02:06.430> one<00:02:07.030> I'm<00:02:07.330> going<00:02:07.479> get<00:02:08.310> upward<00:02:09.310> or

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
more heavier one I'm going get upward or

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.280 
more heavier one I'm going get upward or
download<00:02:10.119> will<00:02:10.360> affect<00:02:11.290> them<00:02:11.550> cg<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.900> we

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
download will affect them cg so and we

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.490 
download will affect them cg so and we
like<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.650> after<00:02:14.980> i<00:02:15.340> install<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:16.060> mean<00:02:16.300> time<00:02:16.989> we

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
like that after i install I mean time we

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.690 
like that after i install I mean time we
sell<00:02:17.739> all<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.099> electrons<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:18.940> self<00:02:19.239> useless

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
sell all the electrons in self useless

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.270 
sell all the electrons in self useless
so<00:02:21.700> God<00:02:22.660> placing<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.860> electronics<00:02:25.530> on<00:02:26.530> which

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
so God placing the electronics on which

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.570 
so God placing the electronics on which
part<00:02:27.640> of<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.090> few<00:02:28.390> slurs<00:02:28.720> I'd<00:02:29.110> say<00:02:29.709> I've<00:02:30.130> moved

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
part of the few slurs I'd say I've moved

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.570 
part of the few slurs I'd say I've moved
all<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.709> electronics<00:02:32.709> that's<00:02:33.010> my<00:02:33.250> e<00:02:33.660> se<00:02:34.660> my

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
all the electronics that's my e se my

battery and the Calico and my receiver

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.009 
battery and the Calico and my receiver
so<00:02:41.860> all<00:02:42.100> in<00:02:42.489> front<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.120> future<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.600> enough

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
so all in front of the future is enough

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.720 
so all in front of the future is enough
room<00:02:44.350> here<00:02:45.000> inside<00:02:46.000> this<00:02:46.360> cabin<00:02:46.959> here<00:02:47.580> but<00:02:48.580> to

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
room here inside this cabin here but to

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.199 
room here inside this cabin here but to
accommodate<00:02:49.330> all<00:02:49.540> these<00:02:49.900> three<00:02:51.209> electronics

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
accommodate all these three electronics

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.610 
accommodate all these three electronics
so<00:02:53.049> I<00:02:53.470> have<00:02:53.860> pushed<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:54.700> as<00:02:54.940> much<00:02:55.480> forward<00:02:56.319> as

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
so I have pushed it as much forward as

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.090 
so I have pushed it as much forward as
possible<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.970> attain<00:02:58.150> this<00:02:58.890> balance<00:02:59.890> here

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
possible to attain this balance here

the wings however else it's pretty much
well<00:03:13.420> balanced<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.200> don't<00:03:14.769> see<00:03:14.950> much<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.220> a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
well balanced I don't see much of a

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:25.039 
well balanced I don't see much of a
tail-heavy<00:03:18.010> or<00:03:19.079> no<00:03:20.079> se<00:03:20.380> v<00:03:21.180> cg<00:03:22.180> here<00:03:23.069> it's<00:03:24.069> quite

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
tail-heavy or no se v cg here it's quite

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.229 
tail-heavy or no se v cg here it's quite
balanced<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.739> think<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.670> would<00:03:27.970> make<00:03:28.209> a

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
balanced and I think it would make a

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.150 
balanced and I think it would make a
perfect<00:03:28.810> flight<00:03:30.930> all<00:03:31.930> right<00:03:32.109> guys<00:03:32.260> um<00:03:32.680> before

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
perfect flight all right guys um before

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.080 
perfect flight all right guys um before
