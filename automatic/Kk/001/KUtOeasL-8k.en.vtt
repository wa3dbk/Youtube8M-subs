00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.680
 god everyone ends up for a 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.240
 tutorial this time for a kraft tutorial 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.220
 days to do to show how 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.650
 make walls for furniture you 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.389
 will already have to cut wood will not need 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.170
 of level 2 craftsman then he will you 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.289
 will need sticks that you removed 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:26.869
 in August of a support and with the log 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:31.170
 you start it's not here you go with 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:37.200
 overflows itself offers you terminals 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.360
 assemble the supports arches with 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.850
 board 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:46.790
 and this time from where you give pilar have 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.350
 tried several it's used in the 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.680
 structure of houses at the roudourou in 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.680
 the country 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.600
 so you will need so I believe a pillar 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:07.060
 and and gives you free leyden frame is 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.860
 supported so that's of course you'll have to 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.940
 first laid the two pillars and then 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:19.149
 put the milk gives you there gives you 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:24.450
 the best of course as it is already like 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.450
 are like that 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.660
 it's not common sense 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.600
 both the watching games 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.920
 woods would then have said again and 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.960
 gives you do not agree it will take 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.640
 still some wood 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.070
 so the woods the wood you can the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.470
 cut with a normal ax that would like 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.120
 have in the arena mode with a fierce 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.150
 that you can find at barracks 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:03.480
 Fire in cities near 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:07.450
 bridge so it weighs less than the 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.660
 than the normal ax and it costs more 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.660
 quick 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.890
 kraft 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.010

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.010

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.200
 with or christmas 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.380
 it makes me a ride and away 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.440
 to jump a door 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.850
 in a castle that I was with 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.780
 the you sleep when you hand 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.200
