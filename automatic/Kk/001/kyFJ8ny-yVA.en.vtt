we're<00:01:14.280> at<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> time<00:01:15.060> yeah<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:16.110> then<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.259> have

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
we're at a time yeah and then you have

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.140 
we're at a time yeah and then you have
to<00:01:16.470> open<00:01:16.710> go<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.060> use

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
to open go that and but you can use

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.570 
to open go that and but you can use
water<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.659> kind<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.619> don't<00:01:20.070> know<00:01:20.280> why<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.520> is

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
water I kind of don't know why it is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.249 
water I kind of don't know why it is
called<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> extreme<00:01:21.360> Saltine<00:01:21.810> challenge<00:01:21.840> I

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
called the extreme Saltine challenge I

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.960 
called the extreme Saltine challenge I
think<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.560> would<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.310> casual

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
think this would be like the casual

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.370 
think this would be like the casual
Saltine<00:01:24.420> challenge<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.930> think<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> little

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
Saltine challenge I think it's a little

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.810 
Saltine challenge I think it's a little
bit<00:01:25.500> easier<00:01:25.830> using<00:01:26.009> yeah<00:01:26.159> water<00:01:26.520> would<00:01:26.790> help

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
bit easier using yeah water would help

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.490 
bit easier using yeah water would help
quite<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> bit<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.659> think<00:01:27.689> they<00:01:27.900> just<00:01:27.990> wanted<00:01:28.320> so

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
quite a bit I think they just wanted so

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.780 
quite a bit I think they just wanted so
i<00:01:28.530> will<00:01:28.799> think<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.009> wanted<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.369> way<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.520> do<00:01:29.759> a

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
i will think they wanted a way to do a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.149 
i will think they wanted a way to do a
challenge<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.450> was<00:01:30.570> safe<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.380> put<00:01:31.710> into<00:01:31.829> our

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
challenge that was safe we put into our

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.219 
challenge that was safe we put into our
choking<00:01:32.579> out<00:01:32.640> saltine<00:01:33.000> crackers<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.750> extreme

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
choking out saltine crackers the extreme

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.870 
choking out saltine crackers the extreme
version<00:01:34.619> i<00:01:34.710> think<00:01:35.009> what<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> next<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.729> should

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
version i think what the next one should

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.940 
version i think what the next one should
be<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.140> ever<00:01:37.259> seen<00:01:37.530> somebody<00:01:37.680> do<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
be is have you ever seen somebody do the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.590 
be is have you ever seen somebody do the

jagged down my throat and I was that was
it<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.379> know<00:03:42.500> even<00:03:42.859> losing<00:03:43.069> two<00:03:43.579> seconds<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.239> was

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
it I know even losing two seconds it was

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.970 
it I know even losing two seconds it was
over<00:03:44.629> yeah<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:45.109> was<00:03:45.200> really<00:03:45.319> hard<00:03:45.560> though<00:03:45.739> oh

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
over yeah that was really hard though oh

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.069 
over yeah that was really hard though oh
it's<00:03:46.310> likely<00:03:46.519> them<00:03:46.670> cold<00:03:46.849> just<00:03:47.599> even<00:03:47.840> adding

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
it's likely them cold just even adding

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.710 
it's likely them cold just even adding
two<00:03:48.230> more<00:03:48.260> wood<00:03:48.650> oh<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:50.150> know<00:03:50.269> what<00:03:50.359> make<00:03:50.540> that

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
two more wood oh you know what make that

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.330 
two more wood oh you know what make that
easy<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.500> we<00:03:51.620> might<00:03:51.739> have<00:03:51.889> gotten<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.160> rules

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
easy and we might have gotten the rules

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.979 
easy and we might have gotten the rules
wrong<00:03:52.549> you<00:03:52.730> may<00:03:52.849> be<00:03:52.910> able<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.150> do<00:03:53.269> this<00:03:53.419> is<00:03:53.599> if

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
wrong you may be able to do this is if

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:54.940 
wrong you may be able to do this is if
you<00:03:54.079> could<00:03:54.230> do<00:03:54.349> like<00:03:54.500> three<00:03:54.739> at<00:03:54.859> a<00:03:54.889> time

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
you could do like three at a time

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.099 
you could do like three at a time
because<00:03:55.370> you<00:03:55.519> break<00:03:55.940> around<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.599> so<00:03:56.720> you<00:03:56.930> want

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
because you break around and so you want

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.569 
because you break around and so you want
to<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.530> could<00:03:57.680> you<00:03:57.859> could<00:03:58.069> be<00:03:58.250> like<00:03:58.340> to<00:03:58.430> i'm

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
to you could you could be like to i'm
