the circuit boys have gloves a circle
it's<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.180> great<00:00:45.360> track<00:00:45.660> how<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.800> i<00:00:46.920> think<00:00:47.129> i'm

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
it's a great track how do i think i'm

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.819 
it's a great track how do i think i'm
going<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> go<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> bit<00:00:48.030> pretty<00:00:48.239> ordinarily

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
going to go for a bit pretty ordinarily

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.720 
going to go for a bit pretty ordinarily
Oh<00:00:50.270> going<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.390> corners<00:00:51.719> way<00:00:51.870> too<00:00:51.930> quick<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
Oh going to corners way too quick and

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.240 
Oh going to corners way too quick and
screami'<00:00:53.730> exits<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:56.129> it's

people say what a great circuit it is I
think<00:02:37.900> it's<00:02:38.020> awesome<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:39.490> said<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:40.120> the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
think it's awesome I said in the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.870 
think it's awesome I said in the
previous<00:02:40.530> podcast<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.920> it's<00:02:42.250> got<00:02:42.490> long

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
going to do everything mate I really

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.030 
going to do everything mate I really
enjoy<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.820> yeah<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.120> sure<00:02:49.300> does<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.690> it's<00:02:50.650> one

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
enjoy it yeah it sure does and it's one

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.980 
enjoy it yeah it sure does and it's one
circuit<00:02:51.520> that<00:02:51.670> whenever<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.120> get<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.360> new<00:02:52.600> f1

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990
