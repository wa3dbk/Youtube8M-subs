00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.019
 Yes, rarely have to play what than 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.470
 you understand well, let's say I 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.210
 soldier 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:16.510
 I'm fighting I saved the lives of friends I kill 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.960
 enemies and dying 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:24.280
 but how often do we fight save 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.920
 flexible at all how can death be collected 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.950
 based on my own experience and 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.020
 flipping women baby buds to home yet 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.240
 anyone 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:42.670
 there generally is actually a reality and 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:44.500
 Here I understand the poses of antics 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.740
 alcohol 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.100
 tears of success 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.449
 loneliness 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.449
 black pour 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:07.330
 flirt despair 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:10.510
 and depression is expensive 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.630
 again alcohol resentment like this twist 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.500
 this giorno di approach them in the corridor 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.600
 look into your eyes so itâ€™s understandable 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:26.650
 scary faces all hairstyle finger and 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:29.070
 say no fraternity of darkness jokes you all 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.070
 knew before 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.690
 projecting murok ignorance in all 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.530
 thought to that 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:46.420
 where are we from and why is mr. malta from 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:50.980
 Moscow with bob acting tour one 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:55.000
 words before rarely happens to play something in what 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.870
 understand about but it happens and it 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.870
 perfectly
