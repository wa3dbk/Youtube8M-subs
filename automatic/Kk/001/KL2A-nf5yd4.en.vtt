00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.299
 I understood about drinks and I had already 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:16.859
 excited but do not spit out like this with this 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:19.490
 accent and we're going to open the list of 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.490
 materials 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.849
 for the compass frames we need 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:31.070
 picture frames printed napkins 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:34.489
 Brush sticks and scissors shine 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:39.500
 we have a reason now very cool 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:42.710
 I do not ever ever ula ula chachachá 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.040
 It hosts hosts and there are some napkins 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.320
 that are called good that are pp and that are 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.379
 the ideals in this in this case not the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.760
 we have but we have to have have 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:01:01.780
 super detail what we're going to do is 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:01.780
 separable if this serves as a nice 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.780
 and on it we had a cloth of the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.620
 waste and well let's basically it's 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.900
 cut it and we're going to stick 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.350
 lowering this this part which is what 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:21.700
 will give us this finished with her 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:30.690
 stick is like that as a game name 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:30.690
 children do not hit them important 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.079
 the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.259
 strips and what we are doing is 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:43.560
 we submerge the brush a little in the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.359
 glitter glues sticks we put asylum so 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.520
 found in any shop 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:52.069
 decoration everything here everything will be the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.069
 cubas technique and bought shines paste 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.820
 process with a varnish I hope to give a 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.850
 brush-stroke effect on top of it 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.440
 of the material then if you can it is 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:09.670
 quite different 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.670
 and above we are going to give you a little pass 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.170
 if you want a white frame in this 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.849
 If we are applying a 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.450
 recycling you already know that you always 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.980
 thank you 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.080
 you do not have to throw away because they say that 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.569
 that if a lot of garbage is produced that 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.299
 in one day we will fill the Aztec stadium 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.750
 by then and several times and then 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.960
 you imagine 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.540
 so it is important that 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.620
 for each stroke we give ourselves 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:45.420
 account that is lawful 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.420
 I will not cut 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.280
 what is superfluous for me after 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.560
 help to remember the marimón 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.959
 it would be in his brushes once finished 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.830
 because good every product that 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.830
 we apply then 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:05.960
 now if all are already there that is like this 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.140
 and then it is not the same 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:13.190
 let's notice that this is another idea that 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.900
 we can is to land in 14 segregando 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.180
 we did the rates were also left 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.980
 amazing with his spoon was was the 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.659
 same technique in this case then for me 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.250
 which by the way was great 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.900
 program so if they missed it the 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.450
 we invite you to go to the page of 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.880
 tvc and there in the tabs above 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.580
 we have 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.830
 a label that says videos clicks 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.050
 there and then all the photos of the 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.740
 different programs that we have and we 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.500
 click 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.540
 and there you can see all the videos 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.310
 from the first program to the last 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.590
 we will be soon a surprise with 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.680
 that lamp that we decorate that is 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.320
 back here if you can capture camera 3 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:57.240
 Banditas, I'm the one who only goes here to 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:00.090
 the blue- blue sunflowers do not lose 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.120
 detail because we have a surprise for 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.650
 you tomorrow we are going to tell you how 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.350
 they will be able to carry it like this is that this 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.690
 daley hernán mode detail of the problem 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.790
 they would have told me before the theory 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.450
 very generous if it's just from 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.390
 Give away a little, not if on Sunday 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:24.210
 also because she passed and we are healthy 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:25.590
 and without number of extras and that's what 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.120
 we have dry 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.470
 this was a blue frame and this is a 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.660
 orange frame then it is reached to 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.800
 spend a bit and well that also makes 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.949
 what 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.120
 is a little contrast that looks 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:40.030
 more interesting with more 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.340
 it's something our practical and good study 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.350
 always according to the decoration that 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.790
 have at home then as I've seen 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:51.850
 also this technique with with figures of 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:54.940
 poles or so and over boxes then they are 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.190
 like wooden trunks 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.699
 and they are as old as replicas of 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.580
 paints 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:06.009
 quite original original 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.030
 Now we cut him off and he said that 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.289
 we need one 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.289
 we lack draft 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.749
 and apart and afterwards it is very easy 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:17.030
 cut it because it moistens all 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:19.250
 our 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.930
 our napkin this is like very 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.729
 very spring-like but good 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.190
 napkin designs like them 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.240
 we commented there good endless for 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.240
 paint up 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.430
 let's give it a little 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.970
 last detail 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.970
 the last 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.789
 that there is 20 the brush if bearish but 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.620
 very well that is not holding because 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.940
 so I can give you the habit already 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.430
 we finish fast 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.110
 it's an excellent idea to give it then 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.310
 another touch to the things that we already have in 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.650
 our house and 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.110
 change a little we have worked with this 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.120
 This product is very attached 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.600
 very economical the truth is that they can 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.580
 Acquiring it is practically not going to 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.020
 cost a lot and good is always good 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.560
 have it at home for what we said 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.360
 make different design options more 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.180
 beyond a frame we can make cups 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:23.460
 some decoration dish as I said 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:27.610
 martín has creative space all of them 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:30.400
 pretty good course to win the 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:33.350
 three times of creative space and good 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.260
 we can still do business with them 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:39.170
 let's put a little bit of change 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.310
 necessary with this same channel with these 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.920
 same 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.510
 I practically have it ready but 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.700
 good in case they lost detail what 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:51.710
 it seems if we are going to see the step by step and 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:54.890
 we return here free space 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.900
 for the frames of glasses removes one of 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.300
 the layers of the napkin and it works 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.610
 only with the print put it on the 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.130
 frame and cut the strips that you will use to 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.130
 cover them with the help of the brush with a 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:09.170
 little glitter sticks in the frame and 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:11.060
 then the napkin gently 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.340
 with the brush moistens the napkin 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:18.280
 until it is stuck in the frame of your 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.280
 import portraits let it dry and ready
