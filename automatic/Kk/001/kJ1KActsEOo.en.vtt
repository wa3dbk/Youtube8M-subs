but I'm hopeful because a lot of it a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.220 
but I'm hopeful because a lot of it a
lot<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.390> new<00:00:36.540> leaves<00:00:36.750> are<00:00:37.020> still

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
lot of the new leaves are still

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.979 
lot of the new leaves are still
sprouting<00:00:37.739> okay<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.600> it's<00:00:39.600> kind<00:00:39.810> of<00:00:39.840> been

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
sprouting okay and it's kind of been

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.260 
sprouting okay and it's kind of been
traveling<00:00:40.410> around<00:00:40.470> our<00:00:40.770> greenhouse<00:00:41.180> you<00:00:42.180> know

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
traveling around our greenhouse you know

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.389 
traveling around our greenhouse you know
pretty<00:00:42.540> much<00:00:42.720> everything<00:00:43.140> else<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.560> healed<00:00:44.190> up

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
pretty much everything else is healed up

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.430 
pretty much everything else is healed up
other<00:00:44.610> than<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.030> plant<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.079> can<00:00:46.230> see

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
other than that plant as you can see

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.920 
other than that plant as you can see
it's<00:00:46.710> kind<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:46.980> dissipating<00:00:47.579> here<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.810> then

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it's kind of dissipating here and then

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.770 
it's kind of dissipating here and then
if<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.110> want<00:00:49.290> to<00:00:49.320> look<00:00:49.500> what<00:00:50.160> fungus<00:00:50.670> ends<00:00:51.660> up

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
if you want to look what fungus ends up

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.770 
if you want to look what fungus ends up
looking<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.260> when<00:00:52.830> it's<00:00:53.010> gone<00:00:53.220> it's<00:00:53.690> kind<00:00:54.690> of

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
looking like when it's gone it's kind of

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.890 
looking like when it's gone it's kind of
this<00:00:55.070> more<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.280> yellowish<00:00:56.970> color<00:00:57.270> here<00:00:57.810> or

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
this more this yellowish color here or

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.840 
this more this yellowish color here or
this<00:01:00.900> yellow<00:01:01.860> spotting<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.610> on<00:01:02.700> these

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
this yellow spotting here on these

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.780 
this yellow spotting here on these
melons

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
melons

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.760 
melons
and<00:01:05.570> that's<00:01:05.780> when<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.050> really<00:01:06.080> starts<00:01:06.590> to

and that's when it really starts to

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.200 
and that's when it really starts to
dissipate<00:01:07.190> so<00:01:07.640> I'm<00:01:07.700> going<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:07.880> walk<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:08.180> down

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
we like to use for treating fungus is

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.000 
we like to use for treating fungus is
serenade<00:01:20.300> here<00:01:20.660> in<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.830> greenhouse<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:24.010> know

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.170 
week you know and it's been really humid
too<00:02:18.940> which<00:02:19.840> adds<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:21.220> fungus<00:02:21.580> ability

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
too which adds to the the fungus ability

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.660 
too which adds to the the fungus ability
to<00:02:22.330> spread<00:02:22.769> so<00:02:23.769> I'll<00:02:23.890> basically<00:02:23.980> spray<00:02:24.519> down

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
to spread so I'll basically spray down

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.150 
to spread so I'll basically spray down
my<00:02:25.030> entire<00:02:25.269> greenhouse<00:02:25.629> here<00:02:26.170> with<00:02:26.980> this

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
my entire greenhouse here with this

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.180 
my entire greenhouse here with this
fungicide<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:29.140> know<00:02:29.260> slowly<00:02:29.620> dissipate
