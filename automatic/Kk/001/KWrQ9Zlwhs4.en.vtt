00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
live it was like a little HP and maybe I

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.070 
live it was like a little HP and maybe I
can<00:02:17.310> hit<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.580> with<00:02:17.700> something<00:02:17.849> but<00:02:18.540> i<00:02:18.750> guess

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
can hit it with something but i guess

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.010 
can hit it with something but i guess
not<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:20.010> died<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.940> i<00:02:21.239> go<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.540> my<00:02:21.660> fighter

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
not and I died so i go to my fighter

like<00:02:22.380> finish<00:02:22.709> off<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.950> law<00:02:23.069> deals<00:02:23.310> with<00:02:23.400> a

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
like finish off the law deals with a

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.210 
like finish off the law deals with a
shadow<00:02:23.700> ball<00:02:23.910> but<00:02:24.780> he<00:02:25.200> switches<00:02:25.440> out<00:02:25.739> goes

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
shadow ball but he switches out goes

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.309 
shadow ball but he switches out goes
into<00:02:26.580> his<00:02:26.730> evil<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.239> fodder<00:02:27.480> him<00:02:27.780> out<00:02:27.959> because

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
into his evil to fodder him out because

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.070 
into his evil to fodder him out because
like<00:02:28.910> there's<00:02:29.910> no<00:02:30.030> really<00:02:30.480> used<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.750> him<00:02:30.959> i

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
like there's no really used to him i

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.570 
like there's no really used to him i
guess<00:02:31.440> for<00:02:31.650> him<00:02:31.830> or<00:02:32.190> something<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:32.519> that

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
guess for him or something like that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.860 
guess for him or something like that
because<00:02:32.849> he<00:02:33.090> doesn't<00:02:33.239> want<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.540> get<00:02:33.599> caught

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870
