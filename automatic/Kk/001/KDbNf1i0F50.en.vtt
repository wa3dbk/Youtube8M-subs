00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.969 
you do mess around or manipulate your
hair<00:01:25.149> the<00:01:25.569> more<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:26.049> notice<00:01:26.350> that<00:01:26.560> you<00:01:26.740> lean

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
already it's obvious that it's not best

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.889

your hair if you're noticing it doesn't

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.589 
your hair if you're noticing it doesn't
give<00:04:58.349> much<00:04:58.620> elasticity<00:04:59.190> you<00:04:59.909> need<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.300> add

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
give much elasticity you need to add

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:02.659 
give much elasticity you need to add
more<00:05:00.900> moisture<00:05:01.110> so<00:05:01.530> you<00:05:01.560> need<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:01.979> do<00:05:02.159> more

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
more moisture so you need to do more

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.310 
more moisture so you need to do more
deep<00:05:03.000> conditioning<00:05:03.539> treatments<00:05:04.020> to<00:05:04.110> keep

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
deep conditioning treatments to keep

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.529 
deep conditioning treatments to keep
your<00:05:04.500> hair<00:05:04.680> more<00:05:04.830> balanced<00:05:05.280> so<00:05:05.909> the<00:05:06.180> reason

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
your hair more balanced so the reason

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.240 
your hair more balanced so the reason
why<00:05:06.659> I<00:05:06.690> suggested<00:05:07.229> that<00:05:07.380> is<00:05:07.500> because<00:05:07.830> if<00:05:08.070> you

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
why I suggested that is because if you

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.370 
why I suggested that is because if you
really<00:05:08.940> really<00:05:09.270> want<00:05:09.570> to<00:05:09.659> retwist<00:05:10.020> your<00:05:10.200> hair
