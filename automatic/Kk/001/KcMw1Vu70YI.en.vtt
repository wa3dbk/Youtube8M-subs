00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hi everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.879
 elite gaming celestini today vi 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.740
 I'll show you what dropped in the three coves 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.750
 the night held this week 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.550
 first of all I remind you that the assault 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.349
 the night of this week will be 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.839
 the devils' den so you will have to 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.340
 kill six px first with the first 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.260
 character with the hiltrop hunter 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.210
 of the carnet one night was a ciniere 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.160
 of the alpha wolf for the hunter precisely 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.320
 very very exotic ray point 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.180
 very nice cute to use if 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.300
 were it not that he dismantled it practically 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.529
 immediately for two reasons the first is because 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.579
 I already had it so I don't need to 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.500
 nothing to have another 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.320
 the second is that at the level of 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.690
 statistics was weaker than that 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.340
 I already had only 120 to go 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.570
 his statistic is what you were 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.640
 around 160 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.110
 so let's say it has a general character 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.210
 regarding my editor arch 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.190
 when I am less than 150 I tend 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.989
 take them apart because I'm sure 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.910
 exist and can be found with 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.890
 better statistics regarding 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.109
 instead my second room notes played 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.960
 with my character titan the drop 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.390
 will be well and I say nine strange 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.799
 coins I am happy to have found them for 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.470
 the simple reason that last week 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.390
 he had almost all the ones I had and didn't 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.549
 I didn't even do a weekly assault 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.250
 so for lack of time I had it 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.990
 need money to put it aside not 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.220
 I 'm happy because we say that in the car 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.810
 and at least I would have preferred the night 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.360
 find a legendary weapon with gods 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.130
 good because rather than not ingram 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.509
 rather than too exotic though 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.180
 let's say I don't always complain better 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.310
 of ascending fragments and energy ed 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.560
 finally sending the third and last falls 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.689
 night played with my sorcerer 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.670
 clinging to the last word not cannon 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.100
 bring the very strong exotic of the pivi 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.320
 probably in the top 3 of the canons 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.420
 portable to use precisely in pvp 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.920
 and here I will also speak in the future why 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.200
 however, I am preparing a review there 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.790
 charge in the next two weeks not 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.470
 I know exactly the day anyway 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.659
 the next two weeks and for now not 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.790
 I advance you nothing if it is not a weapon 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.070
 fantastic is certainly some mistakes of 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.060
 translation in his abilities because he says 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.250
 when you shoot real big that in 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.750
 when you shoot without aiming for sure 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.880
 this thing here is still a weapon 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.740
 fantastic advice to anyone of 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.899
 learn to use because really 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.000
 the crucible becomes much easier if 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.010
 you can master this parma 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.110
 that is the last word saying this 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.819

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.530
