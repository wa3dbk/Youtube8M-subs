00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello, I have my foundation today 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.810
 routine for you and won yet 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.450
 right on and I'll take mine 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.910
 make-up of clinic and my bb cream 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.410
 from astor this band products me is 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.480
 evenly on my hand back 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.070
 So I just hit my skin tone 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.830
 i have the feeling when i have two 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.170
 products somehow mix that with mine 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.539
 Proton comes from and I wear it then 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.539
 even with a foundation brush 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.429
 from over to and he works the whole thing 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.929
 so a bit of skin in my one to 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.390
 I feel that everything is everywhere 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.309
 is evenly distributed and then will 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.230
 it's already time my pimples and 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.239
 to eliminate my dark circles because 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.829
 if you look a perfect skin 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.180
 Of course they do not want to have that 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.399
 be visible and here I take myself 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.920
 my pick me concealer and share that 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.020
 really generous on my whole 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.670
 face is a little bit now 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.590
 to be a lot but if you like the whole 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.260
 then with such a moistened will 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.210
 iii blinded then the whole works 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.920
 not so overloaded and they will 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.570
 see at the end they are nothing more from 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.820
 the pimples and nothing more from the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.220
 eyes hang everything and bring it to you 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.170
 luck, what else my dark circles are like 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.689
 you see eliminated but I have so 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.340
 small persistent pimples the wars 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.080
 i just do not go away with concealer and 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.420
 Here I show you my secret tip and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.950
 Although it is such an anti pimple cream 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.229
 from essens and that's mine 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.570
 darling product for you 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.040
 has such a rather tough consistency and 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.640
 that even a bit harder 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.860
 rub 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.479
 but she keeps all day and she 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.180
 covers very well if you have the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.280
 then you will never have that again 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.869
 problems that your make-up blurs 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.880
 or that somehow you pee on 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.009
 an hour and then you are after 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.110
 and almost done the whole thing 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.670
 then also fixed with coal because 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.560
 we want that make up as long as 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.869
 possible and is frosted and am 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.680
 i also see the one shiny otherwise 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.050
 What 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.250
 and yes that is actually already 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.550
 everything i do for my foundation 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.440
 I do routine in his dark circles 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.960
 and pimple my skin tone out and 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.400
 I fix the whole with brother is even 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.110
 not as hard you can give me happy times 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.640
 Write what you necessarily in Europe 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.600
 nation routine does that 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.940
 main steps 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.800
 and that's how the final result looks 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.660
 and I want to be relative 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.490
 satisfied so i get it too 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.350
 after all, the every follow through tomorrow 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.240
 and then I usually still make-up 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.610
 something more subtle that is my name please mine 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.470
 Lips up a bit and 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.030
 through the eyelashes and pull mine 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.250
 and then I am actually 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.270
 already finished that was mine 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.270
 foundation routine
