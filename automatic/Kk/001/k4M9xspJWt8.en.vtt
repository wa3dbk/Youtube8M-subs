gonna cross both consoles I've been
playing<00:00:37.200> ps4<00:00:37.649> recently<00:00:38.070> lately<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
playing ps4 recently lately and the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.660 
playing ps4 recently lately and the
ballon<00:00:39.870> ps4<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.379> terrible<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.950> hbr<00:00:41.280> a3<00:00:41.640> is

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
ballon ps4 is terrible the hbr a3 is

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.150 
ballon ps4 is terrible the hbr a3 is
very<00:00:42.059> good<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.480> ak-12<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.320> very<00:00:43.590> good<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:43.980> I

very good in the ak-12 is very good so I

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.889 
very good in the ak-12 is very good so I
think<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.610> ak-12<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.270> probably<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> best

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
think the ak-12 is probably the best

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.380 
think the ak-12 is probably the best
overall<00:00:46.140> gun<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.950> both<00:00:47.280> consoles<00:00:47.850> not<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
overall gun on both consoles not the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.569 
overall gun on both consoles not the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
Xbox it's amazing on both consoles so if

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.430 
Xbox it's amazing on both consoles so if
there's<00:00:53.760> no<00:00:53.910> really<00:00:54.239> down<00:00:54.449> sides<00:00:54.690> today<00:00:54.870> k12

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
there's no really down sides today k12

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.400 
there's no really down sides today k12
but<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.829> ak-12<00:00:56.309> hair-trigger<00:00:56.879> has<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.510> +1<00:00:57.960> fire

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
but the ak-12 hair-trigger has a +1 fire

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.660 
but the ak-12 hair-trigger has a +1 fire
rate<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.829> as<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> lot<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.309> guys<00:00:59.399> know<00:00:59.460> about

with it that gun first what it has plus
1<00:01:08.909> fire<00:01:09.210> rate<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.600> increased<00:01:09.990> fire<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.439> 857

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
1 fire rate so increased fire to 857

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.280 
1 fire rate so increased fire to 857
bolts<00:01:11.580> per<00:01:11.760> minute<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.570> minus<00:01:12.990> 1

accuracy so with the plus 1 fire rate

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.060 
accuracy so with the plus 1 fire rate
what<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> ak-12<00:01:16.080> hair-trigger<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.890> going<00:01:17.009> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
what the ak-12 hair-trigger is going to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.410 
what the ak-12 hair-trigger is going to
end<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.220> having<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.729> going<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> same

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
end up having is going to have the same

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.270 
end up having is going to have the same
fire<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> bow<00:01:19.200> how<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.920> guys<00:01:20.040> know<00:01:20.100> I

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
fire is the bow how do you guys know I

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.940 
fire is the bow how do you guys know I
think<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.729> bowels<00:01:21.000> DeBusk<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.450> xbox<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.110> 857

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
think the bowels DeBusk on xbox so 857

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.950 
think the bowels DeBusk on xbox so 857
fire<00:01:23.189> rate<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.000> ak-12<00:01:24.390> hair-trigger

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
fire rate on the ak-12 hair-trigger

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.350 
fire rate on the ak-12 hair-trigger
makes<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.409> exact<00:01:25.740> same<00:01:25.920> as<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> default<00:01:26.640> bow<00:01:27.060> so

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
makes the exact same as a default bow so

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.969 
makes the exact same as a default bow so
that<00:01:27.479> makes<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.780> one<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.140> better<00:01:28.350> guns<00:01:28.710> it

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
that makes it one of the better guns it

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.770 
that makes it one of the better guns it
obviously<00:01:29.340> shoots<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.850> lot<00:01:30.270> faster<00:01:30.450> than

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
obviously shoots a lot faster than

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.170 
obviously shoots a lot faster than
sanity<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.890> minus<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.369> accuracy<00:01:32.970> all

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
sanity and the minus one accuracy all

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.749 
sanity and the minus one accuracy all

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.670 
hair trigger there's no real negatives
it<00:02:41.180> has<00:02:41.390> just<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.750> plus<00:02:41.990> one<00:02:42.200> fire<00:02:42.440> rate

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.860 
it has just a plus one fire rate
obviously<00:02:43.070> gives<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.370> very<00:02:43.730> very

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
obviously gives it that very very

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.570 
obviously gives it that very very
underrated<00:02:44.870> stat<00:02:45.290> where<00:02:45.650> plus<00:02:45.980> 1<00:02:46.130> fire<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.430> can

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
underrated stat where plus 1 fire it can

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.580 
underrated stat where plus 1 fire it can
change<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.940> regular<00:02:47.330> gun<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.810> an<00:02:47.930> insane<00:02:48.290> guns

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
change a regular gun to an insane guns

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.620 
change a regular gun to an insane guns
so<00:02:48.860> these<00:02:49.340> are<00:02:49.489> in<00:02:49.670> my<00:02:49.850> opinion<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.150> two<00:02:50.360> best

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
so these are in my opinion the two best

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.300 
so these are in my opinion the two best
