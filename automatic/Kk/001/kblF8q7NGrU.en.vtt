are going to be doing a speedrun of

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.589 
are going to be doing a speedrun of
Legend<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:07.859> Zelda<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.280> link<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.849> past<00:00:09.000> and

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
Legend of Zelda a link to the past and

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.770

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
like baby's first speedrun this is super

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.429 
like baby's first speedrun this is super
easy<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.350> do<00:00:16.560> anybody<00:00:17.070> can<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.609> thing<00:00:17.850> so

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
easy to do anybody can do this thing so

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.970 
easy to do anybody can do this thing so
I'm<00:00:19.439> gonna<00:00:19.529> start<00:00:19.740> up<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.920> game<00:00:20.039> normally<00:00:20.430> and

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
I'm gonna start up the game normally and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.349 
I'm gonna start up the game normally and
basically<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.430> play<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> first<00:00:23.970> maybe

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
basically you play the first maybe

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.540 
basically you play the first maybe
minute<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.830> game<00:00:25.980> as<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.369> would

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
minute of the game as you would

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.089 
minute of the game as you would
regularly<00:00:27.050> but<00:00:28.050> then<00:00:28.199> there's<00:00:28.560> gonna<00:00:28.650> be<00:00:28.769> one

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
regularly but then there's gonna be one

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.959 
regularly but then there's gonna be one
little<00:00:29.279> trick<00:00:30.769> but<00:00:31.769> really<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.730> a

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
little trick but really this is just a

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.810 
little trick but really this is just a
fun<00:00:33.239> thing<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.690> found<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.320> wanted<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.399> dip

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
fun thing that I found I wanted to dip

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.850 
fun thing that I found I wanted to dip
my<00:00:35.940> toe<00:00:36.000> into<00:00:36.360> speedrunning<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:37.079> guess<00:00:37.260> I've

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
my toe into speedrunning I guess I've

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.020 
my toe into speedrunning I guess I've
watched<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.160> lot<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.370> people<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> think

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
watched a lot of people do it I think

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.540 
watched a lot of people do it I think
it's<00:00:39.210> really<00:00:39.390> cool<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:40.379> frankly<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.399> don't

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
it's really cool but frankly I don't

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.240 
it's really cool but frankly I don't
have<00:00:41.700> enough<00:00:41.940> time<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.329> learn<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:43.190> ton<00:00:44.190> of

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
have enough time to learn a ton of

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.029 
have enough time to learn a ton of
different<00:00:44.730> mechanics<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:46.289> hit<00:00:46.739> my<00:00:46.860> head

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
different mechanics and just hit my head

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.690 
different mechanics and just hit my head
against<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.340> wall<00:00:47.460> I've<00:00:47.789> messed<00:00:48.120> around<00:00:48.300> with

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
against the wall I've messed around with

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.639 
against the wall I've messed around with
Mario<00:00:50.700> games<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> past<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.289> speedrunning

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
Mario games in the past and speedrunning

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.020 
Mario games in the past and speedrunning
them<00:00:54.199> but<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:56.070> don't<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.640> enough<00:00:56.670> time

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
them but I just don't have enough time

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.450 
them but I just don't have enough time
and<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.920> dedication<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.129> takes<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.370> be

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and the dedication that it takes to be

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.209 
and the dedication that it takes to be
really<00:00:59.760> good<00:00:59.879> at<00:00:59.969> speedrunning<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.510> just

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
really good at speedrunning it's just

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.880 
really good at speedrunning it's just
massive<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> thought<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.559> would<00:01:04.769> I

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
massive so I thought that this would I

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.090 
massive so I thought that this would I
found<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:06.260> speedrun<00:01:07.260> that's<00:01:07.530> possible<00:01:07.950> to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
found this speedrun that's possible to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.710 
found this speedrun that's possible to
do<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.640> think<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.090> fun<00:01:09.299> thing<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
do and I think it's just a fun thing to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.010 
do and I think it's just a fun thing to
be<00:01:09.810> able<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.960> do<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.350> show<00:01:10.770> your<00:01:10.950> friends<00:01:11.400> say<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
be able to do to show your friends say I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.810 
be able to do to show your friends say I
bet<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.380> beer<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.340> linked<00:01:14.729> to

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
bet you a beer that I can be linked to

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.740 
bet you a beer that I can be linked to
the<00:01:14.909> Past<00:01:15.090> faster<00:01:15.509> than<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.580> I<00:01:17.750> think

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the Past faster than you and I think

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.350 
the Past faster than you and I think
you'll<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.140> able<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.790> impress<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> few<00:01:21.090> people

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
you'll be able to impress a few people

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.090 
you'll be able to impress a few people
who<00:01:22.170> might<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.350> played<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.740> game<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
who might have played this game in the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.330 
who might have played this game in the
past<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.820> now<00:01:24.619> this<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.680> where<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.040> start<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
past so now this is where we start to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.120 
past so now this is where we start to
get<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.850> little<00:01:27.750> bit<00:01:27.990> trickier<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:29.009> we're

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
get a little bit trickier what we're

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.350 
get a little bit trickier what we're
gonna<00:01:29.220> do<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.549> we're<00:01:29.670> gonna<00:01:29.729> go<00:01:29.939> into<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
gonna do is we're gonna go into the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.700 
gonna do is we're gonna go into the
castle<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.780> we're<00:01:30.900> gonna<00:01:30.990> jump<00:01:31.350> off<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.500> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
castle and we're gonna jump off of a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.800 
castle and we're gonna jump off of a
Ledge<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.909> midair<00:01:33.210> we're<00:01:33.509> gonna<00:01:33.630> hit

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
Ledge and in midair we're gonna hit

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.469 
Ledge and in midair we're gonna hit
select<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.650> we're<00:01:35.070> gonna<00:01:35.159> save<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.000> quit<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
select and we're gonna save and quit and

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.630 
select and we're gonna save and quit and
restart<00:01:36.509> our<00:01:37.470> game<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.829> that's<00:01:37.979> all<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.490> want

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
restart our game and that's all we want

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.950 
restart our game and that's all we want
to<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.820> right<00:01:39.390> at<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.600> point

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
to do right at this point

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.359 
to do right at this point
oooh<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.619> hit<00:01:46.799> right<00:01:46.920> now<00:01:46.979> but

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
oooh so you can get hit right now but

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.859 
oooh so you can get hit right now but
the<00:01:47.460> next<00:01:47.820> time<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.119> come<00:01:48.149> out<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:48.689> you're

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the next time we come out of here you're

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.539 
the next time we come out of here you're
not<00:01:49.079> allowed<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.439> get<00:01:49.530> hit<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:49.979> I'm<00:01:50.430> probably

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
not allowed to get hit so I'm probably

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.889 
not allowed to get hit so I'm probably
gonna<00:01:50.790> take<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> different<00:01:51.270> route<00:01:51.570> just

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
gonna take a different route just

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.460 
gonna take a different route just
because<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.619> don't<00:01:53.430> want<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.880> have<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.540> restart

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
because I don't want to have to restart
