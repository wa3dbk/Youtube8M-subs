00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
before August 4th 2014 after you beat

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.780 
before August 4th 2014 after you beat
the<00:01:03.899> vulture<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.129> like<00:01:05.309> hey<00:01:05.580> that's

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
the vulture it was just like hey that's

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.390 
the vulture it was just like hey that's
about<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.740> think<00:01:07.740> they<00:01:07.830> made<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.040> stage

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
about it I think they made the stage

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.399 
about it I think they made the stage
harder<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:08.939> faster<00:01:09.119> yeah<00:01:09.540> definitely<00:01:10.260> it

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
harder and faster yeah definitely it

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.840 
harder and faster yeah definitely it
didn't<00:01:13.409> add<00:01:13.590> anything<00:01:13.860> new<00:01:14.040> they<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.700> made

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
didn't add anything new they just made

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:28.910 
didn't add anything new they just made
it<00:01:14.880> harder<00:01:26.930> now<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:27.990> already<00:01:28.200> played<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
it harder now we already played the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.670 
it harder now we already played the
power<00:01:29.189> play<00:01:29.579> event<00:01:29.970> which<00:01:30.270> means<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.869> hey<00:01:31.409> we

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
power play event which means that hey we

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.149 
power play event which means that hey we
already<00:01:31.939> fought<00:01:32.939> electro<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.799> course

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
already fought electro but of course

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.910 
already fought electro but of course
this<00:01:35.369> one<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.610> much<00:01:36.090> harder<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.840> don't<00:01:37.560> know<00:01:37.650> why

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
this one is much harder I don't know why

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.690 
this one is much harder I don't know why
but<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.110> think<00:01:40.200> right<00:01:41.040> off<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.460> bat

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
but it just is I think right off the bat

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.649 
but it just is I think right off the bat
at<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.030> beginning<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.540> oh<00:01:42.869> wow<00:01:43.850> ok<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.479> was

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
at the beginning that oh wow ok that was

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.730 
at the beginning that oh wow ok that was
a<00:01:45.689> real<00:01:46.020> shocker<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.750> they<00:01:48.750> added<00:01:48.930> these<00:01:49.259> green

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
a real shocker so they added these green

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.910 
a real shocker so they added these green
things<00:01:50.159> did<00:01:50.939> they<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> new<00:01:52.530> design

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
things did they it's not a new design

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.160 
things did they it's not a new design
they<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.340> change<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.670> color<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.299> these

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
they just change the color and these

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.990 
they just change the color and these
things<00:01:55.470> pop<00:01:55.770> up<00:01:55.979> out<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.189> nowhere<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.969> the
