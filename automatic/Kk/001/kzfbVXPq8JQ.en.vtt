those<00:00:05.230> Brits<00:00:05.620> we've<00:00:05.830> proved<00:00:06.160> a<00:00:06.399> good<00:00:06.580> garden

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:06.970 
those Brits we've proved a good garden

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.430 
those Brits we've proved a good garden
especially<00:00:07.359> when<00:00:07.450> the<00:00:07.540> sun<00:00:07.720> shining<00:00:08.019> which<00:00:08.350> I

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 
especially when the sun shining which I

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.780 
especially when the sun shining which I
know<00:00:08.500> is<00:00:08.710> a<00:00:08.740> very<00:00:08.800> often<00:00:09.309> but<00:00:09.490> when<00:00:09.550> it<00:00:09.700> does

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
know is a very often but when it does

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.730 
know is a very often but when it does
get<00:00:10.269> out<00:00:10.390> in<00:00:10.570> the<00:00:10.660> garden<00:00:10.690> but<00:00:11.290> when<00:00:11.410> you<00:00:11.500> do

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
get out in the garden but when you do

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.680 
get out in the garden but when you do
you<00:00:11.950> find<00:00:11.980> all<00:00:12.340> those<00:00:12.520> little<00:00:12.850> jobs<00:00:13.090> to<00:00:13.210> do<00:00:13.420> and

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
you find all those little jobs to do and

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.120 
you find all those little jobs to do and
the<00:00:14.170> one<00:00:14.260> things<00:00:14.530> has<00:00:14.620> been<00:00:14.650> growing<00:00:15.070> all

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.130 
the one things has been growing all

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.920 
the one things has been growing all
summer<00:00:15.460> are<00:00:16.029> the<00:00:16.090> weeds

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.089 

if<00:00:19.930> there's<00:00:20.169> one<00:00:20.259> weed<00:00:20.470> you<00:00:20.650> don't<00:00:20.859> want<00:00:21.009> in

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099 
if there's one weed you don't want in

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.569 
if there's one weed you don't want in
your<00:00:21.220> garden

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:21.579 
your garden

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:23.099 
your garden
it's<00:00:21.880> bindweed<00:00:22.419> you<00:00:22.599> can<00:00:22.689> see<00:00:22.810> it's<00:00:22.960> pretty

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.109 
it's bindweed you can see it's pretty

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.419 
it's bindweed you can see it's pretty
little<00:00:23.439> flower<00:00:23.679> here<00:00:24.009> but<00:00:24.279> unfortunately

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:24.429 
little flower here but unfortunately

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.999 
little flower here but unfortunately
belongs<00:00:25.240> to<00:00:25.359> a<00:00:25.419> brew<00:00:25.869> to<00:00:26.079> the<00:00:26.169> plants<00:00:26.529> you<00:00:26.859> can

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
belongs to a brew to the plants you can

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.939 
belongs to a brew to the plants you can
also<00:00:27.130> see<00:00:27.400> its<00:00:27.519> leaves<00:00:27.759> on<00:00:28.210> tendrils<00:00:29.019> that

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
also see its leaves on tendrils that

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.679 
also see its leaves on tendrils that
come<00:00:30.189> out<00:00:30.339> and<00:00:30.550> that<00:00:31.029> eventually<00:00:31.359> will

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
come out and that eventually will

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.420 
come out and that eventually will
strangle<00:00:32.320> your<00:00:32.500> plants<00:00:32.800> you<00:00:32.890> can<00:00:33.010> get<00:00:33.130> so

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
strangle your plants you can get so

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.850 
strangle your plants you can get so
heavy<00:00:33.730> it'll<00:00:34.270> drag<00:00:34.450> your<00:00:34.630> rows<00:00:34.780> over<00:00:35.140> now

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
heavy it'll drag your rows over now

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.380 
heavy it'll drag your rows over now
obviously<00:00:36.250> in<00:00:36.310> a<00:00:36.370> situation<00:00:36.940> like<00:00:37.060> this<00:00:37.330> you

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
obviously in a situation like this you

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.970 
obviously in a situation like this you
can't<00:00:37.780> spray<00:00:38.050> because<00:00:38.170> you<00:00:38.320> kill<00:00:38.500> your<00:00:38.650> roses

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
can't spray because you kill your roses

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.400 
can't spray because you kill your roses
the<00:00:39.400> best<00:00:39.580> thing<00:00:39.760> I<00:00:39.910> use<00:00:40.180> is<00:00:40.420> the<00:00:40.810> roundup<00:00:41.170> gel

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
the best thing I use is the roundup gel

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.010 
the best thing I use is the roundup gel
the<00:00:42.070> idea<00:00:42.370> is<00:00:42.520> you<00:00:42.640> just<00:00:42.670> dab<00:00:43.090> it<00:00:43.300> precisely

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
the idea is you just dab it precisely

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.830 
the idea is you just dab it precisely
onto<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.740> weed<00:00:44.920> leaves<00:00:45.360> avoiding<00:00:46.360> obviously

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
onto the weed leaves avoiding obviously

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.480 
onto the weed leaves avoiding obviously
your<00:00:46.960> roses<00:00:47.260> you<00:00:47.380> don't<00:00:47.500> wanna<00:00:47.620> kill<00:00:47.800> them<00:00:47.920> so

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
your roses you don't wanna kill them so

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.280 
your roses you don't wanna kill them so
couple<00:00:48.970> of<00:00:49.090> clicks<00:00:49.300> gets<00:00:49.510> it<00:00:49.630> started<00:00:49.720> and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
couple of clicks gets it started and

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.340 
couple of clicks gets it started and
just<00:00:52.200> make<00:00:53.200> sure<00:00:53.440> you<00:00:54.040> cover<00:00:54.540> as<00:00:55.540> many<00:00:55.870> leaves

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
just make sure you cover as many leaves

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.240 
just make sure you cover as many leaves
as<00:00:56.620> you<00:00:56.710> can<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:58.840> that<00:00:59.080> it's<00:00:59.770> a<00:00:59.890> good<00:01:00.040> idea

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
as you can like that it's a good idea

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.190 
as you can like that it's a good idea
nice<00:01:00.640> little<00:01:00.910> tip<00:01:01.060> is<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.330> try<00:01:01.540> and<00:01:01.780> trace<00:01:02.020> the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
nice little tip is to try and trace the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.950 
nice little tip is to try and trace the
plant<00:01:02.440> back<00:01:02.590> down<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:03.610> soil<00:01:03.910> level<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.390> dab

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
plant back down to soil level and dab

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.480 
plant back down to soil level and dab
the<00:01:05.140> leaves<00:01:05.350> down<00:01:05.650> there<00:01:05.860> because<00:01:05.979> that<00:01:06.280> way

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
the leaves down there because that way

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.580 
the leaves down there because that way
the<00:01:06.880> chemical<00:01:07.360> in<00:01:07.570> roundup<00:01:07.990> will<00:01:08.230> go<00:01:08.350> down

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
the chemical in roundup will go down

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.899 
the chemical in roundup will go down
into<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:09.040> roots<00:01:09.220> and<00:01:09.430> kill<00:01:09.550> it<00:01:09.640> quicker

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
into the roots and kill it quicker

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.640 
into the roots and kill it quicker
because<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.600> great<00:01:10.780> stuff<00:01:10.990> about<00:01:11.200> this<00:01:11.409> is<00:01:11.560> it

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
because the great stuff about this is it

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.440 
because the great stuff about this is it
will<00:01:11.680> kill<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:11.950> whole<00:01:12.220> plant<00:01:12.550> your<00:01:13.060> weed<00:01:13.240> will

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
will kill the whole plant your weed will

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:31.350 
will kill the whole plant your weed will
go<00:01:13.659> leaving<00:01:14.230> your<00:01:14.350> roses<00:01:14.770> untouched

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.750 

down<00:01:31.990> at<00:01:32.140> surface<00:01:32.530> level<00:01:32.560> at<00:01:33.100> soil<00:01:33.340> level<00:01:33.460> you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
down at surface level at soil level you

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.640 
down at surface level at soil level you
can<00:01:33.880> see<00:01:34.150> it<00:01:34.300> scrambling<00:01:34.900> around<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.500> there

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
can see it scrambling around and there

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.040 
can see it scrambling around and there
not<00:01:35.800> only<00:01:35.950> does<00:01:36.220> it<00:01:36.450> routes<00:01:37.450> from<00:01:37.660> each<00:01:37.810> one<00:01:37.990> of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
not only does it routes from each one of

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.200 
not only does it routes from each one of
these<00:01:38.230> little<00:01:38.380> nodes<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:39.220> routes<00:01:39.490> themselves

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
these little nodes the routes themselves

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.760 
these little nodes the routes themselves
go<00:01:40.330> down<00:01:40.510> about<00:01:40.660> five<00:01:40.990> meters<00:01:41.470> you're<00:01:41.650> never

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
go down about five meters you're never

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.540 
go down about five meters you're never
going<00:01:41.920> to<00:01:41.950> dig<00:01:42.100> it<00:01:42.220> out

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
going to dig it out

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.890 
going to dig it out
just<00:01:43.150> use<00:01:43.270> some<00:01:43.300> roundup<00:01:43.930> gel<00:01:44.170> dab<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:45.040> on<00:01:45.190> and

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
just use some roundup gel dab it on and

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.660 
just use some roundup gel dab it on and
because<00:01:46.900> these<00:01:47.560> leaves<00:01:47.860> are<00:01:48.100> closest<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.580> the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
because these leaves are closest to the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.580 
because these leaves are closest to the
roots<00:01:48.880> it'll<00:01:49.210> get<00:01:49.479> that<00:01:49.690> chemical<00:01:50.170> straight

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
roots it'll get that chemical straight

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.050 
roots it'll get that chemical straight
to<00:01:50.740> where<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:51.010> can<00:01:51.130> kill<00:01:51.370> off<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.610> roots<00:01:51.790> and

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
to where it can kill off the roots and

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.470 
to where it can kill off the roots and
get<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.870> sorted<00:01:53.050> for<00:01:53.410> you
