are actually decreasing in rank in the
alphabet<00:01:26.970> you're<00:01:27.509> going<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.900> si<00:01:28.560> SB<00:01:29.549> SC

is<00:01:36.210> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:36.990> good<00:01:37.140> enough<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.680> this

shelf locate and remove your oil cap
it's<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.970> good<00:01:45.119> idea<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.479> set<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:45.930> out<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it's a good idea to set it up out of the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.830 
it's a good idea to set it up out of the
way<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.549> won't<00:01:47.700> bump<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.570> falls

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
way so you won't bump it if it falls

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.120 
way so you won't bump it if it falls
down<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> engine<00:01:49.590> compartment<00:01:49.619> you're

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
down in the engine compartment you're

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.230 
down in the engine compartment you're
gonna<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.460> spend<00:01:50.700> some<00:01:50.820> time<00:01:50.850> looking

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
gonna have to spend some time looking

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.749 
gonna have to spend some time looking
for<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.720> always<00:01:52.290> use<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> funnel<00:01:52.860> I've<00:01:53.430> done

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
for it I always use a funnel I've done

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.880 
for it I always use a funnel I've done
this<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.119> million<00:01:54.600> times<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.470> spilled
