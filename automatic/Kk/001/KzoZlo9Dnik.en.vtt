now obviously if a you want to make a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.060 
now obviously if a you want to make a
double<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.140> put<00:01:37.320> another<00:01:37.530> shot<00:01:37.860> in

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
double then you put another shot in

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.859 
double then you put another shot in
there<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.210> pretty<00:01:39.540> much<00:01:39.630> what

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
there and so on so pretty much what

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.420 
there and so on so pretty much what
you're<00:01:40.049> going<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.590> put<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:40.979> much<00:01:41.159> gin

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
you're going to do is put that much gin

in there and as you can see the ice

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.560 
in there and as you can see the ice
starts<00:01:43.710> melting<00:01:43.970> instantly<00:01:44.970> because<00:01:45.360> that's

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
starts melting instantly because that's

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.179 
starts melting instantly because that's
what<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> gym<00:01:46.049> does<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.500> actually<00:01:46.680> really
