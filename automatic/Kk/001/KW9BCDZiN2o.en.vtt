00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 how to install a printer in order to 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.880
 set the printer across well after that 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.860
 how did you buy it you should go to 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.870
 complete drive 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.059
 if you bought it from someone with it 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.830
 there is no disk there is an option we are now 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.199
 also consider what to do in this case 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.949
 in the first case, everything is just you 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.180
 insert the disc follow the instructions and 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.220
 quietly install your printer 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.460
 problems should not arise 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.029
 but what if you do not have 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.280
 drivers 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:40.430
 This is a more interesting question for me. 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.140
 already prepared go to your browser 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.870
 drive a driver to a printer such 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:52.260
 such and such will be written in Syria 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:57.650
 number and as you can see it already gives out 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.220
 open a few and see here 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.630
 driver tab downloads 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.220
 that is, you are looking for your printer here 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:11.950
 move on 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.950
 let's choose some kind of printer 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:22.480
 suppose i choose laserjet this one 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.480
 cooler for example 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.760
 So 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.760
 choose your printer 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:46.220
 remove your venus where you are 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:50.300
 work press further after that you 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.020
 can you download your driver to 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.370
 computer 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.370
 but as 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.000
 run after the race just find 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:05.180
 setup or where install file it can 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.490
 to be called we have already passed and 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.270
 you just run and continue to follow 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.170

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.170
