00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.140
 hello with you dmitry shumakov 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:11.370
 and in this video I want to show you 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:13.469
 clearly how to mount the capacity let's say 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.560
 so to ensure the stock here is such 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.189
 drinking water that is here you saw from 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.630
 assembly course 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.210
 water supply to the realization that the house 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.900
 who now produce these works 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.570
 all swades 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.470
 with plumbing and sanitary are in 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.219
 new building 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.309
 a and such a problem here that is day 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.260
 all watered and no use 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.469
 pressure in general that is she doesn't even 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.930
 rises to a at night when everyone is asleep 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:48.390
 in the summer there is normally some pressure 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.579
 even the edema itself and little by little goes then 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.890
 There is something to do in this case 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.320
 provide yourself with water to water 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.500
 it is under pressure that is necessary 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.539
 put here such a container 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.809
 cumulative and in which water at night 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.750
 there is one you can safely pump download 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.869
 that is, these pumps are standard even 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.090
 pumps they up to nine meters can water 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.450
 calmly raise the cartoon drop roughly 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.729
 saying here I prayed and still mine when 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.130
 given just even at this level 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.619
 there will be a pump somewhere meter he needs 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:30.350
 raise that is what i did again 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.350
 let's say my labor feats give 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:39.299
 first i dug a hole i mean i pointed 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.119
 600 liter for three people 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.079
 principle, enough up to the rate of 180 liters 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:51.869
 per person per day it will turn out 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.729
 how many there are 560 liters for three t-10 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.299
 a small margin plus another inside will 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.490
 cost storage boiler will return 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.460
 hot water 100 liters to 700 liters 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.049
 principle enough now what i did i 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.420
 dug neomo you see 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.479
 pit dug thirty meter 30 meter 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.840
 but they are established here the shields 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.620
 there is no ground crumbling capacity 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.440
 crushed 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.290
 can also make this bunker out 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.520
 concrete pour reinforce there all like 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.950
 and so on, I certainly thought that 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.310
 here this broth at the place will turn out 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.770
 a little less because he changed his mind 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.050
 bump into the tank just below and how 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.270
 this is usually done but now I see that 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.110
 look into action such a place can be to 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:45.010
 fear of living we will crash like 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:48.910
 laid and so that's what i did i dug 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.820
 this hole somewhere about three hours knife principle 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.420
 Zemke is normally damp to the main 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.959
 ground I did not reach the flow shot here these 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.120
 shields as dawn for them dug something else I 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.630
 I did two bills for this one and 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.100
 this 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:10.480
 screwed here such boards with the calculation 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.430
 precisely other types of accounts and then two 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.320
 these two others these accounts i 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.799
 just put it in here now don't see 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.190
 in the struts as it were, well, you can still 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.380
 about fixing let's say screws or just 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.130
 on the outside sprinkle them then it will press 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.470
 such a box 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.040
 In principle, it is as if such a temporary 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.620
 now the thing is why because I am this 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.780
 I took the tank specifically Monica I need 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.600
 will subsequently for other like 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.160
 the goal and here I will put a good big 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.780
 five cubic capacity and everything is covered here 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.959
 to concrete and that is will return immediately 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.680
 first for concreting then already five 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.510
 I will mount the tank capacity like this 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.850
 right now here this extra sticks out not 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.560
 pay attention jigsaw sawing because 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.080
 well whiten hacksaw 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.980
 and twenty-five millimeter this one 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.670
 products 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.959
 it is unrealistic for labor 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:11.770
 Here let's take a look at the capacity that is 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.730
 normal capacity of the patient it is good to 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.169
 outer layer of copper which protective 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.190
 ultraviolet is not even afraid of internal 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:23.260
 layer white here in my opinion it is also 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:28.389
 special smooth enough 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.060
 there is a clean sterile that's just 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.770
 here I do the cap and 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.580
 You can winter you foam will 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:41.530
 still obzorchik give insulate foam and 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:46.120
 everything seems to pass without problems and so on 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:50.590
 some of this you see let's say a 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.479
 body can be considered small on frag 10 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.250
 15 millimeters so that 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:05:00.490
 provide drainage is not accumulated 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.580
 that is, in principle, let's say this 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.770
 the idea shook this tank 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.320
 let's finish this video and in 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.400
 next we take the scheme 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.419
 about turning off this particular tank 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.580
 let's see what you need for this 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.900
 hardware what fittings are needed 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.620
 how to connect this whole thing 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:25.259
 and in the next video we will see clearly 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.080
 how to do it all practically that is 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.960
 how to cut a hole correctly how 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.690
 put exactly as here with that 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.020
 equipment you bought and on this 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:40.430
 video finish with you was Dmitry Shmakov
