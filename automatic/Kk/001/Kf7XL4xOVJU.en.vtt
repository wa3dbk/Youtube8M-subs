00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
has that feature which is one of the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.340 
has that feature which is one of the
reasons<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.400> bought<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.110> said<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
reasons I bought it but like I said I

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.810 
reasons I bought it but like I said I
don't<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.130> charge<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
don't like that I have to charge it up a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.300 
don't like that I have to charge it up a
see<00:01:24.330> here's<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.900> input<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:26.040> charging<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.840> and

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
see here's the input for charging it and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.080 
see here's the input for charging it and
then<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.700> your<00:01:29.729> power<00:01:30.030> button

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
then you just have your power button

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.580 
then you just have your power button
here<00:01:32.150> so<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.299> comes<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.720> little<00:01:34.110> little

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
here so it comes with little little

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.469 
here so it comes with little little
cords<00:01:34.979> here<00:01:35.250> everything<00:01:35.939> fits<00:01:36.119> into<00:01:36.360> this

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
cords here everything fits into this

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.539 
cords here everything fits into this
little<00:01:36.689> bag<00:01:36.900> including<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> AC<00:01:37.740> plug<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.400> it's

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
little bag including the AC plug so it's

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.880
