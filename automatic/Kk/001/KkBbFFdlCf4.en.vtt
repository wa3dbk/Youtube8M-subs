00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
with his fighting not you know maybe get

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.610 
with his fighting not you know maybe get
some<00:05:33.440> more<00:05:33.789> experience<00:05:34.789> in<00:05:34.970> there<00:05:35.180> maybe<00:05:35.840> not

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
some more experience in there maybe not

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.980 
some more experience in there maybe not
the<00:05:36.740> elite<00:05:37.400> fighters<00:05:37.970> but<00:05:38.330> then<00:05:38.510> again<00:05:38.600> maybe

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
the elite fighters but then again maybe

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.740 
the elite fighters but then again maybe

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
maybe he can keep away from him enough

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.760 
maybe he can keep away from him enough
and<00:05:46.820> keep<00:05:47.030> the<00:05:47.150> pressure<00:05:47.360> off<00:05:47.540> of<00:05:47.900> him<00:05:48.050> you
