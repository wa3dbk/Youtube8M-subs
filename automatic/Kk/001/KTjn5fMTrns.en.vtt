00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
the purpose of learning it start off

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.960 
the purpose of learning it start off
slower<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:45.290> you<00:00:46.070> can<00:00:46.220> work<00:00:46.400> your<00:00:46.430> way<00:00:46.730> up<00:00:46.760> to

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
slower and you can work your way up to

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.360 
slower and you can work your way up to
get<00:00:47.269> to<00:00:47.750> play<00:00:48.230> it<00:00:48.320> faster<00:00:48.800> once<00:00:48.980> you<00:00:49.100> become

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
get to play it faster once you become

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.060 
get to play it faster once you become
more<00:00:49.519> comfortable<00:00:49.730> with<00:00:50.089> the<00:00:50.239> strumming<00:00:51.110> so

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
more comfortable with the strumming so

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.890 
more comfortable with the strumming so
basically<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:52.790> strumming<00:00:53.210> is<00:00:53.300> like<00:00:53.449> this<00:00:53.659> or

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
basically the strumming is like this or

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:05.299 
basically the strumming is like this or
the<00:00:54.019> picking

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.730 

you<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.149> that<00:01:06.479> way<00:01:06.509> or<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.409> start

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
you can do it that way or you can start

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:32.910 
you can do it that way or you can start
try<00:01:08.399> that<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:08.939> use<00:01:09.149> it<00:01:09.360> using<00:01:09.689> an<00:01:09.810> upstroke

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.010 

so<00:01:33.920> basically<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.520> song<00:01:34.760> goes<00:01:35.060> kind<00:01:35.690> of<00:01:35.810> like

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
so basically the song goes kind of like

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.960 
so basically the song goes kind of like
this<00:01:36.350> when<00:01:36.980> you<00:01:37.070> put<00:01:37.220> it<00:01:37.340> together<00:01:37.490> I<00:01:39.610> hear<00:01:40.610> the
