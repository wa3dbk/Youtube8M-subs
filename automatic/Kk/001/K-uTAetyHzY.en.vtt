00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hi guys only alexandre lopes from the board 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.640
 race awareness and the article that 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.589
 people going to talk today have the following 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.260
 title use of compression stockings 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.719
 during a marathon to reduce injury 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.469
 exercise-induced muscle two 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.960
 points 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.789
 they are really useful this article was 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.890
 published in the journal of orthopedics and 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.890
 physiotherapy sports society 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.970
 American Academy of Physiotherapy in 2015 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.970
 Spanish researchers 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.180
 this article was published by 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.460
 researchers from the area of 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.710
 physiology what is a little different 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.040
 of subjects related to the journal of 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.000
 physiotherapy but because this article 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.940
 Physiology is inside a magazine 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.430
 apparently from injuries and 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:51.420
 physiotherapy because it addresses as a 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.860
 pain goals if this sock can 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.780
 really decrease the pain 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.940
 before starting the introduction is worth 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.579
 emphasize as the authors themselves 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.680
 quoted that this study has a 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.259
 conflict of interest because it was 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.150
 partially supported by a mark of 6 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.110
 called medi-las ti that is a brand 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.700
 Spanish 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.190
 the authors begin by saying the following 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.390
 that the sock has been widely used in 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.360
 racing universe 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.100
 generally the 6 has the following objective 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.380
 until then of being used in the universe 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.570
 of the race it was used and until then 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.850
 is widely used for the purpose of 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.270
 improve the venous return reduce the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.050
 edema decreased clot formation 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.630
 especially for patients with 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.670
 venous insufficiency we can see that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.280
 this is the main goal of the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.320
 compression of elastic stockings until then 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.350
 but the race universe has brought 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.140
 this sock for several runners 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.729
 they further assert that manufacturers 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.190
 have said that these same they 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.610
 can attorney increase performance 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.100
 due to increased venous return 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.840
 however there is no scientific evidence 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.600
 prove that promise 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.400
 the authors also mention the introduction to 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.479
 compression stockings can still 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.610
 reduce muscle vibration that could 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.190
 decrease muscle damage 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.090
 some authors state that even 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.640
 with pressure can reduce the sensation 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.190
 subjective definition of pain also stated as 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.260
 one of the possible explanations of why 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.090
 I use half a run 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.310
 other studies have already investigated 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.410
 effects of the compression stocking 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.000
 my understanding of performance 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.799
 with the tests being conducted in 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.570
 distances not exceeding 15 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.380
 kilometers speaking in an environment of 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.900
 running 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.360
 there is only one study done during 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.580
 a competition in the environment let's say 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.350
 a real situation, but this study was 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.630
 done in the middle was one that is 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.430
 triathlon is very different from a race 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.620
 who has swimming has an environment 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.150
 which may interfere as well as 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.730
 the bike that is absolutely 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.320
 different the effect of running only you 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.350
 run a pedal swim 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.960
 therefore the authors propose to do 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.050
 the following study therefore objective 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.360
 investigate possible benefits of 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.910
 use compression stockings on the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.640
 performance and injury prevention 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.740
 muscular that a test that a race 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.690
 usually produces in case they did 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.140
 during a marathon we go to the methods 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:20.250
 how was this study done two groups 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.060
 with 17 runners 15 men and two 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.130
 women 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.650
 thirty-four runners in total 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.830
 were verified the characteristics 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.440
 anthropometric performance and 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.860
 participants' experience 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.570
 they used the group that used 6 to 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.730
 the two groups used half 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.340
 only used a conventional stocking and the 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.380
 other compressive half to compressive 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.990
 had the following brand characteristic 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.470
 How did you hear about the manufacturer? 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.550
 sport and the model is the model mrg 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.140
 fernandinho 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:58.980
 the composition of this 6 77% polyamide 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:02.130
 13% elastane and 10% polyester 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.000
 this stocking is up to the knee causing 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.310
 a progressive compression or whether 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.680
 had a greater compression in the foot and 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.320
 ankle and she was decreasing 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.540
 knee- level compression 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.450
 the control group in return 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.609
 used a conventional stocking 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.020
 basically of cotton and nylon only in 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.480
 ankle height 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.870
 two weeks before the runners 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.700
 will receive the socks to get accustomed and 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.860
 they had to perform at least three 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.440
 training sessions there was a concern 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.940
 adaptation of the sock not only 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.810
 during the marathon that they would 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:43.410
 48 hours before the race was 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.100
 made a blood sample of 7 ml of 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.920
 blood 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.410
 besides the measurement of the leg volume of the 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.750
 participants and jumps were made 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.040
 vertical on the platform these measures 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.320
 have the logical goal the mind t 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.820
 the baseline measures the girls 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.420
 they initials 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.420
 the event that the participants ran 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.740
 marathon rock'n'roll marathon of madrid 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.630
 in 2013 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.390
 The start was good at 9 am 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:14.110
 morning at room temperature that day 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:17.140
 was 8 degrees celsius with 68% of 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.330
 unit after completion of the marathon in 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.100
 interval of three minutes some things 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.830
 should necessarily happen for 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.720
 body weight was measured and 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.480
 should avoid drinking water in this 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.760
 interval of three minutes after the end 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.550
 performing 12 vertical cars was 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.430
 checked the leg volume and after 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.800
 five minutes a sam show was made 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.080
 was withdrawn but again a sample 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.840
 was done was applied a 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.940
 the subjective effort scale for 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.520
 check how much they as he was 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.950
 that time at the end of the marathon and 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.960
 a pain scale was applied and 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.240
 muscle discomfort what is the level of 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:59.320
 discomfort that is from 0 to 10 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.840
 all filled this in after 24 hours of 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.090
 the day following the conclusion of the 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.700
 marathon again was applied a new 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.730
 pain scale of 0 to 10 on the 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.350
 muscle discomfort that usually 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.390
 say that the vast majority of people 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.340
 tourists enter the next day at a 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.020
 discomfort a muscle ache in some 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.360
 region in many regions 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:23.230
 and that of this discomfort was measured and 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.990
 again on this 24 after a new collection 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.540
 Blood was made the results 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.030
 performance was compared between the two groups 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.040
 the performance was not different from the group 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.380
 that the man is conventional and the group 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.950
 who used the 6 with pain compression 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:42.340
 also had very good results. 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:44.890
 like all blood tests 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.180
 the six analyzes also had 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.430
 similar results 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.430
 the serum concentration of 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.450
 lesion were also similar conclusion 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.210
 of the study 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:58.300
 there is no difference between the groups 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:01.360
 performance of pain sensation and 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.380
 serum concentrations and markers 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.660
 blood 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.970
 Here we can make a brief 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.150
 comment saying that until then this is 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.710
 one 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.750
 everything logically has another being 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.600
 conducted but perhaps the first study 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:16.390
 which verifies the use of sock in a situation 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.090
 and not from a laboratory during a 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:21.160
 marathon test and where it was where 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.990
 it was possible to show with a series of 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.540
 blood tests including 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.940
 performance including vertical jumps 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.400
 verifying that there was no performance 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:33.160
 so we can say that so far 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:36.190
 we have no evidence to justify the use 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.260
 of a half compressive in marathon runners 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.990
 Good this is if you liked our video 

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:43.560
 let one like and so our channel until the 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.560
 next
