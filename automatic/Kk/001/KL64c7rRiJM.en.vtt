bit more there you go so you guys should

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.130 
bit more there you go so you guys should
be<00:01:23.909> able<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> time<00:01:24.479> there<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.020> you'll

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
be able to see the time there but you'll

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
be able to see the time there but you'll
notice<00:01:25.350> there's<00:01:25.619> no<00:01:25.770> icons<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.430> here<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.790> I

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
notice there's no icons on here but if I

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.100 
notice there's no icons on here but if I
hover<00:01:27.060> over<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.630> actually<00:01:27.750> see<00:01:27.960> at<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
hover over I can actually see at the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.960 
hover over I can actually see at the
same<00:01:28.290> icons<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.890> would<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.070> my<00:01:29.220> taskbar<00:01:29.640> or

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
same icons that would be my taskbar or

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.999 
same icons that would be my taskbar or
crate<00:01:30.240> menu<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.990> there's<00:01:31.170> some<00:01:31.409> bugs<00:01:31.650> here<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
crate menu so there's some bugs here and

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.460 
crate menu so there's some bugs here and
then<00:01:32.100> again<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.430> open-source<00:01:32.670> software<00:01:33.470> but

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
then again it's open-source software but

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.980 
then again it's open-source software but
it<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> most<00:01:35.759> part<00:01:35.880> matches<00:01:36.420> nicely<00:01:36.570> with

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
it for the most part matches nicely with

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.569 
it for the most part matches nicely with
the<00:01:37.170> Windows<00:01:37.470> seven<00:01:37.770> theme<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.159> think<00:01:38.400> for

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
the Windows seven theme and I think for

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.190 
the Windows seven theme and I think for
the<00:01:38.640> most<00:01:38.790> part<00:01:38.880> will<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.689> color<00:01:39.930> will<00:01:40.110> stay

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the most part will the color will stay

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.440 
the most part will the color will stay
about<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.470> same<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.729> really<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.150> it

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
about the same and it really just it

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.910 
about the same and it really just it
allows<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.140> maximize<00:01:43.350> minimize

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
allows you to maximize minimize

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.520 
allows you to maximize minimize
applications<00:01:44.850> certain<00:01:45.270> monitors<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:45.960> you

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
applications certain monitors so you

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.080 
applications certain monitors so you
know<00:01:46.649> if<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.189> chrome<00:01:47.520> window<00:01:47.790> over

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
know if I have this chrome window over

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.929 
know if I have this chrome window over
here<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.540> minimize<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.320> monitor

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
here I can minimize it to this monitor

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.490 
here I can minimize it to this monitor
so<00:01:50.939> you'll<00:01:51.090> go<00:01:51.360> down<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.110> then<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.320> can

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
so you'll go down here and then I can

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.620 
so you'll go down here and then I can
obviously<00:01:52.890> open<00:01:53.430> up<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:53.909> rather<00:01:54.149> than<00:01:54.420> it

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
obviously open up here rather than it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.230 
obviously open up here rather than it
being<00:01:55.130> overall<00:01:56.130> my<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.549> know<00:01:56.640> having<00:01:57.000> all<00:01:57.119> of

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
being overall my you know having all of

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.270 
being overall my you know having all of
a<00:01:57.299> go<00:01:57.509> go<00:01:57.930> all<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> way<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.619> first<00:01:58.799> monitor

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
a go go all the way to the first monitor

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.620 
a go go all the way to the first monitor
click<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.820> and<00:01:59.939> open<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.420> know<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
click it and open it you know it's a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.090 
click it and open it you know it's a
hassle<00:02:00.780> especially<00:02:01.469> if<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.619> lot<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.860> windows

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
hassle especially if a lot of windows

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.280 
hassle especially if a lot of windows
open<00:02:02.189> they<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.549> get<00:02:02.640> kind<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.850> crowded<00:02:03.290> so

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
open they can get kind of crowded so

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.969 
open they can get kind of crowded so
that<00:02:04.710> case<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.159> know<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.909> easier<00:02:06.630> to

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
that case you know if it's easier to

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.859 
that case you know if it's easier to
lock<00:02:07.979> one<00:02:08.310> window<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:09.030> certain<00:02:09.390> monitor<00:02:09.780> in

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
lock one window to a certain monitor in

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.320 
lock one window to a certain monitor in
the<00:02:09.959> sense<00:02:10.200> now<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.580> can<00:02:11.670> also<00:02:11.790> open<00:02:12.180> the

the sense now that you can also open the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.559 
the sense now that you can also open the

see<00:02:27.849> kind<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.150> flips<00:02:28.359> up<00:02:28.540> when<00:02:28.719> I<00:02:28.780> apply<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.590> you

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
see kind of flips up when I apply it you

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.770 
see kind of flips up when I apply it you
can<00:02:30.219> use<00:02:30.310> small<00:02:30.579> icons<00:02:31.000> auto<00:02:31.329> hide<00:02:31.629> the

can use small icons auto hide the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.509 
can use small icons auto hide the
taskbar<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.680> it's<00:02:32.889> like<00:02:33.010> that<00:02:33.159> feature<00:02:33.370> you

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
taskbar so it's like that feature you

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.789 
taskbar so it's like that feature you
don't<00:02:33.730> want<00:02:33.969> to<00:02:34.060> kind<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.269> disappear<00:02:34.689> and<00:02:34.900> then

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
don't want to kind of disappear and then

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.740 
don't want to kind of disappear and then
hover<00:02:36.129> over<00:02:36.310> went<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.730> pop<00:02:36.939> over<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.329> networks

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
hover over went to pop over it networks

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.220 
hover over went to pop over it networks
to<00:02:38.730> see<00:02:39.730> here<00:02:39.939> you<00:02:40.060> show<00:02:40.389> notification<00:02:41.019> area

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
to see here you show notification area

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.110 
to see here you show notification area
you<00:02:41.379> can<00:02:41.500> change<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.280> location<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.879> it<00:02:42.999> so

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
you can change the location of it so

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.520 
you can change the location of it so
just<00:02:43.299> like<00:02:43.389> a<00:02:43.450> regular<00:02:43.510> taskbar<00:02:44.109> you<00:02:44.290> can<00:02:44.409> move

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
just like a regular taskbar you can move

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.619 
just like a regular taskbar you can move
around<00:02:44.620> um<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.700> can<00:02:45.849> automatically<00:02:46.480> have<00:02:46.599> to

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
around um you can automatically have to

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.270 
around um you can automatically have to
start<00:02:47.049> with<00:02:47.200> Windows<00:02:47.379> obviously<00:02:48.069> that<00:02:48.159> would

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
start with Windows obviously that would

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.220 
start with Windows obviously that would
