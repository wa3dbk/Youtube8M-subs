 volkswagen of brazil inaugurated the new 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.060
 painting of the taubate factory in 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.609
 ceremony attended by the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.400
 president of the volkswagen group teacher 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.400

 from volkswagen from brazil thomas schmall e 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.689
 of 100 other executives and employees 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.870
 the painting of the factory in taubaté 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.239
 sets new standards of technology and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.890
 environmental protection and becomes 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.770
 reference in the auto industry

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.930
 with an investment of 427.8 million 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.910
 real 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.899
 aligned with the overall strategy of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.050
 volkswagen 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.640
 the new painting of the taubaté unit 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.280
 ecologically and has the highest 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.589
 technology with equipment and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.560
 innovative processes in favor of protection 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.480
 in all its stages 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.700
 using the full capacity of the 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.320
 facilities of the factory producing the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.060
 new goal and voyage 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.870
 the new painting will expand the capacity 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.890
 production from around 1,000 to 1,300 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.890
 vehicles per day 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.120
 comparing with the conventional process 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.730
 the innovations of the new painting reduce 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.730
 energy consumption by 30 per cent and 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.790
 water by 20% per vehicle produced 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.490
 the painting is 100% automated with the use 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.400
 of robots eliminating ink layer 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.460
 primer and saves energy drying 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.130
 more efficient than 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.760
 exhaust air from the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.610
 Robotic cabins allow for cleaning 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.430
 Dry electrostatic and used 80% 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.130
 air that would be discarded or save 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.230
 that would be spent on heating or 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.890
 cool the air entering the cabin 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.390

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.060
 The installation also 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.380
 body transporter unprecedented in the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.170
 South America 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.690
 the 360 degree swivel in the baths of the 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.910
 the initial paint process eliminates 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.610
 air bubbles and improves protection 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.500
 corrosion and the quality of the product 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.590
 to ensure the quality of the 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.390
 end before applying the enamel robots 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.060
 clean the body with brushes 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.040
 this process is shown 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.380
 also comes from the use of paint 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.020
 water base that has the minimum of 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.790
 solvents in their composition in addition to 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.980
 use of equipment of high 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.980
 efficiency and low energy consumption 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.000
 the new painting of the taubate factory was 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.030
 designed with the aid of the factory 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.959
 digital few wander simulated software 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.880
 in 3d 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.550
 the constructions of the units in their 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.010
 productive processes which allowed the 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.440
 agility of the process and analysis of 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.510
 possible interference of the work that 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.090
 innovative tool also simulated the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.670
 production flow and all work was 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.850
 implemented in partnership with the 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.850
 Germany 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.950
 another innovation is the German gabi software 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.530
 which fully assesses a new 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.470
 installation of an industrial process for 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.880
 minimize environmental impacts 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.580
 partnership between the Volkswagen Group and 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.470
 international company gabi 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.959
 calculates what the potential impacts are 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.360
 the environment as the consumption of 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.880
 natural resources and waste emissions 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.650
 and points out the more 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.650
 appropriate in ecological terms 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:49.640
 if the harvest is good, very good 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.830
 if everything works right nothing at all 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.060
 it works 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.060
 the unexpected moments 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.750
 the storms that have debts if the 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.629
 back to sea 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.909
 if the world turned upside down 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:08.090
 one thing can be sure 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.670
 I will always be with you the new 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.560

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.489
