 matchstick matches you do that then 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:49.360
 I have a small gesture like that I get up 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.320
 it does not take off hockey and it does not stick and 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.969
 all his matches 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.399
 we will connect them to a plate of 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.410

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.239

 crispy well chosen you are you see 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.530
 this rule we match his liver 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.420
 so what can we prepare for 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.100
 the moment is listening we will prepare the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.840
 cubes his death and then we take a 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.670
 tray of his death and we open 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.229
 delicately because I like 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.659
 during his death and you see is that these 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.080
 slices to bhl what is it enough 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.020
 farm town is both it stays super 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.880
 month would do you see it brought to 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.520
 the freshness of the treats wages 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.009
 well melting too it's off thoroughly 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:34.540
 in and we'll put cream 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:38.460
 fresh and milk so that it can 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.460
 enter the siphon and beat the mixer 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.360
 there is great contention is really 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.439
 nickel we will pay him delicately 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.190
 it may be the most complicated of the 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:57.869
 recipe in a siphon okay that's it 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.770
 our siphon baldness regard is what 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.360
 is important what the trimmings 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.180
 three quarters of agreement during this 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:08.489
 weekend we do it and here we go 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.520
 put two gas cartridges there 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.520
 first named him a first 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:24.030
 a first time by a mixture well 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:26.100
 homogeneous and those are not the same 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.810
 problem be low fridge and go 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.739
 better apply a little bit the cold one 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.350

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.280
 we'll just cut into four is reached 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.569
 and we beat them we just removed the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.010
 skin we soaked a few seconds 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.470
 in boiling water and salt tankers 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.510

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.350
 peppers agree for it to be fine 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.660
 my readings it's important to hear 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.680

 it must be very very friendly to 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.630
 not to mix you see to have 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.890

 with that we're going to put on we're going to be dotted very 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.790
 delicately it's perfect but 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.350
