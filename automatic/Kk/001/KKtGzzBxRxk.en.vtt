00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.210
 to go for your car quickly 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.210
 running 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.770
 Y 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.140
 while for the car we are going to do 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.170
 some little things 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.809
 is going to tell us something, sometimes not 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.220
 they can not sell it but if they do not 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.229
 can sell from lost what can 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.659
 duplicate because I could not sell it such 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.630
 once as why not because I did it 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.790
 times past and I could sell it but 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.710
 first I put it in my garage 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.120
 so if you can not sell it go 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.000
 feeding the gas and I'm going to it 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.770
 to sell and as you will see it says ay 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.220
 doubled but can not give it now what 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.890
 let's see next to me 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.700
 they are removing the car from that now I 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.700
 I'm going to park there 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.900
 I'm not going to park there at that moment 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:42.500
 a friend is going to hit me when I hit 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:45.380
 to the xbox store alone while 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.450
 tends to xbox quickly we set 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.430
 that if as soon as we arrive and my friend 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.000
 you are going to invite me 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.350
 the invitation right now the game is in 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.350
 As we enter, we accept it 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.009
 and will send us to the same game another 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.990
 Again, let's hope we try it 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.299
 that yes and now we wait a little bit for a 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.330
 little bit a project, let's go 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:16.800
 going down with little god for short 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.800
 world of gta cinquito to see let's see 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.930
 already being here to me it will seem to me that 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.700
 my car is on the other side and they all 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.220
 they will have the lane 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.959
 in this I go for my car he too 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.590
 I like to give a raite because he is a 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.590
 cabbie 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.180
 and we're already going for our car the most 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.670
 fast possible 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.890
 and it's all if they want to duplicate it 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.989
 do that if you want to sell do 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.689
 this go and kill the hours and then 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.219
 take it out and then sell well if you can 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.659
 sell because if they do like that I do not know no 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:51.090
 they will be able to sell it good for 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.620
 program them I can not if that's the same 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.599
 that I will not be able to subscribe 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.599
