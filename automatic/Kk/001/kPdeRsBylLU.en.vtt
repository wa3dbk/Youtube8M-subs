00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.760
 for muscle contraction needed 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.540
 energy it is formed in the process 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.679
 cellular respiration which occurs 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.470
 mitochondria of muscle fibers 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.260
 this process is to extract 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.400
 energy with glucose splitting 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.779
 amino acids and fatty acids and 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.580
 formation of high-energy bonds 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.960
 the energy of these bonds is spent on 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.480
 muscle contraction 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.420
 oxygen that is delivered to the muscles with 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.430
 blood bound to red myoglobin 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.160
 pigment in structure similar to 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.450
 hemoglobin at rest and during normal 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.790
 physical exertion 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.579
 muscle gets enough 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.800
 oxygen however if not trained 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.829
 muscles work in very intensively then 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.230
 oxygen is not enough 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.079
 as a result, muscle cells move onto 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.120
 bis oxygen metabolism path 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.640
 glycolysis at which is formed in many 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.300
 times less atf than during cell 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.189
 respiration that is from the national metabolism 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.439
 the end product of glycolysis is 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.210
 lactic acid each of us 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.700
 ever experienced muscle pain 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.770
 after a lot of exercise it 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.460
 pain is due to the accumulation of breast 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.460
 acids
