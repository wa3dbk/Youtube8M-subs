balls<00:02:20.280> gonna<00:02:20.489> land

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
balls gonna land

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.870 
balls gonna land
now<00:02:22.140> let's<00:02:22.350> move<00:02:22.440> on<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.650> conversion<00:02:23.400> all

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
now let's move on to conversion all

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.099 
now let's move on to conversion all
right<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.120> can<00:02:24.269> see<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.690> defending

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
right you can see that the defending

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.270 
right you can see that the defending
players<00:02:25.319> are<00:02:25.470> under<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.709> poles<00:02:25.920> should<00:02:26.130> just

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
players are under the poles should just

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.680 
players are under the poles should just
under<00:02:26.549> try<00:02:26.760> there's<00:02:27.000> gonna<00:02:27.090> be<00:02:27.209> no<00:02:27.329> charging

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
under try there's gonna be no charging

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.319 
under try there's gonna be no charging
in<00:02:27.780> game<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.350> left<00:02:28.530> side<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.370> see<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
ps4 on the left one it's gonna be up

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.840 
ps4 on the left one it's gonna be up
down<00:02:34.170> left<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.440> right<00:02:34.530> where<00:02:35.310> you're<00:02:35.459> going

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
down left and right where you're going

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.729 
down left and right where you're going
the<00:02:36.120> aim<00:02:36.359> in<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.600> conversion<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.260> depending

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
the aim in the conversion and depending

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.069 
the aim in the conversion and depending
on<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:37.950> wind<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.310> right<00:02:38.790> one<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.269> think<00:02:39.630> is

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
on the wind the right one is I think is

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.599 
on the wind the right one is I think is
you're<00:02:40.410> going<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.889> pull<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.220> back<00:02:41.400> and

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
you're going to have to pull it back and

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.449 
you're going to have to pull it back and
move<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:41.970> forward<00:02:42.799> for<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:43.889> conversion<00:02:44.160> and

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
move it forward for the conversion and

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.940 
move it forward for the conversion and
the<00:02:45.030> straighter<00:02:45.329> you<00:02:45.420> are<00:02:45.660> just<00:02:46.290> regular<00:02:46.470> you

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
the straighter you are just regular you

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.039 
the straighter you are just regular you
pull<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.459> stick<00:02:47.700> back<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.120> forward<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
pull the stick back and forward is the

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.740 
pull the stick back and forward is the
better<00:02:49.260> power<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.370> accurate<00:02:50.760> see<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.600> your

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
better power and accurate see of your

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.910 
better power and accurate see of your
kick<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.079> also<00:02:52.260> want<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.500> point<00:02:52.650> out<00:02:52.739> the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
kick I also want to point out the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.199 
kick I also want to point out the
distance<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.430> goal<00:02:53.579> in<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.880> Kenya<00:02:54.120> on<00:02:54.180> the

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
distance the goal in the Kenya on the

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.819 
distance the goal in the Kenya on the
top<00:02:54.450> right<00:02:54.630> hand<00:02:54.750> corner<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:55.139> the<00:02:55.290> screen<00:02:55.500> shot

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
top right hand corner of the screen shot

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.370 
top right hand corner of the screen shot
you<00:02:56.040> can<00:02:56.310> see<00:02:56.459> that's<00:02:56.720> 37<00:02:57.720> meters<00:02:58.019> out<00:02:58.230> and

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
you can see that's 37 meters out and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.930 
you can see that's 37 meters out and
this<00:02:58.739> is<00:02:58.859> going<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.100> be<00:02:59.190> here<00:02:59.400> for<00:02:59.700> the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
this is going to be here for the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.030 
this is going to be here for the
conversion<00:03:00.359> which<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.510> good<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.019> it's<00:03:01.769> very

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
conversion which is good and it's very

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.620 
conversion which is good and it's very
interesting<00:03:02.280> depending<00:03:02.910> on<00:03:02.970> path<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.450> also

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
interesting depending on path I also

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.479 
interesting depending on path I also
know<00:03:03.900> talk<00:03:04.230> about<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.440> background<00:03:04.859> you<00:03:05.340> can

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
know talk about the background you can

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.420 
know talk about the background you can
see<00:03:05.519> that<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:06.060> audience<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.750> very<00:03:06.870> pixelated

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
see that the audience is very pixelated

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.340 
see that the audience is very pixelated
but<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.609> stadium<00:03:09.000> looks<00:03:09.180> ok<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:10.049> can<00:03:10.200> see

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
but the stadium looks ok you can see

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.930 
but the stadium looks ok you can see
that<00:03:10.530> there's<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:10.739> chill<00:03:11.010> pill<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.400> hogging<00:03:11.819> it

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
that there's a chill pill is hogging it

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.849 
that there's a chill pill is hogging it
up<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.600> small<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:13.019> attention<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.500> detail

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
up the small of attention to detail

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.080 
up the small of attention to detail
there<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.069> can<00:03:14.190> also<00:03:14.340> see<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.639> trees<00:03:14.880> in<00:03:15.030> the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
there you can also see the trees in the

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.759 
there you can also see the trees in the
background<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.600> some<00:03:16.049> houses<00:03:16.379> in<00:03:16.709> the

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
background and some houses in the

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:17.720 
background and some houses in the
background<00:03:16.799> as<00:03:17.250> well<00:03:17.280> if<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:17.549> look<00:03:17.700> very

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
background as well if you look very

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.670 
background as well if you look very
strong<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.569> can<00:03:18.689> also<00:03:18.840> see<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.049> security<00:03:19.409> guy

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
strong you can also see a security guy

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.110 
strong you can also see a security guy
on<00:03:19.890> corner<00:03:20.189> post<00:03:20.370> so

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
on corner post so

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.940 
on corner post so
very<00:03:21.420> cool<00:03:21.659> now<00:03:21.959> have<00:03:22.379> a<00:03:22.409> look<00:03:22.530> at<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.769> bar

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
very cool now have a look at the bar

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.289 
very cool now have a look at the bar
slowly<00:03:23.370> on<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.610> right<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.849> can<00:03:23.970> see<00:03:24.120> that

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
slowly on the right you can see that

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.670 
slowly on the right you can see that
it's<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.569> straight<00:03:24.870> there's<00:03:25.230> almost<00:03:25.440> a

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
it's a straight there's almost a

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.199 
it's a straight there's almost a
straight<00:03:25.890> line<00:03:26.040> then<00:03:26.459> this<00:03:26.610> way<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:26.819> think<00:03:26.940> it's

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
straight line then this way I think it's

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.479 
straight line then this way I think it's
gonna<00:03:27.330> be<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.540> follow-through<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.489> the

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
gonna be the follow-through and the

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.280 
gonna be the follow-through and the
right<00:03:29.640> analog<00:03:29.909> stick<00:03:30.030> for<00:03:30.390> taking<00:03:30.629> a<00:03:30.690> kick<00:03:30.930> you

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
right analog stick for taking a kick you

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.140 
right analog stick for taking a kick you
can<00:03:31.530> also<00:03:31.709> see<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.190> slight<00:03:32.519> wind<00:03:32.909> that

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
can also see that the slight wind that

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.630 
can also see that the slight wind that
has<00:03:33.360> an<00:03:33.569> effect<00:03:33.900> on<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.080> ball<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:34.980> that's<00:03:35.280> the

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
has an effect on the ball so that's the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.390 
has an effect on the ball so that's the
conversion<00:03:35.909> for<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.920> let's<00:03:37.920> move<00:03:38.069> on<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.250> the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
conversion for you let's move on to the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.740 
conversion for you let's move on to the
rack<00:03:38.579> it's<00:03:38.940> confirmed<00:03:39.420> that<00:03:39.480> there's<00:03:39.659> going

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
rack it's confirmed that there's going

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.210 
rack it's confirmed that there's going
to<00:03:39.810> be<00:03:39.870> three<00:03:40.079> players<00:03:40.319> from<00:03:40.409> my<00:03:40.590> team<00:03:41.010> in<00:03:41.129> the
