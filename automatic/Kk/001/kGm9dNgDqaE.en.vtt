paint with the fill color of the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.080 
paint with the fill color of the
foreground<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.739> really<00:00:38.070> not<00:00:38.190> blending<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
existing image so I'll undo that but

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.510 
existing image so I'll undo that but
eath<00:00:42.719> better<00:00:43.110> than<00:00:43.320> choosing<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.950> foreground

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
eath better than choosing a foreground

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
a while to experiment with these to

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.120 
a while to experiment with these to
really<00:02:00.540> see<00:02:00.689> what's<00:02:00.869> going<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.530> they<00:02:01.950> even

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
really see what's going on and they even

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.370 
really see what's going on and they even
have<00:02:02.399> presets<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.090> are<00:02:03.210> saved<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.110> can

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
have presets that are saved so you can

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.190 
have presets that are saved so you can
choose<00:02:04.649> whether<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.070> want<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.280> wet<00:02:05.610> dry<00:02:06.299> very

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200

wet<00:02:07.640> but<00:02:08.640> let<00:02:08.819> me<00:02:08.910> set<00:02:09.090> my<00:02:09.270> wet<00:02:09.599> back<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.640> 50%

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
wet but let me set my wet back to 50%

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.149 
wet but let me set my wet back to 50%
and<00:02:13.049> I'm<00:02:13.200> gonna<00:02:13.290> undo<00:02:13.530> them<00:02:13.799> to<00:02:13.920> keep<00:02:14.099> doing

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
and I'm gonna undo them to keep doing

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.500 
and I'm gonna undo them to keep doing
these<00:02:14.549> with<00:02:14.700> different<00:02:14.760> settings<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:15.420> you

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
these with different settings so you

explanation of what it's doing so wet is

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.420 
explanation of what it's doing so wet is
basically<00:02:42.569> how<00:02:42.840> much<00:02:43.049> ink<00:02:43.470> gets<00:02:43.739> mixing<00:02:44.250> into

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
basically how much ink gets mixing into

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.479 
basically how much ink gets mixing into
the<00:02:44.640> photograph<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.739> let's<00:02:46.739> make<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.040> around

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
the photograph and let's make it around

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.460 
the photograph and let's make it around
eighty<00:02:47.849> percent<00:02:48.389> for<00:02:48.599> wet<00:02:48.780> anywhere<00:02:49.290> between

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
eighty percent for wet anywhere between

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.640 
eighty percent for wet anywhere between
50<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.010> 80<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.370> one<00:02:50.579> I<00:02:50.609> like<00:02:50.940> load<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.290> how<00:02:52.470> much

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
50 and 80 is one I like load is how much

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.809 
50 and 80 is one I like load is how much
ink<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.310> loaded<00:02:53.970> on<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.510> brush<00:02:54.720> ink<00:02:55.109> or<00:02:55.590> paint

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
ink is loaded on the brush ink or paint

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.149 
ink is loaded on the brush ink or paint
so<00:02:56.819> let's<00:02:57.180> set<00:02:57.389> this<00:02:57.569> to<00:02:57.629> 20<00:02:58.139> percent<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.829> I'll

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
so let's set this to 20 percent and I'll

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.210 
so let's set this to 20 percent and I'll
click<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.549> drag<00:03:00.349> you've<00:03:01.349> got<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.560> light<00:03:01.829> bit<00:03:02.099> of

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
click and drag you've got a light bit of

click and drag you've got a light bit of
painting<00:03:02.670> I'll<00:03:03.079> undo<00:03:04.099> set<00:03:05.099> it<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.370> 90<00:03:05.939> percent

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.619 
painting I'll undo set it to 90 percent
click<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.680> drag<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.310> it's<00:03:08.670> kind<00:03:08.879> of<00:03:08.939> compound

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
click and drag and it's kind of compound

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.780 
click and drag and it's kind of compound
more<00:03:10.079> ink<00:03:10.409> with<00:03:10.859> each<00:03:11.040> stroke<00:03:11.400> but<00:03:11.670> I'm

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
more ink with each stroke but I'm

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.580 
more ink with each stroke but I'm
already<00:03:12.120> getting<00:03:12.209> some<00:03:12.599> really<00:03:12.989> nice<00:03:13.170> special

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
already getting some really nice special

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.490 
already getting some really nice special
effects<00:03:14.329> now<00:03:15.329> mixing<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:15.959> how<00:03:16.109> much<00:03:16.319> it's

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
effects now mixing is how much it's

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.650 
effects now mixing is how much it's
mixing<00:03:16.949> the<00:03:17.099> colors<00:03:17.459> I'll<00:03:17.940> use<00:03:18.150> my<00:03:18.329> spacebar

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
mixing the colors I'll use my spacebar

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.119 
mixing the colors I'll use my spacebar
in<00:03:18.930> scoot<00:03:19.199> over<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.590> have<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.739> little<00:03:19.889> bit<00:03:20.069> of

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
in scoot over so I have a little bit of

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.280 
in scoot over so I have a little bit of
an<00:03:20.220> empty<00:03:20.579> canvas<00:03:20.849> and<00:03:21.269> on<00:03:21.419> the<00:03:21.599> mixing<00:03:22.079> I'll

an empty canvas and on the mixing I'll

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.369 
an empty canvas and on the mixing I'll
go<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.709> 20<00:03:23.430> percent<00:03:23.849> and<00:03:24.090> if<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.780> pause<00:03:25.049> over

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.349 
all layers and also airbrush airbrush is
kind<00:03:50.159> of<00:03:50.190> neat<00:03:50.370> on<00:03:50.579> this<00:03:50.729> cuz<00:03:50.909> when<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.090> hold

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
kind of neat on this cuz when I hold

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.020 
kind of neat on this cuz when I hold
still<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.989> just<00:03:52.379> keeps<00:03:52.650> collecting<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.790> ink

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
still it just keeps collecting the ink

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.839 
still it just keeps collecting the ink
in<00:03:54.329> that<00:03:54.540> given<00:03:54.900> spot<00:03:55.229> so<00:03:56.069> what<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.280> like<00:03:56.579> to<00:03:56.699> do

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
in that given spot so what I like to do

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.659 
in that given spot so what I like to do
on<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:57.180> one<00:03:57.239> is<00:03:57.569> just<00:03:58.019> nice<00:03:58.319> big<00:03:58.889> sweeping

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
on this one is just nice big sweeping

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.449 
on this one is just nice big sweeping
motions<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.479> if<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:00.930> set<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:01.470> use<00:04:01.889> solid

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
motions and if I set it to use solid

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.030 
motions and if I set it to use solid
colors<00:04:03.000> only<00:04:03.349> this<00:04:04.349> is<00:04:04.530> something<00:04:04.889> you<00:04:05.010> should

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
colors only this is something you should

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.119 
colors only this is something you should
see<00:04:05.459> so<00:04:06.120> if<00:04:06.209> I<00:04:06.299> load<00:04:06.540> solid<00:04:06.959> colors<00:04:07.290> only<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:07.919> I

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
see so if I load solid colors only and I

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.490 
see so if I load solid colors only and I
hold<00:04:08.400> down<00:04:08.639> option<00:04:08.909> or<00:04:09.389> alt<00:04:09.569> to<00:04:09.870> sample<00:04:10.379> the

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
solid color it's showing me the top half

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.589

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
I'm gonna collapse this down you could

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.530 
I'm gonna collapse this down you could
even<00:04:39.070> move<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.490> around<00:04:39.550> if<00:04:39.970> you<00:04:40.060> want<00:04:40.300> it<00:04:40.389> off

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
the stage a little bit more and I'm just

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.550 
the stage a little bit more and I'm just
gonna<00:04:42.820> make<00:04:43.060> some<00:04:43.120> strokes<00:04:43.750> over<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.260> sky

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
I've got a layer mask created so it's

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.409 
I've got a layer mask created so it's
okay<00:04:47.980> if<00:04:48.010> I<00:04:48.250> paint<00:04:48.490> over<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:49.000> buildings

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
and you really do need a lot of

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.100 
and you really do need a lot of

love to have eight this file can get
pretty<00:05:08.330> complicated<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.470> mix<00:05:09.860> all<00:05:10.070> these

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
pretty complicated to mix all these

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.820 
pretty complicated to mix all these
blended<00:05:10.790> brushes<00:05:11.240> but<00:05:12.080> with<00:05:12.290> just<00:05:12.470> a<00:05:12.650> few

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
blended brushes but with just a few

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.340 
blended brushes but with just a few
sweeps<00:05:13.160> I'm<00:05:13.550> not<00:05:13.790> an<00:05:13.940> artist<00:05:14.330> I<00:05:14.600> could<00:05:15.110> still

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
sweeps I'm not an artist I could still

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.950 
sweeps I'm not an artist I could still
make<00:05:15.380> something<00:05:16.250> that<00:05:16.669> looks<00:05:16.699> painted<00:05:17.360> and<00:05:17.540> I

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
make something that looks painted and I

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.350 
make something that looks painted and I
might<00:05:18.169> even<00:05:18.199> try<00:05:18.710> combining<00:05:19.610> different<00:05:19.880> brush

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
might even try combining different brush

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.650 
might even try combining different brush
types

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.960 

and<00:05:24.440> you<00:05:24.620> could<00:05:24.740> see<00:05:24.920> it<00:05:25.010> drawing<00:05:25.490> in<00:05:25.610> the<00:05:25.700> sky

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
and you could see it drawing in the sky

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.730 
and you could see it drawing in the sky
in<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.240> background

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.370 

now<00:05:30.310> as<00:05:30.460> fast-forwarded<00:05:31.150> a<00:05:31.240> bit<00:05:31.420> to<00:05:31.960> fill<00:05:32.200> this

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
now as fast-forwarded a bit to fill this

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.140 
now as fast-forwarded a bit to fill this
portion<00:05:32.830> in<00:05:32.980> so<00:05:33.220> let's<00:05:33.430> change<00:05:33.700> our<00:05:33.880> brush

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
portion in so let's change our brush

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.310 
portion in so let's change our brush
type<00:05:34.540> so<00:05:35.530> let's<00:05:35.770> try<00:05:36.100> the<00:05:36.610> flat<00:05:36.940> angle<00:05:37.540> low

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
type so let's try the flat angle low

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.710 
type so let's try the flat angle low
bristle<00:05:38.890> count<00:05:39.160> brush<00:05:39.520> so<00:05:40.240> it's<00:05:40.390> gonna<00:05:40.510> be<00:05:40.690> a

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
bristle count brush so it's gonna be a

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.320 
bristle count brush so it's gonna be a
little<00:05:40.840> bit<00:05:41.050> more<00:05:41.200> blunt<00:05:41.650> of<00:05:41.860> a<00:05:42.070> tip<00:05:42.310> I<00:05:42.550> can<00:05:43.000> hit

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
little bit more blunt of a tip I can hit
