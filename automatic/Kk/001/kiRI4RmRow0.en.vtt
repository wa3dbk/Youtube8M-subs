00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.640
 Big sound is also a big channel to spread the island 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:10.910
 This time re reborn one hundredd 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.290
 I would like to introduce the random mark iii 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:21.160
 I will continue from the introduction of the part is Feri 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:24.790
 Yes, here is is like body Yes right arm is a foot rinsed with a little while ago David 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.840
 I am a left leg I am a backpack 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:31.380
 Shield is 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.360
 Let's assembly splash that's beam rifle 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.160
 The west head was attached 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.480
 It is upper body completion accepted depending on the timing attached 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.829
 The next thing is cheap, when I was right footed I was left footed 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.560
 acer Hanshin completed The upper body interest is attached 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.620
 I was attached to the upper body and half 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:58.440
 Next backpack came dark pack 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:02.130
 I will put the seal next Yes I put on the shield Replace the arm and equip the team rifle 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.890
 It's completed It's completed , so let's see right away 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.550
 Yes it's from the front 4 from the side 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.870
 From close-up 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:19.810
 Well I will explain the village here It is a beam rifle 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:23.830
 It seems to be compatible because it uses the same beam pack as Mark 2 and Ne Hundred 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.970
 This is a beam cannon and there is no Vulcan gun so it's in place 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.570
 It looks like 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:32.930
 This has become a dedicated seal does not smoke had been attached to the Joey role here 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.440
 Like the beam saber attached 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:41.710
 You can remove it from the shield and hold the beam saber . 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:46.360
 It comes with energy pack for the I beam rifle like a cat on the back of a dedicated knee 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:50.140
 Distinctive binders and slicers seem to be quite successful at high maneuverability 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.320
 It seems like a reckless existence between Zetas and 100s 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:59.080
 Early Kedomo series it's such respect to 1 ne range of motion 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:01.700
 I think I'm going to go pretty well, so I think my arms have something similar to the recent hd 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.870
 Especially my legs 20 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.600
 Feeling to be painful not I see you joint what has become the joint 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.790
 It moves quite 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.560
 Yes er So it hguc game much I can think feet would like to compared with the 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.950
 Long is it is a long story 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:25.030
 hg is about the same length as me, it's quite huge, compared to fair straight 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.620
 After all, foot length stands out 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.769
 Compared with the nightingale of the first sound re 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:36.150
 It's floor in the I still Nightingale has become something like 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:41.340
 Yes Well this time was the introduction of the re What's mark iii 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:44.030
