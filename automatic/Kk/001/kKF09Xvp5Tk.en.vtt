00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
not actually using the swarm which is

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.200 
not actually using the swarm which is
definitely<00:01:04.680> different<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.369> know<00:01:05.489> i<00:01:05.700> was<00:01:06.030> only

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
definitely different you know i was only

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.390 
definitely different you know i was only
like<00:01:06.360> level<00:01:06.659> 51<00:01:07.260> 52<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.010> game<00:01:08.220> play

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
like level 51 52 in this game play

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.310 
like level 51 52 in this game play
actually<00:01:09.240> i<00:01:09.299> leveled<00:01:09.600> up<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.840> three<00:01:10.020> times

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
actually i leveled up like three times

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.500 
actually i leveled up like three times
in<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.530> gameplay<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:11.100> um<00:01:11.340> I'd<00:01:11.729> not<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
in this gameplay but um I'd not have the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.960 
in this gameplay but um I'd not have the
swarm<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.170> start<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> game<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.979> it's<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
swarm to start the game so it's the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
swarm to start the game so it's the
world's<00:01:15.270> most<00:01:15.479> kills<00:01:15.810> without<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.020> swarm<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.740> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
world's most kills without a swarm so I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.740 
world's most kills without a swarm so I
thought<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.700> would<00:01:17.820> be<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.000> pretty<00:01:18.420> cool

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
thought that it would be a pretty cool

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.270 
thought that it would be a pretty cool
gameplay<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.530> slurred<00:01:19.740> my<00:01:19.920> words<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.250> I

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
gameplay I just slurred my words there I

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.090 
gameplay I just slurred my words there I
was<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.460> dash<00:01:20.670> because<00:01:21.030> yeah<00:01:21.210> um<00:01:22.070> anyway<00:01:23.070> I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
was like dash because yeah um anyway I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.320 
was like dash because yeah um anyway I
thought<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> would<00:01:23.580> be<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> pretty<00:01:24.060> cool

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
thought it would be a pretty cool

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.230 
thought it would be a pretty cool
gameplay<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.750> use<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:25.170> Figgy<00:01:25.350> fridays<00:01:25.799> and

you know i think you guys should agree
with<00:01:28.439> me<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.579> world's<00:01:29.880> most<00:01:29.970> kills

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
with me it's the world's most kills

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.789 
with me it's the world's most kills
without<00:01:30.329> swarm<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.840> i<00:01:30.990> said<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.619> guys<00:01:31.740> might

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
without swarm like i said you guys might

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.679
