00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.730
 pumpkin risotto with julienne chicken and speck step immediately to list the 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.630
 ingredients for 4 people 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.630
 which are 200 grams of patna rice 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.699
 one liter of vegetable broth 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.449
 12 pumpkin flowers 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.259
 three cloves 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.290
 4 tablespoons of extra oil 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.290
 250 grams of chicken breast 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.930
 80 grams of speck in slices 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.050
 1 clove of garlic 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.240
 and salt as needed 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.260
 well let's now pass the execution of this recipe 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.540
 I tried a lot of Danish spas and tasty pistols 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.270
 we go more and more towards the warmer months and I have prepared pumpkin flowers 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.170
 stuff with rice and instead of tomato passion yield of flowers of 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.940
 pumpkin 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.769
 that I cook it with the broth 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.060
 it is accompanied by chicken breast is a bit of a nodis because 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.479
 this is a dish that should also be considered as a single dish not to be dovetailed 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.590
 not - 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.930
 it can be so it can be placed as an appetizer as a second first name also 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.420
 in torino because at the same time all the ingredients and wines of vegetable rice 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.970
 of white meat a bit of the roma diza mirrors 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.070
 that's love running the first time I have to do 4 flower rain hours 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.570
 of pumpkin flights of 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.570
 with this is the site we pay attention to 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.950
 external filaments 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.080
 and inside the little bed without breaking them must remain in the rock 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.750
 after which instead of the normal rice of rice. and we are commonly white tails 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.310
 farms or this releasing Indian rice - starch 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.150
 atc long infinity 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.330
 while the other manages to make a compact mass inside 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.070
 these we will have turned out then that there is also - because I have laughed normal bose 14 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.050
 16 minutes 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.720
 this rising iano and is slightly more up 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.570
 a - starch and scented ds4 in 12 minutes then 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.620
 the flower 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.339
 you see - because I have never been there - you could break the rice 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.599
 so the flower goes like this with a spoon 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.599
 put the rice outside see the stuffing 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:23.709
 the pro 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.539
 rice inside and close 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:29.799
 I don't need to know how to predict portion 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.849
 a companion of an unpolymerized dibond so I'm going to fill them 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.269
 beware that this also doubles his 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.259
 mass 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:39.609
 so that's okay 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.289
 in the meantime I can 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:43.759
 heat 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:45.579
 a small casserole 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.699
 I put a little bit of oil 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:50.159
 little 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.399
 some cloves because it re-perfumes to hear it like this 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:57.349
 the rice must be in the command 3 4 cloves if also use the 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.699
 ravine also binds well with butter 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.699
 this dvd biasca so 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.030
 2 3 4 e50 unmade mold 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.019
 same trunk ok 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.019
 anna ji flowers 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:20.729
 stas already giving off a video scent of carnation 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:24.509
 so betitaly plays well 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.619
 schools without making them brown otherwise it will ruin you 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:30.369
 immediately boiling broth are 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:34.039
 pools if it is far put 100 grams of rice 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:39.249
 hot stock we buy 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.939
 because the author of them must have heat beats on the cover falls back 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.810
 esquina d'autore forms both below and above never one above the other allowed a lot 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.809
 wide that they had line and cooking ever 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.810
 too strong otherwise happy miss 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.719
 the continually stir up 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:58.829
 simmer for 10 12 minutes 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.290
 the dish is ready I recommend it to the lid otherwise I am rivals naked 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.169
 then in the meantime 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.519
 I can prepare the other staple ingredients 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.430
 how to see a very fast dish that you can make 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.750
 in 12 - rimini a dish for every day that can be cooking all 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.479
 days 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.150
 very tasty you can replace the spekkietto 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.310
 for those who prefer a fish I can make fish bubbles 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.520
 which matches very well some like meat so chicken and a little bit of 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.400
 respect 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.229
 I immediately go to the radio 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.030
 in this case the fragrant decidedly er rice I don't want to access with taste 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:36.050
 I remove the part of the garlic bud very strongly 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.639
 and with a trench coat, as always we do so work cost 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.909
 we mock him 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.240
 we enter very finely 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.759
 stmpare 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:59.379
 and we keep it apart because it goes to do now infuse this yes again 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:00.849
 burns quickly 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.409
 now the lever from the pans to heat a lot without I want then 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:05.770
 let's put it right away 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.770
 a little bit of oil 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:13.259
 as mentioned often lol and little cost was only increases dermal conduction but does 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.620
 so that the chicken and the speck and if they play better 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.969
 but wishing I can put even more quality oil at the end 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.860
 work these are there that therefore deteriorate with very cotton 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.699
 strong 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.699
 they tend to ruin you we can skip the chicken the speck and drain it 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.370
 and then put fresh oil ok 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.259
 back to juve 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.389
 that starts to cut 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.169
 the chicken in very small cubes 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.330
 after fading he can cook 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.930
 in 2 minutes 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.930
 so 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:51.479
 as you can see the recipes I present are always readjusted 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:55.289
 or possible damage can also be followed at home
