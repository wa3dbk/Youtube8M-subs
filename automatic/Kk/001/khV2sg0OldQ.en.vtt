is also the voice of Kirito and lover
from<00:03:37.510> becoming<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.260> killer<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.590> sort<00:03:38.860> out

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
from becoming a killer and sort out

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.430 
from becoming a killer and sort out
online<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:39.820> he's<00:03:40.330> a<00:03:40.360> very<00:03:40.540> good<00:03:40.930> voice<00:03:41.050> ID<00:03:41.290> I
