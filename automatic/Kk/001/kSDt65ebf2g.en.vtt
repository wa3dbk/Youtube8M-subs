00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:09.829
 Stepanova we took tires bridgestone 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:12.449
 the continental will be years and years old 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.719
 In addition, we decided to experience Chinese 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.719
 will be paradise 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.789
 we will compare and test until 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.239
 the last centimeters and in the end 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.689
 find out which tire is the most 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.689
 safe 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.439
 so they will show us how much 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.770
 be in the snow in a variety of conditions 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.260
 deals on acceleration and deceleration 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.010
 slow and fast corners 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.650
 first climb test 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.120
 serves to test the bulk potential 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.120
 an error 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.180
 the cyclone will cover the station steady tires it 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.110
 ability to accurately hold the trajectory 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.720
 driver-exposed all 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.500
 competitors performed well 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.440
 even Chinese tires which are quite 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.590
 recently appeared on the market in this that is and 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.590
 practically not inferior to European 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.630
 finished serpentine go to the tests on 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.630
 plain acceleration from standstill to thirty 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.650
 kilometers per hour and braking from 50 to 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.650
 full stop 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.530
 believe it or not 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.700
 cheap winter tires on the snow behaves 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
 better expensive summer 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.620
 in the kit we bill 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.270
 put the tires to the test 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.850
 identical conditions 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.840
 and now we are most worried 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.920
 stopping distance is our safety in 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.860
 most dependent on this 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.250
 parameter 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.550
 here the differences are more successive for example 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.720
 the best divorce turned out to be goodyear she 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.980
 braking strangely chinese in 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.980
 prague 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.420
 in conclusion, we can only 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.990
 announce the winner on the amount of points it 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.990
 rubles will work 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.859
 now if i may 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.859
 I'm tyson bye 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.329
 that's all we managed to tell you strength
