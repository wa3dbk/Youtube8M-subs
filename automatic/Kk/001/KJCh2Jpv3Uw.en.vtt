just<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.170> little<00:00:31.380> bit<00:00:31.470> about<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> brush<00:00:31.860> to

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:32.039 
just a little bit about the brush to

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:33.950 
just a little bit about the brush to
start<00:00:32.279> with<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.789> duo<00:00:32.969> fiber<00:00:33.239> brush<00:00:33.450> it's

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.530 
start with it's a duo fiber brush it's
fairly<00:00:34.890> its<00:00:35.160> medium-sized<00:00:35.640> head<00:00:35.910> I'd<00:00:36.030> say<00:00:36.060> I

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
fairly its medium-sized head I'd say I

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.910 
fairly its medium-sized head I'd say I
definitely<00:00:36.720> have<00:00:37.110> smaller<00:00:37.380> duo<00:00:37.650> fiber

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
definitely have smaller duo fiber

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.650 
definitely have smaller duo fiber
brushes<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.550> larger<00:00:38.850> ones<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.150> well<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.540> this

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
brushes and larger ones as well so this

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.569 
brushes and larger ones as well so this
is<00:00:39.720> pretty<00:00:39.930> average<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.739> what<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.340> it's

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
is pretty average and what it is it's

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.150 
is pretty average and what it is it's
got<00:00:41.730> natural<00:00:41.940> bristles<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.290> bottom<00:00:43.620> with

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
got natural bristles on the bottom with

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.430 
got natural bristles on the bottom with
some<00:00:44.340> longer<00:00:44.780> synthetic<00:00:45.780> bristles<00:00:46.110> at<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
some longer synthetic bristles at the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.290 
some longer synthetic bristles at the
top<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.520> purpose<00:00:47.790> of<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.970> duo<00:00:48.090> fiber

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
top and so the purpose of a duo fiber

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.330 
top and so the purpose of a duo fiber
brush<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.899> really<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:49.380> field<00:00:49.560> to<00:00:49.680> buff<00:00:50.010> in

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
brush is really just field to buff in

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.819 
brush is really just field to buff in
any<00:00:51.329> products<00:00:51.720> really<00:00:51.930> well<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.470> what<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.710> does

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
any products really well so what it does

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.710 
any products really well so what it does
is<00:00:53.040> that<00:00:53.070> these<00:00:53.610> synthetic<00:00:53.850> brushes<00:00:54.210> apply

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
is that these synthetic brushes apply

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.150 
is that these synthetic brushes apply
the<00:00:54.780> product<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> idea<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:55.980> you're

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the product and the idea is that you're

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.979 
the product and the idea is that you're
supposed<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.430> use<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.790> natural<00:00:57.360> bristles<00:00:57.809> to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
supposed to use the natural bristles to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.840 
supposed to use the natural bristles to
really<00:00:58.800> buff<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.220> and<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.700> that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
really buff it in and get that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.180 
really buff it in and get that

like<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.309> use<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:02.579> meditation<00:01:02.880> I<00:01:03.239> don't

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
like to use this for meditation I don't

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.149 
like to use this for meditation I don't
like<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.049> foundation<00:01:04.649> for<00:01:05.040> whatever

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.760 
like it for foundation for whatever
reason<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.640> find<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.970> super<00:01:06.180> streaky<00:01:06.780> because

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
reason I find it super streaky because

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.230 
reason I find it super streaky because
the<00:01:07.920> size<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.460> big<00:01:08.670> even<00:01:08.880> though<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.180> a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the size is so big even though I have a

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.719 
the size is so big even though I have a
really<00:01:09.600> big<00:01:09.780> head<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.830> doesn't<00:01:11.370> quite<00:01:11.490> do

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
really big head it just doesn't quite do

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.100 
really big head it just doesn't quite do
the<00:01:11.760> job<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.090> me<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.570> white<00:01:12.690> wrestles

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the job for me the white wrestles

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.980 
the job for me the white wrestles
wrestles<00:01:13.950> bristles<00:01:14.760> get<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.120> the<00:01:15.240> way<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.630> I

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
wrestles bristles get in the way and I

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.010 
wrestles bristles get in the way and I
can't<00:01:16.380> really<00:01:16.590> blend<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.400> out<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
can't really blend it out so the of the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.560 
can't really blend it out so the of the
density<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.549> not<00:01:21.180> really<00:01:21.450> for

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
because it's so subtle that people will

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.120
