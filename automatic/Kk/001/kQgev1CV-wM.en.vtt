00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.079
 was not something that we had 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.760
 very natural so we do not make it 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.650
 often but we like it anyway 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.980
 and you've asked us a lot about 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.870
 we were inspired and we got 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.030
 let some hairstyles do very 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.440
 very very easy without heat that you

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.890
 easily for the summer if you like 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.920
 the hairdressing videos do not hesitate to 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.440
 liker for fight so we know and 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.600
 and even if we are not the most talented 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.399
 of the youtube planet regarding 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.839
 hairstyles down we like to learn and 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.030
 we like to explain to you 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.769
 after how to do so that would be with 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.239
 great pleasure that we enter the other and 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.239
 let's go for the video 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.820
 others left for four 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.920
 very easy and without heat hairstyle 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.270
 the first is a hairstyle actually 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.500
 which will allow you to keep the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.270
 hair down 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.189
 because often hairstyles bring him 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.090
 to tie a lot of hair and there I 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.500
 I thought it was still 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.630
 the opportunity to introduce you to 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.000
 thing where you can keep your hair 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.259
 dropped while being oxidized 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.939
 it's having two little snows 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.549
 each side of the stage to wrap them up 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.710
 from the east us and back of the skull to 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.119
 Kananaskis will not see you 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.649
 advise to really take Africa 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.569
 black if you're brunette it's a lot 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.000
 more beautiful and finally more discreet in fact 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.409
 and then you just have to pass the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.530
 knotted little brown eggs 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.659
 one in the other I really love this 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.009
 Paschal hairstyle is super easy to taïz 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.259
 and to let you keep your hair 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.240
 detached and quantity not too much 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.950
 too chauvinistic we like to have the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.330
 detached hair and she really does 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.289
 its effect because we wonder a little 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.289
 as we did 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.150
 four consonants and vowels this is the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.739
 first name of rolle geneva in the second 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.480
 by pure chaos rings I propose a 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.860
 braid but then be careful this is the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.319
 kind of press you never have 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.390
 saw my I was scared to see that I 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.250
 really found that super original is 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.450
 so beautiful 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.370
 once you've made your tail 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.709
 of horse you can split in two 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.150
 strands and the one above you go the 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.129
 we did not like everything at the top 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.129
 really to be able to leave a space 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.200
 to make a hole in it is the brown that is 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.420
 were underneath so he 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.040
 go over and you repeat 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.349
 the operation as many times as he 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.829
 will have to get to the very bottom of your 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.900
 hair 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.909
 again it's a hairstyle that 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.709
 is super easy to achieve you have 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.450
 not especially need to see me from 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.959
 anything to do it and she 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.489
 is really really very direct for 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.409
 give a little more volume do not hesitate 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.900
 not to loosen the fists in one 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.260
 and that's the result of my in our 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.920
 list of our lives remarks ans 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.630
 then of a saint 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.580
 I think he stayed by far 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.800
 that there is more practical in summer because 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.720
 that it allows to have a pretty hairstyle 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.459
 but in addition to having the shot released 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.760
 when it's hot and it's not 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.760
 negligible 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.740
 we crossed it or will not do it on 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.330
 something a little more your m - my 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.340
 hair is a bit too long 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.080
 for this hairstyle and it was a little 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.670
 more complicated if you have hair 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.940
 shorter it will be much easier 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.620
 you say it we do not start doing 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.030
 braids on each side of the head it's 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.890
 like African braids because at 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.650
 every time you go pick up a 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.230
 strand in the inner part and come 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.450
 bring it back to the braid for the result 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.800
 that you will see right after that is 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.870
 simply instead of having three 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.440
 strands that I braid toulon with each other 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.210
 others 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.660
 every time the third sailor I 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.400
 come pick up behind my head and that's 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.050
 where it gets more complicated when 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.420
 we have long hair like me it's 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.160
 to come fix behind the head so 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.830
 with coils of small tongs 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.510
 flat and that it is discreet that we see 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.570
 not all the hair that they exceed and 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.130
 be nice for this pop you 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.690
 can you help a mirror for 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.970
 control a little bit that everything is 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.440
 eat well and store securely attached you 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.210
 can come out some wicks 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.250
 story of not having your head too 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.930
 perfect and you can fix it all 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.930
 with a little bit of strépy history 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.260
 and for those who follow me on the 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.930
 chain develops here is the famous ice cream 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.480
 which we had a lot of fun during 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.610

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.979
 but a bun that is both chic 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.409
 and to the bad luck so easy to 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.180
 achieve in Block postponed to you 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.699
 been very many to him asked for a 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.740
 tutorial so here I have to do a maximum 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.780
 of volume to his carwin bun to 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.490
 use extensions so there too 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.039
 two extensions fill it as 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.599
 usually she sets them around the 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.150
 ponytail what access just before 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.729
 and after all it's a question of 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.949
 bobby pts and you wind up your 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.500
 hair or your extensions around 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:46.169
 your head and you set the most 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.000
 possible with coils so that 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.650

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.120

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.949

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.169
 some wicks on the side to make 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.980

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.910
 horses will come we shot this scene 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.470
 it's a place we are 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.420
 particularly expensive because it 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.000
 would take effect our very first name 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.570
 motor Lyon a year ago and half that 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.570
 loved it 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.230
 key 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.790

 so we can see that we would 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.040
 really happy 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.880
 two months there for the video hairstyle 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.800
 I hope you liked it we were 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.300
 took a lot of fun learning to 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.310
 do these few hairstyles to 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.830
 take inspiration from the internet to find the 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.440
 ideas etc and to reproduce them for you 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.960

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.630
 do you really take care of yourself? 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.920
 I wanted to make you say that because 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.840
 I feel like we are a little bit 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.880
 in a rush period there was 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.050
 many of you who are in the process 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.630
 to pass their exams 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.030
 so do not worry, this is all 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.410
 is not nearly deep breath 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.700
 to use essential if it makes you feel good 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:03.250
 but do not forget that everything ends up 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.620
 to arrange and also it is difficult 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.870
 now everything will be better later 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.610
