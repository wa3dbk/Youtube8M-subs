00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
to the right or two because it will be

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.030 
to the right or two because it will be
most<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.240> ball<00:01:06.450> down<00:01:06.720> are<00:01:07.320> always<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:08.010> the

most of the ball down are always on the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.430 
most of the ball down are always on the
left<00:01:08.400> side<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.360> there's<00:01:09.570> no<00:01:09.720> damage<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> the
