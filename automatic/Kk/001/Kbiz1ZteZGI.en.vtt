the system together I found out this

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.979 
the system together I found out this
card<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.010> only<00:02:15.159> good<00:02:15.400> for<00:02:15.580> our<00:02:16.030> two<00:02:16.269> card<00:02:16.599> SLI

know yeah it's gets knew you'd figure
days<00:02:45.879> maybe<00:02:46.299> it<00:02:46.450> should<00:02:46.599> work<00:02:46.720> with<00:02:46.900> three

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
days maybe it should work with three

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.569 
days maybe it should work with three
together<00:02:47.319> but<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.769> doesn't<00:02:48.040> work<00:02:48.160> with<00:02:48.340> three

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
together but it doesn't work with three

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.369 
together but it doesn't work with three
only<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:49.000> only<00:02:49.209> if<00:02:49.299> you<00:02:49.450> only<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.049> really
