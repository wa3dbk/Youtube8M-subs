but<00:03:32.030> it's<00:03:32.209> all<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.510> question<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:33.200> ambition<00:03:33.799> and

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
but it's all a question of ambition and

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.410 
but it's all a question of ambition and
what<00:03:35.480> we're<00:03:35.720> here<00:03:35.989> for<00:03:36.019> is<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:37.090> enable<00:03:38.090> the

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
what we're here for is to enable the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.330 
what we're here for is to enable the
student<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:38.930> convert<00:03:39.319> that<00:03:39.530> ambition<00:03:40.099> into

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
student to convert that ambition into

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.660 
student to convert that ambition into
results<00:03:41.299> so<00:03:42.049> I<00:03:42.109> found<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:42.859> Duke<00:03:43.159> puts<00:03:43.549> its

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
results so I found that Duke puts its

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.330 
results so I found that Duke puts its
money<00:03:43.790> words<00:03:44.060> in<00:03:44.209> office<00:03:44.569> when<00:03:45.440> it<00:03:45.620> says<00:03:45.859> that

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
money words in office when it says that

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.339 
money words in office when it says that
it<00:03:46.609> will<00:03:46.790> have<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.720> resources<00:03:48.079> and<00:03:48.260> the

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
it will have the resources and the

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.159 
it will have the resources and the
faculty<00:03:48.859> to<00:03:49.519> help<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:50.359> explore<00:03:50.720> any<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:51.049> your

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
faculty to help you explore any of your

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.010 
faculty to help you explore any of your
interests<00:03:51.680> they<00:03:51.889> really<00:03:52.190> do<00:03:52.310> mean<00:03:52.489> that

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
interests they really do mean that

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.470

this<00:03:54.170> is<00:03:54.350> some<00:03:54.620> potential<00:03:55.280> to<00:03:55.730> do<00:03:55.940> something

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
this is some potential to do something

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.620 
this is some potential to do something
special<00:03:57.140> to<00:03:57.620> be<00:03:57.860> way<00:03:58.460> more<00:03:58.760> interesting<00:03:59.420> than

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
special to be way more interesting than

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.980 
special to be way more interesting than
they<00:03:59.990> are<00:04:00.020> when<00:04:00.260> they<00:04:00.380> come<00:04:00.410> to<00:04:00.680> college
