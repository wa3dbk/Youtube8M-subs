eating but that's feeding therapy like
getting<00:02:52.120> her<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.299> put<00:02:52.420> anything<00:02:52.629> our<00:02:52.840> mouth<00:02:52.989> is

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
getting her to put anything our mouth is

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.710 
getting her to put anything our mouth is
but<00:02:53.319> that<00:02:53.769> an<00:02:54.220> ice<00:02:54.640> cream<00:02:54.879> is<00:02:55.090> like<00:02:55.329> a<00:02:55.360> form<00:02:55.629> of

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
but that an ice cream is like a form of

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.759 
but that an ice cream is like a form of
liquid<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.200> it's<00:02:56.349> a<00:02:56.409> step<00:02:56.590> in<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.680> right

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
liquid so it's a step in the right

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.830 
liquid so it's a step in the right
direction<00:02:56.829> eventually<00:02:57.579> turn<00:02:57.909> into<00:02:57.940> like<00:02:58.239> more

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
direction eventually turn into like more

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.020 
direction eventually turn into like more
solid<00:02:59.260> of<00:02:59.379> food<00:02:59.590> so<00:02:59.890> she's<00:03:00.489> doing<00:03:00.730> good<00:03:00.879> and

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
solid of food so she's doing good and

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.460 
solid of food so she's doing good and
for<00:03:01.239> protectiveness<00:03:01.810> they<00:03:02.200> haven't<00:03:02.379> really

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
for protectiveness they haven't really

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.020 
for protectiveness they haven't really
been<00:03:02.620> in<00:03:02.680> situations<00:03:03.250> where<00:03:03.400> she<00:03:03.579> would<00:03:03.819> have

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
been in situations where she would have

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.000 
been in situations where she would have
to<00:03:04.150> be<00:03:04.239> protected<00:03:04.659> from<00:03:04.750> hannah<00:03:04.989> so<00:03:05.859> i<00:03:05.890> think

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
to be protected from hannah so i think

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.520 
to be protected from hannah so i think
she<00:03:06.340> would<00:03:06.579> be<00:03:06.609> but<00:03:07.359> i<00:03:07.390> don't<00:03:07.690> really<00:03:07.930> know<00:03:08.170> the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
she would be but i don't really know the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.949 
she would be but i don't really know the
next<00:03:08.769> question<00:03:09.190> does<00:03:09.640> hannah<00:03:10.000> try<00:03:10.299> any<00:03:10.599> table

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.110 
next question does hannah try any table
foods<00:03:11.200> or<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.889> it<00:03:12.159> hard<00:03:12.459> for<00:03:12.700> her<00:03:12.819> to<00:03:12.970> swallow

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
while i heelied of sits in the corner

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.289 
while i heelied of sits in the corner
forever<00:04:05.949> it's<00:04:06.160> not<00:04:06.310> like<00:04:06.459> that<00:04:06.489> you<00:04:07.120> think

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
forever it's not like that you think

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.839 
forever it's not like that you think
Hannah<00:04:07.449> will<00:04:07.720> be<00:04:08.290> still<00:04:08.680> a<00:04:08.709> 100-percent<00:04:09.340> GTFO

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
Hannah will be still a 100-percent GTFO

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.599 
Hannah will be still a 100-percent GTFO
and<00:04:10.359> she's<00:04:10.599> 5<00:04:10.840> have<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.829> doctors<00:04:12.220> discussed

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
and she's 5 have the doctors discussed

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.569 
and she's 5 have the doctors discussed
getting<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.940> trach<00:04:13.150> out<00:04:13.299> again<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:14.579> definitely

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
getting the trach out again I definitely

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.580 
getting the trach out again I definitely
think<00:04:16.030> she<00:04:16.209> will<00:04:16.329> still<00:04:16.539> be<00:04:16.630> tubed<00:04:16.840> fed<00:04:17.320> when

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
think she will still be tubed fed when

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.670 
think she will still be tubed fed when
she's<00:04:17.919> five<00:04:18.159> I<00:04:19.199> don't<00:04:20.199> really<00:04:20.380> see<00:04:20.500> that

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
she's five I don't really see that

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.129 
she's five I don't really see that
coming<00:04:21.010> out<00:04:21.130> until<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.579> she's<00:04:21.789> like<00:04:21.820> 10<00:04:22.270> that's

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
coming out until it she's like 10 that's

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.300 
coming out until it she's like 10 that's
not<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.349> say<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.530> she<00:04:23.800> won't<00:04:23.919> be<00:04:24.070> able<00:04:24.099> to<00:04:24.250> eat

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
not to say that she won't be able to eat

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.640 
not to say that she won't be able to eat
like<00:04:24.729> almost<00:04:25.090> home<00:04:25.300> meals<00:04:25.570> by<00:04:25.900> then<00:04:26.110> but<00:04:26.590> I

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
like almost home meals by then but I

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.129 
like almost home meals by then but I
definitely<00:04:26.860> think<00:04:27.280> that<00:04:27.570> she's<00:04:28.570> still<00:04:28.840> not

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
definitely think that she's still not

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.020 
definitely think that she's still not
going<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.380> be<00:04:29.440> able<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.680> eat<00:04:29.800> enough<00:04:30.280> to<00:04:30.610> gain

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
going to be able to eat enough to gain

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.339 
going to be able to eat enough to gain
enough<00:04:31.180> weight<00:04:31.330> that<00:04:31.780> she's<00:04:31.960> supposed<00:04:32.229> to

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
enough weight that she's supposed to

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.020 
enough weight that she's supposed to
especially<00:04:33.099> with<00:04:33.159> her<00:04:33.280> shortcut<00:04:33.639> so<00:04:33.789> I<00:04:33.849> don't

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
especially with her shortcut so I don't

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.310 
especially with her shortcut so I don't
think<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.300> tubes<00:04:34.539> going<00:04:34.840> anywhere<00:04:35.110> anytime

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
think the tubes going anywhere anytime

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.320 
think the tubes going anywhere anytime
soon<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.979> for<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.490> trick<00:04:36.729> we're<00:04:36.880> hoping<00:04:37.150> that

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
soon and for the trick we're hoping that

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.020 
soon and for the trick we're hoping that
it<00:04:37.419> comes<00:04:37.630> out<00:04:37.870> in<00:04:38.289> spring<00:04:39.250> but<00:04:39.669> we'll<00:04:39.880> see<00:04:40.000> how
