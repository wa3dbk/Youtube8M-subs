00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.040 

this<00:00:09.920> is<00:00:10.100> what<00:00:10.340> my<00:00:10.580> revision<00:00:11.120> of<00:00:11.240> my<00:00:11.480> making

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050 
this is what my revision of my making

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.179 
this is what my revision of my making
sodium<00:00:12.650> metal<00:00:13.010> videos<00:00:13.719> now<00:00:14.719> the<00:00:14.750> looks<00:00:15.189> you

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
sodium metal videos now the looks you

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.839 
sodium metal videos now the looks you
might<00:00:16.369> not<00:00:16.580> hear<00:00:16.970> me<00:00:17.210> wound<00:00:17.510> the<00:00:17.689> camera

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:18.849 
might not hear me wound the camera

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.030 
might not hear me wound the camera
lithium<00:00:19.849> is<00:00:20.119> a<00:00:20.390> stronger<00:00:20.990> reducing<00:00:21.560> agent<00:00:21.860> not

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
lithium is a stronger reducing agent not

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.609 
lithium is a stronger reducing agent not
more<00:00:22.520> reactive<00:00:23.119> but<00:00:23.420> reducing<00:00:23.960> agents<00:00:24.410> can

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
more reactive but reducing agents can

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.089 
more reactive but reducing agents can
reduce<00:00:25.040> the<00:00:25.220> other<00:00:25.369> like<00:00:25.730> in<00:00:25.989> industry<00:00:27.099> sodium

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
reduce the other like in industry sodium

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.130 
reduce the other like in industry sodium
is<00:00:28.130> used<00:00:28.399> to<00:00:28.489> make<00:00:28.970> potassium<00:00:29.630> which<00:00:29.779> is<00:00:29.899> much

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
is used to make potassium which is much

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.720 
is used to make potassium which is much
much<00:00:30.649> less<00:00:31.040> reactive<00:00:31.930> so<00:00:33.430> then<00:00:34.430> you<00:00:34.550> know

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
much less reactive so then you know

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.930 
much less reactive so then you know
uncle<00:00:35.660> goes<00:00:36.170> to<00:00:37.010> not<00:00:37.220> do<00:00:37.399> the<00:00:37.550> electrolysis

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
uncle goes to not do the electrolysis

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.980 
uncle goes to not do the electrolysis
and<00:00:38.390> do<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:38.690> reduction<00:00:39.520> like<00:00:40.520> in<00:00:40.970> some<00:00:41.570> videos

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:41.990 
and do the reduction like in some videos

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.730 
and do the reduction like in some videos
of<00:00:42.790> sodium<00:00:43.790> hydroxide<00:00:44.300> like<00:00:44.480> a<00:00:44.510> museum<00:00:44.750> by

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
of sodium hydroxide like a museum by

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:55.420 
of sodium hydroxide like a museum by
living<00:00:46.100> for<00:00:46.280> more<00:00:46.430> reactive

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.029 

very<00:00:56.430> viable<00:00:56.699> reaction<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.690> see<00:00:58.039> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
very viable reaction as you can see the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.680 
very viable reaction as you can see the
smoke<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.579> not<00:00:59.789> fake<00:01:04.610> you<00:01:05.610> get<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:05.850> by<00:01:06.390> melting

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
smoke is not fake you get out by melting

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.800 
smoke is not fake you get out by melting
it<00:01:07.100> as<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.300> some<00:01:09.540> little

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
it as but there will be some little

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.469 
it as but there will be some little
abilities<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.700> then<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.060> watching

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
abilities so then you for watching

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.010 
abilities so then you for watching
please<00:01:15.869> subscribe<00:01:15.930> rate<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.190> comment

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
please subscribe rate and comment

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.310 
please subscribe rate and comment
nothing<00:01:19.020> took<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:20.780> actually<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.170> see

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
nothing took this but actually you see

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.150 
nothing took this but actually you see
the<00:01:22.440> tile<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:24.479> sodium<00:01:25.110> has<00:01:25.320> actually<00:01:25.619> melted

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
the tile the sodium has actually melted

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.180 
the tile the sodium has actually melted
into<00:01:28.009> tiles<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.670> see<00:01:29.970> there<00:01:30.929> is<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.409> grey

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
into tiles so as you see there is a grey

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.669 
into tiles so as you see there is a grey
solid<00:01:33.649> so<00:01:34.670> we'll<00:01:35.670> test<00:01:35.940> this<00:01:36.229> is<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.440> great

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
solid so we'll test this is just great

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:48.890 
solid so we'll test this is just great
just<00:01:37.860> good<00:01:38.840> 3<00:01:39.840> 2<00:01:40.440> 1<00:01:42.409> data<00:01:43.409> sodium

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.460 

I<00:01:48.990> me<00:01:49.560> sodium<00:01:49.980> would<00:01:50.130> do<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:51.290> without<00:01:52.290> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
I me sodium would do that without a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.150 
I me sodium would do that without a
sinful<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.580> tell<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> lot<00:01:53.940> of<00:01:54.000> sodium<00:01:54.270> or<00:01:55.160> and

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
sinful to tell a lot of sodium or and

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.570 
sinful to tell a lot of sodium or and
that's<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.550> way<00:01:56.670> how<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.030> get<00:01:57.150> it<00:01:57.330> out

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
that's the way how you can get it out

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.890 
that's the way how you can get it out
and<00:01:59.580> it<00:01:59.880> burns<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.210> flush<00:02:00.510> with<00:02:00.660> knee<00:02:00.870> high

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
and it burns it flush with knee high

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.840 
and it burns it flush with knee high
temperatures<00:02:01.620> and<00:02:01.650> it's<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.400> very<00:02:02.430> violent

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
temperatures and it's a very violent

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.480 
temperatures and it's a very violent
reaction
