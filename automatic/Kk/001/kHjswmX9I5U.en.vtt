a<00:02:27.790> lot<00:02:28.270> of<00:02:28.390> songs<00:02:28.600> will<00:02:29.080> chip<00:02:29.319> me<00:02:29.440> changing

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
a lot of songs will chip me changing

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.380 
a lot of songs will chip me changing
chords<00:02:30.190> faster<00:02:30.640> than<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:30.880> because<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.150> can

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
chords faster than that because you can

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.120 
chords faster than that because you can
use<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.690> in<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.900> lot<00:02:31.990> of<00:02:32.020> places<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.950> for

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
use this in a lot of places so for

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.760 
use this in a lot of places so for
instance<00:02:33.490> in<00:02:33.700> some<00:02:33.840> songs<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:34.959> might<00:02:35.110> might<00:02:35.740> be

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
instance in some songs it might might be

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.250 
instance in some songs it might might be
that<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.850> beginning<00:02:37.240> of<00:02:37.300> that<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.600> at<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:38.020> and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
that the beginning of that is at a and

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.199 
that the beginning of that is at a and
then<00:02:38.350> starting<00:02:38.920> at<00:02:38.980> beat<00:02:39.190> three<00:02:39.520> it's<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:40.030> D

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
then starting at beat three it's a D

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:53.190 
then starting at beat three it's a D
chord<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.470> get<00:02:41.709> something<00:02:41.980> like<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:50.910> notice

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
chord so you get something like I notice

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.330
