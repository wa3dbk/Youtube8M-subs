actually<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.430> way<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.970> sort<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.450> shortens

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
actually a way that sort of shortens

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.870 
actually a way that sort of shortens
that<00:03:58.410> time<00:03:58.590> down<00:03:58.769> not<00:03:58.950> by<00:03:59.070> much<00:03:59.310> but<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.730> is<00:03:59.850> a

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
that time down not by much but it is a

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.090 
that time down not by much but it is a
lot<00:04:00.209> more<00:04:00.239> convenient<00:04:00.900> at<00:04:01.079> least<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.410> me<00:04:01.620> but

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
lot more convenient at least to me but

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.710 
lot more convenient at least to me but
basically<00:04:02.430> all<00:04:02.640> you<00:04:02.760> do<00:04:02.910> is<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.269> hit<00:04:03.420> start

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
basically all you do is you hit start

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.479 
basically all you do is you hit start
you<00:04:04.049> go<00:04:04.170> to<00:04:04.230> online<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:04.950> then<00:04:05.100> you<00:04:05.250> go<00:04:05.430> to

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
you go to online and then you go to

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.880 
you go to online and then you go to
creator<00:04:06.060> now<00:04:06.720> once<00:04:06.930> you're<00:04:07.049> in<00:04:07.140> creator<00:04:07.560> mode

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
creator now once you're in creator mode

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.190 
creator now once you're in creator mode
you<00:04:08.459> actually<00:04:08.700> can<00:04:08.970> do<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.780> same<00:04:09.989> thing

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
you actually can do the same thing

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.170 
you actually can do the same thing
you're<00:04:10.380> doing<00:04:10.410> story<00:04:11.010> mode<00:04:11.220> as<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.609> hit<00:04:11.910> start

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
you're doing story mode as you hit start

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.789 
you're doing story mode as you hit start
then<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:12.600> go<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.750> online<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.470> then<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:13.680> go<00:04:13.739> to

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
then you go to online and then you go to

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.229 
then you go to online and then you go to
invite<00:04:14.100> only<00:04:14.220> session<00:04:14.670> it<00:04:14.760> cuts<00:04:15.000> down<00:04:15.180> the

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
invite only session it cuts down the

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.330 
invite only session it cuts down the
steps<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:15.840> you<00:04:16.410> don't<00:04:16.560> have<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:16.919> go<00:04:17.190> through

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
steps and you don't have to go through

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.550 
steps and you don't have to go through
that<00:04:17.400> stupid<00:04:17.880> long<00:04:18.450> cutscene<00:04:19.140> that<00:04:19.260> usually

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
that stupid long cutscene that usually

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.900 
that stupid long cutscene that usually
happens<00:04:19.919> when<00:04:20.039> you<00:04:20.130> go<00:04:20.220> back<00:04:20.370> in<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.669> story

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
happens when you go back in the story

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.360 
happens when you go back in the story
mode<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.359> my<00:04:22.049> opinion<00:04:22.470> this<00:04:22.740> I'm<00:04:23.039> definitely

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
mode and my opinion this I'm definitely

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
mode and my opinion this I'm definitely
going<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.700> be<00:04:23.760> using<00:04:23.910> this<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.120> lot<00:04:24.240> more

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
going to be using this a lot more

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.540 
going to be using this a lot more

the air but then you kind of slide out
you<00:04:49.120> gotta<00:04:49.270> sort<00:04:49.870> of<00:04:49.960> make<00:04:50.229> it<00:04:50.259> so<00:04:50.680> where<00:04:50.830> the

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
you gotta sort of make it so where the

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.950 
you gotta sort of make it so where the
bike<00:04:51.190> doesn't<00:04:51.820> like<00:04:52.330> it's<00:04:52.479> not<00:04:52.600> on<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.810> edge

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
cargobob hop in the car then you just

hop on the side of the car go Bob and
from<00:05:02.919> here<00:05:03.280> you<00:05:03.460> know<00:05:03.669> you<00:05:03.729> mean<00:05:04.240> now

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
from here you know you mean now

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.020 
from here you know you mean now
obviously<00:05:04.810> if<00:05:05.110> the<00:05:05.320> guy<00:05:05.470> is<00:05:05.530> driving<00:05:05.979> if<00:05:06.880> he

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
obviously if the guy is driving if he

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.540 
obviously if the guy is driving if he
does<00:05:07.210> it<00:05:07.449> hits<00:05:07.720> any<00:05:07.900> poles<00:05:08.139> or<00:05:08.410> does<00:05:09.340> some

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
does it hits any poles or does some

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.939 
does it hits any poles or does some
crazy<00:05:09.759> maneuver<00:05:10.599> then<00:05:11.110> you<00:05:11.349> might<00:05:11.620> fall<00:05:11.919> off

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
crazy maneuver then you might fall off

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:13.950 
crazy maneuver then you might fall off
but<00:05:12.340> for<00:05:12.639> the<00:05:12.699> most<00:05:12.880> part<00:05:13.000> you<00:05:13.419> stay<00:05:13.479> pretty

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
but for the most part you stay pretty

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.749 
but for the most part you stay pretty
much<00:05:14.110> on<00:05:14.289> there<00:05:14.530> it's<00:05:14.680> like<00:05:14.800> kind<00:05:15.490> of<00:05:15.639> when

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 
much on there it's like kind of when

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:16.800 
much on there it's like kind of when
you're<00:05:15.880> on<00:05:15.970> the<00:05:16.000> SWAT<00:05:16.270> van<00:05:16.539> and<00:05:16.720> you're

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.330 
you're on the SWAT van and you're
driving<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:17.410> kind<00:05:17.620> of<00:05:17.680> just<00:05:17.830> stick<00:05:18.070> on<00:05:18.220> the

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
driving you kind of just stick on the

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.790 
driving you kind of just stick on the
top<00:05:18.550> but<00:05:19.389> it's<00:05:19.539> neat<00:05:19.720> because<00:05:19.960> you<00:05:20.289> can<00:05:20.500> now

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
top but it's neat because you can now

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.680 
top but it's neat because you can now
have<00:05:21.099> more<00:05:21.340> people<00:05:21.580> in<00:05:21.849> the<00:05:21.880> car<00:05:22.120> go<00:05:22.270> Bob<00:05:22.419> I

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
have more people in the car go Bob I

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.240 
have more people in the car go Bob I
don't<00:05:23.080> know<00:05:23.169> how<00:05:23.259> many<00:05:23.289> it<00:05:23.620> holds<00:05:23.889> normally<00:05:24.190> I

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
don't know how many it holds normally I

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.529 
don't know how many it holds normally I
think<00:05:24.370> it's<00:05:24.490> like<00:05:24.580> six<00:05:24.880> or<00:05:25.000> something<00:05:25.150> but<00:05:25.449> you

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
think it's like six or something but you

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.210 
think it's like six or something but you
can<00:05:25.690> obviously<00:05:26.110> put<00:05:26.650> more<00:05:26.800> people<00:05:26.949> on<00:05:27.099> the

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
can obviously put more people on the

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.730 
can obviously put more people on the
side<00:05:27.430> now<00:05:27.699> and<00:05:27.940> then<00:05:28.570> also<00:05:28.810> if<00:05:29.349> you're<00:05:29.530> on<00:05:29.650> the

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
side now and then also if you're on the

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.800 
side now and then also if you're on the
side<00:05:29.919> and<00:05:30.190> you<00:05:30.759> shoot<00:05:31.000> things<00:05:31.270> you<00:05:31.510> don't<00:05:31.690> get

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
side and you shoot things you don't get

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.390 
side and you shoot things you don't get
star<00:05:32.050> or<00:05:32.289> you<00:05:32.470> get<00:05:32.620> stars<00:05:32.919> but<00:05:33.099> the<00:05:33.190> people

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
star or you get stars but the people

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.589 
star or you get stars but the people
inside<00:05:33.760> don't<00:05:34.030> get<00:05:34.150> started<00:05:34.419> so<00:05:34.479> that's

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
inside don't get started so that's

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.149 
inside don't get started so that's
another<00:05:34.780> neat<00:05:35.080> little<00:05:35.229> thing<00:05:35.530> that<00:05:35.949> happens

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159 
another neat little thing that happens

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:38.550 
another neat little thing that happens
and<00:05:36.880> then<00:05:37.000> also<00:05:37.210> you<00:05:37.389> can<00:05:37.630> use<00:05:37.659> like<00:05:37.960> rockets

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
and then also you can use like rockets

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.930 
and then also you can use like rockets
and<00:05:38.800> snipers<00:05:39.250> and<00:05:39.280> stuff<00:05:39.520> like<00:05:39.580> that<00:05:39.639> where

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
and snipers and stuff like that where

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.580 
and snipers and stuff like that where
normally<00:05:40.300> if<00:05:40.330> you<00:05:40.599> just<00:05:40.780> sat<00:05:40.900> on<00:05:40.930> the<00:05:41.080> side<00:05:41.289> you

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
normally if you just sat on the side you

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.170 
normally if you just sat on the side you
can<00:05:41.740> just<00:05:41.860> use<00:05:41.889> your<00:05:42.070> lmg<00:05:42.520> so<00:05:42.760> I<00:05:42.789> think<00:05:42.880> it's<00:05:43.120> a

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
can just use your lmg so I think it's a

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.399 
can just use your lmg so I think it's a
pretty<00:05:43.330> cool<00:05:43.539> or<00:05:43.900> neat<00:05:44.139> little<00:05:44.289> thing

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409 
pretty cool or neat little thing

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.379 
pretty cool or neat little thing
especially<00:05:44.770> if<00:05:45.400> nobody<00:05:45.729> knows<00:05:45.940> about<00:05:46.120> it<00:05:46.240> and

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
especially if nobody knows about it and

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:47.700 
especially if nobody knows about it and
you're<00:05:46.539> lobbying<00:05:46.690> you're<00:05:46.960> just<00:05:47.110> like<00:05:47.260> chillin

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
you're lobbying you're just like chillin

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.430 
you're lobbying you're just like chillin
on<00:05:47.770> the<00:05:47.830> side<00:05:48.090> it's<00:05:49.090> really<00:05:49.270> cool<00:05:49.510> and<00:05:49.750> it

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
on the side it's really cool and it

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.750 
on the side it's really cool and it
definitely<00:05:50.620> is<00:05:50.889> a<00:05:50.919> lot<00:05:51.099> easier<00:05:51.310> if<00:05:51.669> you're

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
definitely is a lot easier if you're

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.250 
definitely is a lot easier if you're
trying<00:05:52.000> to<00:05:52.090> get<00:05:52.240> away<00:05:52.360> from<00:05:52.479> other<00:05:52.690> people<00:05:52.810> or
