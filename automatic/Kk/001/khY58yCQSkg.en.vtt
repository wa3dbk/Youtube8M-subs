00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.059
 Welcome to the film analysis 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.269
 today with photos of david robert mitchum 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.580
 This movie is called it 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.119
 maybe the best horror movie of the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.609
 year 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.550
 Mitchel lever the genre on a whole 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.220
 another new level of it follows is one 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.699
 bow to the famous models 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.880
 the teenage fear and the horror 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.030
 brought together 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.040
 all that is right and then discuss 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.620
 many more critics and spectators 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.930
 if this movie maybe a very 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.820
 conservative statement 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.930
 but with this judgment you have to 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.829
 be careful 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.140
 what is a 19-year-old named jay? 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.940
 and her friends and friends live 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.809
 in suburban detroit 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:59.010
 she has a date with you and she has 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.280
 sex afterwards obviously animal however young 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.949
 that he will give her a curse 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.140
 after sleeping with her 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:13.049
 be it afterwards and this comes 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.430
 always new in a new shape 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.869
 she once as an old woman as a big man 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.930
 but this can also be done by 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.590
 friends show up and this behind it 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.439
 you her 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.689
 and to get rid of it, she has to 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.030
 sleep around with someone else again 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.280
 to transfer the curse, so to speak 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.420
 that too, whatever 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.950
 designed it if it gets too close 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.960
 Killing them will do the whole thing 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.820
 conflict then so strong that they do so 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.140
 is somehow forced to act 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.600
 can not just say good then 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.909
 I do not have sex anymore and then I am 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.470
 All good but she has to have sex around 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.170
 to get rid of this 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.520
 So it's not that easy 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.229
 curse to get rid of 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.899
 but it is also not so easy these 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.060
 curse to be considered as punishment 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.250
 that's an old horror 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.710
 tradition so who has sex is in 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.190
 We punish any kind of punishment 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.170
 us also the example of idiotic 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.940
 politicians who acted as aids so 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.820
 said that they said that was now 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.210
 punish god for gay sex im 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.470
 horrorfilm genre has this lustful 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.780
 Lustfeindlichkeit already a long time 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.270
 tradition permissive girls and 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.070
 Selfish breakers often need for her 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.810
 Pay for vicious lives 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.230
 but it is really to ask if that 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.870
 here again the message of the film is 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.940
 that would be pretty wrong in my eyes 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.870
 It's totally easy to blame 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.600
 because it follows it does imitate this 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.430
 However, discourse is not unquestioned because 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.100
 Finally, the times have changed 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.820
 changed and above all tells us about it 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.820
 this movie 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.650
 already the slow documentary 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.200
 acting camera rides and the 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.660
 lackluster inertia radiating 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.450
 environment reflects the lethargy of 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.880
 teenager again drives you to 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.910
 Refreshment in a water tub times 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.670
 look at the friends a few old b 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.500
 but actually they vegetate 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.800
 only around there is not more 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.450
 to feel any vitality around 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.180
 School cock would say these teens 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.860
 are tired all honor mountain would say 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.110
 they are exhausted 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.930
 the teens are not like in the past 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.310
 filmed, motivated and motivated 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.580
 looking for constantly new 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.800
 Sexual adventures all these teens 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.980
 are members of the white middle class 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.580
 sedate dispassionate and extreme 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.920
 passive 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.410
 even if they are being followed by 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.380
 which zombie behave behaving 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.360
 make them run away briefly but soon 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.250
 they are already racing again 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.989
 Of course, the whole leaves one 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.650
 psychoanalytic meaning too 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.239
 So it followed that you were happy 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.269
 Of course, the wavering could easily 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.239
 shape it as identifying as that 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:09.900
 you desire yourself but you wonder where 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:12.269
 the heck is the superego and so 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.890
 the question is where are the parents the 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.680
 teachers the priests etc 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.810
 these representations of the above me 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.180
 play no role in the movie you 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.669
 partly do not occur at all 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.800
 there are no restrictive adults 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.860
 the abstinence of the young 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.290
 demand or so and straight and straight 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.870
 abstemious one had once sex 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.090
 one may not want to be, jay 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.750
 then it has to survive with others 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.390
 sleeping men listlessly follows then too 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.880
 this command what the young people there 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.919
 not that it will be followed 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.270
 it would be lustful and frivolous 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.600
 seductively show 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.620
 but only leached out 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.050
 inexorable shape 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.229
 They are the embodiment of a principle 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.540
 or an ideology, that is 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.099
 when they shape the embodiment 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.140
 of the remainder 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:07.640
 the one with vehemence in the 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.640
 promote promiscuity 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.530
 that it only appears the sexual drive 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.590
 lapsed is not exhausted only 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.810
 see the city but also the eros 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.630
 we are not here our post sexual 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.260
 age children is therefore the app of 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.500
 hour 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.570
 much more exciting than the realized sex 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.300
 For many, that is actually what it is 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.550
 in the app so this match if 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.250
 the flashing one has here and there 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.950
 still a bit of sex but this sex 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.440
 then itself is completely unspectacular 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.930
 and tiring that the movie does not even 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.900
 more the scene only slightly shows 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:52.380
 When the young woman sex with three men 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.090
 that speaks volumes on a lake 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.610
 even the young prostitute we 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.770
 look bored once seeing 3 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.200
 this generation may just have 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.910
 because of over sexualization that 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.310
 interest in sex lost 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.730
 At the same time there is the call of 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.980
 I ask about sex everywhere 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.630
 in advertising of pornography in 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.440
 We become lifestyle magazine 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.169
 Must 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.930
 that's sexy so you have her or him 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:21.300
 try everything out is open 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.669
 So these are the ones that always shape 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.950
 We also emerge from the 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:29.400
 We are constantly becoming aware of reality 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:32.669
 threatened by the imperative try it out 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.430
 Make it sex because the wonderful 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.740
 related to halloween to texas chainsaw 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.620
 massacre and of course to larry clark 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.840
 the already youthful showed the 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.580
 Although highly sexualized but are the 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.010
 Maybe it was already disappearing 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.830
 is understood at all is fully busy 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.919
 but a tremendously current film 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.990
 in the past, one went to the psychoanalyst 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:57.660
 the restrictive about getting rid of me 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.580
 and finally be able to live promiscuous 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.950
 today psychoanalysts are above all 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.750
 busy explaining to patients 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.400
 that they do not have to live everything they do 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.290
 Do not have sex with five women 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.270
 at the same time they have it okay if 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.300
 you do not have sex and you have to 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.890
 not every tip from a guidebook 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.560
 you can not say so far 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:19.169
 that the film is conservative he shows 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.460
 only and that makes it so great ours 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:22.410
 today's dilemma 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.050
 we can not do it like that 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.509
 Embassy 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:28.120
 Her horror films were abstemious 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:29.740
 Sex has become the highest duty 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.259
 the real horror of this movie is 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.330
 hence the one true love relationship 

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:37.629
 is made impossible because of the above-me 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:40.720
 a permanent openness with vehemence 

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:44.110
 a shimmer of hope demands that 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.879
 However, in the end it was rare that the 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.250
 dialectics of the so-called sexual 

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:51.069
 liberation as well in pictures as 

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:53.710
 it would be easy to say in it now 

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:57.270
 that's too conservative for me 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.270
 but only does not look
