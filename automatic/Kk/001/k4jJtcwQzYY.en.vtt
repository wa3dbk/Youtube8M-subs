an<00:01:11.799> alternative<00:01:12.460> here<00:01:12.640> is<00:01:12.759> Bishop<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.180> c5

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
an alternative here is Bishop to c5

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.389 
an alternative here is Bishop to c5
which<00:01:13.899> leads<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.439> Traxler<00:01:14.950> counter

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
which leads to the Traxler counter

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.139 
which leads to the Traxler counter
gambit<00:01:15.790> but<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:17.020> Traxler<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:18.670> been<00:01:18.880> heavily

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
gambit but the Traxler it's been heavily

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.700 
gambit but the Traxler it's been heavily
analyzed<00:01:19.659> heavily<00:01:20.140> studied<00:01:20.350> but<00:01:20.979> a<00:01:21.340> recent

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
analyzed heavily studied but a recent

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.749 
analyzed heavily studied but a recent
analysis<00:01:23.710> shows<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.159> after<00:01:24.310> Bishop<00:01:24.610> takes

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
analysis shows that after Bishop takes

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.929 
analysis shows that after Bishop takes
f7<00:01:25.299> keen<00:01:25.630> e7<00:01:26.170> Bishop<00:01:26.799> d5<00:01:27.159> this<00:01:27.399> position<00:01:27.820> is

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
f7 keen e7 Bishop d5 this position is

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.240 
f7 keen e7 Bishop d5 this position is
better<00:01:28.119> for<00:01:28.390> white<00:01:28.570> there<00:01:29.469> are<00:01:29.500> some<00:01:29.710> analysis

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
better for white there are some analysis

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.370 
better for white there are some analysis
between<00:01:30.549> Billy<00:01:31.090> offski<00:01:31.539> and<00:01:31.689> Anand<00:01:31.960> in<00:01:32.259> the

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
between Billy offski and Anand in the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.779 
between Billy offski and Anand in the
informant<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:32.979> you<00:01:33.189> could<00:01:33.369> find

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.130 

alternatively<00:01:36.789> my<00:01:37.240> recommendation<00:01:37.960> would<00:01:38.079> be

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
alternatively my recommendation would be

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.469 
alternatively my recommendation would be
to<00:01:38.229> play<00:01:38.469> d4<00:01:38.920> for<00:01:39.159> white<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.520> then<00:01:39.939> to<00:01:40.119> capture

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
to play d4 for white and then to capture

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.200 
to play d4 for white and then to capture
on<00:01:40.570> f7<00:01:40.869> this<00:01:41.140> gives<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:41.469> a<00:01:41.530> more<00:01:41.680> lively<00:01:42.210> more

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
on f7 this gives you a more lively more

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.419 
on f7 this gives you a more lively more
lively<00:01:43.539> play<00:01:43.770> because<00:01:44.770> qualitatively

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
lively play because qualitatively

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.190 
lively play because qualitatively
speaking<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.000> pattern<00:01:46.329> of<00:01:46.450> seven<00:01:46.659> is<00:01:46.929> more

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
speaking the pattern of seven is more

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.620 
speaking the pattern of seven is more
valuable<00:01:47.530> than<00:01:47.799> the<00:01:47.920> pawn<00:01:48.130> on<00:01:48.280> d4<00:01:48.640> because

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
valuable than the pawn on d4 because

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.380 
valuable than the pawn on d4 because
even<00:01:49.869> though<00:01:50.049> the<00:01:50.829> f7<00:01:51.250> pawn<00:01:51.399> is<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.850> winged<00:01:52.149> pond

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
even though the f7 pawn is a winged pond

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.779 
even though the f7 pawn is a winged pond
or<00:01:52.570> a<00:01:52.630> flank<00:01:52.899> pawn<00:01:53.170> it's<00:01:53.460> taking<00:01:54.460> away<00:01:54.640> the

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
or a flank pawn it's taking away the

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.200 
or a flank pawn it's taking away the
possibility<00:01:55.450> of<00:01:55.479> counseling<00:01:56.079> for<00:01:56.799> black<00:01:57.429> so

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
possibility of counseling for black so

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.840 
possibility of counseling for black so
going<00:01:58.659> back<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:59.859> the<00:01:59.979> initial<00:02:00.130> position<00:02:00.429> after

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
going back to the initial position after

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.450 
going back to the initial position after
d5<00:02:01.420> we<00:02:02.140> have<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.439> sacrifice<00:02:02.679> a<00:02:03.009> pawn<00:02:03.280> because

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
d5 we have to sacrifice a pawn because

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.819

white can play Knight takes f7 here and
the<00:02:11.890> theory<00:02:12.220> says<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.489> this<00:02:12.819> leads<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.180> a

the theory says that this leads to a

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.670 
the theory says that this leads to a
draw<00:02:13.629> but

Bishop to b7 and at one point a
centralized<00:05:08.850> this<00:05:09.060> Knight<00:05:09.300> and<00:05:09.690> obviously

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
centralized this Knight and obviously

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.780 
centralized this Knight and obviously
he's<00:05:10.470> not<00:05:10.620> playing<00:05:10.919> for<00:05:11.070> exchanges<00:05:11.640> he's

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
he's not playing for exchanges he's

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.040 
he's not playing for exchanges he's
planning<00:05:12.090> for<00:05:14.390> activity<00:05:15.390> in<00:05:15.419> the<00:05:15.600> position

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
planning for activity in the position

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.860 
planning for activity in the position
and<00:05:16.230> so<00:05:16.800> he<00:05:17.640> you<00:05:17.970> know<00:05:18.090> that's<00:05:18.330> what<00:05:18.510> he<00:05:18.570> has<00:05:18.720> to

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
and so he you know that's what he has to

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.240 
and so he you know that's what he has to
follow<00:05:19.050> he<00:05:19.320> has<00:05:19.440> to<00:05:19.590> follow<00:05:19.740> those<00:05:20.040> principles

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
follow he has to follow those principles

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.050 
follow he has to follow those principles
keep<00:05:21.150> those<00:05:21.300> principles<00:05:21.780> in<00:05:21.930> mind

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
keep those principles in mind

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.030 
keep those principles in mind
so<00:05:24.060> after<00:05:24.360> d4<00:05:24.810> which<00:05:24.990> is<00:05:25.140> the<00:05:25.230> main<00:05:25.410> move<00:05:25.650> black

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
so after d4 which is the main move black

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.970 
so after d4 which is the main move black
typically<00:05:26.580> recaptures<00:05:27.240> on<00:05:27.419> d3<00:05:27.600> a<00:05:27.990> knight<00:05:28.230> a<00:05:28.440> c3

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
typically recaptures on d3 a knight a c3

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.960 
typically recaptures on d3 a knight a c3

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
and after Queen c7 b3 and castles we

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.159 
and after Queen c7 b3 and castles we
could<00:05:33.090> see<00:05:33.270> that<00:05:33.419> black<00:05:33.660> has<00:05:33.900> enough

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
could see that black has enough

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:35.960 
could see that black has enough
compensation<00:05:34.560> for<00:05:35.070> the<00:05:35.160> pawn<00:05:35.370> given<00:05:35.700> to<00:05:35.850> the

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.210 
fact that he's ahead and development
there<00:05:38.070> a<00:05:38.810> of<00:05:39.810> ridiculous<00:05:40.530> amount<00:05:40.830> of<00:05:40.890> open

he'll<00:05:43.020> be<00:05:43.169> he<00:05:43.560> should<00:05:43.770> be<00:05:43.890> able<00:05:44.010> to<00:05:44.160> drum<00:05:44.430> up

he'll be he should be able to drum up

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.909 
he'll be he should be able to drum up
