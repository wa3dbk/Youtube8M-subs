change the controls to three different

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.190 
change the controls to three different
ways<00:00:40.059> I'm<00:00:40.270> going<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.480> stick<00:00:40.660> with<00:00:40.720> the<00:00:40.960> tilt

ways I'm going to stick with the tilt

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.170 
ways I'm going to stick with the tilt
because<00:00:41.380> this<00:00:42.130> is<00:00:42.310> one<00:00:42.460> of<00:00:42.580> the<00:00:42.670> few<00:00:42.970> games

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
because this is one of the few games

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.840 
because this is one of the few games
that<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.750> tilt<00:00:44.020> actually<00:00:44.770> is<00:00:45.310> a<00:00:45.370> lot<00:00:45.640> of<00:00:45.760> fun

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
that the tilt actually is a lot of fun

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.760 
that the tilt actually is a lot of fun
to<00:00:46.000> play<00:00:46.180> with<00:00:46.360> so<00:00:46.420> I'm<00:00:46.900> planted<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.590> weird

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
actually a progressive level type game

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.840 
actually a progressive level type game
where<00:03:25.540> after<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:26.630> killed<00:03:26.959> all<00:03:27.320> of<00:03:27.350> the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
where after you killed all of the

where after you killed all of the
monsters<00:03:28.850> in<00:03:29.420> one<00:03:29.450> section<00:03:30.100> you<00:03:31.100> move<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.790> the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
monsters in one section you move to the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.860 
monsters in one section you move to the
right<00:03:32.120> or<00:03:32.299> to<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:32.450> left<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.989> got<00:03:33.920> some<00:03:34.280> more

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
right or to the left and got some more

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.140 
right or to the left and got some more
monsters<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.980> it'd<00:03:37.430> be<00:03:37.519> nicer<00:03:37.820> if<00:03:37.850> the<00:03:38.000> game

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
monsters and it'd be nicer if the game

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.539 
monsters and it'd be nicer if the game
was<00:03:38.269> a<00:03:38.299> little<00:03:38.510> longer<00:03:38.690> it's<00:03:38.930> it's<00:03:39.140> only<00:03:39.549> five

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
was a little longer it's it's only five

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.990 
was a little longer it's it's only five
levels<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.680> whole<00:03:42.860> goal<00:03:43.160> is<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:43.820> within

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
levels and the whole goal is to within

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.699 
levels and the whole goal is to within
that<00:03:44.209> five<00:03:44.420> levels<00:03:44.810> maximize<00:03:45.380> your<00:03:45.530> score

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
that five levels maximize your score

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.009 
that five levels maximize your score
which<00:03:46.340> is<00:03:46.519> a<00:03:46.549> nice<00:03:47.239> way<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:47.540> keep<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:47.900> game

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
which is a nice way to keep the game

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.479 
which is a nice way to keep the game
short<00:03:48.760> but<00:03:49.760> also<00:03:50.829> you<00:03:51.829> know<00:03:51.950> keep<00:03:52.160> you<00:03:52.250> coming

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
short but also you know keep you coming

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:53.770 
short but also you know keep you coming
back<00:03:52.519> for<00:03:52.670> more<00:03:52.910> but<00:03:53.060> it'd<00:03:53.180> be<00:03:53.269> nice<00:03:53.450> if<00:03:53.480> there

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
back for more but it'd be nice if there

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.229 
back for more but it'd be nice if there
was<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:53.930> longer<00:03:54.380> version<00:03:54.560> with<00:03:55.010> a<00:03:55.239> more

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
was a longer version with a more

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.920
