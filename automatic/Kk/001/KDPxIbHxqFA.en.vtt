00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:33.279
 I will not repeat now 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:35.949

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:43.660
 I know October Chen Yong again do not turn it over 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:46.430
 yeah well the problem is not sniffling turned over 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.220
 there was such a bald man that was smiling 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.230
 took off his helmet and there it was to this network to 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.380
 there is this red red car this 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:57.060
 this bald man's car you don't know 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:02.300
 how not normal 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:04.980
 it's okay to bring everything back x c 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.480
 I really don't know the guys, I repaired 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.910
 yes now before me and the battle why me 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.380
 only reads in different directions I do not know 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.200
 like a camera 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:19.410
 switch the essence of this all 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.360
 to win every car there is like 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.940
 would be a unique opportunity 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.500
 This is a good defense of the one that 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:30.540
 back, you can well, that is, more big 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.419
 ram each has its own peculiarity 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:37.550
 every car and now I have a hike 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.550
 now studying for do it 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:46.289
 in general, I do not know the whole point 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:51.419
 and there is still some kind of gleaming face 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:58.710
 good quality well, let's say now 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:07:02.819
 let 's try to merge everything to the end 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:07.560
 ready still alive but my movement is bad 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:10.409
 engine now try to think yes here 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:13.199
 the wheels are already staggering again in the second 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:16.379
 it was also as I understood it and so armageddon 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.159
 A new version of how I was looking for a grinder decker 

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:20.250
 2000 

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:21.360
 as far as I remember, in general, we are all with 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.389
 you saw 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.469
 a game as unusual as it is a little 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:29.300
 distraction from sampo 

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:29.300
 mastered the layout all bye
