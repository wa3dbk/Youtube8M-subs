 around 8am unlock 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.770
 jack 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.770
 as well as the pool for why change 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.100
 and then it goes on but I forgot 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.410
 in 35 years

 and his cross the pulp and paper and if the fights 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.610
 it's a little stupid because we can not have changed them from a jack 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.800
 sector 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.800

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.510
 the small seams that hurt m's ears according to the site 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.750
 both created a huge career in a green era 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:07.500
 always the same crappy shell 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.130
 must be because frankly for the least week jules he was jealous 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.649
 stock markets in its subsidiaries 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.779
 that's all but frankly romance and 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:20.379
 it shows that he is very small 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.390
 so if you offer a new one have one especially bought a copy 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.519
 the essential accessory for products 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.249
 g heroin the beast 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:41.569
 so that the last update me I come from the farm although young 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.009
 the lock 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:44.899
 a small search screen 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:45.719
 so 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:47.099
 we want 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.670

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:59.910
 disney 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.349
 and search possibilities on the web as well as what wikipedia 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.839
 so it's really good focus 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:08.589
 if you have lost something where you are looking for something and you have 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:09.969
 the laziness of looking 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.819
 it's really good 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.309
 so that's American so that's the foie gras and a connection 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:17.839
 internet -which finished 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.839

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.500

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.940

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.579

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.579
 the dictaphone that are absolutely nothing of the pup and micro 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:36.739
 so committing a mistake 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.650
 she and her father facebook 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.519
 so that's small applications I added 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.369
 belote 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:46.559
 music so that the poles 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.769
 the safari the browser where you are 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.269
 from the pole 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.840
 as well as the app store it's the side changed all your apps 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.030

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:00.279
 lille 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.279
 the loaded side of music and your videos 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:08.219
 so here at lahore after what can I come with a 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.259
 % 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:13.959
 the German plan 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.579

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.239
 many times I'm not too fan 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.239
 according to you have game it's really good too 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.169

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.050
 the cabri what is it dassier 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.110
 unlocking on a little say 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.949
 ipod 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.800
 it allows to install applications without paying them 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.340
 because I do not know but batista allowed applications cichero by m 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.520
 so that's it over 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.559
 unlocking we can say ap 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:02.460

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.419
 alas for them a pointy app in places 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:21.780
