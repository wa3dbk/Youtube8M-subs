00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:55.720
 It is the opening last place 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:59.500
 Well I think items may come out since that time, and I think it is easy to reverse the early stage because everyone is fixed 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:05.110
 Yes I think positively 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:07.659

 I went around because I thought it was rather 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.300
 Hmm 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.230

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.680
 Then there was nothing from the last minute 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.090

 Even though I loved it most 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.720
 It is not 6 standard 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.790
 Yeah yeah 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:56.549
 It's because of the painful ne de m
