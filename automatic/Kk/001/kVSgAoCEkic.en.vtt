up using the Ulta mark RGB encoder I had
some<00:00:19.380> issues<00:00:19.680> with<00:00:19.710> grounding<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.520> I

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
some issues with grounding that I

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.040 
some issues with grounding that I
figured<00:00:21.600> out<00:00:21.750> now<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:23.310> RF<00:00:23.640> power<00:00:24.449> brick<00:00:24.869> has

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
figured out now the RF power brick has

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.349 
figured out now the RF power brick has
been<00:00:25.230> removed<00:00:25.529> now<00:00:26.490> i'm<00:00:26.609> running<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> nes

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
been removed now i'm running the nes

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.650 
been removed now i'm running the nes
directly<00:00:27.779> off<00:00:27.900> 5<00:00:28.170> volts<00:00:28.970> which<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.179> pulled<00:00:30.510> off

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
directly off 5 volts which is pulled off

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.799 
directly off 5 volts which is pulled off
the<00:00:30.929> jamming<00:00:31.710> edge<00:00:31.830> connector<00:00:32.340> here<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the jamming edge connector here on the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.069 
the jamming edge connector here on the
other<00:00:33.840> side<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.860> know<00:00:35.010> just<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> cart

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
other side you know just the cart

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.139 
other side you know just the cart
amounts<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:41.280> I've<00:00:41.370> got<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.670> down<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.879> just
