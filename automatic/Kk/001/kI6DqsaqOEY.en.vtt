in<00:00:03.500> this<00:00:03.860> tutorial<00:00:04.100> we<00:00:04.880> are<00:00:05.270> making<00:00:06.370> this<00:00:07.720> dull

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.190 
in this tutorial we are making this dull

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.680 
in this tutorial we are making this dull
computer<00:00:10.190> chairs<00:00:12.640> position<00:00:13.640> you<00:00:13.790> dull<00:00:14.030> at<00:00:14.330> the

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
computer chairs position you dull at the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.890 
computer chairs position you dull at the
90<00:00:15.230> degree<00:00:15.460> take<00:00:16.460> a<00:00:16.490> piece<00:00:16.820> of<00:00:17.000> cardboard<00:00:17.390> you

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
90 degree take a piece of cardboard you

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.870 
90 degree take a piece of cardboard you
need<00:00:18.590> space<00:00:19.000> from<00:00:20.000> both<00:00:20.420> sides<00:00:21.070> the<00:00:22.070> chair<00:00:22.430> has

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
need space from both sides the chair has

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.540 
need space from both sides the chair has
to<00:00:22.910> reach<00:00:23.390> her<00:00:23.660> needs<00:00:23.990> and<00:00:24.289> certainly<00:00:25.190> not

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
to reach her needs and certainly not

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.060 
to reach her needs and certainly not
should<00:00:26.240> not<00:00:26.270> be<00:00:26.480> longer<00:00:27.020> than<00:00:27.170> that<00:00:27.230> in

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
should not be longer than that in

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.630 
should not be longer than that in
addition<00:00:28.670> we<00:00:28.970> want<00:00:29.180> a<00:00:29.570> rounded<00:00:30.140> edges<00:00:30.680> I<00:00:30.920> will

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
addition we want a rounded edges I will

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.119 
addition we want a rounded edges I will
make<00:00:31.850> these<00:00:32.149> corners<00:00:32.719> perfectly<00:00:33.109> round<00:00:33.800> and

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
make these corners perfectly round and

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.020 
make these corners perfectly round and
here<00:00:35.030> I<00:00:35.179> will<00:00:35.479> take<00:00:35.749> off<00:00:36.050> a<00:00:36.379> triangle<00:00:37.339> and<00:00:37.519> then

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
here I will take off a triangle and then

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.299 
here I will take off a triangle and then
round<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.260> corners<00:00:39.649> as<00:00:39.859> well<00:00:40.089> cut<00:00:41.089> it<00:00:41.269> out<00:00:41.539> the

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.629 

back<00:00:46.309> of<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.639> chair<00:00:46.969> should<00:00:47.569> be<00:00:47.780> slightly

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:48.639 
back of the chair should be slightly

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:53.379 
back of the chair should be slightly
thinner<00:00:49.639> than<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.479> seat<00:00:51.760> that's<00:00:52.760> why<00:00:53.120> I<00:00:53.149> will

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:53.389 
thinner than the seat that's why I will

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:59.439 
thinner than the seat that's why I will
take<00:00:53.839> off<00:00:54.079> a<00:00:55.299> little<00:00:56.299> bit<00:00:56.709> in<00:00:57.709> our<00:00:58.249> case<00:00:58.729> it

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
take off a little bit in our case it

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.719 
take off a little bit in our case it
reaches<00:00:59.989> our<00:01:00.170> shoulders<00:01:00.649> but<00:01:00.829> it<00:01:00.949> also<00:01:01.100> can<00:01:01.519> be

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
reaches our shoulders but it also can be

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.960 
reaches our shoulders but it also can be
as<00:01:01.789> high<00:01:02.149> as<00:01:02.179> underarms<00:01:02.989> and<00:01:03.460> around<00:01:04.460> corners

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
as high as underarms and around corners

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.440 
as high as underarms and around corners
here<00:01:05.299> as<00:01:05.510> well<00:01:05.780> I<00:01:06.100> draw<00:01:07.100> a<00:01:07.130> triangle<00:01:08.000> here<00:01:08.390> and

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
here as well I draw a triangle here and

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.160 
here as well I draw a triangle here and
here<00:01:09.400> then<00:01:10.400> round<00:01:11.770> them<00:01:12.770> make<00:01:13.760> corners<00:01:14.720> round

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
here then round them make corners round

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.220 
here then round them make corners round
