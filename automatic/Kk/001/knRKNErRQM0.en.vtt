their website this is what I ordered
looked<00:02:47.600> through<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:48.320> make<00:02:48.500> sure<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.770> wasn't

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
looked through to make sure I wasn't

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.210

just<00:02:49.310> going<00:02:49.520> crazy<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:51.110> wanted<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.590> see<00:02:51.890> if

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
just going crazy and I wanted to see if

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.120 
just going crazy and I wanted to see if
indeed<00:02:53.320> this<00:02:54.320> picture<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:57.470> what<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:57.680> ordered

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130

indeed this picture is what I ordered
and<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.459> is<00:02:58.810> I<00:02:59.830> guess<00:03:01.180> there's<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.300> situation

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
and it is I guess there's a situation

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.520 
and it is I guess there's a situation
where<00:03:03.350> they<00:03:03.560> say<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.280> doesn't<00:03:04.700> the

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
where they say that it doesn't the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.810 
where they say that it doesn't the
picture<00:03:06.530> may<00:03:06.709> not<00:03:06.920> match<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.280> product<00:03:07.489> you

picture may not match the product you
actually<00:03:08.180> received<00:03:08.540> but<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:08.720> doesn't<00:03:09.049> say

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
actually received but it doesn't say

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.259 
actually received but it doesn't say
that<00:03:09.380> anywhere<00:03:09.410> on<00:03:09.739> their<00:03:09.920> website<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.640> took<00:03:11.180> a

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.759 
that anywhere on their website I took a
little<00:03:11.450> bit<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.750> a<00:03:11.840> risk<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:12.320> I<00:03:12.350> was<00:03:12.500> worried

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
little bit of a risk and I was worried

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.460 
little bit of a risk and I was worried
about<00:03:12.830> this<00:03:13.160> when<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:13.340> was<00:03:13.459> buying<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.970> on<00:03:14.470> eBay

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
about this when I was buying it on eBay

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.259 
about this when I was buying it on eBay
they<00:03:15.799> had<00:03:16.010> them<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.489> it<00:03:16.640> had<00:03:16.850> this<00:03:17.000> same

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
they had them and it had this same

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.229 
they had them and it had this same
picture<00:03:17.690> for<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:17.989> XR<00:03:18.380> 400<00:03:18.980> as<00:03:19.130> well<00:03:19.310> but<00:03:20.180> I

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
picture for the XR 400 as well but I

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.280 
picture for the XR 400 as well but I
need<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:20.780> thought<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.739> had<00:03:22.100> known<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:23.290> usually

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
need I thought I had known that usually

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.770 
need I thought I had known that usually
the<00:03:24.440> XR<00:03:24.799> 400<00:03:25.340> fenders<00:03:25.730> looked<00:03:26.030> kind<00:03:26.510> of<00:03:26.600> like<00:03:26.660> a

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
the XR 400 fenders looked kind of like a

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.699 
the XR 400 fenders looked kind of like a
mix<00:03:27.110> anywhere<00:03:27.890> between<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:29.049> CRF<00:03:30.049> and<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.290> XR

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
mix anywhere between the CRF and the XR

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.190 
mix anywhere between the CRF and the XR
fender<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.280> that's<00:03:32.090> exactly<00:03:32.390> what<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:32.750> got<00:03:32.959> if

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
fender and that's exactly what I got if

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.350 
fender and that's exactly what I got if
you<00:03:33.350> look<00:03:35.049> that<00:03:36.049> clearly<00:03:36.650> isn't<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.850> same

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
you look that clearly isn't the same

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.710 
you look that clearly isn't the same
thing<00:03:38.690> as<00:03:38.930> this<00:03:39.459> I<00:03:40.459> thought<00:03:41.090> because<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.690> was

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
thing as this I thought because it was

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.930 
thing as this I thought because it was
on<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:41.959> services<00:03:42.560> website<00:03:43.100> that<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.760> would

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
on a services website that it would

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.320 
on a services website that it would
probably<00:03:44.209> be<00:03:45.400> trustworthy<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.790> don't<00:03:47.209> know<00:03:47.299> I

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
probably be trustworthy I don't know I

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.759 
probably be trustworthy I don't know I
thought<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:48.820> that<00:03:49.820> on<00:03:50.120> a<00:03:50.180> service<00:03:50.769> website

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
thought that that on a service website

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.280 
thought that that on a service website
it<00:03:51.920> would<00:03:52.010> match<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:53.060> actual<00:03:53.330> product<00:03:53.840> but<00:03:54.110> I

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
it would match the actual product but I

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.150 
it would match the actual product but I
guess<00:03:54.500> not

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
guess not

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.280 
guess not
if<00:03:55.610> you<00:03:55.730> go<00:03:55.940> back<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.540> their<00:03:56.780> fenders<00:03:59.290> main

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
if you go back to their fenders main

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.490 
if you go back to their fenders main
page<00:04:01.329> they<00:04:02.329> all<00:04:02.510> pretty<00:04:02.750> much<00:04:02.870> look<00:04:03.019> the<00:04:03.290> same

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
page they all pretty much look the same

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.780 
page they all pretty much look the same
and<00:04:04.070> this<00:04:04.910> look<00:04:05.660> of<00:04:05.840> this<00:04:05.959> fender<00:04:06.350> to<00:04:07.280> me<00:04:07.430> looks

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
and this look of this fender to me looks

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.500 
and this look of this fender to me looks
a<00:04:07.910> lot<00:04:08.060> better<00:04:08.239> than<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.950> XR<00:04:10.340> 400<00:04:11.030> but<00:04:11.209> I<00:04:11.239> guess

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
a lot better than the XR 400 but I guess

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.940 
a lot better than the XR 400 but I guess
I'm<00:04:11.660> just<00:04:11.780> gonna<00:04:11.900> run<00:04:12.170> it<00:04:12.290> either<00:04:12.410> way<00:04:12.680> because

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
I'm just gonna run it either way because

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.910 
I'm just gonna run it either way because
it's<00:04:13.250> still<00:04:13.569> the<00:04:14.569> XR<00:04:14.959> 400<00:04:15.500> fender

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
it's still the XR 400 fender

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.199 
it's still the XR 400 fender
looks<00:04:16.239> better<00:04:17.239> than<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.930> Excel<00:04:18.620> under<00:04:19.220> XR<00:04:19.639> 650

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
looks better than the Excel under XR 650

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.520 
looks better than the Excel under XR 650
L<00:04:20.359> vendor<00:04:21.250> but<00:04:22.250> little<00:04:22.820> disappointed

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530

I<00:04:26.240> guess<00:04:26.900> just<00:04:26.930> take<00:04:27.290> this<00:04:27.440> as<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.680> warning<00:04:27.770> that

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
I guess just take this as a warning that

you're not gonna get what you think

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
the look of the stock fender on there

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.610 
the look of the stock fender on there
can't<00:04:48.530> really<00:04:48.710> see<00:04:48.950> it<00:04:49.040> from<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.310> angle<00:04:49.729> but

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
can't really see it from the angle but

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.110 
can't really see it from the angle but
it's<00:04:51.620> got<00:04:51.830> a<00:04:51.860> considerable<00:04:54.460> angle<00:04:55.460> to<00:04:55.880> the

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
it's got a considerable angle to the

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.480 
it's got a considerable angle to the

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
dangle so to speak

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.690 
dangle so to speak
it<00:04:58.880> goes<00:04:59.090> down<00:04:59.360> quite<00:04:59.720> a<00:04:59.780> bit<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.490> I<00:05:01.490> just

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
it goes down quite a bit and I just

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.980 
it goes down quite a bit and I just
don't<00:05:01.820> think<00:05:01.940> that<00:05:02.210> looks<00:05:02.450> very<00:05:02.660> good

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
don't think that looks very good

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.640 
don't think that looks very good
aesthetically<00:05:03.919> speaking<00:05:04.220> so<00:05:05.110> along<00:05:06.110> with<00:05:06.139> the

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
aesthetically speaking so along with the

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.850 
aesthetically speaking so along with the
squared<00:05:07.310> off<00:05:07.520> front<00:05:08.030> section<00:05:08.660> how<00:05:09.470> it's<00:05:09.680> not

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
squared off front section how it's not

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.450 
squared off front section how it's not
really<00:05:10.389> tapered<00:05:11.389> out<00:05:11.919> just<00:05:12.919> doesn't<00:05:13.220> look<00:05:13.310> the

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
really tapered out just doesn't look the

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.060 
really tapered out just doesn't look the
best<00:05:13.610> so<00:05:13.760> I'm<00:05:13.850> gonna<00:05:14.030> change<00:05:14.300> it<00:05:14.510> out<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:15.070> come

drill<00:05:34.100> out<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.460> rivets<00:05:34.760> that<00:05:34.910> hold<00:05:34.970> that<00:05:35.210> on

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
drill out the rivets that hold that on

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.350 
drill out the rivets that hold that on
if<00:05:36.470> you<00:05:37.130> want<00:05:37.310> to<00:05:37.430> take<00:05:37.820> it<00:05:37.970> off<00:05:38.120> without

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
if you want to take it off without

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.600 
if you want to take it off without
uninstalling<00:05:39.110> your<00:05:40.120> speedometer<00:05:41.860> wire<00:05:42.860> which

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
uninstalling your speedometer wire which

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.120 
uninstalling your speedometer wire which
I<00:05:43.940> really<00:05:44.210> didn't<00:05:44.479> feel<00:05:44.630> like<00:05:44.690> doing<00:05:45.100> so<00:05:46.100> I

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
I really didn't feel like doing so I

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.159 
I really didn't feel like doing so I
just<00:05:46.700> went<00:05:46.850> ahead<00:05:46.970> and<00:05:47.360> drilled<00:05:47.660> those<00:05:47.870> out

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
just went ahead and drilled those out

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.500 
just went ahead and drilled those out
like<00:05:48.950> I<00:05:49.100> said<00:05:49.310> it's<00:05:49.430> just<00:05:49.580> riveted<00:05:49.970> on<00:05:50.120> so<00:05:50.360> it's

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
like I said it's just riveted on so it's

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.620 
like I said it's just riveted on so it's
super<00:05:50.840> easy<00:05:50.870> and<00:05:51.760> now<00:05:52.760> I<00:05:52.789> just<00:05:52.880> need<00:05:53.150> to<00:05:53.270> decide

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
super easy and now I just need to decide

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.620 
super easy and now I just need to decide
whether<00:05:53.870> or<00:05:53.990> not<00:05:54.200> I<00:05:54.500> want<00:05:54.860> to<00:05:55.570> reinstall<00:05:56.570> that

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
whether or not I want to reinstall that

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.719 
whether or not I want to reinstall that
over<00:05:57.410> here<00:05:57.740> or<00:05:58.780> just<00:05:59.780> leave<00:05:59.960> it<00:06:00.080> the<00:06:00.200> way<00:06:00.229> it<00:06:00.410> is

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
over here or just leave it the way it is

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.310 
over here or just leave it the way it is
it's<00:06:01.729> not<00:06:01.850> like<00:06:01.910> it's<00:06:02.270> flopping<00:06:02.660> around<00:06:02.900> too

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
it's not like it's flopping around too

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.700 
it's not like it's flopping around too
much<00:06:03.560> I<00:06:03.970> wouldn't<00:06:04.970> think<00:06:05.180> that<00:06:05.560> it's<00:06:06.560> gonna

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
much I wouldn't think that it's gonna

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.159 
much I wouldn't think that it's gonna
save<00:06:07.100> you<00:06:07.310> any<00:06:07.490> more<00:06:07.700> than<00:06:07.970> what's<00:06:08.930> already

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
save you any more than what's already

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.010 
save you any more than what's already
there<00:06:09.289> so<00:06:09.880> I'm<00:06:10.880> not<00:06:10.940> too<00:06:11.270> worried<00:06:11.570> about<00:06:11.780> it<00:06:11.930> I

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
there so I'm not too worried about it I

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.900 
there so I'm not too worried about it I
may<00:06:12.200> end<00:06:12.560> up<00:06:12.740> reinstalling<00:06:13.400> it<00:06:13.610> all<00:06:13.700> you<00:06:13.820> got

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
may end up reinstalling it all you got

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.360 
may end up reinstalling it all you got
to<00:06:14.030> do<00:06:14.150> is<00:06:14.270> drill<00:06:14.510> out<00:06:14.630> holes<00:06:14.660> and<00:06:15.250> rivet<00:06:16.250> it

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
to do is drill out holes and rivet it

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.810 
to do is drill out holes and rivet it
but<00:06:16.639> seeing<00:06:17.570> a<00:06:17.690> different<00:06:18.050> look<00:06:18.820> different

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
but seeing a different look different

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:25.750 
but seeing a different look different
view<00:06:20.210> I<00:06:21.039> think<00:06:22.039> it<00:06:22.460> looks<00:06:22.669> a<00:06:22.789> lot<00:06:22.880> better<00:06:24.760> more

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
view I think it looks a lot better more

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.300 
view I think it looks a lot better more
riding<00:06:26.060> videos<00:06:26.510> in<00:06:26.659> the<00:06:26.750> future<00:06:26.930> will<00:06:27.440> prove

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
riding videos in the future will prove

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.710 
riding videos in the future will prove
what<00:06:29.310> it<00:06:29.400> looks<00:06:29.610> like<00:06:29.819> all<00:06:30.090> together<00:06:30.270> outside

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
what it looks like all together outside

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.550 
what it looks like all together outside
of<00:06:30.990> the<00:06:31.139> garage<00:06:31.439> for<00:06:32.099> the<00:06:32.220> messy<00:06:32.580> garage<00:06:33.560> color

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
of the garage for the messy garage color

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.820 
of the garage for the messy garage color
matches<00:06:35.099> just<00:06:35.129> about<00:06:35.580> perfectly<00:06:36.620> can't<00:06:37.620> tell

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
matches just about perfectly can't tell

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.740 
matches just about perfectly can't tell
the<00:06:37.979> difference<00:06:38.009> and<00:06:38.789> I<00:06:39.090> think<00:06:39.120> overall<00:06:39.629> it

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
the difference and I think overall it

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.890 
the difference and I think overall it
looks<00:06:39.900> a<00:06:40.169> lot<00:06:40.409> better<00:06:40.639> doesn't<00:06:41.639> dive<00:06:42.539> down

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
looks a lot better doesn't dive down

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.110 
looks a lot better doesn't dive down
like<00:06:43.259> the<00:06:43.409> other<00:06:43.590> one<00:06:43.800> and<00:06:44.610> I<00:06:44.729> think<00:06:44.939> it<00:06:45.030> just

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
like the other one and I think it just

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.320 
like the other one and I think it just
mooks<00:06:45.419> looks<00:06:45.870> more<00:06:46.080> aggressive<00:06:46.639> than<00:06:47.639> the

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
mooks looks more aggressive than the

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.770 
mooks looks more aggressive than the
stock<00:06:48.949> this<00:06:49.949> like<00:06:50.310> I<00:06:50.460> said<00:06:50.490> is<00:06:50.729> a<00:06:50.939> kind<00:06:51.719> of

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
stock this like I said is a kind of

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.689 
stock this like I said is a kind of
in-between<00:06:51.990> between<00:06:52.919> the<00:06:53.300> stock<00:06:54.300> XR<00:06:55.699> fender

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:56.699 
in-between between the stock XR fender

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:58.520 
in-between between the stock XR fender
where<00:06:56.909> that<00:06:57.060> is<00:06:57.300> squared<00:06:57.750> off<00:06:57.960> on<00:06:58.229> the<00:06:58.319> front

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
where that is squared off on the front

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.399 
where that is squared off on the front
and<00:06:58.830> it<00:06:58.919> really<00:06:59.159> dives<00:06:59.400> down<00:06:59.729> and<00:07:00.120> a<00:07:00.810> CRF

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:01.409 
and it really dives down and a CRF

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:03.320 
and it really dives down and a CRF
fender<00:07:01.860> which<00:07:02.069> is<00:07:02.280> the<00:07:02.789> most<00:07:02.969> aggressive

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
fender which is the most aggressive

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.379 
fender which is the most aggressive
being<00:07:04.319> that<00:07:04.500> it's<00:07:04.620> a<00:07:04.680> dirt<00:07:04.860> bike<00:07:05.120> it's<00:07:06.120> really

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:06.389 
being that it's a dirt bike it's really

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:09.200 
being that it's a dirt bike it's really
tapered<00:07:06.840> up<00:07:06.960> front<00:07:07.259> and<00:07:07.699> it's<00:07:08.699> got<00:07:08.849> little

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
tapered up front and it's got little

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.969 
tapered up front and it's got little
wings<00:07:09.449> on<00:07:09.690> the<00:07:09.840> sides<00:07:10.080> that<00:07:10.289> look<00:07:10.680> really

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:10.979 
wings on the sides that look really

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:12.860 
wings on the sides that look really
aggressive<00:07:11.460> this<00:07:12.030> is<00:07:12.240> somewhere<00:07:12.690> in<00:07:12.780> the

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:12.870 
aggressive this is somewhere in the

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.390 
aggressive this is somewhere in the
middle<00:07:13.110> I<00:07:13.199> think<00:07:13.229> it<00:07:13.500> still<00:07:13.740> looks<00:07:13.979> a<00:07:14.250> whole

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 
middle I think it still looks a whole

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.180 
middle I think it still looks a whole
lot<00:07:14.430> better<00:07:15.289> kind<00:07:16.289> of<00:07:16.409> wish<00:07:16.560> that<00:07:16.590> the

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.190 
lot better kind of wish that the

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.040 
lot better kind of wish that the
Cerberus<00:07:17.969> website<00:07:18.479> would<00:07:18.629> have<00:07:18.750> had<00:07:18.900> their

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.050 
Cerberus website would have had their

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.260 
Cerberus website would have had their
pictures<00:07:19.349> right<00:07:19.620> but<00:07:20.490> nonetheless<00:07:20.669> I'm<00:07:21.120> not
