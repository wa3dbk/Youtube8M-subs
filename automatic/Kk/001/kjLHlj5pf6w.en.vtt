00:00:07.693 --> 00:00:09.463
Today we will prepare margarita

00:00:09.463 --> 00:00:13.197
one of the international drinks, drunk most of the world.

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.696
Take a glass sombrero cold and bathe the edge with a slice of lemon

00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:25.975
then pass it on a plate with the salt, to form the crusta.

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:37.717
Fill a shaker or rock medium with ice 
 where we're going to mix our ingredients.

00:00:38.493 --> 00:00:40.638
Tequila to start,

00:00:40.638 --> 00:00:45.163
cointreau or triple sec, to give the citrus aroma

00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:49.925
and finally lime or lemon juice.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.425
Take the boston and shake for a few seconds the content of the shaker.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:17.186
With the strainer filter out the content within the sombrero.

00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:30.078
As a garnish, a slice of lime

00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:32.086
and to give color, red fruit.

00:01:38.882 --> 00:01:43.570
3,5 cl Tequila, 2,0 cl Cointreau, 1,5 cl Lime juice
