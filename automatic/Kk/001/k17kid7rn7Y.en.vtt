00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.619
 been asked by a pascal customer rahal 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.140

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.230
 video that will talk about how well 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.369

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.320
 so the same day actually you you 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.280
 so go if you're interested in 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.540
 the step when you day it makes you 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.090
 are going to have a guinea pig 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.649
 so you have everything prepared so in fact 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.289
 everything that will have them in the cage 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.020
 so they put the litter there puts the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.809
 fist and attics a lot for this 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.399
 which is to be rough and he m the hut 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.629
 power that can hide because 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.210
 it's important to him that some 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.379
 thing it's an animal that needs to get 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.510
 hide You are not the same error 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.900
 that I put a hut is also you 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.240
 can you take a step here 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.500
 your pig not to live outside 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.590
 and that he lives in one that the city after 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.450
 so the 2 the second thing to do 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.750
 so in you and basically it's adoption 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.250
 so it's actually when you go 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.360
 buy your guinea pig me I 'm going 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.950
 give you a little trick 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.340
 little trick is when you go 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.360
 so go to the pet shop in 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.470
 breeding etc. 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.230
 when you go go get your 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.510
 guinea pig I tell you to take a 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.030
 basket so a wicker basket do not know 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.979
 what do you put a towel in do 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.330
 in power that the nightmare is not 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.100
 sore feet and still a top 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.200
 and you put a little bit of points 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.150
 like that he will be able to feed himself 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.619
 during the journey and for power and 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:58.400
 to do - less be stressed that 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.220
 if there is in a box with no 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.950
 a lot of room is obvious all 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.380
 just just with two small holes 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.740
 so here we go 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.740
 Wait 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.670
 after so the roof the third part 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.160
 basically it's the arrival of the jack 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.220
 so basically when you go home 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.270
 you put yourself in fact directly 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.870
 your guinea pig in his cage 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.870
 it's like that you can put 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:38.060
 in and leave you two to three 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:42.290
 days alone why why and a 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.680
 guinea pig 2 to 3 days social in her 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.530
 cage 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:50.330
 simply to be able because a 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.950
 crazy pig when cantons canton 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.410
 adopt it in truck which but it is a 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.480
 little to kidnapping so suddenly it's 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.760
 not too good for him finally what I 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.290
 I mean, that's what he's doing here 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.540
 and all of a sudden not wanted to leave everything 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.860
 alone there but it's not because you 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.060
 leave all alone that you do not have 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.040
 right to go see him what I want 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.500
 to say leaving him alone is not 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.930
 physical contact with a human is 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.400
 it's like that but everywhere is when 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.250
 even read there stories we know what 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.560
 that he is personally I read a tiny 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.870
 stories to be able to get it 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.090
 familiar with my voice and at the end of 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.790
 account now she is hyper 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.230
 close with him so after the fourth 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.200
 thing to do so to put it's 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.180
 that after the three days stems is 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.100
 simply you will be able 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.650
 start m 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.130
 your hand makes it flat in the cage 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.500
 so not like that but flat like 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.660
 this because if you put it as 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.910
 that and you move must the pig 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.260
 one of them is going to whatever you want 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.900
 catch him so that he does not have 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.500
 molli come on so that if you put 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.500
 your hand flat evil to guinea pig 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.630
 will immediately feel a little bit 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.880
 more secure and therefore why you 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.620
 you can do that it's in power 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.290
 that your nano pig sniffs your 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.230
 smell and to be able to simply beat 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.510
 recognize you later when he 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.989
 will have become more familiar with 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.610
 quotation marks with you and so here I am 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.010
 advise you to tell you to do that 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.870
 but on the other hand just a trick if your 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.860
 spouse of the dead when you put your 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.010
 hand in which flat is not it 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.600
 do not bite you because he's afraid he 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:38.570
 is dead for 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:41.070
 how do you say they are going to die for 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.330
 to taste your finger makes it a 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.030
 must-see is good facade or 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.420
 late to the smells of people for 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.740
 to be able to know that sniffs for 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.630
 recognize the smell but it moves too 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.880
 to be able to recognize the smell 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.950
 I'm not asked why I do not 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.300
 know nothing at all and after the 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.260
 fifth inning and taming 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.420
 so I'm not going I'm not going to you 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.640
 make a video on it I got 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.920
 downright sorry but actually I 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:12.570
 can not find the words for 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:15.810
 to be able to tell you I do not arrive in 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.130
 do find the words for you 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.470
 say what you need to do 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:23.130
