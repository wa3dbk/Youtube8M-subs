relate to
instead<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.480> doing<00:02:25.660> concealer<00:02:26.410> or<00:02:26.500> foundation

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
instead of doing concealer or foundation

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.160

first<00:02:27.190> this<00:02:27.490> book<00:02:27.730> focuses<00:02:28.150> on<00:02:28.270> eyes<00:02:28.630> first

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
first this book focuses on eyes first

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.230 
first this book focuses on eyes first
because<00:02:29.860> as<00:02:30.070> I've<00:02:30.280> mentioned<00:02:30.490> loads<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:31.060> times

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
because as I've mentioned loads of times

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.420 
because as I've mentioned loads of times
the<00:02:31.420> reason<00:02:31.570> I<00:02:31.840> do<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.230> eyes<00:02:32.410> first<00:02:32.830> is

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
the reason I do the eyes first is

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.400 
the reason I do the eyes first is
because<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.970> get<00:02:34.090> full<00:02:34.360> light<00:02:34.570> and<00:02:34.870> when

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
because you get full light and when

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.750 
because you get full light and when
you've<00:02:35.530> done<00:02:35.560> concealer<00:02:36.130> makeup<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.580> got<00:02:36.670> to

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
you've done concealer makeup you got to

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.540 
you've done concealer makeup you got to
be<00:02:36.820> so<00:02:37.240> careful<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:38.500> it's<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.160> know<00:02:39.250> it's<00:02:39.460> a

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
be so careful that it's you know it's a

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.340 
be so careful that it's you know it's a
bother<00:02:39.730> plus<00:02:40.300> even<00:02:40.780> when<00:02:41.050> you're<00:02:41.170> really

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
bother plus even when you're really

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.810 
bother plus even when you're really
careful<00:02:41.530> there's<00:02:41.890> always<00:02:42.070> a<00:02:42.190> tiny<00:02:42.520> bit<00:02:42.730> of

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
careful there's always a tiny bit of

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.030 
careful there's always a tiny bit of
fallout<00:02:43.210> so<00:02:43.690> doing<00:02:43.990> it<00:02:44.050> first<00:02:44.350> eliminates

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
fallout so doing it first eliminates

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.700 
fallout so doing it first eliminates
that<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.490> can<00:02:45.610> just<00:02:45.730> wipe<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.060> away<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.590> the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
that you can just wipe it away so the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.170 
that you can just wipe it away so the
book<00:02:47.860> is<00:02:48.010> broken<00:02:48.160> up<00:02:48.400> into<00:02:48.520> lots<00:02:48.820> of<00:02:48.910> different

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
blush when you smiling so for me it just

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.500 
blush when you smiling so for me it just
I<00:05:12.290> kind<00:05:12.680> of<00:05:12.860> felt<00:05:13.100> like<00:05:13.220> he<00:05:13.460> gave<00:05:13.670> me<00:05:13.820> a<00:05:13.850> small

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
I kind of felt like he gave me a small

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.340 
I kind of felt like he gave me a small
amount<00:05:14.990> of<00:05:15.200> validation<00:05:15.860> because<00:05:17.050> you<00:05:18.050> know<00:05:18.170> I

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
amount of validation because you know I

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.620 
amount of validation because you know I
just<00:05:18.380> I<00:05:18.830> struggled<00:05:19.580> for<00:05:19.640> a<00:05:19.970> long<00:05:20.030> long<00:05:20.570> time

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
just I struggled for a long long time

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.410 
just I struggled for a long long time
thinking<00:05:21.310> especially<00:05:22.310> when<00:05:22.790> Bobby<00:05:22.970> BAM<00:05:23.210> was

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
thinking especially when Bobby BAM was

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.390 
thinking especially when Bobby BAM was
promoting<00:05:24.200> this<00:05:24.350> smiling<00:05:24.650> thing<00:05:25.010> it<00:05:25.160> became

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
promoting this smiling thing it became

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.860 
promoting this smiling thing it became
very<00:05:25.550> prevalent<00:05:25.850> I<00:05:26.120> felt<00:05:26.390> like<00:05:26.540> I<00:05:26.660> was<00:05:26.780> the

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
very prevalent I felt like I was the

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.150 
very prevalent I felt like I was the
only<00:05:26.930> one<00:05:27.170> that<00:05:27.230> was<00:05:27.440> doing<00:05:27.650> it<00:05:27.740> differently

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
only one that was doing it differently
