00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.540
 this place is very special for me 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.090
 its beautiful 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.600
 It is the most beautiful place in the world 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.630
 why 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.940
 [Music] 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:25.590
 here to train personality 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:28.310
 sorry are the way out and I did not have to 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.310
 know it's worth 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.500
 maybe we arrived here so 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.500
 maybe you have to see the file 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.070
 salvation is to be happy again 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.380
 Y 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:58.270
 and what to do with that 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:58.270
 [Music] 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.000
 no no 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.000
 [Music] 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.080
 and we leave it 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.180
 you can listen if you want nothing 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.840
 I'm waiting for you 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.880
 and 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.420
 We came here by chance and I did not 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:31.420
 you misunderstand the excess the mind 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.950
 to explain anything no longer does not give me 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.390
 jealousy or anything like that to see you with 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.189
 someone else does not mean the same thing anymore 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.289
 for me I already got over it 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.039
 and right now for me the only person who 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.039
 I care about the roxy 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.360
 it's okay I accept everything that is 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.180
 saying but take our forehead 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.680
 because it is in its place to be always 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.810
 our equal 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.950
 but it is in the past no no 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.950
 our past 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.770
 Because they 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.099
