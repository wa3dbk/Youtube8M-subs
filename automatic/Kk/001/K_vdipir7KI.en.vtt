00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.490 
difficulty the difficulty of this level
makes<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.759> much<00:01:41.970> hated<00:01:42.479> level<00:01:42.750> by<00:01:42.840> many<00:01:43.140> fans

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
makes it a much hated level by many fans

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.109 
makes it a much hated level by many fans
but<00:01:43.829> i<00:01:43.860> think<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> heart<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.610> level<00:01:44.970> is

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
but i think the heart of the level is

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.330 
but i think the heart of the level is
the<00:01:45.360> more<00:01:45.509> satisfying<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.229> complete<00:01:46.710> which<00:01:47.189> is

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the more satisfying to complete which is

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.499 
the more satisfying to complete which is
why<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.880> time<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.720> play

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
why it's time to play

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.679 
why it's time to play
sure<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:55.520> really<00:01:56.520> can't<00:01:56.970> explain<00:01:57.240> why<00:01:57.630> this

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
sure I really can't explain why this

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.649 
sure I really can't explain why this
level<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.560> satisfying<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.399> play<00:01:59.729> I<00:02:00.000> think

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
level is so satisfying to play I think

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.580 
level is so satisfying to play I think
it's<00:02:00.890> something<00:02:01.890> about<00:02:02.840> bouncing<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:03.990> fat

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it's something about bouncing on fat

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.260 
it's something about bouncing on fat
