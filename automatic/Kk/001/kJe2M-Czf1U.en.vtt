the outline now here Dave is busting at
the<00:01:40.350> dremel<00:01:40.650> tool<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:41.310> my<00:01:41.460> first<00:01:41.759> time<00:01:41.909> using

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the dremel tool it's my first time using

a dremel tool and we are building the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.920 
a dremel tool and we are building the
frame<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.000> sign<00:01:47.149> so<00:01:48.149> what<00:01:48.329> would<00:01:48.479> what<00:01:48.840> we

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
frame for the sign so what would what we

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.149 
frame for the sign so what would what we
used<00:01:49.229> was<00:01:49.649> some<00:01:50.360> modeling<00:01:51.380> wood<00:01:52.380> I've<00:01:52.890> never

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
used modeling wood before but it's

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.929 
used modeling wood before but it's
really<00:01:54.810> light<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.500> better<00:01:55.799> than<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.820> was

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
really light it's better than it was

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.959 
really light it's better than it was
easy<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.329> cut<00:01:58.100> we're<00:01:59.100> using<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.490> dremel<00:01:59.790> tool

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
easy to cut we're using the dremel tool

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.969 
easy to cut we're using the dremel tool
and<00:02:00.240> even<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.780> got<00:02:00.990> halfway<00:02:01.259> through<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.710> can

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and even if I got halfway through I can

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.649 
and even if I got halfway through I can
literally<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.520> break<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.939> with<00:02:03.090> my<00:02:03.240> hands

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
literally just break it with my hands

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.539 
literally just break it with my hands
because<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.899> was<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.229> light<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.280> was<00:02:05.399> good

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
because it was so light and it was good

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.229 
because it was so light and it was good
for<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.790> frame<00:02:06.030> too<00:02:06.240> because<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.719> wood<00:02:07.069> and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
for the frame too because it is wood and

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.790 
for the frame too because it is wood and
but<00:02:09.239> at<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> same<00:02:09.629> time<00:02:09.899> if<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.080> use<00:02:10.379> real<00:02:10.649> wood

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
but at the same time if we use real wood

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.980 
but at the same time if we use real wood
it'd<00:02:10.950> just<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.220> really<00:02:11.670> heavy

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
it'd just be really heavy

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.870 
it'd just be really heavy
I<00:02:13.080> don't<00:02:13.740> really<00:02:13.890> know<00:02:14.130> what<00:02:14.430> we<00:02:14.700> would<00:02:14.850> have

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
I don't really know what we would have

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.950 
I don't really know what we would have
used<00:02:15.210> if<00:02:15.900> we<00:02:16.110> didn't<00:02:16.410> use<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:18.390> modeling<00:02:18.750> would

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
used if we didn't use the modeling would

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.760 
used if we didn't use the modeling would
but<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:20.490> get<00:02:20.670> really<00:02:20.850> creative<00:02:21.150> with<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
but you get really creative with the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.290 
but you get really creative with the
with<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.890> frame<00:02:25.580> okay<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:26.640> here<00:02:27.060> what<00:02:27.210> we're

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
with the frame okay so here what we're

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.790 
with the frame okay so here what we're
gonna<00:02:27.390> do<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.870> I'm<00:02:28.110> putting<00:02:28.320> down<00:02:28.470> the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
gonna do is I'm putting down the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.710 
gonna do is I'm putting down the
modeling<00:02:29.190> wood<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.670> I'm<00:02:30.120> measuring<00:02:30.390> an

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
modeling wood and I'm measuring an

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.030 
modeling wood and I'm measuring an
hour's<00:02:32.870> what<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:33.990> wanted<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.410> do<00:02:34.560> we<00:02:34.740> were<00:02:34.830> kind

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
hour's what we wanted to do we were kind

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.380 
hour's what we wanted to do we were kind
of<00:02:35.100> coming<00:02:35.220> up<00:02:35.430> with<00:02:35.460> ideas<00:02:35.640> we're<00:02:36.120> trying<00:02:36.330> to

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
of coming up with ideas we're trying to

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.070 
of coming up with ideas we're trying to
add<00:02:36.510> living<00:02:36.780> this<00:02:36.870> whole<00:02:37.050> thing<00:02:38.300> so<00:02:39.300> what<00:02:39.990> we

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
add living this whole thing so what we

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.750 
add living this whole thing so what we
decided<00:02:40.380> here<00:02:40.860> was<00:02:41.130> we<00:02:41.400> were<00:02:41.490> going<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.670> have

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
decided here was we were going to have

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.830 
decided here was we were going to have
one<00:02:42.060> long<00:02:42.470> piece<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.740> wood<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.280> four<00:02:45.180> small

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
one long piece of wood and four small

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.410 
one long piece of wood and four small
pieces<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:47.460> one<00:02:47.670> long<00:02:47.880> piece<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.120> wood

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
pieces so the one long piece of wood

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.660 
pieces so the one long piece of wood
would<00:02:48.720> go<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.440> top<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.920> on<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.400> bottom<00:02:52.670> so

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
would go on the top and on the bottom so

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.150 
would go on the top and on the bottom so
we'll<00:02:53.850> take<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.150> four<00:02:54.360> pieces<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:55.160> we'll

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
we'll take the four pieces and we'll

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.310 
we'll take the four pieces and we'll
stick<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.520> to<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.730> frame<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.930> then<00:02:58.200> we'll

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
stick it to the frame and then we'll

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.650 
stick it to the frame and then we'll
take<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.710> long<00:02:59.070> two<00:02:59.550> long<00:02:59.760> pieces<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.390> stick

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
take the long two long pieces and stick

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.560 
take the long two long pieces and stick
them<00:03:00.870> on<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.010> top<00:03:02.190> now<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.760> reason<00:03:03.390> why<00:03:03.540> I

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
them on the top now the reason why I

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.490 
them on the top now the reason why I
wanted<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.110> have<00:03:05.330> two<00:03:06.330> layers<00:03:06.630> is<00:03:07.110> because<00:03:07.470> I

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
wanted to have two layers is because I

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.360 
wanted to have two layers is because I
wanted<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.210> have<00:03:09.210> enough<00:03:10.160> spacing<00:03:11.160> between

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
wanted to have enough spacing between

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.020 
wanted to have enough spacing between
the<00:03:12.180> sign<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.810> also<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.560> light<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:14.490> the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
the sign and also the light the the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.940 
the sign and also the light the the
lighting<00:03:15.630> medium<00:03:15.930> then<00:03:16.110> we're<00:03:16.230> going<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.440> use

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.850 

I'm<00:03:19.950> skipping<00:03:20.310> ahead<00:03:20.520> here<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.750> forgot<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.620> film

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
I'm skipping ahead here I forgot to film

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.140 
I'm skipping ahead here I forgot to film
it<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.010> got<00:03:23.130> kind<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.370> caught<00:03:23.520> up<00:03:23.700> but<00:03:23.910> what<00:03:24.060> we

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
it I got kind of caught up but what we

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.780 
it I got kind of caught up but what we
did<00:03:24.330> was<00:03:24.360> we<00:03:24.600> finished<00:03:24.990> it<00:03:25.140> already<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.790> you

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
did was we finished it already and you

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.110 
did was we finished it already and you
could<00:03:26.910> see<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.180> framing<00:03:27.480> we<00:03:28.380> have<00:03:28.880> what<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:29.910> did

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
could see the framing we have what I did

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.980 
could see the framing we have what I did
was<00:03:30.300> we<00:03:30.450> added<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.870> three<00:03:31.260> long<00:03:32.160> planks<00:03:32.670> and

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
was we added the three long planks and

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.230 
was we added the three long planks and
we<00:03:33.990> used<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.320> hot<00:03:34.500> glue<00:03:34.740> gun<00:03:34.770> at<00:03:35.490> this<00:03:35.790> point<00:03:36.060> I

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
we used a hot glue gun at this point I

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.170 
we used a hot glue gun at this point I
didn't<00:03:36.510> use<00:03:37.310> spray<00:03:38.310> adhesive<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.850> wanted<00:03:39.120> to

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
didn't use spray adhesive I wanted to

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.640 
didn't use spray adhesive I wanted to
use<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.450> glue<00:03:39.630> gun<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.960> held<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.230> lot<00:03:40.380> stronger

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
use the glue gun and held a lot stronger

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.230 
use the glue gun and held a lot stronger
and<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:43.230> kind<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.470> worked<00:03:43.650> out<00:03:43.860> because<00:03:44.310> what

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
and it kind of worked out because what

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.350 
and it kind of worked out because what
we<00:03:45.360> wanted<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:45.750> use<00:03:45.960> was<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.320> LED<00:03:46.770> lights<00:03:47.360> and

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.920 
light sticks you press the button and
there's<00:03:56.820> like<00:03:57.000> these<00:03:57.150> styrofoam<00:03:57.420> light

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
there's like these styrofoam light

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.930 
there's like these styrofoam light
sticks<00:03:58.230> they<00:03:58.440> light<00:03:58.680> up<00:03:58.710> what<00:03:59.400> we<00:03:59.490> did<00:03:59.640> was<00:03:59.820> we

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
sticks they light up what we did was we

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.940 
sticks they light up what we did was we
just<00:03:59.970> took<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.450> knife<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:00.930> we<00:04:01.110> cut<00:04:01.410> away<00:04:01.590> the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
just took a knife and we cut away the

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.149 
just took a knife and we cut away the
styrofoam<00:04:03.470> and<00:04:04.470> then

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
styrofoam and then

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.819 
styrofoam and then
inside<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.209> stick<00:04:06.480> was<00:04:06.659> these<00:04:06.780> lights<00:04:07.079> and

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
inside the stick was these lights and

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.349 
inside the stick was these lights and
what<00:04:08.189> you<00:04:08.249> can<00:04:08.370> see<00:04:08.519> is<00:04:08.609> I'm<00:04:08.760> pointing<00:04:09.090> out<00:04:09.180> the

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
what you can see is I'm pointing out the

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.270 
what you can see is I'm pointing out the
frame<00:04:09.599> in<00:04:09.780> here<00:04:10.019> of<00:04:10.170> how<00:04:10.290> it's<00:04:10.469> built<00:04:10.650> and

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
frame in here of how it's built and

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.509 
frame in here of how it's built and
again<00:04:12.150> just<00:04:12.389> using<00:04:12.599> a<00:04:12.870> hot<00:04:13.620> glue<00:04:13.650> gun<00:04:13.859> just

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
again just using a hot glue gun just

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.569 
again just using a hot glue gun just
stick<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.790> all<00:04:14.849> together<00:04:15.889> okay<00:04:16.889> so<00:04:16.949> what<00:04:17.430> we

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
stick it all together okay so what we

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.520 
stick it all together okay so what we
did<00:04:17.729> was<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:18.060> just<00:04:18.120> wanted<00:04:18.389> to<00:04:18.600> make<00:04:18.750> sure<00:04:18.780> that

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
did was I just wanted to make sure that

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.710 
did was I just wanted to make sure that
there<00:04:19.680> was<00:04:19.799> enough<00:04:20.039> room<00:04:20.400> between<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:21.539> LED

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
there was enough room between the LED

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.330 
there was enough room between the LED
lights<00:04:22.199> and<00:04:22.639> the<00:04:23.639> outline<00:04:24.710> so<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:26.099> kind<00:04:26.310> of

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
lights and the outline so it kind of

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.469 
lights and the outline so it kind of
worked<00:04:26.520> out<00:04:26.610> what<00:04:26.729> these<00:04:26.849> planks<00:04:27.150> because

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
worked out what these planks because

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.240 
worked out what these planks because
what<00:04:27.630> we<00:04:27.720> did<00:04:27.870> was<00:04:28.050> we<00:04:28.080> put<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.590> lights<00:04:28.830> and

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
what we did was we put the lights and

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.800 
what we did was we put the lights and
these<00:04:29.400> are<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.639> lights<00:04:29.849> he<00:04:30.270> could<00:04:30.449> bend<00:04:30.690> these

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
these are the lights he could bend these

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.499 
these are the lights he could bend these
wires<00:04:31.139> and<00:04:31.560> move<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.800> lights<00:04:32.009> around<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:32.610> we

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
wires and move the lights around and we

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.290 
wires and move the lights around and we
use<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.900> planks<00:04:34.340> we<00:04:35.340> didn't<00:04:35.610> glue<00:04:35.820> them<00:04:36.000> first

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
use the planks we didn't glue them first

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.570 
use the planks we didn't glue them first
we<00:04:36.599> kind<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:36.840> put<00:04:37.020> them<00:04:37.169> down<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:37.740> then<00:04:38.340> we

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
we kind of put them down and then we

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.950 
we kind of put them down and then we
measured<00:04:40.550> how<00:04:41.550> these<00:04:41.789> LED<00:04:42.210> lights<00:04:42.240> will<00:04:42.690> fit

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
measured how these LED lights will fit

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.540 
measured how these LED lights will fit
in<00:04:43.080> very<00:04:43.259> snug<00:04:43.650> and<00:04:44.160> if<00:04:44.250> you<00:04:44.310> press<00:04:44.520> that

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
in very snug and if you press that

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.010 
in very snug and if you press that
button<00:04:44.849> right<00:04:45.000> there<00:04:45.150> this<00:04:45.419> one<00:04:45.599> is<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:45.780> dead

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
button right there this one is a dead

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.689 
button right there this one is a dead
LED<00:04:46.530> light<00:04:46.710> but<00:04:47.099> if<00:04:47.190> you<00:04:47.250> pressed<00:04:47.520> that<00:04:47.639> button

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
LED light but if you pressed that button

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.210 
LED light but if you pressed that button
they'll<00:04:48.630> light<00:04:48.870> up<00:04:48.900> you<00:04:49.320> have<00:04:49.800> like<00:04:49.949> four

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
they'll light up you have like four

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.589 
they'll light up you have like four
different<00:04:50.370> changes<00:04:50.940> you<00:04:51.120> can<00:04:51.240> do<00:04:51.330> three

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
different changes you can do three

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.540 
different changes you can do three
different<00:04:51.870> colors<00:04:52.139> you<00:04:52.979> can<00:04:53.009> have<00:04:53.250> it<00:04:53.370> like

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
different colors you can have it like

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.010 
different colors you can have it like
strobe<00:04:53.970> or<00:04:54.470> you<00:04:55.470> know<00:04:55.560> a<00:04:55.889> slow<00:04:56.250> transition<00:04:57.020> but

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
strobe or you know a slow transition but

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.659 
strobe or you know a slow transition but
again<00:04:58.199> what<00:04:58.320> we<00:04:58.410> did<00:04:58.440> was<00:04:58.710> before<00:04:58.860> we<00:04:59.310> glued<00:04:59.550> it

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
again what we did was before we glued it

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.510 
again what we did was before we glued it
down<00:04:59.870> we<00:05:00.870> put<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.199> lights<00:05:01.410> in<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:02.039> then<00:05:02.370> we

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
down we put the lights in and then we

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.920 
down we put the lights in and then we
measured<00:05:02.820> it<00:05:02.880> down<00:05:03.060> you<00:05:03.180> can<00:05:03.240> see<00:05:03.419> those<00:05:03.570> marks

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
measured it down you can see those marks

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.770 
measured it down you can see those marks
right<00:05:04.080> there<00:05:04.139> I<00:05:04.620> made<00:05:05.250> with<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.550> pen<00:05:05.789> and<00:05:06.060> then

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
right there I made with the pen and then

you want I like this little transition

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.430 
you want I like this little transition
one<00:05:40.860> so<00:05:41.639> then<00:05:41.759> you<00:05:41.820> just<00:05:42.030> slide<00:05:42.720> it<00:05:42.870> in<00:05:42.990> and
