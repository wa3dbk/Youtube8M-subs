now<00:03:41.160> considering<00:03:41.700> light<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.240> readily

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
now considering light is readily

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.120 
now considering light is readily
available<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:43.820> again<00:03:45.680> it's<00:03:46.680> just<00:03:46.800> any

if we depress the second button down

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.840 
if we depress the second button down
here<00:03:55.040> you'll<00:03:56.040> see<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.930> smaller<00:03:58.580> time<00:03:59.580> zone

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
here you'll see this smaller time zone

maybe see there it's playing the August

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.990 
maybe see there it's playing the August
and<00:04:12.180> since<00:04:12.540> 2008<00:04:13.170> is<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.680> leap<00:04:13.860> year<00:04:14.000> it's

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
and since 2008 is the leap year it's

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.630 
and since 2008 is the leap year it's
pointing<00:04:15.330> at<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.450> leap<00:04:15.630> year<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:16.459> you<00:04:17.459> see

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
pointing at the leap year and you see

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.039 
pointing at the leap year and you see
here<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.910> bright<00:04:18.090> orange<00:04:18.239> hands<00:04:18.600> pointing<00:04:18.989> to

here the bright orange hands pointing to
the<00:04:19.109> 21st<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:20.040> and<00:04:20.330> then<00:04:21.330> in<00:04:21.450> about<00:04:21.540> 15<00:04:22.080> or<00:04:22.109> 20

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
the 21st so and then in about 15 or 20

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.500 
the 21st so and then in about 15 or 20
seconds<00:04:22.890> it<00:04:23.010> goes<00:04:23.130> back<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.730> the<00:04:23.850> normal<00:04:24.030> home

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.260 
seconds it goes back to the normal home
time<00:04:24.780> zone<00:04:25.110> there<00:04:26.240> so<00:04:27.620> there<00:04:28.620> goes<00:04:28.770> back<00:04:29.270> so

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
time zone there so there goes back so

being it's relatively a busy dial
I'd<00:04:40.470> imagine<00:04:40.710> this<00:04:41.070> is<00:04:41.220> quite<00:04:41.460> an<00:04:41.580> eye-catcher

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
I'd imagine this is quite an eye-catcher

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.390 
I'd imagine this is quite an eye-catcher
and<00:04:42.470> if<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.560> can<00:04:43.680> have<00:04:43.830> it<00:04:43.950> anywhere<00:04:44.190> under

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
and if you can have it anywhere under

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.610 
and if you can have it anywhere under
$200<00:04:45.090> just<00:04:45.210> definitely<00:04:45.690> worth<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.140> or<00:04:46.260> even

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
$200 just definitely worth it or even

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.210 
$200 just definitely worth it or even
more<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:48.419> fit<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:48.900> finish<00:04:49.050> really<00:04:49.740> suggests

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
more the fit and finish really suggests

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.970 
more the fit and finish really suggests
to<00:04:50.340> watch<00:04:50.520> it<00:04:50.790> cost<00:04:51.000> it<00:04:51.150> may<00:04:51.180> be<00:04:51.390> more<00:04:51.570> like<00:04:52.230> 250

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
to watch it cost it may be more like 250

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.870 
to watch it cost it may be more like 250
or<00:04:53.010> 300<00:04:53.310> dollars<00:04:54.410> you<00:04:55.410> know<00:04:55.560> just<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:56.640> great

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
or 300 dollars you know just the great

or 300 dollars you know just the great
dial<00:04:57.150> work<00:04:57.480> here<00:04:57.780> so<00:04:58.140> a<00:04:58.169> lot<00:04:58.260> of<00:04:58.380> layers<00:04:58.530> you

drawback<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.700> this<00:05:05.790> watch<00:05:06.200> that<00:05:07.200> even<00:05:07.410> with<00:05:07.530> a

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
drawback to this watch that even with a

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.990 
drawback to this watch that even with a
screw<00:05:07.890> down<00:05:08.010> case<00:05:08.070> back

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
screw down case back

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.930 
screw down case back
it<00:05:09.360> only<00:05:09.510> has<00:05:09.690> 30<00:05:09.960> meters<00:05:10.260> resistance<00:05:10.880> it's<00:05:11.880> a

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
it only has 30 meters resistance it's a

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.400 
it only has 30 meters resistance it's a
bit<00:05:12.090> disappointing<00:05:12.270> but<00:05:12.930> perhaps<00:05:13.080> it's

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
bit disappointing but perhaps it's

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.970 
bit disappointing but perhaps it's
because<00:05:13.710> of<00:05:13.890> the<00:05:13.950> pushers<00:05:14.370> and<00:05:14.669> that<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.270> case

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
because of the pushers and that the case

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.950 
because of the pushers and that the case
probably<00:05:16.980> needs<00:05:17.400> to<00:05:17.520> remain<00:05:17.760> pretty<00:05:18.090> thin<00:05:18.480> for

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
probably needs to remain pretty thin for

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.050 
probably needs to remain pretty thin for
the<00:05:18.990> minute<00:05:19.350> repeater<00:05:19.590> to<00:05:19.740> be<00:05:19.950> audible<00:05:20.280> and

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
the minute repeater to be audible and

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.720 
the minute repeater to be audible and
the<00:05:21.240> alarms<00:05:21.630> for<00:05:21.810> that<00:05:21.930> matter<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:23.580> only

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
the alarms for that matter and the only

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.260 
the alarms for that matter and the only
other<00:05:23.910> drawback<00:05:24.510> is<00:05:25.790> citizens<00:05:26.790> use<00:05:27.000> of

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
other drawback is citizens use of

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.589 
other drawback is citizens use of
mineral<00:05:27.780> crystals

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
mineral crystals

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:31.969 
some other Japan domestic market watches

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:35.469 
some other Japan domestic market watches
use<00:05:32.210> sapphire<00:05:33.169> but<00:05:33.649> as<00:05:34.309> far<00:05:34.550> as<00:05:34.580> I<00:05:34.789> know<00:05:34.849> the

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
use sapphire but as far as I know the

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:40.389 
use sapphire but as far as I know the
American<00:05:36.069> market<00:05:37.069> watches<00:05:37.539> use<00:05:38.539> almost<00:05:39.399> you

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:40.399 
American market watches use almost you

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:44.079 
American market watches use almost you
know<00:05:40.569> primarily<00:05:41.569> mineral<00:05:42.020> crystals<00:05:42.499> which<00:05:43.089> is

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:44.089 
know primarily mineral crystals which is

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:45.579 
know primarily mineral crystals which is
a<00:05:44.240> bit<00:05:44.479> disappointing<00:05:44.689> especially<00:05:45.199> on<00:05:45.559> a

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:45.589 
a bit disappointing especially on a

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:47.199 
a bit disappointing especially on a
watch<00:05:45.740> it<00:05:45.919> retails<00:05:46.339> for<00:05:46.490> every<00:05:46.729> five<00:05:46.939> hundred

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:47.209 
watch it retails for every five hundred

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:49.600 
watch it retails for every five hundred
dollars<00:05:47.569> and<00:05:48.080> I'm<00:05:48.619> afraid<00:05:48.919> this<00:05:49.099> one<00:05:49.279> might<00:05:49.429> be

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
dollars and I'm afraid this one might be

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.100 
dollars and I'm afraid this one might be
a<00:05:49.639> little<00:05:49.789> easy<00:05:49.969> to<00:05:50.149> scratch<00:05:50.389> considering

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
a little easy to scratch considering

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.790 
a little easy to scratch considering
there's<00:05:51.259> a<00:05:51.349> slight<00:05:51.649> dome<00:05:51.949> to<00:05:52.249> it<00:05:52.339> here<00:05:52.639> but<00:05:53.800> I

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
there's a slight dome to it here but I

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.399 
there's a slight dome to it here but I
didn't<00:05:55.520> show<00:05:55.610> you<00:05:55.639> because<00:05:56.270> the<00:05:56.629> clasp<00:05:56.899> which

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
didn't show you because the clasp which

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:58.899 
didn't show you because the clasp which
actually<00:05:57.740> has<00:05:57.830> a<00:05:57.860> little<00:05:58.099> bit<00:05:58.159> decoration<00:05:58.729> to

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:58.909 
actually has a little bit decoration to

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:59.199 
actually has a little bit decoration to
it

00:05:59.199 --> 00:05:59.209 
it

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:01.809 
it
it's<00:05:59.899> nice<00:06:00.110> touch<00:06:00.409> but<00:06:00.709> obviously<00:06:01.639> it's<00:06:01.759> not

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:01.819 
it's nice touch but obviously it's not

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:06.429 
it's nice touch but obviously it's not
gonna<00:06:01.939> get<00:06:02.119> seen<00:06:02.389> very<00:06:02.599> often<00:06:03.369> but<00:06:05.439> guys

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:06.439

to read instructions but would rather be

to read instructions but would rather be
shown<00:06:20.990> what<00:06:21.259> to<00:06:21.409> do<00:06:21.789> it's<00:06:22.789> definitely<00:06:22.999> the<00:06:23.300> way

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
shown what to do it's definitely the way

to go

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:26.439 
to go
basically<00:06:25.279> if<00:06:25.430> I<00:06:25.550> had<00:06:25.669> to<00:06:25.759> make<00:06:25.879> an<00:06:25.969> analogy

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:26.449 
basically if I had to make an analogy

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:29.489 
basically if I had to make an analogy
this<00:06:26.659> is<00:06:26.719> pretty<00:06:27.050> much<00:06:27.139> an<00:06:27.619> analogue<00:06:28.339> g-shock

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:29.499 
this is pretty much an analogue g-shock

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:33.209 
this is pretty much an analogue g-shock
lots<00:06:30.499> of<00:06:30.649> features<00:06:31.069> good<00:06:31.369> price<00:06:31.639> good<00:06:31.999> build

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:33.219 
lots of features good price good build
