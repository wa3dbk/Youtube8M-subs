thought that this was a cream shade and
most<00:02:04.789> of<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.119> is<00:02:05.149> cream<00:02:05.660> but<00:02:06.080> it<00:02:06.200> has<00:02:06.380> got<00:02:06.679> ever

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
most of it is cream but it has got ever

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.969 
most of it is cream but it has got ever
two<00:02:07.369> fine<00:02:07.869> particles<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:09.229> shimmer<00:02:09.560> running

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
two fine particles of shimmer running

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.590 
two fine particles of shimmer running
through<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:10.399> they're<00:02:11.000> really<00:02:11.330> kind<00:02:11.510> of

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
through it they're really kind of

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.990 
through it they're really kind of
difficult<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.110> see<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:13.310> would<00:02:13.490> suit<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.819> lot

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
difficult to see so it would suit a lot

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.940 
difficult to see so it would suit a lot
of<00:02:14.180> people<00:02:14.480> if<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:15.140> did<00:02:15.319> want<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.590> make<00:02:15.800> it

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
of people if you did want to make it

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.590 
of people if you did want to make it
more<00:02:16.130> shimmery<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:17.090> could<00:02:17.240> put<00:02:17.390> something

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
more shimmery you could put something

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.710 
more shimmery you could put something
like<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:18.170> VIP<00:02:18.440> statuses<00:02:19.430> on<00:02:19.580> top<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:20.090> but

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
like the VIP statuses on top of it but

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.120 
like the VIP statuses on top of it but
it's<00:02:20.959> a<00:02:21.080> really<00:02:21.470> beautiful<00:02:21.680> baby<00:02:22.370> blue<00:02:22.670> shade

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.760 
it's a really beautiful baby blue shade
and<00:02:25.420> finally<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.690> last<00:02:26.930> color<00:02:27.290> in<00:02:27.620> the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410

last one on the chart now it is a cream
baby<00:02:34.040> pink<00:02:34.459> color<00:02:34.849> I<00:02:35.240> think<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:35.959> would

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
baby pink color I think that it would

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.980 
baby pink color I think that it would
look<00:02:36.170> absolutely<00:02:36.410> stunning<00:02:37.540> underneath<00:02:38.540> this

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
one which is the grapefruit sparkle I

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.120 
one which is the grapefruit sparkle I
think<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:42.020> they<00:02:42.110> would<00:02:42.260> really<00:02:42.440> complement

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
think that they would really complement

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.040 
think that they would really complement
each<00:02:43.250> other<00:02:43.520> very<00:02:43.760> well<00:02:43.849> but<00:02:44.300> it's<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.840> really

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
each other very well but it's a really

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.530 
each other very well but it's a really
beautiful<00:02:45.349> color<00:02:45.800> exactly<00:02:46.790> on<00:02:46.910> trend<00:02:47.270> right

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
beautiful color exactly on trend right

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.330 
beautiful color exactly on trend right
now<00:02:47.569> and<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.110> can<00:02:48.290> see<00:02:48.470> that<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:48.830> one<00:02:49.040> will<00:02:49.160> be

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340

glitter<00:03:50.400> with<00:03:50.670> shellac<00:03:51.030> but<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.720> do<00:03:51.840> find<00:03:52.320> that

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
glitter with shellac but I do find that

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.770 
glitter with shellac but I do find that
these<00:03:52.710> give<00:03:52.980> off<00:03:53.160> more<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.970> sparkle<00:03:54.570> and

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
these give off more of a sparkle and

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.710 
these give off more of a sparkle and
have<00:03:55.140> more<00:03:55.380> depth<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.070> dimension<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.700> them<00:03:57.120> so

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
have more depth and dimension to them so

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.870 
have more depth and dimension to them so
they<00:03:58.020> are<00:03:58.170> very<00:03:58.560> fine<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.280> of<00:03:59.370> course<00:03:59.610> very

they are very fine and of course very
high<00:04:00.150> quality<00:04:00.210> so<00:04:00.870> this<00:04:01.710> color<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.070> I'm

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280
