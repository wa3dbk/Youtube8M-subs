 prepare some chocolate popsicles for 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.029
 this February 14 what we are going to 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.160
 need are sticks palette 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.310
 molds 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.039

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.380
 glycerin 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.640
 and chocolate sparks 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.640
 let's go to elaborate 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.900
 the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.560
 happy 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.560
 chocolate chips 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.480
 we 're going to cover in a bain-marie 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.020
 and you are going to consider repeating 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.070
 the pallets that are going to make room 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.070
 the chocolate will support 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.590
 well we put our sticks in the 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:08.100
 mold so that when you invert the chocolate 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.850
 in the mold is covered so that it 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.850
 hold well 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:36.680
 later we give him a few taps 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:38.930
 so that the entire mold is covered well 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.300
 and we put them in the cold we leave them 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.520
 cool to room temperature good since 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.920
 we unmold our palette now the 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.750
 let's go we'll put you all over 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.450

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.280
 and be uniform 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.280
 inside our palette 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.360

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.360

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.709

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.909
