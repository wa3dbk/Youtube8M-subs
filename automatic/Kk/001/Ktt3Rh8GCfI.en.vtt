00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
cases so on this we on this build we had

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.260 
cases so on this we on this build we had
to<00:00:49.170> split<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.590> cases<00:00:50.039> clean<00:00:50.879> everything<00:00:51.180> out

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
to split the cases clean everything out

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.660 
to split the cases clean everything out
put<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> hot<00:00:54.539> rods<00:00:54.750> crank<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:56.070> top<00:00:56.460> still

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
put a hot rods crank in the top still

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.250 
put a hot rods crank in the top still
under<00:00:56.820> way<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.149> replayed<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.809> with<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> new

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
under way to have replayed it with a new

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.010 
under way to have replayed it with a new
piston<00:00:58.649> put<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.550> basically<00:00:59.850> whole<00:01:00.329> new<00:01:00.690> top

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
piston put in so basically whole new top

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.340 
piston put in so basically whole new top
