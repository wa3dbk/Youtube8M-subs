really<00:00:43.469> absolutely<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.760> thing<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.539> would<00:00:46.110> say

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
really absolutely this thing I would say

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.529 
really absolutely this thing I would say
excels<00:00:46.770> actually<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.399> harder<00:00:47.760> situation<00:00:47.969> hard

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
excels actually in harder situation hard

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.299 
excels actually in harder situation hard
pack<00:00:48.690> situations<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:49.680> also<00:00:49.860> performance

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
pack situations but also performance

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.889

ever really in any soft snow situation
ok<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:53.219> think<00:00:53.430> one<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> things<00:00:54.030> that

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
ok and I think one of the things that

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.970 
ok and I think one of the things that
make<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.449> ski<00:00:54.719> more<00:00:55.020> versatile<00:00:55.620> than<00:00:55.649> some

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
make this ski more versatile than some

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.400 
make this ski more versatile than some

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
right rocker course is the thing

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.180

got the Hypertech construction as well

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.319 
got the Hypertech construction as well
so<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.500> day<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:53.430> talked<00:01:53.670> earlier<00:01:53.970> about<00:01:54.000> how

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
so it's day we talked earlier about how

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.780 
so it's day we talked earlier about how
it<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.899> good<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.500> heart

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
it is so good in the heart

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.520 
it is so good in the heart
bad<00:01:56.000> conditions<00:01:56.510> I<00:01:56.690> think<00:01:57.050> those<00:01:57.320> two

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
bad conditions I think those two

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.290 
bad conditions I think those two
technologies<00:01:58.160> really<00:01:58.610> blended<00:01:58.970> something

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
technologies really blended something

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.920 
technologies really blended something
that<00:01:59.450> yeah<00:02:00.020> this<00:02:00.200> skis<00:02:00.560> really<00:02:01.190> dialed<00:02:01.930> in

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
that yeah this skis really dialed in

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.930 
that yeah this skis really dialed in
terms<00:02:03.290> of<00:02:03.440> its<00:02:03.560> edge<00:02:03.740> ability<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.850> know

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
terms of its edge ability you know

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.880 
terms of its edge ability you know
things<00:02:05.210> like<00:02:05.330> hybrid<00:02:05.690> tech<00:02:05.900> things<00:02:06.560> like<00:02:06.740> it's

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
things like hybrid tech things like it's

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.180 
things like hybrid tech things like it's
a<00:02:06.980> vertical<00:02:07.880> sidewalls<00:02:08.770> with<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.890> metal

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
a vertical sidewalls with the metal

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.250 
a vertical sidewalls with the metal
things<00:02:10.429> like<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:10.790> make<00:02:11.300> this<00:02:11.510> ski<00:02:11.840> when<00:02:12.050> it's

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
things like that make this ski when it's

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.940 
things like that make this ski when it's
in<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.470> hardpack<00:02:12.830> situation<00:02:13.820> hold<00:02:14.390> just

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
in a hardpack situation hold just

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.650 
in a hardpack situation hold just
amazingly<00:02:15.950> well<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:17.180> then<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.360> other<00:02:17.480> thing

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
amazingly well and then the other thing

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.510 
amazingly well and then the other thing
that<00:02:17.690> makes<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:18.050> ski<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:18.440> verso<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:18.890> the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
that makes this ski so verso is the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.120 
that makes this ski so verso is the
progressive<00:02:19.880> sidecut<00:02:20.410> right<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.860> this<00:02:21.950> is

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
progressive sidecut right and this is

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.710 
progressive sidecut right and this is
actually<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.460> psycho<00:02:22.790> which<00:02:22.910> excels<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.630> you
