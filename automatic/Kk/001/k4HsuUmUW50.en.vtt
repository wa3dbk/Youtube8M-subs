 Semifredo resin is ricotta cheese 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:42.200

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.640
 Sahara 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.289
 I certainly know that in a glass of 200 grams 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.380
 but I used to measure everything electronically 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:28.160
 weights take 50 grams of sugar 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.240
 I'll take those feelings over 250 grams 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.119
