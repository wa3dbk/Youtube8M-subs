i would love to see it be a regular
thing<00:01:33.679> I<00:01:34.130> think<00:01:34.940> that<00:01:35.149> Chicago<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.140> Madison<00:01:36.799> is

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
thing I think that Chicago to Madison is

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.580 
thing I think that Chicago to Madison is
probably<00:01:37.640> one<00:01:37.940> of<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.330> primary<00:01:38.690> areas<00:01:39.409> that

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
probably one of the primary areas that

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.260 
probably one of the primary areas that
should<00:01:39.619> have<00:01:40.130> passenger<00:01:40.729> service<00:01:41.060> that

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
should have passenger service that

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.219 
should have passenger service that
doesn't<00:01:41.899> is<00:01:42.319> that<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.530> good<00:01:42.770> way<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:42.920> say<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.280> and

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
doesn't is that a good way to say it and

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.539 
doesn't is that a good way to say it and
people<00:01:45.229> ask<00:01:45.560> me<00:01:45.679> well<00:01:45.920> do<00:01:46.039> you<00:01:46.159> need<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.429> have

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549
