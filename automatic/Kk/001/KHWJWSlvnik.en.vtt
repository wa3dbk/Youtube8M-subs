flummoxed<00:01:48.750> people<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.530> figured<00:01:49.980> the<00:01:50.160> first

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
flummoxed people I figured the first

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.160 
flummoxed people I figured the first
thing<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.030> would<00:01:51.210> do<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.570> figure<00:01:51.810> out<00:01:51.960> which

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
thing I would do is figure out which

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.469 
thing I would do is figure out which
button<00:01:52.440> combination<00:01:53.250> makes<00:01:53.430> Anakin<00:01:54.000> impale

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
himself on his lightsaber but actually I

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.060 
himself on his lightsaber but actually I

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
played through the whole game and think

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.650 
played through the whole game and think
it's<00:01:59.190> better<00:01:59.400> than<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.729> movie<00:02:05.420> because<00:02:06.420> even

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
it's better than the movie because even

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.090 
it's better than the movie because even

game<00:04:13.940> they're<00:04:14.150> usually<00:04:14.360> better<00:04:14.810> when<00:04:15.050> they

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
game they're usually better when they

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.440 
game they're usually better when they
focus<00:04:15.740> on<00:04:15.860> one<00:04:16.130> thing<00:04:16.430> like<00:04:16.670> episode<00:04:17.239> 1
