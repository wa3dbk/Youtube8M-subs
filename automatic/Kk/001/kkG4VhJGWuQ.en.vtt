advanced<00:00:02.010> BOSU<00:00:02.399> circuit<00:00:02.730> number<00:00:02.820> two<00:00:03.140> this

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
advanced BOSU circuit number two this

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.180 
advanced BOSU circuit number two this
circuit<00:00:04.470> we're<00:00:04.560> gonna<00:00:04.680> start<00:00:04.920> off<00:00:05.009> the

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
circuit we're gonna start off the

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.730 
circuit we're gonna start off the
push-up<00:00:05.580> exchange<00:00:06.089> followed<00:00:06.990> by<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.109> crossover

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
push-up exchange followed by a crossover

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.629 
push-up exchange followed by a crossover
lunge<00:00:08.059> then<00:00:09.059> into<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.420> side<00:00:10.110> pillar<00:00:10.550> when<00:00:11.550> we

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
lunge then into a side pillar when we

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.039 
lunge then into a side pillar when we
finish<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.000> ball<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.330> up<00:00:12.450> with<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.599> step<00:00:12.870> up

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
finish the ball that up with a step up

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.390 
finish the ball that up with a step up
and<00:00:13.230> we're<00:00:13.380> gonna<00:00:13.830> finish<00:00:13.980> up<00:00:14.219> with<00:00:14.340> some

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
and we're gonna finish up with some

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.900 
and we're gonna finish up with some
lateral<00:00:14.910> jumps<00:00:15.410> so<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.470> start<00:00:16.710> off<00:00:16.890> with<00:00:17.850> a

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
lateral jumps so to start off with a

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.970 
lateral jumps so to start off with a
BOSU<00:00:18.270> platform<00:00:18.750> side<00:00:18.960> down<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.740> should<00:00:19.890> have

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
BOSU platform side down you should have

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.320 
BOSU platform side down you should have
one<00:00:20.189> hand<00:00:20.369> on<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> floor<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:20.939> one<00:00:21.090> hand<00:00:21.270> on

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
one hand on the floor and one hand on

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.570 
one hand on the floor and one hand on
the<00:00:21.449> BOSU<00:00:21.710> he's<00:00:22.710> gonna<00:00:22.830> perform<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.340> push-up

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the BOSU he's gonna perform a push-up

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.660 
the BOSU he's gonna perform a push-up
and<00:00:23.939> then<00:00:24.029> cross<00:00:24.900> his<00:00:25.140> hands<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:26.310> other<00:00:26.400> hand

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
and then cross his hands the other hand

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.550 
and then cross his hands the other hand
up<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.029> just<00:00:27.090> cross<00:00:27.660> over<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.109> other<00:00:28.199> side

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
up and just cross over to the other side

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.410 
up and just cross over to the other side
we're<00:00:29.220> gonna<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.400> six<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.910> each<00:00:29.939> side<00:00:32.329> it's<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
we're gonna do six on each side it's the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.970 
we're gonna do six on each side it's the
standard<00:00:33.840> push-up<00:00:34.079> he's<00:00:34.350> up<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.559> his<00:00:34.649> toes

a crossover lunch he's going to stand

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.520 
a crossover lunch he's going to stand
back<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.210> kind<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.480> off<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.780> side<00:00:51.899> from

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
back and kind of off to the side from

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
back and kind of off to the side from
the<00:00:52.680> BOSU<00:00:53.070> he's<00:00:53.699> going<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> keep<00:00:54.030> both<00:00:54.210> his

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390

going to cross over each other as it
comes<00:00:59.250> onto<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> BOSU<00:00:59.760> well<00:01:00.510> both<00:01:00.719> toes<00:01:01.020> are

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
comes onto the BOSU well both toes are

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.740 
comes onto the BOSU well both toes are
gonna<00:01:01.260> stay<00:01:01.590> pointing<00:01:02.190> straight<00:01:02.370> forward<00:01:02.750> so

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
gonna stay pointing straight forward so

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.060 
gonna stay pointing straight forward so
it's<00:01:03.870> gonna<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> little<00:01:04.500> bit<00:01:04.619> difficult<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
it's gonna be a little bit difficult to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:14.210 
it's gonna be a little bit difficult to
balance<00:01:05.220> we're<00:01:05.610> new<00:01:05.790> six<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.270> each<00:01:06.420> leg<00:01:13.220> these

start<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.640> clock<00:01:47.820> now<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:50.580> he's<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.360> gonna

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
start a clock now and he's just gonna

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.630 
start a clock now and he's just gonna
try<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.840> hold<00:01:51.990> his<00:01:52.170> body<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.189> completely

standing up and holding his feet up
there<00:01:59.659> you<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.840> balance<00:02:01.049> yourself<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:02.130> this

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
there you can balance yourself on this

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.039 
there you can balance yourself on this
arm<00:02:02.520> that's<00:02:03.030> closest<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> ground<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:03.960> you

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
arm that's closest to the ground if you

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.630 
arm that's closest to the ground if you
need<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.289> put<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.530> forearm<00:02:04.950> down<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.250> balance

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
need to put that forearm down to balance

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.669 
need to put that forearm down to balance
also<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.569> try<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:06.899> pull<00:02:07.080> it<00:02:07.200> up<00:02:07.350> if<00:02:07.530> you

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
also you can try and pull it up if you

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:08.600 
also you can try and pull it up if you
want<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:07.890> make<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.130> little<00:02:08.250> bit<00:02:08.429> more

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
want to make it a little bit more

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.870 
want to make it a little bit more
difficult<00:02:12.950> almost<00:02:13.950> there<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.430> got<00:02:14.549> about<00:02:14.670> five

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
difficult almost there we got about five

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.640 
difficult almost there we got about five
seconds<00:02:15.360> left

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650
