00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello friends and welcome 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.740
 the next episode of the myth league thanks for 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.990
 your comments and video ratings they 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.480
 motivate to work further and immediately 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.610
 go to myth number one this myth was 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.070
 sent alexandro what happens if 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.320
 Cassiopeia is ulta luxury suite jarvan a or 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.740
 darius a second before completing them 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.199
 ults 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.300
 as you understand it is a difficult myth since 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.160
 It is difficult to clearly pick time in the first 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.590
 case you see that jarvan was in 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.750
 jump when I was utanul but I could not 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.940
 stop his flight and it looks like he's all 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.489
 equal to fly and finish ulta however 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.129
 upon landing it petrifies the case with 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.770
 Darius goes much more beautiful since he 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.200
 turns into a statue right in the air but 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.079
 such a cult has essentially taken damage 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.850
 according to Cassiopeia, it will still apply and finally 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.110
 the last champion to go 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.120
 test is a suite 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.520
 she is just like the previous champions 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.920
 behaved similar as you can see I 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.620
 utanul it a second before getting me 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.719
 damage by repeating the experiment and using 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.000
 Ult teach earlier it turned out that it does not matter 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.100
 when you stun her and if the suite is already 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.790
 start untying but the sooner you have it 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.920
 make the more beautiful the statue will turn out 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.240
 the second myth is very interesting and was sent 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.520
 my friend boom shaka 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.650
 can draven catch another's ax 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.990
 Drive on without a learned spinning ex 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.970
 we all know that drayvena from different 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.130
 teams can sometimes catch each other 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.560
 and what if you don't invest skill points 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.110
 spinning x and spend it instead 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.329
 for the benefit even in this case 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.909
 catching an ax and an enemy is very 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.040
 interesting and essentially gives two skills on 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.020
 first level such a solution can 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.479
 play into the hands of the norms of Allah if you 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.759
 beat another draven purely for 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.649
 interest we decided to test the myth for 2 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.840
 drive nah with different skins and what 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.380
 happens if i catch another's ax 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.420
 dravena 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.430
 will my ax skin change or 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.770
 will remain the same as it was and how you 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.590
 yourself can see the skin is not the champion 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.200
 affects the skin of the ax the next myth was 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.570
 sent by milan can they via their 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.299
 wall block ulti nocturne battle 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.340
 or malfit champions with dash skills or 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.009
 jumps can jump over walls 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.709
 but if you put the wall while the enemy is in 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.730
 flying then the wall will block it and will 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.550
 reckon the interauto 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.560
 and stop 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.090
 most give skills and jumps like 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.580
 just stopped awa 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.890
 knowing this we can consider ulta 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.170
 each of the previously listed champions 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.480
 the first test will pass the piles as soon as 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.820
 ulta activated i put a wall on her 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.040
 ways but as we see it did not work 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.310
 wai went through the wall like a knife through 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.770
 oil because the truth is not a hindrance with another 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.170
 the parties different conditions give different 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.780
 the results in this case the result is almost 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.150
 same if you put the wall closer to 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.370
 niva then she will alienate wai what 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.710
 the completion of the ults will be far enough 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.720
 to give anivia a chance to leave second 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.270
 a champion testing the strength of the wall 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.070
 the result will be the same nocturne 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.560
 as soon as the nocturne activates the ulta 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.540
 an invina appears in his path at first 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.240
 it seems that the wall should 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.170
 stop him but nocturne spat on everything 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.420
 these are your walls 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.180
 he just goes straight through them to 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.640
 goals are the last scenario of this myth with 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.830
 the boy starring absolutely too 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.580
 what happened in the nocturne fair and 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.770
 for makita 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.800
 he just ignores the wall passing 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.150
 through new and inflict anivia damage 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.670
 the next myth I sent to myself 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.920
 because I wanted to check it if 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.140
 Fiora ultuet s-yes and that change 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.459
 in places with distant shadow, will cancel 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.980
 This is ulta Fiora 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.750
 those who often play for very grandfather 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.270
 unhappy if pour them not 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.640
 worth it all due to the fact that in essence 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.739
 there is no escape on the line, and both the ults and 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.020
 she will constantly haunt you 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.209
 so I wondered how much 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.160
 need to go far to cancel it 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.410
 ultu you just saw very much 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.840
 a typical picture of lane vs fiora 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.910
 damage which is no salvation I decided 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.950
 test the myth at the elevator right and 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.110
 leave the shadow as far as I can 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.959
 the picture is the same as in the previous episode 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.150
 but here I use ulta on caitlin and 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.650
 teleport to fiore which immediately 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.840
 pounced on me with ulta 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.630
 at that moment I returned to the shadow on the 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.540
 plain and guess what happened PR 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.400
 finally got rid of me thanks for 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.769
 I watched the video I hope you 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.799
