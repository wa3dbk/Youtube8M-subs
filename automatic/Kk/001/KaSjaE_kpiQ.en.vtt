00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.519
 men do not look for you if you talk to them 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.680
 I do not think you want to bore them there 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.900
 above it is preferred that the ladies do not 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.650
 converse unless you do not want to 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.650
 amuse 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.449
 hi girls and guys I hope you are 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.869
 super good, because today I'm too 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.970
 Make up as you may realize and 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.360
 this is because this is the first video 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.660
 themed halloween to start and 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.309
 is part of a video collaboration with 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:48.809
 rosa yauri and other youtube girls 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:52.379
 well inspired by disney villains and 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.229
 I chose who is definitely my 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.640
 favorite and it's nothing more and nothing 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:02.339
 less than ursula of the little mermaid 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.450
 I decided to make a makeup inspired by 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:08.670
 which she uses but with certain 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.270
 modifications since I did not want to do it 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.939
 both a copy of your makeup but 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.250
 adapt it simply to a very look 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.680
 dramatic to be just some 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.590
 villanas this halloween if you do not like 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.979
 things so extravagant to be painted 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.869
 all face and good let's start and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.939
 he invited them to check also the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.880
 videos of the other girls so that 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.030
 can have more ideas about makeup 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.270
 of disney villains as it is a 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.749
 very very dramatic makeup we are going to 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.149
 start with our eyes and first thing 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:48.469
 what we are going to do is apply a test 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.469
 separate our shadows 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.630
 remember that on my channel I have a video 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.040
 on how to make one yourselves 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.970
 equally how are we going to use colors 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.470
 they could apply a white concealer 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.970
 then let's take a shadow on 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:11.330
 very intense blue color and we're going to 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.900
 put on all our eyelid mobile 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.000
 we can even go up a little bit more 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.050
 just not too much because we're going to apply 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.050
 then another color 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.780
 if you want it more dramatic 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.970
 Concentrate very well the color if not 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.970
 they can put it a bit more dim 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.140
 and we are going to take the second color that is 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.350
 purple 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.730
 and we're going to put it right where it ends 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:48.340
 the blue color as they are seeing there and 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.430
 let's do like a tail towards 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.830
 outside I did this because the 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.350
 makeup with many endings like this 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.620
 as in tip related it with the 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.250
 villanas maybe have nothing to do 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.560
 but I think so 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.110
 they can also give you the shape that you 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.410
 prefer later let's take a 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.480
 white shade or a light shade for 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.340
 put it in the small space that 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.190
 we have left below the eyebrows 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.250
 and since we apply everything we are going to take 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.739
 a blur brush to integrate it 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.700
 and that it does not look like that all the 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.310
 color divisions 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.260
 the more usable they want it the more 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.660
 they have to blur since if 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.769
 they want for something halloween really 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.110
 it does not matter much now with a cotton swab and 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.970
 a little make-up remover we're going to 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.510
 perfecting the outside of the 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.510
 makeup 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:54.580
 as you see this gives a much more finish 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.580
 clean and it's something very very easy to do 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:03.540
 now let's take a black eyeliner 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.969
 in pencil format of preference 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.579
 and we're going to put it on the side of 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:11.969
 Above our form tabs 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.620
 normal and out we're going to do as 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:17.260
 a tail 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.320
 I'm going to make the outline as thick as 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.729
 you want and we are also going to mark 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.729
 from the bottom 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.380
 then we are going to take black shadow with 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.630
 an angular brush and let's go over 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.630
 all we just outlined 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.430
 so that it stays in its place and 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.400
 blurs the edges a bit 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.800
 in this case I'm not going to blur it much 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.400
 but you can do it if you 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.400
 prefer 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.280
 and the same black shadow with the same 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.200
 I will apply it to my eyebrows 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.670
 I'm using black shadow only 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.280
 because it is a make-up 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.440
 dramatic if they want something more usable 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.940
 simply put the ones of the color that 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.790
 usually use 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.840
 and now let's take an eyeliner 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.270
 liquid in black and let's review 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.480
 the outline we did but with a 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.180
 finite line is simply so that 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.880
 get more black stuck on the eyelashes and 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.800
 that will not be removed as they can 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.300
 see in the part of the lacrimal we are going to 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.090
 make like a little piquito 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.370
 that's totally optional but how do you 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.639
 I said the makeups as well as with many 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:44.610
 peaks are more villainous now 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:47.639
 let's tilt our tabs and 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.139
 apply several layers of mascara if 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.319
 prefer they can apply also 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:55.620
 false eyelashes but I did not put them 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:58.099
 because at that moment I was going to remove the 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.099
 makeup 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.660
 and with that our eyes are ready 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:12.650
 now let's move on to the rest of our 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:15.740
 face first I'm going to take my base myself 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.100
 I only use compact powder but applies in 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.160
 its base in a normal way 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:26.040
 Úrsula is like a home but I wanted to 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.040
 keep it in one color and the normal 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:45.780
 and now let's apply a bit of 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:49.189
 bronze how are you looking there to mark 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.960
 the cheekbones and to disguise the double chin 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:54.569
 now like this makeup I am 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.990
 doing very dramatic I'm going to apply a 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:07:00.990
 super red lipstick as you see I am using 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.150
 an eyeliner because of that color is the 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.699
 ursula lipstick but if you do not 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:08.580
 they want more usable they can use a 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:10.889
 neutral lip and and 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.919
 remember that they are simple variations 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:16.919
 that you can do and good with that 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:19.439
 this inspired makeup would be ready 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:24.050
 in úrsula and I'll leave some pictures 

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:24.050
 so you can see it a little better 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.980
 and that would be all 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:43.710
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:46.530

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:50.430

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:55.169

00:07:55.169 --> 00:08:00.569
 a lot of ideas and they can also
