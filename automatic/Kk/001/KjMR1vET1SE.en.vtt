00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.180

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.250

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.280

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.040
 type and there I 100% focused on art I 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.840
 I always wanted to 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.600
 She speaks freedom to do what you 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.600

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.550
 my name is blonde and 35 years old I'm an artist 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.790
 plastic and I love what I do I love it 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.790
 what I do 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.940
 and after these voluntary work 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.100
 I started to design my project that in the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.200
 It's true that drum lessons are 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.060
 disabled people 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.000
 so I went to get the training of 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.400
 pedagogy that did not have 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.830
 opportunity for people to have a 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.760
 experience with people who love art and 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.470
 who are actually happy to serve 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.060
 When I set up this project, I had 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.810
 mind that it is the return it was not only the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.810
 project
