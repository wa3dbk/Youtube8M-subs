your<00:00:57.750> hypothalamus<00:00:58.430> so<00:00:59.430> um<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.350> was<00:01:01.350> enjoying

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
your hypothalamus so um I was enjoying

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.539 
your hypothalamus so um I was enjoying
that<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.879> much<00:01:03.379> that<00:01:04.379> when<00:01:04.799> i<00:01:04.860> went<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.220> start

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
that so much that when i went to start

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.780 
that so much that when i went to start
round<00:01:05.909> three<00:01:06.409> i<00:01:08.720> I<00:01:10.159> wasn't<00:01:11.159> quite<00:01:11.369> ready<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
round three i I wasn't quite ready to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.870 
round three i I wasn't quite ready to
give<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.090> phase<00:01:12.540> four<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.080> think<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.070> then<00:01:14.850> I

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
give up phase four I think so then I

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.719 
give up phase four I think so then I
fooled<00:01:15.240> myself<00:01:15.360> into<00:01:15.930> thinking<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.729> you

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
fooled myself into thinking that you

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.359 
fooled myself into thinking that you
know<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.880> wanted<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.360> see<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:18.960> maybe<00:01:19.770> I

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
know I wanted to see you know maybe I

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.160 
know I wanted to see you know maybe I
could<00:01:20.700> get<00:01:20.820> away<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.210> little<00:01:21.479> bit<00:01:21.659> more

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
could get away with a little bit more

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.380 
could get away with a little bit more
during<00:01:22.830> phase<00:01:23.130> two<00:01:23.670> maybe<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.180> wasn't

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
during phase two maybe it wasn't

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.039 
during phase two maybe it wasn't
necessary<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.310> strict<00:01:26.820> or<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.720> do<00:01:27.900> it

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
necessary to be so strict or to do it

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.170 
necessary to be so strict or to do it
this<00:01:28.229> way<00:01:28.439> or<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.280> way<00:01:29.490> well<00:01:32.180> one

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
this way or to do it that way well one

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.679 
this way or to do it that way well one
week<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.880> number<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.119> messed<00:01:36.509> up

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
week of that and number one I messed up

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.350 
week of that and number one I messed up
my<00:01:36.869> hypothalamus<00:01:37.530> from<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.460> perfect<00:01:38.939> phase

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
my hypothalamus from that perfect phase

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.499 
my hypothalamus from that perfect phase
four<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:40.920> you're<00:01:41.040> going<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.340> start<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.850> HCG

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
four so if you're going to start the HCG

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.950 
four so if you're going to start the HCG
and<00:01:42.630> take<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:44.009> better<00:01:44.280> be<00:01:44.670> really<00:01:45.090> firm

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
and take it you better be really firm

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960 
and take it you better be really firm
that<00:01:46.500> that's<00:01:46.860> really<00:01:47.340> what<00:01:47.490> you're<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.880> to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
that that's really what you're going to

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.010 
that that's really what you're going to
do<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.210> you're<00:01:48.299> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.450> stick<00:01:48.780> with<00:01:48.810> it

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
do and you're going to stick with it

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.230 
do and you're going to stick with it
because<00:01:49.619> otherwise<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.490> mess<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.729> what<00:01:51.119> you

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
because otherwise you mess up what you

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.200 
because otherwise you mess up what you
did<00:01:51.390> before<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.979> tried<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.520> return<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
did before and I tried to return to the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.050 
did before and I tried to return to the
phase<00:01:54.420> or<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:57.020> didn't<00:01:58.020> work<00:01:58.079> anymore

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
phase or and it didn't work anymore

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.330 
phase or and it didn't work anymore
and<00:01:59.210> I<00:01:59.780> started<00:02:00.200> climbing<00:02:00.380> really<00:02:01.189> fast<00:02:01.630> so
