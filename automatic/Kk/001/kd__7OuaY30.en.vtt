00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.500
 flowers a lot of people in the urban area of ​​villa elisa works the huerta 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.070
 called reunited farms 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.820
 that occupied an area of ​​about two thousand square meters of surface 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:24.269
 in which different varieties of vegetables are produced as beet 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.410
 tomato and sanabria thanks to the cooperation of its associates in a 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.320
 orchard where we are working 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.610
 at the national audience 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.330
 in fact the natural assets in an organic garden where we do the best 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
 possible use of resources such as water the soil 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.260
 for skies manure hill on organic matter in general that is 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.430
 wasted 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.440
 with the objective of producing food 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.770
 Achieving soil fertility permanently is one of the greatest 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.700
 challenges for technicians the most important in soil care 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.090
 from that point of view the one of our main objective is to feed this 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.280
 soil that I feel is that not only that because the plants 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.420
 if not beyond that especially he the element that allows the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.450
 plants are watching healthy stridency 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.070
 to feed the soil using different types of fertilizer 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.170
 for example here we certainly half of a production circuit 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.140
 where the organic garden is absolutely integrated what is the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.640
 goat farm 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.229
 then we use as an input the precious say the manures that 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.150
 here the animals goats the mobilization 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.380
 cows 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.930
 this integrates a composting wall processor and worm production 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.180
 then we do not have a good high quality snatch 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.280
 directly from the farm next to the mister coles go to the earthworms 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.620
 which composters and after about two or three months we are already getting 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.570
 efe the compos or the earthworm cluster 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.470
 which are really very nutritious for soil since 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.250
 hauls 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.170
 pl enrichment of the land is achieved with simple but very useful techniques 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.410
 we plan in nice to also is incorporating potassium to soil and you 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.209
 we incorporate itself bone meal so have a good level of 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.340
 phosphorus also for certain crops such as tomatoes or 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.659
 the opponent and other plants and fruits 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.379
 the fight against pests also develops naturally for 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.139
 preserve the quality of the soil 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:42.779
 certainly we use plant extracts for example extract of 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.509
 paradise tea extract tartago 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:51.839
 from below visitors even get to explanations learn quickly 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.859
 the techniques developed in the garden 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.789
 the kids that come to so many beings 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:02.989
 percent share with us the productive experience pass percent 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.460
 and for the different processes for example 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.949
 how sowing is done the seed how it is prepared to the soil 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.079
 as the fertilizers maintain 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.419
 percent until the transplant 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:19.180
 i the risk with the work application goode porthole and so on 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.550
 everything in the productive process itself 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.970
 and then to the great moment of this harvest for example they know 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.890
 how a carrot is harvested from which a carrot leaves, from which a 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.659
 lettuce 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.779
 because in general burbano guys have very little in relation sometimes with 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:40.569
 the productive sectors and do not know how to want a plant grows on the ground 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.900
 like a pc harvest like the tomato process before you get to start well 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.469
 mature and in launching it so for us and for the visitors a 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:54.970
 process really very pleasant also must be extremely positive in the sense 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:58.510
 that they do not learn it and we also learn from them
