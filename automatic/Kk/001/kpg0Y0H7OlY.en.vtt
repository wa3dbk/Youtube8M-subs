00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.620
 let's make some tea soaps 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.650
 green which they will do for the 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.680
 body and facial care and you will occupy 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.150
 two envelopes or three depending on the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.800
 amount of soap that you are going to make in 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.860
 this case I'm just going to do three 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.710
 soaps and I'm going to occupy two oil envelopes 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.190
 of vitamin e a spoonful 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.399
 and glycerin soap and optional you can 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.199
 also occupy some essence and oil 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.290
 of rosehip that is also very 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.820
 good for the skin but this we are 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.390
 optional that's if you want it 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.540
 add good let's start first 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.790
 adding glycerin soap 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.060
 our world and we will take 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.170
 bain- marie to melt and right now 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.380
 let's add the following 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.380
 ingredients 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.400
 it happened to me to tell you that the molds of 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.820
 You can also find them in haberdashery 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.460
 and craft stores and these you must 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.920
 to grease the previously when you go 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.440
 to pour the soap to take it off 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.440
 more easily and good let's move on to 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.140
 melt the soap 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.820
 since it 's melting I'm going to add 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.470
 the ingredients right now I'm going to add 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.180
 the vitamin e 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.680
 If you do not have liquid vitamin D 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.680
 add 3 capsules 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.650
 a few drops of essence 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.480
 content of two envelopes 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.480
 of green tea and we mix 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.010
 we have all the ingredients 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.750
 and we wait for it to melt for 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.750
 pour them to the molds 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.150
 of the molds with great care of not 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.150
 burn us 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.600
 to remove the bubbles only 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.569
 you occupy a little alcohol with a 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.819
 atomizer 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.120
 yes 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.299
 and with that it is removed or good and have passed 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.160
 several hours to my soap already sunbathed and 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.320
 the molds are already 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.350
 and that's how our soaps are 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.410
 tv a recommendation only 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.890
 clean them a little bit because with the 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.560
 oil that we put in the mold so that 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.630
 do not stick they might have a 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.160
 little up here nothing else is cleaned 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.540
 and we can use them on our skin 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.670
 well we are bathing when we move 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.860
 to wash the face 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.860
 see you next video is going
