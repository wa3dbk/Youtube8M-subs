quality and that type of thing so let's

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.570 
quality and that type of thing so let's
start<00:00:21.720> with<00:00:21.810> how<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.960> game<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.320> played<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:23.220> by

start with how the game is played so by

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.000 
start with how the game is played so by
the<00:00:23.640> way<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.240> classic<00:00:24.689> edition<00:00:25.010> so

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
the way this is the classic edition so

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.460 
the way this is the classic edition so
this<00:00:26.189> top<00:00:27.060> panel<00:00:27.420> here<00:00:27.449> slides<00:00:27.960> off<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.410> if

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
this top panel here slides off and if

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.290 
this top panel here slides off and if
you<00:00:28.560> flip<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.859> over<00:00:28.980> there's<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.340> 4x4<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
you flip it over there's a 4x4 and a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.770 
you flip it over there's a 4x4 and a
board<00:00:30.660> which<00:00:31.380> will<00:00:31.830> either<00:00:31.949> fit<00:00:32.279> back<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.510> top

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
board which will either fit back on top

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.670 
board which will either fit back on top
of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.770> box<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:36.200> didn't<00:00:37.200> really<00:00:37.380> do<00:00:37.500> that

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
of the box or didn't really do that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.020 
of the box or didn't really do that
right<00:00:37.890> or<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.399> set<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> ground

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
right or I can just set it on the ground

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.299 
right or I can just set it on the ground
double<00:00:39.570> time<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.110> then<00:00:40.500> inside<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:41.160> you'll

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
double time and then inside what you'll

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.240 
double time and then inside what you'll
see<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.809> each<00:00:42.809> color<00:00:43.110> has<00:00:43.379> three<00:00:43.800> stacks<00:00:44.160> of

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
see is each color has three stacks of

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.830 
see is each color has three stacks of
game<00:00:47.250> pieces<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.210> they<00:00:48.360> kind<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.629> mess

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
game pieces here and they kind of mess

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:58.189 
game pieces here and they kind of mess
inside<00:00:49.230> each<00:00:49.379> other<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:57.050> basically<00:00:58.050> what

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
inside each other this basically what

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.779 
inside each other this basically what
this<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.739> kind<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> glorified

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
this is is kind of like a glorified

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.420 
this is is kind of like a glorified
version<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.680> tic-tac-toe<00:01:01.680> or<00:01:01.710> Connect<00:01:02.219> four

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
version of tic-tac-toe or Connect four

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.340 
version of tic-tac-toe or Connect four
or<00:01:02.579> something<00:01:02.760> where<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> object<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.229> they

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
or something where the object is they

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.590 
or something where the object is they
get<00:01:04.470> four<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.739> your<00:01:04.979> own<00:01:05.100> color<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.090> row<00:01:06.330> on

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
get four of your own color in a row on

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.660 
get four of your own color in a row on
the<00:01:06.689> game<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.710> take<00:01:07.920> turns<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.549> there's

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the game so you take turns and there's

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.760 
the game so you take turns and there's
there's<00:01:09.030> three<00:01:09.299> things<00:01:09.540> or<00:01:10.290> there's<00:01:10.530> three

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
there's three things or there's three

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.350 
there's three things or there's three
types<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.159> moves<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.000> your<00:01:12.150> turn

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
types of moves you can do on your turn

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.600 
types of moves you can do on your turn
the<00:01:12.900> first<00:01:13.080> one<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.650> pull<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> piece

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the first one is you can pull a piece

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.460 
the first one is you can pull a piece
off<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.939> one<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.210> your<00:01:15.330> stacks<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.990> place<00:01:16.320> it

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
off of one of your stacks and place it

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.390 
off of one of your stacks and place it
on<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> board<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:18.090> second<00:01:18.450> option<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.680> can

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
on the board the second option is I can

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.480 
on the board the second option is I can
move<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.850> piece<00:01:21.470> that's<00:01:22.470> already<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.280> board

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
move a piece that's already on the board

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.929 
move a piece that's already on the board
of<00:01:23.729> mine<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.240> another<00:01:24.479> spot<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.729> third

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
of mine to another spot and the third

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.969 
of mine to another spot and the third
option<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:27.750> move<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.960> piece<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.530> cover<00:01:28.770> up

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
option is I can move a piece to cover up

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.830 
option is I can move a piece to cover up
another<00:01:29.220> piece<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.360> there's<00:01:30.540> three<00:01:30.810> different

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
another piece so there's three different

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.510 
another piece so there's three different
moves<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:31.770> make<00:01:31.950> which<00:01:32.100> makes<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
moves you can make which makes it a

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.760 
moves you can make which makes it a
little<00:01:32.700> bit<00:01:32.850> more<00:01:33.090> tactical<00:01:33.990> than<00:01:34.530> your

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
little bit more tactical than your

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.530 
little bit more tactical than your
typical<00:01:34.890> version<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.549> tic-tac-toe<00:01:35.880> because

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
typical version of tic-tac-toe because

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.990 
typical version of tic-tac-toe because
there's<00:01:36.990> multiple<00:01:37.320> move<00:01:37.770> types<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.460> it's

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
there's multiple move types and it's

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.390 
there's multiple move types and it's
also<00:01:39.150> four<00:01:39.509> by<00:01:39.659> four<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.650> you'll<00:01:40.770> find<00:01:40.979> as<00:01:41.250> you

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
also four by four so you'll find as you

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.550 
also four by four so you'll find as you
start<00:01:41.640> playing<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.360> there's<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.899> lot

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
start playing this that there's a lot

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.230 
start playing this that there's a lot
more<00:01:43.710> strategy<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.520> than<00:01:44.670> email<00:01:44.909> that

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
more strategy to do it than email that

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.070 
more strategy to do it than email that
you<00:01:45.329> may<00:01:45.509> have<00:01:45.630> been<00:01:45.810> to

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
you may have been to

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.040 
you may have been to
I<00:01:46.140> know<00:01:46.620> I<00:01:47.310> lost<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:48.090> first<00:01:48.210> couple<00:01:48.510> games<00:01:48.630> to

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
I know I lost my first couple games to

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.450 
I know I lost my first couple games to
friends<00:01:49.320> who<00:01:49.440> had<00:01:49.560> also<00:01:49.680> never<00:01:50.010> played<00:01:50.310> it

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
friends who had also never played it

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.180 
friends who had also never played it
because<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:51.540> wasn't<00:01:51.870> as<00:01:51.960> straightforward<00:01:52.740> as

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
because it wasn't as straightforward as

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.020 
because it wasn't as straightforward as
you<00:01:53.340> think<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> play<00:01:55.100> so<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.550> pretty<00:01:56.760> fun

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
you think to play so it's a pretty fun

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.430 
you think to play so it's a pretty fun
game<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.390> got<00:01:57.480> to<00:01:57.600> say<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.870> is<00:01:58.050> one<00:01:58.230> that<00:01:58.350> I'll

game I got to say this is one that I'll

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.230 
game I got to say this is one that I'll
probably<00:01:58.620> want<00:01:58.980> to<00:01:59.070> grab<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.550> I'm<00:01:59.700> going<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
it's kind of like you know it's tactical

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.200 
it's kind of like you know it's tactical
like<00:02:13.200> chess<00:02:13.530> but<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.220> also<00:02:14.370> more<00:02:14.670> simple<00:02:15.060> and

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
like chess but it's also more simple and

like chess but it's also more simple and

accessible to anybody that may not be

accessible to anybody that may not be
that<00:02:18.690> hardcore<00:02:19.820> so<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:21.240> good<00:02:21.540> game<00:02:21.750> I've<00:02:22.440> only

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
that hardcore so a good game I've only

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.920 
that hardcore so a good game I've only
had<00:02:22.740> about<00:02:22.860> five<00:02:23.790> games<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.570> far<00:02:24.810> but

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
had about five games of it so far but

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.960 
had about five games of it so far but
I've<00:02:25.050> been<00:02:25.560> enjoying<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.340> it's<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.670> little

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
I've been enjoying it and it's a little

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.940 
I've been enjoying it and it's a little
bit<00:02:27.180> more<00:02:27.620> complicated<00:02:28.620> than<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.800> had

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
bit more complicated than I had

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.560 
bit more complicated than I had
anticipated<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.850> that's<00:02:30.030> good<00:02:30.300> not

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
anticipated so that's good not

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.210 
anticipated so that's good not
complicated<00:02:31.140> but<00:02:31.380> there's<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.980> lot<00:02:32.100> more

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
complicated but there's a lot more

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.910 
complicated but there's a lot more
strategy<00:02:32.730> than<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:32.970> thought<00:02:33.740> now<00:02:34.740> this

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
strategy than I thought now this

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.100 
strategy than I thought now this
particular<00:02:35.430> version<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:36.060> picked<00:02:36.420> on<00:02:36.600> picked<00:02:36.990> up

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
particular version I picked on picked up

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.190 
particular version I picked on picked up

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
and it's got some nice dark colors but

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.170 
and it's got some nice dark colors but
when<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.040> bought<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.519> thought<00:02:53.700> this<00:02:53.940> might<00:02:54.120> be

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
when I bought it I thought this might be

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.550 
when I bought it I thought this might be
something<00:02:54.600> that<00:02:54.630> I'd<00:02:54.840> want<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.080> leave<00:02:55.260> out<00:02:55.410> on

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
something that I'd want to leave out on

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.100 
something that I'd want to leave out on
a<00:02:55.590> coffee<00:02:55.890> table<00:02:56.190> or<00:02:56.459> something<00:02:56.790> like<00:02:56.940> that

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
a coffee table or something like that

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.060 
a coffee table or something like that
because<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.230> looks<00:02:58.260> good<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.769> it<00:02:58.860> would<00:02:58.950> be

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
because it looks good and it would be

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.530 
because it looks good and it would be
real<00:02:59.280> easy<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.640> pick<00:02:59.820> up<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.060> play<00:03:00.239> with

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
I have some concerns about that now that

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.460 
I have some concerns about that now that
I've<00:03:05.850> seen<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.300> person<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.959> first<00:03:07.170> one<00:03:07.350> is

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
I've seen it in person the first one is

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.070 
I've seen it in person the first one is
the<00:03:07.709> pieces<00:03:07.950> itself<00:03:08.519> are<00:03:09.209> pretty<00:03:09.510> thin<00:03:09.840> I

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
the pieces itself are pretty thin I

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.240 
the pieces itself are pretty thin I
don't<00:03:10.380> know<00:03:10.440> if<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.590> can<00:03:10.739> see<00:03:10.920> them<00:03:11.040> at<00:03:11.160> all

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
don't know if you can see them at all

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.000 
don't know if you can see them at all
there<00:03:11.489> but<00:03:11.700> these<00:03:12.180> are<00:03:12.360> like<00:03:12.510> probably<00:03:13.470> an

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
there but these are like probably an

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.530 
there but these are like probably an
eighth<00:03:14.160> of<00:03:14.370> an<00:03:14.459> inch<00:03:14.580> or<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.850> sixteenth<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.420> an

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
eighth of an inch or a sixteenth of an

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.420 
eighth of an inch or a sixteenth of an
inch<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.900> they're<00:03:15.989> pretty<00:03:16.260> light<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:17.250> feel

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
inch and they're pretty light and I feel

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.430 
inch and they're pretty light and I feel
like<00:03:17.580> if<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.730> were<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:17.880> drop<00:03:18.209> these<00:03:18.390> too<00:03:19.019> much<00:03:19.200> on

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
like if I were to drop these too much on

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.180 
like if I were to drop these too much on
a<00:03:19.470> hard<00:03:19.709> surface

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
a hard surface

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.640 
a hard surface
they're<00:03:20.519> probably<00:03:21.300> susceptible<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.200> breaking

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
they're probably susceptible to breaking

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.940 
they're probably susceptible to breaking
especially<00:03:22.920> some<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.489> larger<00:03:23.850> size<00:03:24.300> ones

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
especially some of the larger size ones

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.479 
especially some of the larger size ones
and<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:28.200> that's<00:03:28.380> one<00:03:28.620> thing<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:29.010> second<00:03:29.340> thing

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
and so that's one thing the second thing

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.540 
and so that's one thing the second thing
is<00:03:29.930> this<00:03:30.930> came<00:03:31.170> packaged<00:03:31.590> in<00:03:31.890> shrink<00:03:32.400> wrap

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
is this came packaged in shrink wrap

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.720 
is this came packaged in shrink wrap
with<00:03:33.410> cardboard<00:03:34.410> supports<00:03:35.070> on<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.310> corners

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
with cardboard supports on the corners

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.570 
with cardboard supports on the corners
to<00:03:36.209> prevent<00:03:36.540> dinging<00:03:37.320> on<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.590> corners<00:03:37.980> and

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
to prevent dinging on the corners and

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.160 
to prevent dinging on the corners and
right<00:03:38.850> when<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.030> opened<00:03:39.360> up<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.570> shrink<00:03:39.840> wrap<00:03:39.989> I

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
right when I opened up the shrink wrap I

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.560 
right when I opened up the shrink wrap I
could<00:03:40.350> smell<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.739> like<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.820> lacquer<00:03:42.060> or

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
could smell the like the lacquer or

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.080 
could smell the like the lacquer or
whatever<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:42.989> finish<00:03:43.350> is<00:03:43.530> called<00:03:43.799> and

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
whatever this finish is called and

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.750 
whatever this finish is called and
I<00:03:45.200> can<00:03:46.200> actually<00:03:46.319> still<00:03:46.769> smell<00:03:47.069> it's<00:03:47.250> really

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
I can actually still smell it's really

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.000 
I can actually still smell it's really
really<00:03:48.150> strong<00:03:48.420> smell<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.870> some<00:03:49.680> kind<00:03:49.920> of

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
really strong smell of some kind of

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.059 
really strong smell of some kind of
finish<00:03:50.730> here<00:03:51.050> she's<00:03:52.050> weird<00:03:52.379> and<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.680> also<00:03:52.830> had

finish here she's weird and it also had

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.770 
finish here she's weird and it also had
kind<00:03:53.220> of<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.400> dusty<00:03:53.819> film<00:03:54.120> on<00:03:54.300> it<00:03:54.480> that<00:03:54.660> was

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
kind of a dusty film on it that was

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.600 
kind of a dusty film on it that was
coming<00:03:55.050> off<00:03:55.140> on<00:03:55.349> my<00:03:55.470> hands<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:55.980> first<00:03:56.160> couple

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
coming off on my hands the first couple

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.630 
coming off on my hands the first couple
times<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:56.970> handled<00:03:57.360> it<00:03:57.830> kind<00:03:58.830> of<00:03:58.920> nasty<00:03:59.099> to<00:03:59.519> be

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
times I handled it kind of nasty to be

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.930 
times I handled it kind of nasty to be
honest<00:03:59.910> with<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.209> it's<00:04:00.360> just<00:04:00.420> not<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:01.940> guess
