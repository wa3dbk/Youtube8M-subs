00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.610
 hello everyone we find ourselves 

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.930
 today for a dialogue so if 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.340
 you do not know how to store your 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.290
 necklace I propose you today a 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.850
 very easy tutorial 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.650
 it's gone you'll need a 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.930
 wooden center if there is a bar at 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.400
 medium it will have to be removed from a dozen 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.310
 to deny that one finds in store of 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.230
 do-it-yourself of a person painting in 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.010
 spray or if you prefer to paint in 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.359
 cube with a brush and ribbons 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.100
 start by protecting the surface on 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.140
 which you worked with 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.239
 newspaper 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.100
 spray the paint about 30 cm 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.569
 hanger, making sure to cover it 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.889
 fully let dry then done 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:44.229
 exactly the same for the other 

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:45.850
 side if bound waters are not from the 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:48.249
 color you want you can 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.049
 also the pins placed then the 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:53.949
 have equal distance from each other 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:54.489
 able I placed 8 to 6 cm one 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.440
 others 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.479
 once you like it 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.019
 make points in the pen to mark 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:03.969
 the places where you will drill breakthrough 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.530
 in the place you made the point without 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:10.450
 go too deeply 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.450
 then screw the medias inside 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.800
 for really simple deco I chose to 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.480
 to surround me the summit with durban for 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.480
 put some glue on this spot 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.520
 placing the ribbon and tighten during 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.520
 few seconds for the brace r 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.590
 then wrap the ribbon all around in 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.590
 squeezing well 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.860
 once arrived at the end redeposit a 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.840
 little glue and place the ribbon at 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.060
 over by squeezing well again 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.970
 for a few seconds cut the ribbon 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.970
 too much and stick the rest that exceeds 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.940
 he does the same thing for the widespread 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.790
 but be careful not to paste them 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.849
 fingers with the rest of the ribbons will create 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.849
 a 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.819
 Oh 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.790
 you can place it here or here by 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.450
 sticky personally i would prefer 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.920
 be 2nd option 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.320
 it'll just it 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.440
 hang on necklace and that's it 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.440
