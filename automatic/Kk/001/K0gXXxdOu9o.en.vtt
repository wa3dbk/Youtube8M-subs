00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
simpler first of all if you look at a

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.660 
simpler first of all if you look at a
store-bought<00:00:28.140> dress<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.800> nicer<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:29.340> you'll

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
store-bought dress a nicer one you'll

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.250 
store-bought dress a nicer one you'll
see<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.060> they<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:30.660> them<00:00:30.840> down<00:00:31.050> at<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
see that they have them down at the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.860 
see that they have them down at the
bottom<00:00:31.820> isn't<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.210> seam<00:00:33.450> all<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> way

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
bottom isn't just a seam all the way

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.100 
bottom isn't just a seam all the way
around<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> edge<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.950> looks<00:00:35.460> like<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:36.149> it's

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
around the edge it looks like it's it's

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.139 
around the edge it looks like it's it's
really<00:00:37.320> invisible<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:38.640> looks<00:00:38.820> like<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.090> just

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
really invisible it looks like it's just

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.569 
really invisible it looks like it's just
folded<00:00:39.750> under<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.530> tacked<00:00:40.860> every<00:00:41.340> inch

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
folded under and it's tacked every inch

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.639 
folded under and it's tacked every inch
or<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:41.910> there's<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.210> tiny<00:00:42.570> stitch<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.440> same

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
or so there's a tiny stitch the same

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.639 
or so there's a tiny stitch the same
color<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.399> fabric<00:00:44.960> so<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.050> aren't<00:00:46.469> really

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
color as the fabric so you aren't really

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.100 
color as the fabric so you aren't really
seeing<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.399> sement<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.210> looks<00:00:48.420> folded<00:00:48.840> under

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
seeing a sement just looks folded under

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.709 
seeing a sement just looks folded under
and<00:00:49.260> that's<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.649> look<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.039> want<00:00:50.660> on<00:00:51.660> your
