approaching right turn so right away
within<00:01:45.990> seconds<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.649> actually<00:01:46.950> calculated

within seconds it's actually calculated
the<00:01:47.609> route<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.969> now<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.140> not<00:01:49.320> only<00:01:49.500> giving

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the route and now it's not only giving

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.590 
the route and now it's not only giving
me<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.920> graphical<00:01:50.460> representation<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.450> has

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
me a graphical representation but it has

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.480 
me a graphical representation but it has
that<00:01:51.810> voice<00:01:52.079> as<00:01:52.380> well<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.310> I'm
