00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.670
 ah 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.219
 and redials a castle - turned 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.849
 here you can hold me in the black hand 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.099
 I set the life and the business very fast 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.619
 of Mexican football what dirty hercules 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.970
 gomez received marca.com in his house where 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.769
 he talked about the problems of football 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.599
 Mexican and the bad experience that 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.269
 touched live when he was a player of Puebla 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.250
 the soccer player of santos lagoon that 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.800
 He played the South Africa-2010 World Cup with 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.170
 the United States assured that many players in 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.970
 Mexico is afraid but identified in 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.970
 the promoters the biggest problem 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.280
 and the team from Puebla told me 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.520
 high place 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.980
 and I did not want to go to his place and I know what 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.809
 which is the gentlemen's pact that I know 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.420
 Hercules and you are not free but not 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.100
 Have you bought your pass with us ? 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.440
 keep knowing the park here 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.120
 Gentleman says that another team has to 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.339
 negotiate with us for you for your 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.540
 rights although you no longer have a contract if 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.360
 over there I was going 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:09.050
 pachuca lost money as easy as they 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.970
 paid to negotiate is something that runs 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.230
 against the human laws of 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.290
 work is the worst for me from 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.290
 Mexicans are the promoters there is one 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.900
 a thought that what its citizens 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.880
 the old days have to follow their 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.340
 not until today also 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.780
 I believe that the country and whatever it does to the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.910
 fifa goal or what do the same 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.350
 operation will continue to exist there is 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.390
 a shame because the truth football 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.700
 Mexican are groups because it's pretty 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.760
 pretty pretty cute and to have 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.860
 people so involved in the grief of this 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.510
 people who want to take advantage of 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.860
 player wants to take advantage of the system 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.260
 that the organization and the 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.619
 team and for me it's the worst thing about 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.619
 Mexican soccer 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.900
 Of course, yes, of course, very much 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.410
 spent moments in the Mexican a 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:03.100
 player talks or does things and that same 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.990
 directive or any team punishes him 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.330
 and shows him as an example the weapon very 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.759
 bad that is not like in spanish is dream 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.780
 It is that going to be playing the strike and 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.250
 we did not offer us no 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.050
 change things not here are you going to play 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.060
 because they tell you that you are going to play you have 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.740
 to play and if you do not play find 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.390
 others and you're so worried because it's your 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.010
 salary and because here in Mexico is the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.010
 who win and those who do not win
