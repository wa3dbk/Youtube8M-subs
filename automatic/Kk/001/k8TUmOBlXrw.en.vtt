something you know without having

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630

go underneath it to we're note and Bend
up<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.790> reach<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.180> route<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.630> would<00:00:37.380> be<00:00:37.530> to

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
up and reach the route that would be to

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.540 
up and reach the route that would be to
play<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.250> good<00:00:38.969> play<00:00:39.239> enough<00:00:39.660> below<00:00:40.340> been<00:00:41.340> up

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
play that good play enough below been up

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.319 
play that good play enough below been up
to<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> roof<00:00:42.110> i<00:00:43.879> think<00:00:44.879> some<00:00:45.030> revolutionary

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
to the roof i think some revolutionary

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.720 
to the roof i think some revolutionary
but<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.260> idea<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.950> falling<00:00:47.100> below<00:00:47.280> and

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
but the idea of falling below and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.369 
but the idea of falling below and
bending<00:00:47.969> up<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> strong<00:00:48.510> note<00:00:48.750> another

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
bending up to the strong note another

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.580 
bending up to the strong note another
struggle<00:00:49.770> be<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.980> third<00:00:50.989> there's<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.110> third<00:00:52.350> so

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
struggle be the third there's a third so

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.380 
struggle be the third there's a third so
we<00:00:52.680> start<00:00:52.980> blowing<00:00:53.430> up<00:00:56.750> fifth<00:00:57.750> strong<00:00:58.410> over

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
we start blowing up fifth strong over

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:14.320 
we start blowing up fifth strong over
then<00:01:00.390> i'm<00:01:00.570> from<00:01:06.590> those<00:01:07.590> all<00:01:07.770> together

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.149 

you're<00:01:15.330> bending<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.229> chord<00:01:16.560> tones<00:01:16.860> you're

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
you're bending to the chord tones you're

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.070 
you're bending to the chord tones you're
bending<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:17.670> those<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.450> case<00:01:18.630> try<00:01:18.900> at

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
bending to all those this case try at

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:35.050 
bending to all those this case try at
home<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:22.530> those<00:01:22.680> notes<00:01:32.330> Sam<00:01:33.330> is<00:01:33.479> going<00:01:33.659> with

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
home to those notes Sam is going with

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.889 
home to those notes Sam is going with
Benz<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:37.830> problem<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.369> major<00:01:38.899> that

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
Benz and the problem is a major that

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.020 
Benz and the problem is a major that
doesn't<00:01:40.380> work<00:01:40.530> as<00:01:40.680> well<00:01:40.710> because<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.549> notes

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
doesn't work as well because the notes

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.130 
doesn't work as well because the notes
below<00:01:42.289> the<00:01:43.289> week<00:01:43.920> notes<00:01:44.220> are<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:45.539> don't<00:01:46.020> like

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
below the week notes are I don't like

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.559 
below the week notes are I don't like
them<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.380> much<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:47.039> going<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.119> longest

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
them as much and going to the longest

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.480 
them as much and going to the longest
explanation<00:01:49.080> why<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> don't<00:01:49.679> even<00:01:49.860> that's

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
explanation why I don't even that's

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.669 
explanation why I don't even that's
really<00:01:50.700> know<00:01:50.880> why<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.690> my<00:01:51.869> solution<00:01:52.319> was<00:01:52.350> for

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
really know why so my solution was for

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.830 
really know why so my solution was for
major<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.280> start<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:54.270> week<00:01:54.420> about<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.810> a

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
major I start on the week about this a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.680 
major I start on the week about this a
bottom<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:55.649> stronger<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.340> go<00:01:56.429> down<00:01:56.700> from

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
bottom the stronger and go down from

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.020 
bottom the stronger and go down from
playing<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.990> major<00:01:59.270> instead<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.390> going<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:02.280> blow

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
playing a major instead of going to blow

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.150 
playing a major instead of going to blow
it<00:02:03.209> up<00:02:03.509> I'll<00:02:03.990> go<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:07.140> actually<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.709> we<00:02:07.890> thought

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
it up I'll go so actually the we thought

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.039 
it up I'll go so actually the we thought
is<00:02:08.250> bent<00:02:08.519> and<00:02:08.700> then<00:02:08.850> I<00:02:08.940> resolved<00:02:09.509> down<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.929> get

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
is bent and then I resolved down and get

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:22.640 
is bent and then I resolved down and get
some<00:02:10.080> bottom<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.799> the<00:02:10.860> strong<00:02:11.100> know

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.559 

and<00:02:23.549> I<00:02:25.069> always<00:02:26.069> add<00:02:26.250> on<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.549> strong<00:02:26.819> tone<00:02:27.060> it's

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
and I always add on a strong tone it's

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.750 
and I always add on a strong tone it's
just<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.840> major<00:02:28.349> seems<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.860> work<00:02:29.220> with<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.430> let<00:02:29.579> me

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
just a major seems to work with a let me
