then<00:01:58.649> got<00:01:59.159> this<00:02:00.090> guy<00:02:00.420> at<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.170> end<00:02:01.409> here<00:02:02.270> it's

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
then got this guy at the end here it's

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:20.979 
then got this guy at the end here it's
long<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.409> weird<00:02:04.770> demon<00:02:05.250> cow<00:02:05.490> here<00:02:10.370> mooshroom

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.110 

and<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.079> think<00:02:22.290> that's<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.709> one<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:23.670> call<00:02:23.880> the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
and I think that's the one to call the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:40.309 
and I think that's the one to call the
DP<00:02:25.940> 28<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.980> then<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.069> got<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.340> blend

right<00:02:41.319> here<00:02:46.379> and<00:02:47.379> once<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:47.890> break<00:02:48.069> them<00:02:48.280> down

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
right here and once you break them down

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.069 
right here and once you break them down
and<00:02:48.549> it<00:02:48.760> started<00:02:49.120> loading<00:02:49.450> you<00:02:49.720> don't<00:02:49.870> have<00:02:49.959> to

00:04:59.869 --> 00:04:59.879 
just a quick video tutorial on how to

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.050 
just a quick video tutorial on how to
use<00:05:00.240> these<00:05:00.690> heavy<00:05:00.930> caliber<00:05:01.169> machine<00:05:01.710> guns

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
use these heavy caliber machine guns

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.610 
use these heavy caliber machine guns
this<00:05:03.060> is<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.330> only<00:05:03.539> way<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.050> you<00:05:04.259> can<00:05:04.409> use

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620

yes<00:05:18.569> the<00:05:18.900> only<00:05:19.259> possible<00:05:25.159> it's<00:05:26.159> very<00:05:26.370> simple

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
yes the only possible it's very simple

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:32.480 
yes the only possible it's very simple
and<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:28.860> results<00:05:29.250> are<00:05:29.460> really<00:05:29.520> cool<00:05:31.129> so<00:05:32.129> these

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
and the results are really cool so these

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.610 
and the results are really cool so these
are<00:05:32.669> basically<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.120> turrets<00:05:33.750> of<00:05:33.990> flying<00:05:34.349> spot

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620
