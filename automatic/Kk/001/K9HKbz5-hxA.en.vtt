00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.519
 Hello, youtubers, how are you doing? 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 as we know this week apple has 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.710
 presented what is 17 and has released it 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.309
 to the public 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.099
 good as we see apple has given us as 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.679
 we see and how I think everyone already knows the 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.489
 we put to give a very different interface 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.869
 a change that we have really noticed 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:29.929
 so here in techno colombia is 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.410
 necessary to see how we know beta 1 of 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.990
 this generation of the support has 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.430
 released to the public let's see good 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.920
 we find with the top part 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.870
 we found the messages almost without 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.110
 no change is the only one that has been 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.570
 removed the shadow next side we found the 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.200
 of facetime that this is a novelty for 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.460
 what is the iphone since the iphone does not 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:59.090
 we had this on the radio for 6 and 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.430
 the previous ones to I of 6 we found the 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.320
 of calendar at this moment it does not show 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.269
 well as the square because I have a 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.549
 white background but it's a small square 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.070
 white and every day is updated 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.760
 like the previous version 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.710
 then we have photos that went from the 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.860
 the photo and a sunflower like a sunflower 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.110
 but in a color palette we see it 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.900
 we enter is very simple 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.280
 as you can see we have organized 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.140
 the album is very I think that very well 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.780
 let's continue we have the camera that also 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.470
 we see that change from a lens to the photo 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.470
 from a camera 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.049
 we see that it gives us different options 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.780
 to exchange between photo and video 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.259
 square with a square photo or a 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.259
 panoramic photo 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.619
 for example if we are going to take a picture already 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.990
 because it includes effects within the 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.990
 photo for the moment of taking the photo 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.430
 let's keep going 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.060
 we found the climate that we see that 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.049
 has changed 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.049
 we find 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.950
 we think it has changed now 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.010
 we found the clock that we see that now 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.409
 in the always we will have the clock 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.310
 of hands that will indicate the 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.319
 Exact time 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.989
 the video app we see that it has not 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.270
 changed much later that of notes this one 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:32.400
 there has been a considerable change as 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:35.000
 we can see it's all white and going and 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.010
 when going to a type of notes we find that 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.080
 that we can add a new one and that 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.480
 we have yellow lines but 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.970
 it's going to be a white background 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.879
 then we have contacts that have also 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.879
 changed a lot from yellow to gray 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.950
 step of yellow gray we find 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.329
 reminders for later for 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.220
 magazines that we also see that has 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.040
 changed a lot already happens to be like a 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.890
 aa library to show us as magazines 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.510
 we found the calculator has also 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.510
 changed a lot 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.720
 we found game center for me this is 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.360
 the most considerable change that 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.450
 we find because it happens of like four 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.040
 sections that showed games to four 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.530
 balls to me to my taste very nice 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.530
 then we found the bag and its almost 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.390
 nobody uses it because I do not use ever 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.240
 then we find compass has also 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.310
 had a considerable change after 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.710
 we found adjustments that we see that has 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.370
 changed its icon on the inside 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.370
 as well 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.050
 and then we found the app the app 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.020
 store and the itunes store that we see that has 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.300
 had some changes 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.590
 Well let's see how the system is 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.200
 inside there in the bottom 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.750
 we found safari phone that also 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.360
 has had a change mail and the app 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.610
 good music for example when we enter 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.610
 to safari find is very beautiful 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.330
 I want to show them like that so they will not notice 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.160
 that by just installing 17 you 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.720
 can continue to use almost all the 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
 applications that had the only 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.950
 application that found that it is not 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.690
 compatible at the moment is podcast and 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.030
 what is strange is that it is the same app 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.190
 of apple because in this case remote 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.500
 remote 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.500
 what is another apple app if it works for me 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.410
 has found that many changes the 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.900
 games do not work and I do not know if they remember 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.630
 but always when we were going to go to the 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.669
 last page we found a search engine 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.160
 it's not like that anymore, it's on any page 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.160
 what are we doing down 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.030
 and we find that it gives us to search 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:59.789
 something on the iphone as you know has a 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.759
 control center that by sliding from 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:05.449
 down up we can change 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.449
 many things 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:12.590
 the same when we go down 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.590
 we found many things 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.370
