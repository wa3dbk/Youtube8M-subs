but Sega knows how to get the best out
of<00:03:01.030> her<00:03:01.180> skaters<00:03:01.570> hey<00:03:02.290> dennis<00:03:02.620> is<00:03:03.660> 24<00:03:04.660> skaters

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.229 
and I think that they are really
world-class<00:03:07.540> athletes<00:03:08.550> they<00:03:09.550> work<00:03:09.910> really

world-class athletes they work really

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.220 
world-class athletes they work really
hard<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:10.930> they<00:03:11.380> skate<00:03:11.680> from<00:03:11.890> their<00:03:12.130> heart<00:03:12.459> and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
hard and they skate from their heart and

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.320 
hard and they skate from their heart and
when<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.260> look<00:03:14.440> for<00:03:14.680> this<00:03:14.830> year<00:03:15.220> is<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.459> they
