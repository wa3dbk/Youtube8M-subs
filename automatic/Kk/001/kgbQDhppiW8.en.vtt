00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.379
 I just opened the boys we have a dairy farm 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:10.219
 kabul the net 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:11.839
 three children 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.269
 and we try to get there so well 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.359
 food for social life 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.529
 sustainability is what drives him 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.649
 later it gets gradually but we are falling here with making the 

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:24.060
 plan 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.060
 due consideration of the aspects of both occupants 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.429
 and among other things information one 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.030
 an important part 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.030
 and the old situation at the tunnel with rtl bayern 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.930
 compared to the fifa 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.420
 further explains who they give 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.910
 numbers that it could hold a place relative to the lake and theft 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.090
 divide 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.940
 the modern latvia 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.160
 Cooper I am you the idea to state of course LED lighting 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.920
 drinking water supply and 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.960
 primary systems each delivers their work 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.960
 but especially use the LED lighting and thereby 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.329
 this farmer who has 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.600
 the LED lighting was chosen because of that 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.070
 yes many benefits 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.740
 LED lighting appears from the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.100
 the neighborhood so slowly that it is theirs 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.700
 that is a lot 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.650
 with little energy 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.650
 to give a place in relation to the existing fixtures 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.630
 yes then you should count that one 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.070
 about 60 70 percent money and energy 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.110
 this LED lighting that 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.420
 use 150 watt yourself there you must bring 15 the story about 165 was 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.420
 I compare it to gas discharge lamps 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.710
 you are already saving 300 watts per country 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.860
 the payback time of the latvian light compared to May 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.690
 gas discharge lamps 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.520
 so between four and five years that depends on it occasionally 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.150
 how much if everyone's home 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.180
 the lifespan of these flights of LED lighting up to 50,000 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.910
 setting up 15,000 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.340
 table tops flat in 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.900
 so pack away that is already three times as long what to do for it 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.510
 larger screen 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.240
 buy back on the saving 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.819
 advantage is that you immediately judge 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.879
 they give a nice clear lay 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.879
 other flights may sometimes occur during that period 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:19.379
 this image, on the other hand, is not literate when making contacts with these countries 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:20.409
 the case 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.279
 this image is roasting 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:26.239
 I don't have you nice light this is working Thursday comes very close 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.719
 daylight where you often occur 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.759
 engeldot came with the branch in sneek 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:35.769
 were then busy with starting up the foundation of the game 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.939
 and they then have all the material of the sewer 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.729
 later on the water supply 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.319
 in the steel plate three years ago 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.559
 of these were so positive 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.559
 how would you come with a hammer from LED lighting 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.459
 sound like a whole 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.979
 a good way the familiar way 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:57.909
 can do business with
