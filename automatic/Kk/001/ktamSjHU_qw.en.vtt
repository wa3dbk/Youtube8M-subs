lined up pretty good on the back here
you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.180> probably<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:36.930> that's<00:01:37.470> not<00:01:37.710> perfect

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you can probably see that's not perfect

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.359 
you can probably see that's not perfect
around<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> flash<00:01:39.119> area<00:01:39.950> but<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.220> still

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
around the flash area but you can still

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.940 
around the flash area but you can still
see<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.549> says<00:01:41.880> sprint<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.570> says<00:01:42.780> galaxy<00:01:43.560> s3<00:01:43.799> so

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
see it says sprint and says galaxy s3 so

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.069 
see it says sprint and says galaxy s3 so
the<00:01:44.040> logo<00:01:44.250> shows<00:01:44.399> through<00:01:44.700> better<00:01:45.360> grip<00:01:45.810> then

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
the logo shows through better grip then

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.300 
the logo shows through better grip then
the<00:01:46.200> first<00:01:46.590> case<00:01:47.240> there<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> raised<00:01:49.500> edge<00:01:49.890> on

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the first case there is a raised edge on

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.889 
the first case there is a raised edge on
it<00:01:50.750> my<00:01:51.750> only<00:01:51.869> concern<00:01:52.049> with<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.560> one<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:53.130> that

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
it my only concern with this one is that

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.990 
it my only concern with this one is that
a<00:01:54.899> lot<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.860> people<00:01:55.950> were<00:01:56.219> saying<00:01:56.490> or<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.850> few

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
a lot of people were saying or a few

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.429 
a lot of people were saying or a few
people<00:01:57.180> were<00:01:57.270> saying<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.960> has<00:01:58.079> tens<00:01:58.350> me

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
people were saying that it has tens me

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.899 
people were saying that it has tens me
to<00:01:58.500> turn<00:01:58.619> yellow<00:01:58.890> over<00:01:59.189> time<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.729> one's

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
to turn yellow over time this one's

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.670 
to turn yellow over time this one's
brand<00:02:00.060> new<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.810> don't<00:02:01.229> know<00:02:01.320> if<00:02:01.380> that's<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
brand new so I don't know if that's the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.310 
brand new so I don't know if that's the
case<00:02:01.939> but<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.600> you're<00:02:03.810> looking<00:02:03.840> for<00:02:04.020> something

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
case but if you're looking for something

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.059 
case but if you're looking for something
that<00:02:04.500> shows<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.759> back<00:02:06.020> has<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> nice<00:02:07.320> grip<00:02:07.770> on

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
that shows the back has a nice grip on

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.669 
that shows the back has a nice grip on
it<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> TPU<00:02:09.840> material<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.410> don't<00:02:10.560> mind

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
it is a TPU material if you don't mind

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.150 
it is a TPU material if you don't mind
the<00:02:10.800> softness<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.910> TPU<00:02:12.209> material<00:02:12.270> this

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
the softness of the TPU material this

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.240 
the softness of the TPU material this
is<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.610> one<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.850> go<00:02:13.940> with<00:02:14.980> okay<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.130> finally

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
is the one to go with okay and finally

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.940 
is the one to go with okay and finally
we<00:02:16.580> have<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.790> drop<00:02:17.630> suit<00:02:17.930> by<00:02:18.110> body<00:02:18.380> glove<00:02:18.680> I

kind of found this case by accident I
had<00:02:21.650> been<00:02:22.040> using<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.580> body<00:02:22.910> glove<00:02:23.060> case<00:02:23.210> on<00:02:23.570> my

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
had been using a body glove case on my

previous phone the LG optimus s and as

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.810 
previous phone the LG optimus s and as
it<00:02:26.810> turns<00:02:27.050> out<00:02:27.340> they<00:02:28.340> have<00:02:28.490> one<00:02:28.640> for<00:02:28.760> the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
it turns out they have one for the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.550 
it turns out they have one for the
galaxy's<00:02:29.240> well<00:02:29.390> I've<00:02:29.870> dropped<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.500> phone

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
galaxy's well I've dropped this phone

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.560 
galaxy's well I've dropped this phone
probably<00:02:31.340> four<00:02:31.580> or<00:02:31.610> five<00:02:31.790> times<00:02:32.030> over<00:02:32.360> the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
probably four or five times over the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.090 
probably four or five times over the
two-year<00:02:32.720> period<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.740> phone<00:02:33.890> has

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
two-year period and the phone has

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.940 
two-year period and the phone has
survived<00:02:34.520> it<00:02:35.510> did<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:36.230> particular<00:02:36.530> one<00:02:36.800> add

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
survived it did this particular one add

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.340 
survived it did this particular one add
a<00:02:36.980> lot<00:02:37.190> of<00:02:37.250> bulk<00:02:37.520> but<00:02:38.390> this<00:02:38.570> one<00:02:38.810> still<00:02:39.320> remains

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
a lot of bulk but this one still remains

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.160 
a lot of bulk but this one still remains
slim<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.160> does<00:02:40.310> not<00:02:40.460> add<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.790> lot<00:02:41.270> of<00:02:41.570> bulk<00:02:41.810> to

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
slim it does not add a lot of bulk to

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.380 
slim it does not add a lot of bulk to
the<00:02:42.200> galaxy<00:02:42.710> s3<00:02:43.070> however<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.910> only<00:02:43.970> comes<00:02:44.210> in

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
the galaxy s3 however it only comes in

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.390 
the galaxy s3 however it only comes in
black<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.750> blue<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.590> if<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:45.950> want<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.160> retain

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
black and blue so if you want to retain

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.670 
black and blue so if you want to retain
that<00:02:46.640> look<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.420> white<00:02:47.960> phone<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.440> can't

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
that look of the white phone you can't

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.920 
that look of the white phone you can't
do<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:48.890> with<00:02:49.160> this<00:02:49.190> case<00:02:49.550> but<00:02:50.420> I<00:02:50.450> think

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
do that with this case but I think

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.860 
do that with this case but I think
that's<00:02:51.170> pretty<00:02:51.560> much<00:02:51.710> the<00:02:51.770> only<00:02:51.980> con<00:02:52.690> for<00:02:53.690> me

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
that's pretty much the only con for me

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.480 
that's pretty much the only con for me
the<00:02:54.590> installation<00:02:55.160> is<00:02:55.250> pretty

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
the installation is pretty

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.710 
the installation is pretty
straightforward<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:56.180> push<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.510> corners<00:02:56.870> in

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
straightforward you push the corners in

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.170 
straightforward you push the corners in
and<00:02:59.720> you're<00:02:59.870> done<00:03:00.580> what<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.610> do<00:03:01.760> like<00:03:01.880> about<00:03:01.940> it

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
and you're done what I do like about it

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.540 
and you're done what I do like about it
is<00:03:02.450> it's<00:03:03.020> a<00:03:03.170> good<00:03:03.620> compromise<00:03:03.920> between<00:03:04.130> the

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
is it's a good compromise between the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.870 
is it's a good compromise between the
first<00:03:04.760> two<00:03:04.850> you<00:03:05.390> you've<00:03:05.960> got<00:03:06.580> basically<00:03:07.580> a

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
first two you you've got basically a

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.840 
first two you you've got basically a
thin<00:03:07.940> like<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.960> first<00:03:09.170> case<00:03:09.440> but<00:03:10.400> it's<00:03:10.550> also

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
thin like the first case but it's also

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.700 
thin like the first case but it's also
got<00:03:11.060> shot<00:03:11.300> protection<00:03:11.810> like<00:03:11.960> the<00:03:12.080> TPU<00:03:12.410> case

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
got shot protection like the TPU case

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.280 
got shot protection like the TPU case
but<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.370> doesn't<00:03:13.610> have<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:13.850> cheesy<00:03:14.240> TPU<00:03:14.960> that

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
but it doesn't have that cheesy TPU that

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.400 
but it doesn't have that cheesy TPU that
gummy<00:03:15.560> type<00:03:16.040> feel<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:17.410> definitely

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
gummy type feel to it definitely

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.830 
gummy type feel to it definitely
masculine<00:03:18.800> styling<00:03:19.490> you'd<00:03:20.240> say<00:03:20.420> it's<00:03:20.570> select

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
masculine styling you'd say it's select

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.660 
masculine styling you'd say it's select
something<00:03:21.050> out<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.320> a<00:03:21.800> science<00:03:22.190> fiction<00:03:22.340> movie

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
something out of a science fiction movie

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.460 
something out of a science fiction movie
maybe<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:24.910> like<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.060> way<00:03:26.209> that<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.959> the

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
maybe I like the way that the the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.830 
maybe I like the way that the the
buttons<00:03:27.830> are<00:03:28.160> covered<00:03:28.880> actually<00:03:29.480> because<00:03:29.810> i

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
buttons are covered actually because i

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.270 
buttons are covered actually because i
find<00:03:30.050> myself<00:03:30.230> hitting<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.770> rocker<00:03:30.950> button

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
find myself hitting the rocker button

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.949 
find myself hitting the rocker button
the<00:03:31.340> power<00:03:31.520> button<00:03:31.670> too<00:03:31.880> easily<00:03:32.090> when<00:03:32.750> i<00:03:32.780> go<00:03:32.900> to

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
the power button too easily when i go to

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.750 
the power button too easily when i go to
grab<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.290> phone<00:03:33.440> this<00:03:33.980> adds<00:03:34.190> some<00:03:34.340> resistance

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
grab the phone this adds some resistance

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.400 
grab the phone this adds some resistance
to<00:03:34.850> it<00:03:34.970> plus<00:03:35.180> it<00:03:35.390> brings<00:03:35.570> them<00:03:35.720> flush<00:03:36.020> with<00:03:36.380> the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
to it plus it brings them flush with the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.770 
to it plus it brings them flush with the
outside<00:03:36.530> edge<00:03:37.010> unlike<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.209> other<00:03:38.330> two<00:03:38.420> which

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
outside edge unlike the other two which

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.140 
outside edge unlike the other two which
is<00:03:39.020> just<00:03:39.140> cut<00:03:39.440> out<00:03:39.560> holes<00:03:39.740> so<00:03:40.130> dirt<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:40.910> dust

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
is just cut out holes so dirt and dust

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.000 
is just cut out holes so dirt and dust
can<00:03:41.720> get<00:03:41.870> in<00:03:41.989> there<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:42.380> also<00:03:42.500> makes<00:03:42.680> it

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
can get in there and it also makes it

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.570 
can get in there and it also makes it
kind<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.310> difficult<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.330> find<00:03:45.430> whereas<00:03:46.430> this

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
kind of difficult to find whereas this

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.820 
kind of difficult to find whereas this
one<00:03:46.640> you<00:03:47.090> can<00:03:47.120> actually<00:03:47.450> just<00:03:47.810> feel<00:03:48.560> them

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
one you can actually just feel them

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.900 
one you can actually just feel them
pretty<00:03:49.250> easily<00:03:49.310> I<00:03:49.760> liked<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:52.100> raised

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
pretty easily I liked the the raised

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.550 
pretty easily I liked the the raised
portions<00:03:53.450> because<00:03:53.900> it<00:03:54.080> makes<00:03:54.170> it<00:03:54.290> easy<00:03:54.440> to

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
portions because it makes it easy to

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.210 
portions because it makes it easy to
hold<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:55.670> cutouts<00:03:56.030> are<00:03:56.239> fantastic<00:03:56.900> they're

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
hold the cutouts are fantastic they're

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.750 
hold the cutouts are fantastic they're
centered<00:03:58.220> they<00:03:58.850> don't<00:03:59.030> impede<00:03:59.450> as<00:04:00.110> far<00:04:00.410> as

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
centered they don't impede as far as

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.850 
centered they don't impede as far as
microphone<00:04:01.760> or<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.330> USB<00:04:02.660> connector<00:04:03.110> and<00:04:03.290> it's

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
microphone or the USB connector and it's

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.640 
microphone or the USB connector and it's
still<00:04:04.160> thin<00:04:04.520> I<00:04:04.760> mean<00:04:04.940> I'd<00:04:05.090> it<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:05.900> it's<00:04:06.020> it's

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
still thin I mean I'd it and it's it's

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.160 
still thin I mean I'd it and it's it's
like<00:04:06.770> I<00:04:07.130> don't<00:04:07.400> know<00:04:07.550> one<00:04:07.850> or<00:04:08.030> two<00:04:08.330> millimeters

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
like I don't know one or two millimeters

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.560 
like I don't know one or two millimeters
of<00:04:09.770> thickness<00:04:10.610> is<00:04:10.760> added<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.300> phone

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
of thickness is added to the phone

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.240 
of thickness is added to the phone
itself<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.260> that's<00:04:12.380> at<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.620> thickest<00:04:13.040> part

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
itself and that's at the thickest part

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.880 
itself and that's at the thickest part
so<00:04:14.000> for<00:04:14.180> me<00:04:14.360> this<00:04:14.959> is<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.260> one<00:04:15.380> I'm<00:04:15.470> going<00:04:15.650> with

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
so for me this is the one I'm going with

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.810 
so for me this is the one I'm going with
the<00:04:16.280> body<00:04:16.669> glove<00:04:16.850> drop<00:04:17.840> suit<00:04:18.580> but<00:04:19.580> again

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
the body glove drop suit but again

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.520 
the body glove drop suit but again
there's<00:04:20.180> no<00:04:20.209> right<00:04:20.720> case<00:04:20.989> for<00:04:21.169> everyone

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
there's no right case for everyone

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.900 
there's no right case for everyone
there's<00:04:21.770> there's<00:04:22.100> different<00:04:22.430> solutions<00:04:22.789> for

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
there's there's different solutions for

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.580 
there's there's different solutions for
different<00:04:23.030> people<00:04:23.479> but<00:04:23.570> I<00:04:23.660> hope<00:04:23.780> this<00:04:23.960> helps
