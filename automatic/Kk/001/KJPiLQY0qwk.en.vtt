00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.139
 hello dear friends the other day I was 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.269
 visiting a forum presumably dedicated 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.340
 to photoshop photoshop and all this and 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.740
 someone was asking how to enhance freckles in 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.109
 a photograph and I thought that I could 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.400
 be an interesting topic not so much for the 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.070
 technique itself that can also have 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.289
 more uses but by the way to approach a 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.539
 problem that this way does not have a 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.730
 solution too obvious before 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.289
 nothing to say that this photograph is of a 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.239
 page called morgue file puntocom 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.090
 where there are pictures of this free 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.620
 this one in particular is from the user middle 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.420
 week and you will see here superimposed on the 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.860
 picture information and link 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.989
 if you want to download it for 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.329
 experiment for your good account 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.760
 as I said is a kind of problem that does not 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.260
 has such a clear solution because the 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.420
 elements that interest us are 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.340
 very irregular elements very scattered 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.980
 by the face and that although locally 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.010
 are darker than the area of ​​skin that 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.870
 the surrounds do not always have an outline 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.420
 very defined and also in terms 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.430
 global do not have the same color or 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.630
 same luminosity everywhere bone 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.369
 summarizing that the most 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.380
 usual to select something 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.970
 surely we fail but it is something 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.310
 that varies a lot according to the photo 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.320
 according to the skin and the lighting that there 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.410
 Maybe if more than one technique 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.210
 normal can then serve us one of 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.640
 the things we could try to do 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.340
 posts to complicate a little bit more the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.440
 life is to come to channels and see if here 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.360
 we have something that seems more or less 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.920
 to a mask in the red channel from 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.110
 then not because here is still 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.780
 less contrasted than in the channel 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.610
 added rgb the green channel is a 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.770
 bit better but not much better either 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.140
 than the normal channel and the blue channel 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.479
 maybe it feels like it's a bit 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.830
 better and it is possible that even applying 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.170
 some calculation operation between the 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.390
 green channel and the blue we got a 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.010
 result better but I've done some 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.140
 tests apart from some previous case that 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.970
 I had had a little experience 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.800
 more and as I say there are pictures where with 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.509
 channels you can take something out and there are others 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.190
 cases where the thing is a bit more 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.720
 complicated here for example if I try 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.729
 now apply a level adjustment with 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.110
 Control the echo command backed 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.000
 of the channel by the way whenever you do 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.410
 a copy because if we would not be 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.810
 modifying the original channel and 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.220
 annoy and we love the image as I say in 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.050
 this case with the channel duplicate and a 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.910
 Level adjustment could try 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.350
 contrast more the pegs but of course 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.970
 I find that for example in this 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.400
 area here tried to contrast more 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.830
 to lighten the skin around here I'm 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.840
 completely fusing those of the nose 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.270
 I already say that there is some that could be done 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.470
 some invention to try 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.270
 counter this but instead 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.860
 I will go directly to one of the 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.270
 many techniques that could be employed 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.580
 but one that I find especially 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.620
 curious that has to do with the filter 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.630
 of dust and tears that comes to us very 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.330
 well in this case because what we want 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.120
 isolate the only feature maybe 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.640
 differential that it has is that it is 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.990
 as of spots not as if it were a 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.700
 kind of imperfection in a 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.040
 surface that otherwise does not have a 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.390
 too defined texture or at least not 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.550
 as striking as the contrast that 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.770
 suppose with freckles good I go to the menu 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.970
 filter and now I leave the filter menu 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.220
 because I forgot to duplicate the 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.010
 image first of all doubled it and now 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.680
 I come to filter noise dust and tears 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.410
 this filter let's say that the point of 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.480
 departure would be this the smallest radius 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.590
 of your radio and radio threshold has to do 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.600
 rather with the size of the 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.150
 imperfection and the threshold 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.710
 the criteria to search to determine 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.450
 what change must there be between a 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.190
 point and another to be considered 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.570
 relevant to the filter to make it 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.600
 considered an imperfection a 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.250
 dust rip or whatever then the 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.980
 idea is to go down the threshold and go 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:38.060
 raising the radius and reach a point 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:42.320
 as you see where they begin to disappear 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.270
 the flaws this is a matter of going 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.910
 playing with these values ​​I have before 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.190
 done and roughly a value of 36 and 13 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.690
 I think it would be fine as you see this 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.150
 it was before clicking on the little window 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.860
 violante is to drop medel after and what 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.420
 I do is remove freckles 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.860
 some will say but if this is just what 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.480
 contrary to what we have said that 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.600
 We were going to do it a little bit 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.580
 patience accepted and now we have though 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.230
 has affected the whole image but if we 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.660
 we fix in particular on the skin and 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.460
 freckles we have a skin with freckles and a 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.070
 skin without freckles and from here 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.080
 we could think if we could find 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.690
 or somehow remove the difference of 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.060
 the two images we could have the base 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.380
 of a mask for freckles 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.780
 fortunately for these cases God 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.710
 created the difference mode that what it does 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.030
 it's just show 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.160
 the difference between this layer and the 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.440
 lower what is equal is shown from 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.030
 black color and the rest acquires a color 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.220
 that depends on the type of difference that 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.410
 there is in this case we see that there are 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.360
 something that already looks a lot like a 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.940
 mask what I'm going to do now is 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.190
 press uppercase control to the command 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.680
 uppercase options on mac to create 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.940
 a combined layer here over I'm going to 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.310
 erase this layer because it no longer 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.990
 I need and now in this layer that 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.910
 it seems quite a mask as I say 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.440
 I go first of all has to saturate with 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.110
 uppercase control subo command 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.259
 uppercase hearing picture settings 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.570
 saturate and then pulse control 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.729
 the m command if I wanted curves but 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.190
 good with control levels l think that already 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.320
 I managed and tried to contrast this 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.360
 much more so that freckles are left 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.949
 all white and the rest if it were not 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.400
 black is black but good more or less 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:19.220
 already it is I think that this way already it would be 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.630
 enough I accept and now good 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.759
 obviously areas here that I do not 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.080
 they would interest them I could eliminate them later 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:26.560
 but 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.800
 since we're going to make a selection 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.539
 and I'm going to erase these areas to see a 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.169
 moment that tells us here there is around here 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:35.169
 some apk 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.950
 nor is it necessary to respect 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.290
 the last freckle but good put control 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.360
 kick delete command on mac for 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.750
 fill in this case with my color of 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.530
 background that is black 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.450
 now I'm going to erase this eye here 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.270
 because here you do not have to be 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.169
 painted and I would also have to paint the 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.930
 lips that I do not want 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.490
 that are affected good more or less 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.229
 and it would be fine then now I pulse 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.259
 control command to select it 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:07.509
 everything and control with c command to copy 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:09.460
 because then I saw him planting there 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.710
 in a mask so that this now 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.419
 is let's say a normal image is 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.189
 turn into mask there are more ways to 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.259
 doing it I do it directly like this 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:19.060
 copying and pasting the mask now I'm going 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:21.159
 to hide this because not for now 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.520
 I do not need it and I'm going to create a layer 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:26.439
 saturation tone could be done with 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.960
 curves or with other systems I'm going to 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:31.210
 do so and now I click on the 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.270
 Saturation and pulse tone mask 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.939
 control v to paste this mask that I've 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:40.300
 created before good now I come to the adjustment 

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:42.159
 saturation tone itself and pulled this 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.009
 palette to make it look better I'm going to go down 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:46.629
 the brightness of these scholarships 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.249
 obviously now it seems that there 

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:49.810
 exploded a kind of bomb with 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:51.099
 shrapnel in the face or that you have stepped on 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.169
 a puddle has splashed his face 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:55.150
 because it's very weird but right away 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:56.380
 We'll see how to fix this before I go to 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.560
 finish 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:01.540
 improve a bit mask to 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.820
 some pieces that I would have to paint from 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.550
 black though really how am I going to 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.780
 merge it seems to me in soft light we see 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.510
 that disappears so I do not have any 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.860
 even to perfect that part of 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.290
 all ways he said that this still 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.330
 is maybe as focused as these 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.880
 freckles so what I can do is 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.800
 come here to the double click mask to 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.260
 that the properties panel opens and 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.180
 put two pixels or four good 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.950
 openwork pixels and with this I suppose that 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:31.240
 you see this was before and this is now 

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:32.650
 before now this contour of 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.590
 the mask and it is more blurred 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.330
 effect before after we can come here 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.800
 because I think it's good for me 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.630
 little bit is not good enough but the 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.300
 videos I always try to exaggerate everything 

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.650
 a little more to make it look good and like 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.110
 we see this was before this is after 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.000
 we have managed to create this mask 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.160
 tremendously complicated to create if what 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.590
 we would have had to do by hand we 

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.050
 could create it in a jiffy and get 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:58.450
 the result we were looking for and this 

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.190
 method of merging in difference create 

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:02.020
 a combined and many times in 

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.120
 combination with dust and rips already 

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.370
 times with some 

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.680
 it's a pretty good way to get 

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:10.110
 a mask of little things that otherwise 

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.820
 it would be complicated to get well that has 

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.860
 been everything as always very many 

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.340
 thank you for following this video and I hope 

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.340
 that see you soon
