00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.360
 walrus all dear friends today show 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.009
 pretty cool auto maker 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.200
 hens which will help you a lot 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.520
 survival with food extraction so let's 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.770
 let's see how it works all 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.990
 quite simply we have here in particular 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.240
 chickens sit in the chamber and after some 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.580
 time they themselves will start spawning 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.179
 eggs these eggs will peacock fall into our 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.099
 distributor 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.019
 and from there they will be replenished here 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.570
 already chickens let's check it out 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.830
 take yourself some eggs and 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.110
 imagine that chicken 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.210
 their demolished our special system will 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.739
 now automatically spawn these eggs 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.329
 here who will hatch 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.800
 little chicks 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.260
 the only thing that is of course necessary 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.000
 turn on our system and now the heat has gone 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.859
 Now our eggs are automatically 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.719
 are thrown to be executed by ken fighters and 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.910
 after some time movie action movies 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.949
 grow and their growth does not allow them 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.350
 be in that pocket and they fall 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.660
 into the lava but since the chicken expresses with it 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.640
 drop it 1 with some chance and of course 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.320
 same chicken that through the funnel 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.120
 automatically accumulate in our 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.610
 the chest and now I will show you how 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.920
 to make such a firm in itself we will proceed for 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.810
 start we need to build a floor with this 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.820
 firms of course could drown her 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.619
 underground but I think that with this 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.360
 by the floor it will look much better 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.430
 further cut down the hole here put in 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.650
 his chest and in this chest send 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.600
 funnel on which we put on top immediately 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.799
 half block but she can top the chest 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.930
 immediately mouth and glass 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.180
 well and of course form here then 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.490
 immediately a small pocket in which 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.380
 will be our chickens further beyond 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.250
 semi block need to put one 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.380
 Dispenser face him here and so and 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.210
 ending our pocket we'll just do 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.880
 here are the walls here 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.159
 put yourself a little glass now 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.810
 it is very important to pour lavua over here 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.149
 put the crow so that she 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.960
 watched my face in block and down in our 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.329
 distributor 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.829
 and then put a few crow chick 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.600
 resting directly on her 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.969
 but so that one block stayed here 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.740
 empty space for the wall and then on 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.570
 funnels we lay mats to 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.170
 little hens didn't fall through them 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.759
 We do not build walls so that chicken 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.740
 just did not die lava from them 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.980
 close the glass and finish our 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.810
 a room at your discretion at the top can 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.440
 make here such a hatch through which 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.000
 you will upload additional 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.770
 well, in general, our system 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.150
 almost ready left only 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.950
 lead roadstone 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.110
 for posting ration us in fact 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.210
 will need a comparator repeaters 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.070
 and some pieces of red 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.380
 dust comparator must be positioned so 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.390
 so that he reads the signal from the distributor but 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.100
 and after the repeater which will strengthen it 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.140
 signal we post roadstone here 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.060
 so further here you need 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.070
 install one repeater so he 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.470
 recorded our distributor himself but here 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.080
 let's make an activation system 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.120
 will signal son of petar and here 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.650
 make a place for a lever that will 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.680
 activate the system too that is if 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.840
 lever down then the whole system , red 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.420
 stone and automatically shut off and how 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.370
 only we raise the lever when hit 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.230
 some eggs in the dispenser 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.080
 system is automatically activated and 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.790
 the egg is done here now when 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.310
 the chickens are loaded automatically 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.410
 started to carry eggs and the system earned in 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.640
 full well, you had Mudgee 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.310
 and thank you for watching 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.900
 This video I hope it was useful to you. 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.540
 and if so then put him 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.970
 please like but see you soon 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.130
 but if we turn on the regime with fought as 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.360
 we have activated all the features of this 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.370
 smart cursor 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.470
 for starters let's start with the suggestion that 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.870
 some animals we get right away 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.820
 near the cursor the number of their efficiency as well 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.620
 name well and in the upper right we 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.459
 get information about what this is but 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.459
 passive
