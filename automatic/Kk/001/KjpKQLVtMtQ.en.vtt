00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.119
 hello everyone and welcome to table 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.910
 its acoustic points like for a 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.320
 new guitar course in video then 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.150
 today the short we will be interested 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.829
 in fact what is called the technique of 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.939
 small technically left bearing that 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.130
 is very useful for all those who 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.300
 want to play solos or not 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.710
 besides, we find some elsewhere 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.599
 but it's mainly used in 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.179
 solo and as the technique is 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.500
 relatively simple explained not so 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.269
 easy to apply though 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.010
 did not expect too much we will do that one 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.420
 only video one part will not go 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.100
 an intro and several parties that goes 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.210
 to go relatively quickly 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.250
 so what is a 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.079
 bearing technique already and well I 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.640
 shows you a little adventure that goes 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.170
 give us a nice example of what 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.610
 that's where you see fears and there 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.660
 above we will have to play the case this 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.050
 rope of ré suite to cassette rope of 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.879
 ground 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.920
 that's the same box on two strings 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.140
 consecutive then after I just 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.120
 add box 5 and box six strings 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.980
 of 6 to say that there is a sequel 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.989
 alas when we are facing this kind of 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.670
 situations with the same box play on 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.860
 two different courses is good a 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.080
 little bit bothered there are many ways 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.130
 to play that passage there could be by 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.200
 example to his two fingers jean 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.180
 the ring finger and the little finger with so 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.590
 annular would fit in cassette and 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.510
 the little bank will be short of only 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.100
 Sept 15 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.780
 and play them a network then at christmas the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.550
 the problem is that we do not have 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.810
 always two fingers available in 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.280
 this kind of situation they are born on 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.230
 the strings very acute we do not have the place 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.120
 to place on castrais and cuba on 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.930
 has no place to place both 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.000
 fingers yourself box 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.890
 it's not obvious another solution 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.210
 would be to make a bar and we pose a 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.740
 finger on all strings 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.090
 the problem is that if we do that we 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.210
 will play the first note then the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.560
 second date 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.290
 and the two men will ring at the same 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.460
 time and that's it there are cases where it can 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.170
 to be very good but there are a lot of 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.640
 case also we do not want the two months 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.030
 a graves will be led one then 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.729
 the other 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.110
 so it's not going to be a third technique 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.150
 would be to play the first note with a 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.300
 finger raised the finger and come to ask 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.770
 on the second since continued more 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.540
 the problem is that if we do that 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.560
 walking we have a hole monty silence between 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.790
 the two Olympians 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.030
 and when we want to play a melody 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.289
 that follow each other is not super top 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.690
 so these three techniques are 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.069
 usable in some cases but just 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.610
 not always so we need another 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.319
 solution 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.590
 when we want to play that kind of 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.670
 situation without which holes without having to 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.370
 use two fingers etc 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.610
 and that's the roll-around 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.310
 look like that 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.330
 the work of hergé the two notes that 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.610
 sounds independently of each other 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.010
 they are not superimposed by the bait of 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.390
 silence and I use only one roof one 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.550
 see what this is 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.770
 technique to do it would have placed 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.540
 our directory for this case a simple 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.830
 on a niche must also on the rope 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.840
 the most serious of the two ie the 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.010
 rope degrees in this case and we're going to 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.120
 to pass quite normally on it 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.800
 must be well rounded as we do 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.350
 usually there is no difference 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.270
 good I'm you mattress until then all 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.709
 go well after to come play the rope 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.840
 which is below the G string in 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.790
 cassette we will have to flatten your 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.170
 finger we're not going to move it we're not going to 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.870
 to lift their pose are worth the build 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.850
 completely and getting done translated 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.250
 a ship chartered the ground rope in 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.040
 cassette right here the same amount 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.500
 correctly and in addition to that since 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.220
 flattened our finger will grant it 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.630
 now suffocate 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.160
 she is touched by the tip of 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.680
 the ring and note resonates more 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.600
 so it avoids the bar case and we have them 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.410
 two notes that are superimposed on each other 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.650
 doing this in diving the donuts 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.150
 his trunk and without any problem then 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.230
 this technique is not super obvious 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.270
 to do because what's going to happen 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.890
 is that when your back at the beginning of 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.900
 on the rope tried to imagine the rope 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.270
 who's right here we're gonna need you 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.820
 normally and after we will flatten it and 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.830
 is that the last phalanx there that 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.950
 just flatten and we have our finger that 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.890
 in a kind of weird low position 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.420
 it's cute and it's not easy to 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.430
 take this position debut in a who 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.470
 have a lot of trouble but by dint of you 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.790
 lead to try to do it you 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.260
 will eventually soften you 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.720
 fingers and be able to do that with 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.880
 anybody must do 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.940
 that with the thumb is a good way to 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.110
 soften the tendons and company 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.330
 so to train what is that 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.560
 we can do and well in fact we can 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.540
 just do what I come from you 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.220
 show with any finger under 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.230
 any box on any 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.010
 couple of notes so for example I 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.720
 take my index 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.600
 I'm going to go over the case 3 of the 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.790
 gate of migrants that plays the note and I 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.989
 come flatten to come celebrate 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.570
 rope that is below on the same 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.610
 case and choke the half bass serious 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.740
 play after a holmes I flatten I play 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.620
 with handcuffs 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.970
 and after synchronizing from either 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.720
 do without keel and the world can do 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.120
 it's with the middle finger 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.080
 l ring with the draw we can 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.640
 to do at any place 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.680
 obviously you 'll always take yourself 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.240
 a little harder and you can 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.890
 to do absolutely anywhere 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.650
 couple of ropes to be for everyone regardless 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.390
 frame there is still a last 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.760
 point to see on this team from 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.350
 rolling is that in some cases we 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.360
 will have to do it backwards 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.280
 that is, where to start with 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.890
 rope to more serious of the two and have 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.180
 chained with the agreement of the most thorny 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.910
 so we order whose position 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.860
 normal we suffered but sometimes not 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.150
 have to do it the other way it's 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.100
 to say that we will have to start with 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.290
 the rope to more acute and chain with 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.390
 the same box are the rope that's just 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.820
 more serious so in this case there the 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.810
 technique is really upside down at 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.440
 better to start in a position 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.060
 par 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.640
 we will start at the position already 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.060
 flattens as if we had just done a 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.550
 rolling 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.890
 we play this note and this time 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.110
 waves and flattens the finger or the round where 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.530
 we just land on the rope more 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.740
 serious 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.640
 so it makes me this and if you have 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.770
 a little bit of trouble finding the 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.540
 starting position the position already 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.830
 flattens eh ben you can do a 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.120
 rolling to find you say 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.640
 can put your should normally be 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.550
 serious connection do the rolling and there 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.750
 this is the starting position so this 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.120
 technique is not very complicated to 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.320
 explain a fake flatten a finger or the 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.510
 zapa shoot once we are already 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.680
 flattens but it just takes a lot to 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.880
 workouts for really mastery 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.710
 and especially with the little finger or 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.419
 the ring finger and you will often need 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.800
 to do it with the ring finger the little 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.340
 finger is a little rarer but it 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.320
 happens anyway 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.430
 so to train you do what 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.410
 I told you you take a little bit of yourself 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.600
 ask one place and you built his 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.710
 games the rope that just below wow 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.080
 lambert you can do without 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:17.550
 I flattened the rope just above or 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:19.130
 in cdd of musical scope 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.080
 you can have any 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.850
 motive a move do not aim the 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.410
 early speed on this exercise 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.920
 you really have to make sure rather than 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.180
 the names sounds very nice one who 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.590
 is no noise and 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.040
 other things like that it's the most 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.870
 important 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.030
 and after you will be able to apply to each 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.380
 Once you have the American played 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.230
 on two prospective bodies 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.030
 so that's the technique of the moment 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.380
 it is an essential tool to know 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.730
 when you want to play solos 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.610
 because you will often be for what 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.780
 kind of case and so work on it right 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.950
 as much as possible it puts a little bit of 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.210
 time like that you'll be ready when 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.400
 you will need it 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.750
 so I tell you next time 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.730

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.930
 for other guitar lessons and then 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.190

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.780
