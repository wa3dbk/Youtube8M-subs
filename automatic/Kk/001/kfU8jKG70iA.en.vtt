00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.060 
it and I was kind of like not sure just
because<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.869> kind<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.170> seemed<00:00:25.439> like<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.830> same

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
because it kind of seemed like the same

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.400 
because it kind of seemed like the same
thing<00:00:26.490> as<00:00:26.789> what<00:00:27.539> people<00:00:27.840> were<00:00:28.019> saying<00:00:28.080> about

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
thing as what people were saying about

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.679 
thing as what people were saying about
shatter<00:00:28.920> when<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.279> first<00:00:29.460> came<00:00:29.699> out<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.510> was

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
shatter when it first came out so I was

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.569 
shatter when it first came out so I was
kind<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.960> not<00:00:31.170> really<00:00:31.199> sure<00:00:32.070> whether<00:00:32.309> or<00:00:32.430> not<00:00:32.520> I

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
kind of not really sure whether or not I

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.310 
kind of not really sure whether or not I
want<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.820> purchase<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.300> but<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.780> finally<00:00:34.079> gave

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
want to purchase it but I finally gave

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.410 
want to purchase it but I finally gave
in<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> hype<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.370> picked<00:00:35.700> up<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.030> bottle

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
in to the hype and I picked up a bottle

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.110 
in to the hype and I picked up a bottle
of<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.620> one<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:38.040> was<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.579> truffle

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
of it and the one I got was in truffle

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.869 
of it and the one I got was in truffle
ger<00:00:39.360> square<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.800> looks<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.550> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
ger square so it looks like this and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.750 
ger square so it looks like this and
this<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> sort<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.260> silvery<00:00:43.680> toned<00:00:44.129> gunmetal

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
this is a sort of silvery toned gunmetal

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.720 
this is a sort of silvery toned gunmetal
gray<00:00:45.030> shade<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.500> its<00:00:46.739> own<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.520> really

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
gray shade so on its own it's a really

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.720 
gray shade so on its own it's a really
pretty<00:00:48.030> shade<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.469> wanted<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.309> get<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.610> just

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
pretty shade but I wanted to get it just

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.260 
pretty shade but I wanted to get it just
because<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.390> magnetic<00:00:52.320> effect<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.550> how

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
because of the magnetic effect so how

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.590 
because of the magnetic effect so how
this<00:00:54.510> nail<00:00:54.750> polish<00:00:54.899> works<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.600> apply

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
this nail polish works is that you apply

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.229 
this nail polish works is that you apply
it<00:00:57.629> wet<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.399> base<00:00:59.670> coat<00:01:00.000> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
it wet so you can do one base coat and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.970 
it wet so you can do one base coat and
then<00:01:00.359> apply<00:01:00.690> another<00:01:00.930> coat<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.590> then

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
then apply another coat on and then

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.369 
then apply another coat on and then
while<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.399> still<00:01:02.640> wet<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.449> hold<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
while it's still wet you hold the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.920 
while it's still wet you hold the
magnetic<00:01:05.159> cap<00:01:05.460> over<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.750> there's

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
magnetic cap over it and then so there's

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.789 
magnetic cap over it and then so there's
like<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.140> little<00:01:07.340> ridged<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.760> ridge<00:01:09.470> like<00:01:10.470> guard

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
like a little ridged of ridge like guard

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.950 
like a little ridged of ridge like guard
for<00:01:11.100> your<00:01:11.220> cuticle<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.270> line<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:12.720> like

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
for your cuticle and you line it up like

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.840 
for your cuticle and you line it up like
that<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.470> then<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.890> hover<00:01:14.130> over<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:14.610> nail

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
that and then you hover over your nail

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.320 
that and then you hover over your nail
for<00:01:15.150> about<00:01:15.360> 15<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.229> 20<00:01:16.439> seconds<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.400> then<00:01:18.030> you

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
for about 15 to 20 seconds and then you

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.899 
for about 15 to 20 seconds and then you
lift<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.259> off<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.770> then<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.189> top<00:01:20.520> coat<00:01:20.759> it

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
lift it off and then you can top coat it

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.090 
lift it off and then you can top coat it
and<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.180> reveals<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.930> magnetic<00:01:22.439> effect<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
and it reveals the magnetic effect and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.910 
and it reveals the magnetic effect and
so<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> was<00:01:24.180> able<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.479> swatch<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.110> my<00:01:25.259> nails<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
so I was able to swatch it on my nails a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.969 
so I was able to swatch it on my nails a
couple<00:01:26.759> times<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.170> did<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.470> over<00:01:28.650> here

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
couple times and so I did it over here

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.950 
couple times and so I did it over here
and<00:01:29.130> over<00:01:29.220> here<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.540> that's<00:01:30.689> how<00:01:30.780> it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and over here and so that's how it

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.510 
and over here and so that's how it
turned<00:01:31.229> out<00:01:31.409> i'm<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:31.860> happy<00:01:32.040> with<00:01:32.250> how<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
turned out i'm really happy with how it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.429 
turned out i'm really happy with how it
turned<00:01:32.549> out<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.970> looked<00:01:33.150> exactly<00:01:33.270> like<00:01:33.689> how<00:01:34.409> i

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
turned out it looked exactly like how i

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.319 
turned out it looked exactly like how i
saw<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.040> these<00:01:35.189> swatches<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
saw in these swatches and in the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.700 
saw in these swatches and in the
pictures<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.710> came<00:01:38.520> away<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:40.110> does<00:01:40.470> turn

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
pictures that came away so it does turn

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.889 
pictures that came away so it does turn
out<00:01:40.829> really<00:01:41.070> well<00:01:41.369> i<00:01:41.880> didn't<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.750> any

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
out really well i didn't have any

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.649 
out really well i didn't have any
problems<00:01:43.110> with<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.070> magnet<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.210> have

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
problems with the magnet you just have

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.300 
problems with the magnet you just have
to<00:01:45.689> make<00:01:45.930> sure<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.439> doesn't<00:01:46.619> go<00:01:47.250> too

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
to make sure that it doesn't go too

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.490 
to make sure that it doesn't go too
close<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.240> magnet<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.930> sticks<00:01:49.320> to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
close to the magnet so that it sticks to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.120 
close to the magnet so that it sticks to
it<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.299> really<00:01:51.509> lift<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.320> sort<00:01:53.009> of

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
it it can like really lift and sort of

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.399 
it it can like really lift and sort of
pull<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.329> be<00:01:54.360> careful<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.049> that

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
pull so you have to be careful so that

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.289 
pull so you have to be careful so that
the<00:01:55.649> nail<00:01:55.799> polish<00:01:56.130> doesn't<00:01:56.399> really<00:01:56.520> stick<00:01:57.090> to

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the nail polish doesn't really stick to

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.520 
the nail polish doesn't really stick to
it<00:01:57.420> because<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.689> think<00:01:57.899> you'll<00:01:58.020> get<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.229> really

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
it because I think you'll get a really

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.480 
it because I think you'll get a really
messy<00:01:59.189> situation<00:02:00.110> this<00:02:01.110> was<00:02:01.439> sixteen<00:02:02.250> dollars

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
messy situation this was sixteen dollars

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
comes in two other shades there's a gold

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.139 
comes in two other shades there's a gold
shade<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.500> purple<00:02:07.799> shade<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.970> don't

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
shade and a purple shade but I don't

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.900 
shade and a purple shade but I don't
believe<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.020> gold<00:02:10.560> shade<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.920> available

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
believe that the gold shade is available

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.190 
believe that the gold shade is available
anymore<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.360> was<00:02:12.480> available<00:02:12.690> on

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
anymore it was available on

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.619 
anymore it was available on
for<00:02:13.379> online<00:02:13.860> for<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> little<00:02:14.610> while<00:02:14.819> but<00:02:15.599> I

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
for online for a little while but I

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.540 
for online for a little while but I
don't<00:02:15.900> think<00:02:16.080> it's<00:02:16.230> available<00:02:16.590> anymore<00:02:17.099> but<00:02:17.519> I

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
don't think it's available anymore but I

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.130 
don't think it's available anymore but I
think<00:02:17.819> maybe<00:02:18.090> if<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.420> search<00:02:18.660> for<00:02:18.690> other

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
think maybe if you search for other

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.740 
think maybe if you search for other
websites<00:02:19.349> they<00:02:20.250> might<00:02:20.430> have<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.760> available<00:02:21.420> if

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
websites they might have it available if

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.630 
websites they might have it available if
you<00:02:21.870> really<00:02:22.050> want<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.290> gold<00:02:22.530> shade<00:02:22.860> so

they're just comes in three shades and

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.009 
they're just comes in three shades and
the<00:02:26.670> only<00:02:26.790> places<00:02:27.060> i<00:02:27.209> know<00:02:27.269> you<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.690> get<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.900> is
