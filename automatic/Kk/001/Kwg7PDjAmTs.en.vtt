00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hi, how are you? I'm here for today. 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.410
 answer a tag I saw on the channel 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.510
 Morpheus júlia the world is not 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.420
 exactly matter julie widows that this 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.940
 blog post I'll leave the links 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.279
 due in the information box but it is a 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.140
 thesis on unforgettable beginnings of 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.140
 book, I think it's cool 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.210
 in her video she cited one of the beginnings 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.090
 of sensational books and literature 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.800
 which is that of kafka is that of metamorphosis is a 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.449
 very famous start and I'll leave the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.450
 video of the year on each camera receive case 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.050
 Do not you know then I chose the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.370
 three books is not what I think is more or 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.530
 minus the number of twilight books 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.540
 also not to get too big 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.879
 The first book I chose is a 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.010
 book because I tried to read 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.649
 The first time I did not like it after 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.550
 tournament and I thought it was a good book 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.440
 with soul than the list of the new koff 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.590
 more lolita has a more start 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.780
 wonderful in the world that is beautiful 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.770
 today my life there most of my 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.900
 beef 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.030
 in soul my llama lytha the tip of the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.729
 September language in three heels by 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:20.640
 mouth to lightly trip over the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:22.920
 against the teeth or another 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.890
 beginning of a book that I really like 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.960
 it goes in against his hand because he has 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.960
 is more irreverent here to the west 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.909
 that is the catcher in the field of 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.170
 rye is with the body still in the field of 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.540
 rye which is a book of the Lord and it is 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.640
 a start think much fun it is to 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.649
 even want to hear what happened 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.700
 The first thing I want to know is 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.560
 where I was born 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.689
 How the hell was my childhood? 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.250
 what my parents did before the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.380
 tram me to be born 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.780
 and all this lenga-lenga copy type 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.740
 field but to tell the truth I'm not going 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.740
 talk about it 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.770
 the next is a wonderful book by lynn 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.550
 was one of my favorite readings from the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.259
 last year that the great sertão 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.590
 from Guimarães rosa 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.980
 so I do not know if it 's okay but the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.980
 great back country has a pretty image 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.760
 that she mixes not only the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.549
 language to regional colloquial language 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.959
 né do sertão but also a lot of poetry 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:32.940
 and he will have the following no shots that 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.540
 Did you hear about a man fight? 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.720
 is not God the tree regime in the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.799
 yard in the bass of the corgo for my hit 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.829
 Everyone already does it. I like it from bad to 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.769
 will want to call me the case of 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:53.069
 Calf a white calf and enjoy the 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.769
 eyes are neither civil and more expensive 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.859
 They told me I did not want to 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.650
 to be even if by default as born 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:05.030
 to revisit those of kisses and it seemed 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.340
 laughing person talks about guys face stayed 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.120
 determine was the same people for the 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.780
 children 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.230
 I do not know who his father is. 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.160
 They came to lend my weapons, not so 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.609
 Good 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.900
 you are right looks when the laughs 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.199
 It's a true shot. 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.449
 first the puppy gets active 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:29.940
 instantly after that you will see 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:31.019
 if in a way you are worth it to the 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.680
 backwoods 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.359
 It's really good, we 're wonderful you 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.690
 just come down here for those who wanted 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.310
 more of this book is amazing 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.530
 Another start I think is 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.150
 The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.250
 I also think it's amazing how 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.560
 Answer a dog but today I go 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.299
 read the other braz's vats and it will be like this 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.359
 would have confessed to having written a 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:00.000
 of your books for 100 voters thing 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:03.299
 is that he admired and dismayed what 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.430
 admire or will probably continue and become 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:09.269
 this other book had not without 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:13.590
 readers of 50 or 20 when 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:17.099
 very tess 1095 deals with whether actually 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.950
 a diffuse work in which I brás vats are 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:22.860
 I adopted the free form of another chargeback 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.039
 remedy other than this limit 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.909
 the grumpy one of pessimism can be work 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.759
 of the deceased 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:32.550
 wrote with the pen of the gallant and the ink 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:36.449
 melancholy and it is difficult to foresee what 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.849
 this group can leave the nursery that 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.409
 Record and sign a book 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.409
 lady in the book but the appearances of 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:46.650
 curves while frivolous people 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:49.229
 there is no romance in it, and there it is 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.599
 be deprived of the esteem of the serious 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.900
 love of the frevos that are the two columns 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:59.279
 maximum ax opinion as always 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:02.939
 great and poking right 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:04.080
 the reader is too good the book itself 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:06.810
 It's also a wonderful book. 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.810
 of the most important book of the 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.779
 my life, which is heaven becoming the 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.520
 gabriel garcía marquez and I think it is 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:17.699
 a very beautiful beginning in which it is 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.789
 many years later before the 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:23.610
 firing the Aurelian colonel on time 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.860
 he had to remember that remote afternoon 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.789
 between his father and took him to 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.490
 macondo ice is then in the village of 20 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.289
 mud houses built for the ita 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.509
 margin of a river of tributaries 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:39.389
 which rushed down a bed of 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:42.539
 polished white stones and huge as 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.699
 prehistoric eggs the world was so 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.729
 recently that many things seemed to 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:52.740
 name and to mention if you needed 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:57.330
 have a good car from daniel too 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.490
 and finally a sensational book is also 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.800
 a very important book, right? 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:06.210
 world literature that is xote 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:09.210
 Cervantes also has a beginning very 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.990
 I actually knew to consider 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:16.409
 as I am convinced the prologue is not because he 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.629
 have he got 16 had box start 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:22.490
 privilege rats witnesses 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:26.099
 dedication and then he begins 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:28.529
 Unoccupied reader need not lend 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:30.479
 here an oath for you to fall that with 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:33.539
 all my will and you want this 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:36.100
 book with the son of understanding was 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:39.160
 the most beautiful the most detailed 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.650
 discreet one could imagine though 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.980
 It was not in my hand against coming to 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:48.880
 order of nature in which each thing 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:51.910
 generates the other that it is similar to 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.520
 could therefore be the evil stereo device 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:57.240
 grown produce in this world but to 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.070
 story of a skinny son I was begged 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:04.450
 capricious filled with various thoughts and 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:06.310
 never imagined from someone else 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.810
 good, this is the way I hope you have 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.080
 liked 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:13.540
 I do not go back to guide anyone else 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.300
 Do you want to answer, answer it? It's okay. 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.730
 is and will measure these niches in the 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.330
 Sensational Kiss 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.330
 to the next
