doctor<00:00:21.090> version<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.779> see<00:00:21.990> some<00:00:22.230> of

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
doctor version so you can see some of

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.590 
doctor version so you can see some of
the<00:00:22.380> characteristics<00:00:22.769> first<00:00:23.760> off<00:00:24.000> its<00:00:24.210> design

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
the characteristics first off its design

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.450 
the characteristics first off its design
of<00:00:24.840> an<00:00:24.960> engineered<00:00:25.439> thermal<00:00:25.890> poly<00:00:26.130> resin

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
of an engineered thermal poly resin

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.490 
of an engineered thermal poly resin
which<00:00:27.029> makes<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.390> extremely<00:00:27.630> lightweight<00:00:28.109> it

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
which makes it extremely lightweight it

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.410 
which makes it extremely lightweight it
is<00:00:28.650> form-fitting<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> head<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.179> it's<00:00:30.300> very

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
is form-fitting to the head so it's very

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.139 
is form-fitting to the head so it's very
comfortable<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.109> very<00:00:31.769> lightweight<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.059> you

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
comfortable and very lightweight so you

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.150 
comfortable and very lightweight so you
can<00:00:33.300> ride<00:00:33.510> longer<00:00:33.750> distances<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.500> not<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.130> a
