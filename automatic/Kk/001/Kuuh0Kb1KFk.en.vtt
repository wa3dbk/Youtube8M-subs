00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.490 

this<00:00:00.179> is<00:00:00.299> my<00:00:01.520> 2011<00:00:02.720> WR<00:00:03.720> 450<00:00:06.319> supermoto

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
this is my 2011 WR 450 supermoto

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:18.980 
this is my 2011 WR 450 supermoto
I<00:00:13.670> bought<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.880> with<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:17.369> guys<00:00:18.150> said<00:00:18.390> 500<00:00:18.869> miles

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
I bought it with the guys said 500 miles

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.820 
I bought it with the guys said 500 miles
on<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.289> he<00:00:20.220> didn't<00:00:20.490> uh<00:00:21.260> the<00:00:22.260> speedo<00:00:22.529> wasn't

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
on it he didn't uh the speedo wasn't

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.500 
on it he didn't uh the speedo wasn't
working<00:00:23.130> when<00:00:23.430> we<00:00:23.490> got<00:00:23.640> there<00:00:23.760> zero<00:00:24.210> because<00:00:24.420> I

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
working when we got there zero because I

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.670 
working when we got there zero because I
because<00:00:24.840> he<00:00:24.930> swapped<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.260> wheels<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.619> I

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
because he swapped the wheels and I

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.150 
because he swapped the wheels and I
guess<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.189> reset<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:26.820> some<00:00:26.970> reason<00:00:28.070> but<00:00:29.070> right

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
guess it reset for some reason but right

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.130 
guess it reset for some reason but right
now<00:00:29.310> I've<00:00:29.519> got<00:00:31.550> 1792<00:00:32.550> right<00:00:33.270> now<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.989> have<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
now I've got 1792 right now and I have a

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.690 
now I've got 1792 right now and I have a
little<00:00:34.320> more<00:00:34.559> because<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.250> didn't<00:00:35.520> have<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
little more because I didn't have the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.920 
little more because I didn't have the
trophy<00:00:35.850> icon<00:00:36.149> when<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.300> got<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.840> was

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
trophy icon when I got it and I was

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.420 
trophy icon when I got it and I was
still<00:00:37.050> riding<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> street<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.890> probably

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
still riding on the street I probably

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.010 
still riding on the street I probably
put<00:00:38.670> about<00:00:38.760> 3<00:00:39.090> or<00:00:39.120> 400<00:00:39.480> miles<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.870> so

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
put about 3 or 400 miles on it so

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.740 
put about 3 or 400 miles on it so
there's<00:00:40.379> probably<00:00:40.559> 2,100<00:00:41.489> well<00:00:42.239> plus<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.600> guess

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
there's probably 2,100 well plus I guess

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.020

the<00:01:40.950> trail<00:01:41.220> tech<00:01:44.960> don't<00:01:45.960> think<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.259> did

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
the trail tech don't think I did

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.520 
the trail tech don't think I did
anything<00:01:46.979> else<00:01:50.689> but<00:01:51.689> when<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.020> got<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> guy

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
anything else but when I got it the guy

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.230 
anything else but when I got it the guy
already<00:01:52.799> got<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.549> full<00:01:54.060> throttle<00:01:56.000> mod<00:01:57.000> or

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
already got the full throttle mod or

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.450 
already got the full throttle mod or
whatever<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.780> aftermarket<00:01:58.380> full<00:01:59.040> throttle

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
whatever the aftermarket full throttle

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.830 
whatever the aftermarket full throttle
so<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.909> actually<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.240> full<00:02:00.420> talk<00:02:00.600> because

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
so it can actually go full talk because

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.929 
so it can actually go full talk because
it's<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.130> quarter<00:02:02.130> thought<00:02:02.369> over<00:02:02.610> regular

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
it's like quarter thought over regular

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.370 
it's like quarter thought over regular
or<00:02:03.060> something<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.540> don't<00:02:03.840> know<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.049> didn't

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
and then my turn signal stuff but if I

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.079 
and then my turn signal stuff but if I
move<00:05:25.979> all<00:05:26.099> this<00:05:26.219> my<00:05:26.429> meter<00:05:26.669> can<00:05:26.879> actually

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:27.089 
move all this my meter can actually

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:28.489 
move all this my meter can actually
scoot<00:05:27.270> over<00:05:27.360> more<00:05:27.659> if<00:05:27.899> I<00:05:27.990> need<00:05:28.169> to<00:05:28.229> do<00:05:28.349> that

00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:28.499 
scoot over more if I need to do that

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:32.209 
scoot over more if I need to do that
right<00:05:28.709> now<00:05:29.189> it's<00:05:29.580> really<00:05:29.729> working<00:05:29.969> fine<00:05:31.219> but

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 
right now it's really working fine but

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:33.649 
right now it's really working fine but
I'd<00:05:32.399> like<00:05:32.580> to<00:05:32.669> get<00:05:32.729> rid<00:05:32.849> of<00:05:32.909> this<00:05:33.029> and<00:05:33.270> then<00:05:33.479> tie

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
I'd like to get rid of this and then tie

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.649 
I'd like to get rid of this and then tie
the<00:05:33.719> on/off<00:05:34.319> into<00:05:34.889> the<00:05:35.129> the<00:05:35.669> key<00:05:35.909> switch<00:05:36.119> but

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
the on/off into the the key switch but

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:41.029 
the on/off into the the key switch but
I'm<00:05:36.959> not<00:05:37.529> very<00:05:37.610> electrical<00:05:38.610> savvy<00:05:39.949> enough<00:05:40.949> to

they're not D flux don't they turn

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:56.989 
they're not D flux don't they turn
signals<00:05:56.069> inside<00:05:56.369> there<00:05:56.550> those<00:05:56.729> are<00:05:56.819> pretty
