a slum today in the installation the
viewer<00:01:12.540> basically<00:01:13.580> walked<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.930> to<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.950> living

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
viewer basically walked in to the living

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.970 
viewer basically walked in to the living
room<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.870> families<00:01:18.870> living<00:01:19.050> in<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.260> slums<00:01:19.500> so

room of families living in the slums so

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.690 
room of families living in the slums so
you<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.250> essentially<00:01:21.240> four<00:01:21.330> photograph

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
you have essentially four photograph

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.600 
you have essentially four photograph
surrounding<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:23.850> 90<00:01:24.270> degree<00:01:24.480> angles<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.410> a

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
surrounding your 90 degree angles it's a

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:34.070 
surrounding your 90 degree angles it's a
reconstructing<00:01:26.610> people's<00:01:27.060> rooms<00:01:32.930> because<00:01:33.930> I

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
was photographing these interiors to had

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.340 
was photographing these interiors to had
to<00:01:36.930> encapsulate<00:01:37.800> all<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.580> details<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.510> in

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
it on medium format film and there was

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.950 
it on medium format film and there was
one<00:01:45.000> day<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:46.560> ran<00:01:47.040> out<00:01:47.190> of<00:01:47.220> film<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.870> took

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
one day I I ran out of film so I I took

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.170 
one day I I ran out of film so I I took
the<00:01:49.230> 5d<00:01:49.620> because<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.580> sort<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.910> spare

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
the 5d because I have sort of spare

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.990 
the 5d because I have sort of spare
camera<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.280> took<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.400> same<00:01:53.580> picture<00:01:53.880> with

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
camera and took the same picture with

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.970 
camera and took the same picture with
that<00:01:54.030> thing<00:01:54.510> other<00:01:54.810> sort<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.200> an<00:01:55.290> emergency

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
that thing other sort of an emergency

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.280 
that thing other sort of an emergency
solution<00:01:56.550> and<00:01:56.910> when<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> compared<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
solution and when I compared that the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.600 
solution and when I compared that the
two<00:01:58.470> pictures<00:01:58.650> afterwards<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.370> medium

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
two pictures afterwards the medium

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.650 
two pictures afterwards the medium
format<00:01:59.900> picture<00:02:00.900> and<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.340> 5d<00:02:02.730> I<00:02:03.030> realized

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
format picture and and the 5d I realized

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.810 
format picture and and the 5d I realized
it<00:02:04.050> was<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.290> 5d<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:05.010> was<00:02:05.190> sharper<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.790> more

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
it was the 5d that was sharper and more

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.599 
it was the 5d that was sharper and more
detailed<00:02:06.630> than<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> medium<00:02:07.200> format

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
detailed than the medium format

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.800 
detailed than the medium format
