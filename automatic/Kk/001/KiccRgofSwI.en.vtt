have noticed that there's a little

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:59.149 
have noticed that there's a little
receptacle<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.350> wiring<00:01:58.350> harness<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
receptacle in the wiring harness of the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.249 
receptacle in the wiring harness of the
mini<00:01:59.549> g<00:01:59.729> well<00:02:00.299> that's<00:02:00.450> simply<00:02:00.780> right<00:02:01.049> here

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
mini g well that's simply right here

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.169 
mini g well that's simply right here
this<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.649> pin<00:02:01.829> goes<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.250> there<00:02:02.369> for<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.670> you

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
this the pin goes in there for that you

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.209 
this the pin goes in there for that you
plug<00:02:03.359> it<00:02:03.539> in<00:02:03.630> your<00:02:03.810> typical<00:02:04.079> GV<00:02:04.469> port<00:02:04.829> right

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
plug it in your typical GV port right

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.099 
plug it in your typical GV port right
here<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.939> then<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.450> actually<00:02:06.659> use<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
here and then you can actually use the

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.080 
here and then you can actually use the
buttons<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.710> set<00:02:07.979> up<00:02:08.100> your<00:02:08.220> mini<00:02:08.400> g<00:02:08.640> gyro

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
buttons and set up your mini g gyro

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.900 
buttons and set up your mini g gyro
using<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.690> TV<00:02:09.870> to<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.860> unit<00:02:11.130> also<00:02:11.280> works<00:02:11.670> with

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
using the TV to the unit also works with

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.340 
using the TV to the unit also works with
the<00:02:12.060> atg<00:02:12.600> and

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
the atg and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.830 
the atg and
ecology<00:02:13.800> just<00:02:14.460> like<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.610> regular<00:02:14.910> GV<00:02:15.390> would<00:02:15.630> and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
ecology just like a regular GV would and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.620 
ecology just like a regular GV would and
the<00:02:16.470> only<00:02:16.610> drawback<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:18.120> there's<00:02:18.360> no<00:02:18.450> place

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
the only drawback is is there's no place

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.390 
the only drawback is is there's no place
for<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.900> pin<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.620> therefore<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:20.100> make<00:02:20.250> all

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
for the pin so therefore you make all

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.430 
for the pin so therefore you make all
your<00:02:20.550> adjustments<00:02:20.670> on<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.270> solid<00:02:22.110> G<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.350> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
your adjustments on the solid G of the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.650 
your adjustments on the solid G of the
atg<00:02:22.830> itself<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.670> buttons<00:02:23.970> will<00:02:24.180> not<00:02:24.330> work<00:02:24.510> in

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
atg itself the buttons will not work in

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.520 
atg itself the buttons will not work in
that<00:02:24.750> configuration<00:02:26.780> ok<00:02:27.780> we're<00:02:28.380> going<00:02:28.470> to

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
that configuration ok we're going to

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.900 
that configuration ok we're going to
show<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:28.770> here<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.130> next<00:02:29.340> thing<00:02:29.520> how<00:02:29.850> to
