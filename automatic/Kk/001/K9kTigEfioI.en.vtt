 neighbors 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.320
 television channels do however have populations that feel

 marginalized 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:33.710

 financed almost entirely with municipal funds 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.860
 with a clear objective 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.600
 there is room for the stigma that has gaps the very bad window given by the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.250
 rebels in open 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.300
 and therefore the need to have few means of communication through 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.840
 that the positive things that this territory happens 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.720
 It is essential that the coverage is reached with luck to the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.450
 televisions 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.780

 Documentary interviews and concerts are part of its programming 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.960
 also its press department reaches all corners of the commune 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.880
 its driver 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.200
 has become a face of the sale 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.600
 the scenographer for accompanying them in a new addition to their newscast 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.940
 local ordered recognize when it will aggravate to that tenuous mood ventose 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.190

 reposera sobre important of the season 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.180
 a municipal channel that has not had legal problems due to the use of 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.570
 the fair 39 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.160
 since 2000 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.460
 the concessions that if the electricity were frozen waiting for the 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.690
 digital television 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.450
 in the middle of this scenario 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.630
 new rival channels also emerge in chile there are 112 television channels 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.230
 I know that they are broadcast for days at signals 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.629
 six of them are municipal, however there is also a number 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.760
 indeterminate of channels that are community the most emblematic the 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.760
 Channel 3 of victory 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.969
 come here in the early 90's comes the concept of community channel today not 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:36.439
 they only have extensive programming but also advice to others 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.599
 populations of the country in which they intend to install an antenna 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.469
 community 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.040
 they even make their own commercials 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.359
 its main source 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.359
 financing 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:53.039
 refers to the sanitary part 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.039
 as it will advance at the second hour 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.139
 both the one place pact 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.109
 amazing 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.109
 56 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:18.459
 its signal reaches about 300 thousand homes in five communes of the southern sector of the 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.989
 capital 150 officials are up to a podium minutes and work with 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.969
 professionalism without charging a single peso 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:29.619
 for that reason they want to be prepared with the irruption of the new television 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:32.850
 it was the time of frost legislation 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.100
 of digital television and I think we have what in it a space 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.189
 within what digital television is 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.319
 3 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.399
 as they did seven years ago throughout the country 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:49.689
 the population the league also succumbed to the charms of the crisis 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.069
 put in front to the cuasa the morning will be given already work said 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.709
 there is no fair, I am very happy to be a part of being able to help the 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.639
 education of people to information from people 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:01.859
 I want to rescue 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.379
 certainly the culture in the local 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.269
 a local culture perpetuated by the resignation carried out in neighborhoods and 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.019
 communes 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.370
 a television that avoids focusing on our own identity
