00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
gives you some advice on it start going

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.949 
gives you some advice on it start going
out<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.190> road<00:02:02.220> most<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.940> us<00:02:03.030> have<00:02:03.090> used

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
out on the road most of us have used

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.510 
out on the road most of us have used
bikes<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.500> where<00:02:04.619> kids<00:02:04.890> are<00:02:05.039> all<00:02:05.190> pretty

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
bikes and where kids are all pretty

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.940 
bikes and where kids are all pretty
happy<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.209> on<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.390> bike<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.560> using

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
happy to be on a bike and then using

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.979 
happy to be on a bike and then using
that<00:02:07.979> transition<00:02:08.670> between<00:02:08.910> bike<00:02:09.269> and<00:02:09.600> running

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
that transition between bike and running

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.080 
that transition between bike and running
so<00:02:10.470> what<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.769> maybe<00:02:10.979> do<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.370> go<00:02:11.549> for<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.850> bike

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
so what you maybe do is go for a bike

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.449 
so what you maybe do is go for a bike
ride<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.690> 20<00:02:13.049> minutes<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.590> then<00:02:14.069> drop<00:02:14.340> the

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
ride for 20 minutes and then drop the

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.340 
ride for 20 minutes and then drop the
bike<00:02:14.640> at<00:02:14.880> home<00:02:15.090> or<00:02:15.360> again<00:02:15.630> if<00:02:15.750> you're<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:16.019> a<00:02:16.110> gym

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
bike at home or again if you're in a gym

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.830 
bike at home or again if you're in a gym
you<00:02:16.500> can<00:02:16.560> use<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.010> bike<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:18.030> recliner<00:02:18.480> bikes

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
you can use the bike the recliner bikes

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.289 
you can use the bike the recliner bikes
or<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.410> upright<00:02:19.830> bikes<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.790> gym<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.150> do

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
or the upright bikes in the gym and do

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.320 
or the upright bikes in the gym and do
five<00:02:21.630> or<00:02:21.840> ten<00:02:22.080> minutes<00:02:22.110> have<00:02:22.890> really<00:02:23.819> hard<00:02:24.090> out

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
five or ten minutes have really hard out

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.300 
five or ten minutes have really hard out
cycling<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.200> then<00:02:25.470> straight<00:02:25.890> onto<00:02:26.099> a

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
cycling and then straight onto a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.400 
cycling and then straight onto a
treadmill<00:02:26.880> from<00:02:27.420> running<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:27.989> then<00:02:28.110> keep

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
treadmill from running and then keep

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.470 
treadmill from running and then keep
repeating<00:02:29.099> those<00:02:29.280> sequences<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.150> get<00:02:30.390> an

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
repeating those sequences so you get an

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.650 
repeating those sequences so you get an
idea<00:02:30.599> of<00:02:31.080> how<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.590> go<00:02:31.859> from<00:02:32.070> bike<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.790> running

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
idea of how to go from bike and running
