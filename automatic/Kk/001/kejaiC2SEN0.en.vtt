five more minutes let the water cooled
down<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.540> little<00:03:24.750> bit<00:03:24.990> before<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.500> add<00:03:25.740> it<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.010> the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
down a little bit before I add it to the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.690 
down a little bit before I add it to the
glass<00:03:26.540> because<00:03:27.540> since<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.170> glass<00:03:28.560> if<00:03:29.460> you

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
glass because since this is glass if you

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.820 
glass because since this is glass if you
put<00:03:30.030> ice<00:03:30.209> in<00:03:30.240> it<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.810> put<00:03:31.170> some<00:03:31.410> hot<00:03:31.620> water

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
put ice in it and you put some hot water

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.810 
put ice in it and you put some hot water
in<00:03:32.070> it<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.370> will<00:03:32.550> crack<00:03:32.880> so<00:03:33.600> don't<00:03:33.870> do<00:03:34.050> that<00:03:34.820> let

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
in it it will crack so don't do that let

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.210 
in it it will crack so don't do that let
the<00:03:35.970> water<00:03:36.180> find<00:03:36.540> its<00:03:36.750> medium<00:03:37.470> temperature<00:03:37.800> in

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
the water find its medium temperature in

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.820 
the water find its medium temperature in
the<00:03:38.580> pan<00:03:38.820> okay<00:03:39.420> I'm<00:03:39.570> just<00:03:39.630> taking<00:03:40.140> my<00:03:40.170> tea<00:03:40.320> back

the pan okay I'm just taking my tea back
out<00:03:41.130> now<00:03:47.540> as<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:48.750> can<00:03:48.870> see<00:03:48.930> that<00:03:49.560> be<00:03:49.680> able<00:03:49.890> to

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
out now as you can see that be able to

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.190 
out now as you can see that be able to
use<00:03:50.190> have<00:03:50.370> expanded<00:03:51.030> very<00:03:51.240> nicely<00:03:51.660> they're

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
use have expanded very nicely they're

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.510 
use have expanded very nicely they're
going<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.410> be<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.590> really<00:03:52.950> good<00:03:53.190> jelly

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
going to be a really good jelly

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.150 
going to be a really good jelly
consistency<00:03:54.390> now<00:03:54.830> something<00:03:55.830> similar<00:03:56.130> to

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
consistency now something similar to

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.840 
consistency now something similar to
tapioca<00:03:57.740> what<00:03:58.740> I'm<00:03:58.800> going<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:58.980> do<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.580> just

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
tapioca what I'm going to do is just
