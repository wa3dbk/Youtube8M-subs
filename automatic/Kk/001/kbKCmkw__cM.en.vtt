00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.480
 hello good friends in this tutorial os 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.760
 I bring something special and I bring it because 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.770
 in fishing they are not only rigging 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.630
 techniques and so on there's also 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.400
 resolve situations that may appear 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.410
 at times when you have to 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.100
 improvise for example I want you to see 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.330
 in this video I want to show how 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.640
 you have to make a repair 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.940
 quick but that is effective and that to the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.699
 long 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.350
 serves and works in the same way as a 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.790
 windbreaker on a stormy night in 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.920
 which for example as they serve us more 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.330
 far away he told me the other afternoon and that is that I 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.860
 I have my raincoat like you 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.300
 I suppose you'll have it on portals and 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.190
 it's designed, you should take it 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.789
 Y 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.250
 Well, I was lucky I did not break it 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.469
 in moments, as you already know, I like it 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.940
 fish and leave the car quite far 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.289
 from where that what is here because the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.089
 true that cliff sites are 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.800
 I have to walk a lot because 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.269
 many others can think 16 m breaks the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.890
 zipper I just take pigs I'll 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.330
 home but I think you have to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.950
 improvise you have to do something more than 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.090
 give up going home I think we are 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.490
 fishermen and they turn us into 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.750
 fishermen also the fact that 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.270
 we can improvise and adapt to the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.850
 good situation in what it consists is 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.170
 that we have all the zipper is 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.690
 intact as you can see the new 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.350
 direction is simply when I went 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.750
 to take me out to let off my raincoat 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.940
 I kept the zipper in my hand and 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.130
 one of the things that I always say and 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.259
 in this case it shows that I always 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.600
 I carry in my fishing backpack always 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.700
 I'm wearing a toe because I know 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.850
 they broke a toe and also always 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.040
 I take occasional carriage guide 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.409
 zipper in this case to repair my 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.140
 good rain jacket if you have on 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.190
 rain jacket yes and you tell the what 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.619
 I would consent to have it fixed 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.210
 they will surely change you all the 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.680
 zipper and it will cost between 15 and 20 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.720
 euros but there is a faster way to 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.310
 repair it and you can do it and especially 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.560
 if it happens in the fishing only 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.440
 you need a can of glue or if not 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.409
 you have it then you only need and this 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.420
 your is easy 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.209
 the fleeting one that does not have this part 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.000
 end as you know two bumps one 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.830
 square that is east here and one straight 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.269
 which is how these two when joining with the 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.760
 Center zipper makes the 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.870
 Zipper is zipped 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.660
 agreement then he has to take the one that is 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.959
 in the louis box up and 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.239
 up you have another top you see another 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.290
 butt with the end of the is good by 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.799
 what I had to do is take a 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.860
 scissors and in and between the last stop and the 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.200
 first tooth you have to make a bite 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.930
 You see, you make a cut just like 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.879
 do read a cut how to fix 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.379
 it stays stays separate you see it stays 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.099
 it seems broken is apparently broken 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:52.500
 well then this you take the guide 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.840
 of the car and you put it up that 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.069
 that is how you would raise it and here 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.920
 you have to be a little crafty and you manage 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.100
 make me come in to see there is what you see and 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.900
 has entered 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.909
 you go down check 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.549
 and I always buy one or two that what 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.689
 unique Chinese for standard mode and has 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.400
 come to the end has come up 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.750
 the end of the zipper for 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.280
 make sure that it closes and that this does not 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.750
 it's no nonsense what I'm 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.510
 saying that it is not a lie nor 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.400
 nothing you catch from the other end or it will cost 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.049
 enter because of course it is not the original 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.990
 has to cost the trains already entered 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.530
 you see and now 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.750
 one climb up so dust make 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.570
 set up goes up that prevents this 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.790
 this prevents you from going or 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.550
 I say there's more between picking 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.770
 reeds and I go to the car I put water 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.620
 you do not have because you hurt just have to 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.170
 improvise improvise is a little bit 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.280
 notice that it was not broken there was no 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.610
 knee 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.110
 everything is complete here, you could 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.720
 keep fishing without needing to 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.240
 go home, yes, if you go up 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.340
 completely if you raise the car up 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.870
 all salt you have the car and return to 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.880
 spend the same thing just reopen everything 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.750
 that so in a moment you take over 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.580
 the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.380
 You can do this at home if you 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.110
 remember where you do not have to go up 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.130
 more of this part of here but you can 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.350
 make a traveler together and fix you get together 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:24.950
 those of the top 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:28.080
 and you drop some droplets in the place 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.009
 appropriate you see 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.059
 Spin 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.059
 do not lose around here 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:41.000
 and now, as always, you are waiting for 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.230
 to dry out that this is usually not 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.510
 the truth I mean many girls what 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.130
 better it takes a minute to get married and 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.170
 you have the rack repaired post 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.580
 in your cowboy and you can continue to leave 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.930
 that I think that is what we 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.270
 turns into fishermen does not understand 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.770
 we improvise and we do not give up but we 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.350
 have liked the video if you liked it and 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.370
 Above all, I hope with the help of Alaix 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:04.720
