00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:28.399 
actually not a simple this is just a

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.350 
actually not a simple this is just a
family<00:00:28.700> phone<00:00:28.910> it<00:00:29.779> doesn't<00:00:30.110> work<00:00:30.290> on<00:00:30.649> it<00:00:31.489> of

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
released the iphone 5 day but i think

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.650 
released the iphone 5 day but i think
this<00:00:37.460> is<00:00:37.640> this<00:00:37.940> is<00:00:38.059> what<00:00:38.210> we<00:00:38.300> use<00:00:38.329> as<00:00:38.630> a

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
this is this is what we use as a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.169 
this is this is what we use as a
prototype<00:00:38.960> to<00:00:39.500> cast<00:00:39.739> out<00:00:39.920> our<00:00:40.070> cases<00:00:40.550> it's

00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:41.179 
prototype to cast out our cases it's

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:43.240 
prototype to cast out our cases it's
made<00:00:41.420> to<00:00:41.449> be<00:00:41.719> the<00:00:41.989> same<00:00:42.170> dimension<00:00:42.739> as<00:00:42.859> what<00:00:43.100> we

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
made to be the same dimension as what we

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.860 
made to be the same dimension as what we
think<00:00:43.519> the<00:00:43.670> new<00:00:43.789> iphone<00:00:44.120> 5<00:00:44.329> is<00:00:44.510> going<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.750> be

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
think the new iphone 5 is going to be

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.200 
think the new iphone 5 is going to be
the<00:00:45.079> same<00:00:45.260> thickness<00:00:45.559> with<00:00:46.399> all<00:00:46.789> the

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
the same thickness with all the

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.060 
the same thickness with all the
dimensions<00:00:47.480> in<00:00:48.079> everything<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:50.710> on<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.890> new

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
dimensions in everything so on the new

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.610 
dimensions in everything so on the new
iphone<00:00:52.789> 5<00:00:53.030> it's<00:00:53.629> definitely<00:00:54.109> noticeably

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
iphone 5 it's definitely noticeably

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.369 
iphone 5 it's definitely noticeably
thinner<00:00:55.280> than<00:00:55.550> iphone<00:00:55.760> 4<00:00:56.300> just<00:00:57.199> for

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
thinner than iphone 4 just for
