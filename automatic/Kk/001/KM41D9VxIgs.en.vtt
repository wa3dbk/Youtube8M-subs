00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.710 
same vitalia bram but we really didn't
like<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.610> was<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> little<00:01:41.939> too<00:01:42.090> tangy<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.630> I

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
like it it was a little too tangy but I

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.120 
like it it was a little too tangy but I
thought<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.110> might<00:01:43.140> be<00:01:43.350> great<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.890> pork

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
thought it might be great for the pork

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.560 
thought it might be great for the pork
chops<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.460> they<00:01:44.579> smell<00:01:44.880> really<00:01:44.909> good<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.509> I'm

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
chops and they smell really good so I'm

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.020 
chops and they smell really good so I'm
hoping<00:01:45.869> they<00:01:46.020> taste<00:01:46.290> really<00:01:46.500> good<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:47.820> green

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
hoping they taste really good the green

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.109 
hoping they taste really good the green
beans<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.600> mushrooms<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.970> thought

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
beans and mushrooms and I just thought

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.090 
beans and mushrooms and I just thought

cast<00:03:17.220> iron<00:03:17.459> skillet<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:18.570> just<00:03:19.170> put<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.440> on<00:03:19.530> the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
cast iron skillet and just put it on the

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.050 
cast iron skillet and just put it on the
grill<00:03:19.709> because<00:03:20.130> it's<00:03:20.430> easier<00:03:20.730> when<00:03:20.910> we're

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060

haul and we kind of just made up around

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.640 
haul and we kind of just made up around
marinade<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.330> almost<00:03:42.510> always<00:03:42.810> put<00:03:43.230> Old<00:03:43.410> Bay

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
marinade I almost always put Old Bay

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.540 
marinade I almost always put Old Bay
seasoning<00:03:43.680> on<00:03:45.470> fish<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.830> we<00:03:47.010> buy<00:03:47.190> that

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
seasoning on fish that we buy that

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.220 
seasoning on fish that we buy that
doesn't<00:03:47.880> have<00:03:48.060> already<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:48.870> it's<00:03:48.959> not<00:03:49.200> very

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
doesn't have already and it's not very

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.610 
doesn't have already and it's not very
seasoned<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:51.000> then<00:03:51.209> I<00:03:51.239> decided<00:03:51.810> because

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
seasoned and then I decided because

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.440 
seasoned and then I decided because
sometimes<00:03:53.100> that<00:03:53.250> just<00:03:53.280> makes<00:03:53.610> a<00:03:53.730> crust<00:03:54.150> on<00:03:54.390> it

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
sometimes that just makes a crust on it

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.380 
sometimes that just makes a crust on it
it<00:03:54.780> doesn't<00:03:54.959> keep<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:56.430> know<00:03:56.459> like<00:03:56.790> moist

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
it doesn't keep it you know like moist

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.540 
it doesn't keep it you know like moist
enough<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.320> went<00:03:58.680> ahead<00:03:58.800> and<00:03:58.950> put<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.280> little

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
enough so I went ahead and put a little

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.960 
enough so I went ahead and put a little
bit<00:03:59.910> of<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:01.130> creamy<00:04:02.130> vinaigrette<00:04:02.730> salad

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
dressing that I show I don't know it

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.190 
dressing that I show I don't know it
smelled<00:04:05.489> basically<00:04:06.209> like<00:04:06.390> old<00:04:06.660> bay<00:04:06.870> but<00:04:07.110> I'm
