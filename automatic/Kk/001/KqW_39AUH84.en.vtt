you<00:04:00.140> want<00:04:00.320> to<00:04:00.380> think<00:04:00.530> about<00:04:00.620> what<00:04:00.980> complete

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
you want to think about what complete

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.490 
you want to think about what complete
boys<00:04:01.670> engaged<00:04:02.210> as<00:04:02.570> well<00:04:02.600> as<00:04:02.870> what<00:04:03.050> keeps<00:04:03.380> the

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
boys engaged as well as what keeps the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.590 
boys engaged as well as what keeps the
girls<00:04:03.650> engaged<00:04:04.150> because<00:04:05.150> that<00:04:05.300> might<00:04:05.450> be

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
girls engaged because that might be

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.910 
girls engaged because that might be
slightly<00:04:05.810> different<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:06.350> as<00:04:06.530> I<00:04:06.590> mentioned

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
slightly different so as I mentioned

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.040 
slightly different so as I mentioned
earlier<00:04:07.310> we<00:04:07.550> have<00:04:07.580> superheroes<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:08.720> walkers

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
earlier we have superheroes and walkers

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.840 
earlier we have superheroes and walkers
with<00:04:09.350> spaceships<00:04:09.590> and<00:04:10.010> monsters<00:04:10.520> and<00:04:10.700> that

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
with spaceships and monsters and that

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.730 
with spaceships and monsters and that
kind<00:04:11.150> of<00:04:11.180> thing<00:04:11.390> we<00:04:12.260> want<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:12.530> think<00:04:12.680> about

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
kind of thing we want to think about

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.930 
kind of thing we want to think about
what<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.040> can<00:04:13.130> offer<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.370> girls<00:04:13.580> and<00:04:13.850> the

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
boys and in terms of things that are

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.110 
boys and in terms of things that are
going<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.040> inspire<00:04:16.220> them<00:04:16.520> of<00:04:16.670> course<00:04:16.790> girls

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
going to inspire them of course girls

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.820 
going to inspire them of course girls
are<00:04:17.180> going<00:04:17.299> to<00:04:17.359> be<00:04:17.450> inspired<00:04:17.690> by<00:04:18.109> things<00:04:18.170> that

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
are going to be inspired by things that

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.430 
are going to be inspired by things that
you<00:04:19.040> might<00:04:19.220> think<00:04:19.549> typically<00:04:20.359> a<00:04:20.510> boy<00:04:20.690> thing

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
you might think typically a boy thing

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.810 
you might think typically a boy thing
with<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.710> girls<00:04:21.890> might<00:04:22.130> be<00:04:22.250> inspired<00:04:22.460> by<00:04:22.790> that

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
with the girls might be inspired by that

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.760 
with the girls might be inspired by that
too<00:04:23.210> and<00:04:23.479> equally<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.080> boys<00:04:24.290> might<00:04:24.590> be

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
too and equally the boys might be

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.930 
too and equally the boys might be
inspired<00:04:25.160> by

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
inspired by

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.940 
inspired by
things<00:04:26.660> that<00:04:26.840> you<00:04:26.960> typically<00:04:27.350> thought<00:04:27.620> would

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
things that you typically thought would

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.800 
things that you typically thought would
be<00:04:28.160> more<00:04:28.310> appropriate<00:04:28.880> for<00:04:29.120> a<00:04:29.240> girl<00:04:29.420> so<00:04:29.780> I

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
be more appropriate for a girl so I

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.130 
be more appropriate for a girl so I
really<00:04:30.170> think<00:04:30.350> about<00:04:30.380> that<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:31.870> say<00:04:32.870> yeah

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
really think about that and say yeah

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.260 
really think about that and say yeah
really<00:04:33.620> set<00:04:33.890> the<00:04:34.010> scene<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:34.730> even<00:04:34.940> before<00:04:35.030> you

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
really set the scene so even before you

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.910 
really set the scene so even before you
put<00:04:35.420> music<00:04:35.600> city<00:04:36.050> music<00:04:36.410> concerts<00:04:36.830> for

alright so that brings me on to number

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.990 
alright so that brings me on to number
four<00:05:12.320> behavior<00:05:12.890> you<00:05:13.370> want<00:05:13.490> to<00:05:13.610> model<00:05:13.910> your
