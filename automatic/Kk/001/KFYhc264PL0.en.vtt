00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.710 
to say number 10 has to go to oh Anthony
this<00:01:51.270> dude's<00:01:51.509> been<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:52.740> Turning<00:01:53.070> Point<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
this dude's been on Turning Point and

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.450 
this dude's been on Turning Point and
he's<00:01:54.720> been<00:01:55.020> part<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.409> SWAT<00:01:55.680> for<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> little<00:01:56.310> bit

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
he's been part of SWAT for a little bit

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.980 
he's been part of SWAT for a little bit
he<00:01:56.610> doesn't<00:01:56.850> even<00:01:56.969> get<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.180> play<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.509> much

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
he doesn't even get to play that much

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.069 
he doesn't even get to play that much
I<00:01:58.020> think<00:01:58.860> he's<00:01:59.070> not<00:01:59.909> really<00:02:00.180> into<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.719> that

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
I think he's not really into it that

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.740 
I think he's not really into it that
much<00:02:01.140> but<00:02:01.560> he's<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:02.159> really<00:02:02.909> good<00:02:03.240> well-known

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
much but he's a really good well-known

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.850 
much but he's a really good well-known
player
