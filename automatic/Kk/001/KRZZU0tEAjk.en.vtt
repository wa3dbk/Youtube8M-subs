as a knock stand but you put positive
pressure<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> blade

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
pressure on the blade

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.270 
pressure on the blade
ie<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.660> put<00:00:58.609> pressure<00:00:59.609> all<00:01:00.260> up<00:01:01.260> into<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:02.100> lock

not<00:01:02.730> against<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.510> sink<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.379> positive

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
not against it sink this is positive

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.120 
not against it sink this is positive
press<00:01:05.129> 1<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.670> negative<00:01:05.850> pressure<00:01:07.040> but<00:01:08.040> if

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
press 1 this is negative pressure but if

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.370 
press 1 this is negative pressure but if
you<00:01:08.189> put<00:01:08.400> positive<00:01:08.880> pressure<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.170> blade

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380

and push down the lock fails it slips
annual<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.470> get<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.799> wheel<00:01:17.040> dangle<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:19.549> you

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
annual you get this wheel dangle and you

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.499 
annual you get this wheel dangle and you
can<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> spring<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.810> lifted<00:01:22.350> up<00:01:22.530> so

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
can see that the spring is lifted up so

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.080 
can see that the spring is lifted up so
soon<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.810> relieve<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.070> pressure<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
soon if you relieve the pressure on the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.050 
soon if you relieve the pressure on the
knife<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.420> snaps<00:01:27.689> back<00:01:27.930> into<00:01:27.990> place<00:01:28.439> and

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
knife that snaps back into place and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.880 
knife that snaps back into place and
it's<00:01:30.060> not<00:01:30.180> getting<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.540> what<00:01:30.720> happened<00:01:31.140> but

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
I just want to show you by putting

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.370 
I just want to show you by putting
positive<00:01:36.030> pressure<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> blade<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
positive pressure on the blade and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.330 
positive pressure on the blade and
pressing<00:01:38.130> down<00:01:41.720> that<00:01:42.720> happens<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
pressing down that happens but it

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.249 
pressing down that happens but it
doesn't<00:01:44.670> happen<00:01:44.820> when<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.840> put<00:01:46.049> negative

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
doesn't happen when you put negative

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:54.250 
doesn't happen when you put negative
pressure

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.160 

as<00:01:55.260> you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.590> see<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.520> blade<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.909> buried<00:01:57.780> up<00:01:57.990> in

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
as you can see the blade is buried up in

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.640 
as you can see the blade is buried up in
the<00:01:58.290> cardboard<00:01:58.620> head<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> little<00:01:59.310> bit<00:01:59.460> a<00:02:00.650> little

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
the cardboard head a little bit a little

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.000 
the cardboard head a little bit a little
bit<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.800> pressure<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.160> that<00:02:02.310> way<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:03.180> fells<00:02:04.010> so

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
bit of pressure on that way it fells so

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.160 
bit of pressure on that way it fells so
I<00:02:06.710> don't<00:02:07.880> we<00:02:08.880> didn't<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.600> issue<00:02:09.840> with

cheap knife and I hate to use the word
cheap<00:02:24.540> because<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:26.070> has<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.430> potential<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:27.030> be

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
cheap because it has the potential to be

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.890 
cheap because it has the potential to be
a<00:02:27.270> very<00:02:27.540> good<00:02:27.840> knife<00:02:28.400> but<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:30.300> very

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
a very good knife but it is a very

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.699 
a very good knife but it is a very
affordable<00:02:31.170> knife<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:32.120> if<00:02:33.120> not<00:02:34.080> for<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.470> one

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
affordable knife and if not for this one

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.640 
affordable knife and if not for this one
issue<00:02:34.860> would<00:02:35.220> be<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.370> very<00:02:35.700> high<00:02:35.940> value<00:02:36.239> knife

you<00:02:37.650> know<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.800> can<00:02:38.160> think<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.700> some<00:02:39.239> situations

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
you know I can think of some situations

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.210 
you know I can think of some situations
where<00:02:40.050> you're<00:02:40.170> cutting<00:02:40.380> through<00:02:40.709> Manila<00:02:41.100> rope

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
where you're cutting through Manila rope

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.670 
where you're cutting through Manila rope
or<00:02:41.670> something<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.870> lost<00:02:43.140> my<00:02:43.350> cell<00:02:43.650> on

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
or something that that lost my cell on

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.820 
or something that that lost my cell on
unit<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.370> don't<00:02:44.640> know<00:02:44.989> that<00:02:45.989> could<00:02:46.260> possibly<00:02:46.739> be

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
unit I don't know that could possibly be

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.720 
unit I don't know that could possibly be
a<00:02:46.920> dangerous<00:02:47.400> situation<00:02:48.110> but<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.680> also<00:02:50.250> wanted

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
a dangerous situation but I also wanted

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.640 
a dangerous situation but I also wanted
to<00:02:50.790> make<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.150> video<00:02:51.510> for<00:02:51.570> code<00:02:51.959> still<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.470> see

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
to make this video for code still to see

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.250 
to make this video for code still to see
and<00:02:53.180> hopefully<00:02:54.180> they<00:02:54.360> can<00:02:54.390> engineer<00:02:55.019> that

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
and hopefully they can engineer that
