there<00:00:33.440> you<00:00:33.710> know<00:00:33.860> I'm<00:00:33.980> saying<00:00:39.219> yeah<00:00:40.219> yeah

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:40.429 
there you know I'm saying yeah yeah

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:42.220 
there you know I'm saying yeah yeah
they're<00:00:40.609> more<00:00:40.730> contoured<00:00:41.300> or<00:00:41.480> more<00:00:41.690> cut<00:00:41.989> to<00:00:42.199> a

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
was it a more challenging job or to go

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:21.040 
was it a more challenging job or to go
pretty<00:01:09.770> easy<00:01:09.920> for<00:01:10.190> you<00:01:19.390> particular<00:01:20.390> yeah<00:01:20.630> yeah

times you know especially with these old

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.710 
times you know especially with these old
or<00:04:25.470> convertibles<00:04:26.130> these<00:04:26.730> cars<00:04:27.030> don't<00:04:27.270> look<00:04:27.540> as

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
or convertibles these cars don't look as

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.870 
or convertibles these cars don't look as
cool<00:04:27.930> with<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.500> top<00:04:28.890> up<00:04:29.130> as<00:04:29.310> they<00:04:29.460> do<00:04:29.520> with<00:04:29.760> the

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
cool with the top up as they do with the

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.240 
cool with the top up as they do with the
top<00:04:30.090> down<00:04:30.330> but<00:04:31.080> in<00:04:31.230> this<00:04:31.350> case<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.860> think<00:04:32.160> the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
top down but in this case I think the

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.460 
top down but in this case I think the
top<00:04:32.460> really<00:04:32.790> accents<00:04:33.330> it<00:04:33.450> you<00:04:34.170> did<00:04:34.290> a<00:04:34.350> really

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470

accent color on the stitching like you

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.620 
accent color on the stitching like you
did<00:04:40.530> in<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.650> interior<00:04:40.890> was<00:04:41.130> that<00:04:41.280> your<00:04:41.430> idea

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
did in the interior was that your idea

00:04:41.630 --> 00:05:01.760 
did in the interior was that your idea
well<00:04:59.180> no<00:05:00.180> I<00:05:00.210> think<00:05:00.420> yeah<00:05:00.690> I<00:05:00.780> agree<00:05:00.960> I<00:05:01.320> just<00:05:01.590> want

like<00:05:07.710> I<00:05:07.860> told<00:05:07.890> you<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.280> don't<00:05:08.370> know<00:05:08.580> what<00:05:08.760> it

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
like I told you I don't know what it

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.520 
like I told you I don't know what it
takes<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.210> accomplish<00:05:09.360> my<00:05:09.750> suggestions<00:05:10.380> I

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
takes to accomplish my suggestions I

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.310 
takes to accomplish my suggestions I
just<00:05:11.960> blended<00:05:12.960> right<00:05:13.050> in

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.840 

know<00:05:16.320> like<00:05:16.350> how<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:16.800> does<00:05:16.980> it<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.310> only<00:05:17.520> set<00:05:17.730> it

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
know like how it does it the only set it

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.250 
know like how it does it the only set it
matches<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.300> interior<00:05:18.780> I<00:05:18.840> think<00:05:19.110> what's

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
matches the interior I think what's

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.020 
matches the interior I think what's
really<00:05:19.440> cool<00:05:19.590> i<00:05:19.890> shortened<00:05:20.400> this<00:05:20.460> boat<00:05:20.760> down

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
really cool i shortened this boat down

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.409 
really cool i shortened this boat down
the<00:05:21.960> back<00:05:22.350> glass<00:05:22.590> actually<00:05:23.190> come<00:05:23.430> up<00:05:23.460> about<00:05:24.240> an

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
the back glass actually come up about an

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.270 
the back glass actually come up about an
inch<00:05:24.540> and<00:05:24.750> a<00:05:24.780> half<00:05:24.810> two<00:05:25.140> inches<00:05:25.169> further<00:05:25.890> this

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
inch and a half two inches further this

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.690 
inch and a half two inches further this
way<00:05:26.580> so<00:05:27.210> I<00:05:27.270> drop<00:05:27.510> this<00:05:27.660> back<00:05:27.900> boat<00:05:28.110> down

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
way so I drop this back boat down

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.620 
way so I drop this back boat down
redesigned<00:05:29.700> it<00:05:29.820> a<00:05:29.850> little<00:05:30.030> bit<00:05:30.180> and<00:05:30.419> brought

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
redesigned it a little bit and brought

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.909 
redesigned it a little bit and brought
it<00:05:30.780> on<00:05:30.930> where<00:05:31.169> it's<00:05:31.290> got<00:05:31.440> a<00:05:31.470> little<00:05:31.650> bit<00:05:31.740> more

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
it on where it's got a little bit more

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.710 
it on where it's got a little bit more
of<00:05:31.980> a<00:05:32.070> flow<00:05:32.250> to<00:05:32.280> instead<00:05:32.730> of<00:05:32.790> just<00:05:33.000> raised<00:05:33.510> up

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
of a flow to instead of just raised up

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.210 
of a flow to instead of just raised up
and<00:05:33.930> it<00:05:34.020> sort<00:05:34.230> of<00:05:34.260> squared<00:05:34.500> off<00:05:34.680> I<00:05:34.830> got<00:05:35.010> your

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
and it sort of squared off I got your

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.720 
and it sort of squared off I got your
PIN<00:05:35.400> and<00:05:35.430> changed<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:36.419> back<00:05:36.600> way<00:05:36.810> to<00:05:37.700> design<00:05:38.700> a

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
PIN and changed the back way to design a

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.500 
PIN and changed the back way to design a
little<00:05:39.000> bit<00:05:39.150> originally<00:05:39.780> the<00:05:40.590> head<00:05:40.770> just<00:05:40.919> a

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
little bit originally the head just a

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.450 
little bit originally the head just a
plastic<00:05:42.510> sewed<00:05:42.960> into<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.590> top<00:05:43.800> right<00:05:44.280> so<00:05:44.400> I

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
plastic sewed into the top right so I

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.810 
plastic sewed into the top right so I
made<00:05:44.610> it<00:05:44.760> more<00:05:44.880> like<00:05:45.090> a<00:05:45.120> late-model

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
made it more like a late-model

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.340 
made it more like a late-model
convertible<00:05:47.820> tops<00:05:48.030> got<00:05:48.270> surrounded<00:05:48.690> you<00:05:49.260> know

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
convertible tops got surrounded you know

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.260 
convertible tops got surrounded you know
she's<00:05:49.740> got<00:05:49.860> a<00:05:49.890> separate<00:05:50.310> glass<00:05:50.430> and<00:05:50.910> window

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
she's got a separate glass and window

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.450 
she's got a separate glass and window
right<00:05:51.720> so<00:05:52.140> sort<00:05:52.800> of<00:05:52.860> looks<00:05:53.010> like<00:05:53.070> a<00:05:53.190> later

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
right so sort of looks like a later

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.300 
right so sort of looks like a later
bottle<00:05:53.850> of<00:05:53.940> marble<00:05:54.330> but<00:05:54.870> still<00:05:55.140> you<00:05:55.620> know<00:05:55.710> fits

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
bottle of marble but still you know fits

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.030 
bottle of marble but still you know fits
fits<00:05:56.820> the<00:05:56.970> profile<00:05:57.330> the<00:05:57.450> car<00:05:57.630> really<00:05:57.900> nice<00:05:58.200> now

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
fits the profile the car really nice now

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.310 
fits the profile the car really nice now
it<00:05:59.250> turned<00:05:59.460> out<00:05:59.580> awesome<00:05:59.840> and<00:06:00.840> then<00:06:00.960> you<00:06:01.110> said
