00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
close-range targets which I'm going to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.749 
close-range targets which I'm going to
demonstrate<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.079> next<00:02:04.380> clip<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:05.579> this

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
demonstrate in this next clip now this

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.190 
demonstrate in this next clip now this
size<00:02:05.969> LED<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.390> me<00:02:06.479> when<00:02:06.600> he<00:02:06.689> shoots<00:02:06.869> me<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
size LED to me when he shoots me in the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.410 
size LED to me when he shoots me in the
back<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.979> do<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.190> banking<00:02:08.640> 10<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.060> give<00:02:09.149> chase

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
back so I do a banking 10 and give chase

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.330 
back so I do a banking 10 and give chase
to<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.690> guy<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.800> there's<00:02:10.950> still<00:02:11.069> quite<00:02:11.129> a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
to this guy but there's still quite a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.170 
to this guy but there's still quite a
bit<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.700> range<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.030> us

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
bit of a range on us

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.569 
bit of a range on us
attempt<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:13.870> lead<00:02:14.439> a<00:02:14.469> few<00:02:14.829> shots<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.280> with<00:02:15.459> this

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
attempt to lead a few shots on with this

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.429 
attempt to lead a few shots on with this
guy<00:02:15.760> but<00:02:15.939> again<00:02:16.239> this<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.659> mainly<00:02:16.870> effective

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
guy but again this is mainly effective

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.319 
guy but again this is mainly effective
against<00:02:17.680> closer<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.189> medium-range<00:02:18.640> targets

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
against closer and medium-range targets

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.059 
against closer and medium-range targets
once<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.840> men<00:02:19.959> range<00:02:20.170> however<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.709> can<00:02:20.859> see

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
once a men range however you can see

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.559 
once a men range however you can see
just<00:02:21.489> how<00:02:21.640> much<00:02:21.790> damage<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.239> can<00:02:22.359> deal<00:02:22.540> with

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
just how much damage you can deal with

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.470 
just how much damage you can deal with
this<00:02:22.870> thing<00:02:23.079> it's<00:02:23.260> such<00:02:23.469> a<00:02:23.500> short<00:02:23.829> vest<00:02:24.480> now

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
this thing it's such a short vest now

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.539 
this thing it's such a short vest now
unfortunately<00:02:25.780> for<00:02:26.049> me<00:02:26.409> this<00:02:26.709> guy<00:02:26.890> is<00:02:26.950> too<00:02:27.250> pro

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
unfortunately for me this guy is too pro

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.080 
unfortunately for me this guy is too pro
and<00:02:27.790> decides<00:02:28.659> to<00:02:28.900> kill<00:02:29.109> himself<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.790> I

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
and decides to kill himself so I

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.050 
and decides to kill himself so I
immediately<00:02:31.510> notice<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.500> scythe<00:02:33.459> on<00:02:33.760> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
immediately notice a scythe on the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.729 
immediately notice a scythe on the
mini-map<00:02:34.329> there<00:02:34.659> so<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:34.900> do<00:02:35.019> a<00:02:35.109> banking<00:02:35.560> 10

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
mini-map there so I do a banking 10

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.740 
mini-map there so I do a banking 10
again<00:02:36.099> and<00:02:36.340> I'm<00:02:36.939> easily<00:02:37.120> getting<00:02:37.420> this<00:02:37.569> guy's

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
again and I'm easily getting this guy's

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.420 
again and I'm easily getting this guy's
tail<00:02:38.079> and<00:02:38.670> load<00:02:39.670> clip<00:02:40.540> into<00:02:41.109> this<00:02:41.260> guy<00:02:41.469> you<00:02:42.310> can

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
tail and load clip into this guy you can

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.490 
tail and load clip into this guy you can
see<00:02:42.609> at<00:02:42.819> this<00:02:42.969> range<00:02:43.269> again<00:02:43.870> I'm<00:02:44.079> hitting<00:02:44.260> with

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
see at this range again I'm hitting with

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.809 
see at this range again I'm hitting with
about<00:02:44.709> 70%<00:02:45.129> of<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.519> clip<00:02:45.790> maybe<00:02:46.659> more<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:48.370> you

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
about 70% of the clip maybe more but you

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.399 
about 70% of the clip maybe more but you
can<00:02:48.939> just<00:02:49.120> see<00:02:49.329> the<00:02:49.480> power<00:02:49.689> of<00:02:49.870> this<00:02:50.049> thing<00:02:50.109> at

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
can just see the power of this thing at

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.259 
can just see the power of this thing at
these<00:02:50.530> kind<00:02:50.769> of<00:02:50.829> ranges<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:51.879> guy<00:02:52.090> has

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
these kind of ranges and that guy has

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.240 
these kind of ranges and that guy has
made<00:02:52.450> short<00:02:52.840> work<00:02:52.989> off<00:02:53.349> in<00:02:53.500> no<00:02:53.680> time<00:02:53.709> it's<00:02:54.099> all

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
made short work off in no time it's all

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.039 
made short work off in no time it's all
again<00:02:56.760> now<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.819> final<00:02:58.450> things<00:02:58.629> I<00:02:58.719> want<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.930> get

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
again now the final things I want to get

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.170 
again now the final things I want to get
into<00:02:59.260> here<00:02:59.469> are<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.859> utility<00:03:00.549> defensive<00:03:01.060> and

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
into here are the utility defensive and

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.839 
into here are the utility defensive and
performance<00:03:01.689> lot<00:03:02.040> for<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.099> utility<00:03:03.639> slot<00:03:03.819> I

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
performance lot for the utility slot I

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.069 
performance lot for the utility slot I
would<00:03:04.060> usually<00:03:04.239> recommend<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.870> fire

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
would usually recommend the fire

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.839 
would usually recommend the fire
suppression<00:03:05.290> system<00:03:05.980> but<00:03:06.159> for<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.430> sake<00:03:06.609> of<00:03:06.639> a

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
suppression system but for the sake of a

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.339 
suppression system but for the sake of a
beginner<00:03:07.239> I'm<00:03:07.480> going<00:03:07.599> to<00:03:07.659> recommend<00:03:07.840> the

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
beginner I'm going to recommend the

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.159 
beginner I'm going to recommend the
decoy<00:03:08.769> flares<00:03:09.629> purely<00:03:10.629> because<00:03:10.930> they're

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:11.169 
decoy flares purely because they're

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.379 
decoy flares purely because they're
extremely<00:03:11.620> simple<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.069> use<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.760> they're<00:03:13.269> just

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
extremely simple to use and they're just

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.259 
extremely simple to use and they're just
involved<00:03:13.659> every<00:03:14.260> FPS<00:03:14.709> out<00:03:14.889> there<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:16.060> have

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
involved every FPS out there that have

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.020 
involved every FPS out there that have
some<00:03:16.480> kind<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.750> flight<00:03:17.190> within<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.370> game<00:03:18.609> so

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
some kind of flight within the game so

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.930 
some kind of flight within the game so
everyone<00:03:19.359> knows<00:03:19.540> how<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.750> use<00:03:19.900> them<00:03:20.819> but<00:03:21.819> if

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
everyone knows how to use them but if

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.789 
everyone knows how to use them but if
you<00:03:21.970> are<00:03:22.120> an<00:03:22.419> experienced<00:03:22.870> pilot<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.470> you<00:03:23.620> can

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
you are an experienced pilot and you can

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.500 
you are an experienced pilot and you can
rely<00:03:24.129> on<00:03:24.159> the<00:03:24.370> environment<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:25.000> get<00:03:25.269> rid<00:03:25.479> of

the<00:05:13.780> vertical<00:05:14.320> thrust<00:05:14.740> upgrades<00:05:15.430> which<00:05:15.700> you

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
the vertical thrust upgrades which you

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.170 
the vertical thrust upgrades which you
should<00:05:16.060> max<00:05:16.390> out<00:05:16.600> as<00:05:16.780> soon<00:05:16.960> as<00:05:17.050> you<00:05:17.169> can<00:05:18.180> what

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
should max out as soon as you can what

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.240 
should max out as soon as you can what
this<00:05:19.330> does<00:05:19.540> is<00:05:19.770> increases<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.860> vertical

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
this does is increases the vertical

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.430 
this does is increases the vertical
thrust<00:05:21.460> of<00:05:21.610> course<00:05:21.850> but<00:05:22.360> it<00:05:22.480> also<00:05:22.660> it<00:05:22.990> allows

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
thrust of course but it also it allows

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.260 
thrust of course but it also it allows
you<00:05:23.650> to<00:05:23.800> fly<00:05:24.010> faster<00:05:24.640> if<00:05:24.760> you<00:05:24.850> fly<00:05:25.060> with<00:05:25.180> the

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
you to fly faster if you fly with the
