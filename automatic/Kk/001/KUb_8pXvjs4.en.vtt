also<00:02:27.599> recording<00:02:28.599> with<00:02:28.840> ScreenFlow<00:02:29.560> that's

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
also recording with ScreenFlow that's

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.099 
also recording with ScreenFlow that's
what<00:02:29.950> I'm<00:02:30.040> using<00:02:30.219> to<00:02:30.459> record<00:02:30.609> this<00:02:30.970> video<00:02:31.329> you

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
what I'm using to record this video you

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.110 
what I'm using to record this video you
can<00:02:32.230> see<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.680> screenshot<00:02:33.220> on<00:02:33.489> your<00:02:33.670> screen<00:02:33.939> now

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
can see a screenshot on your screen now

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.789 
can see a screenshot on your screen now
and<00:02:34.239> that<00:02:34.359> shows<00:02:34.629> that<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.989> actual<00:02:35.290> Geekbench

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
and that shows that the actual Geekbench

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.990 
and that shows that the actual Geekbench
score<00:02:36.129> was<00:02:36.730> 9<00:02:37.209> 1<00:02:37.780> 9<00:02:38.290> 8<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:38.890> slightly<00:02:39.159> lower<00:02:39.459> but

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
score was 9 1 9 8 so slightly lower but

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.819 
score was 9 1 9 8 so slightly lower but
then<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.269> is<00:02:40.389> a<00:02:40.420> different<00:02:40.900> operating<00:02:41.230> system

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
then it is a different operating system

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.520 
then it is a different operating system
and<00:02:42.090> as<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.269> said<00:02:43.420> we're<00:02:43.719> not<00:02:43.840> really<00:02:44.319> testing

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
and as I said we're not really testing

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.050 
and as I said we're not really testing
the<00:02:44.739> overall<00:02:45.099> Geekbench<00:02:45.549> score<00:02:45.849> in<00:02:45.969> this

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
the overall Geekbench score in this

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.750 
the overall Geekbench score in this
video<00:02:46.359> we're<00:02:46.900> really<00:02:47.200> concentrating<00:02:48.129> on<00:02:48.159> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
video we're really concentrating on the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.970 
video we're really concentrating on the
hard<00:02:48.970> drive<00:02:49.239> performance<00:02:49.870> just<00:02:50.530> switching

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
hard drive performance just switching

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.300 
hard drive performance just switching
back<00:02:51.189> to<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.780> black<00:02:52.780> magic<00:02:52.989> design<00:02:53.310> disk

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
back to the black magic design disk

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.490 
back to the black magic design disk
speed<00:02:54.669> test<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:55.569> can<00:02:55.720> see<00:02:55.750> we're<00:02:56.260> hitting

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
speed test you can see we're hitting

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.170 
speed test you can see we're hitting
good<00:02:56.590> performance<00:02:57.220> on<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.700> right<00:02:57.909> read

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
good performance on the right read

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.929 
good performance on the right read
speeds<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.720> this<00:02:58.959> Drive<00:02:59.400> slightly<00:03:00.400> under<00:03:00.730> or

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
speeds of this Drive slightly under or

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.300 
speeds of this Drive slightly under or
quite<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.209> lot<00:03:01.389> under<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.900> quoted<00:03:02.439> rates<00:03:02.680> but

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
quite a lot under the quoted rates but

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.159 
quite a lot under the quoted rates but
that<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.549> probably<00:03:03.849> to<00:03:04.000> do<00:03:04.150> with<00:03:04.180> something<00:03:04.599> in

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:05.169 
that is probably to do with something in

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.849 
that is probably to do with something in
Mac<00:03:05.439> OS<00:03:05.769> 10<00:03:06.659> lion<00:03:07.659> and<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:07.840> will<00:03:08.530> be<00:03:08.650> running

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
Mac OS 10 lion and that will be running

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.039 
Mac OS 10 lion and that will be running
this<00:03:09.099> test<00:03:09.400> again<00:03:09.609> once<00:03:10.419> I've<00:03:10.629> made<00:03:10.810> some

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
this test again once I've made some

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.289 
this test again once I've made some
further<00:03:11.349> tweaks<00:03:11.819> thanks<00:03:12.819> very<00:03:13.030> much<00:03:13.180> for

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
further tweaks thanks very much for

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.149 
further tweaks thanks very much for
watching<00:03:13.359> I'll<00:03:13.810> see<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:14.439> all<00:03:14.680> again

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
watching I'll see you all again

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.150 
watching I'll see you all again
in<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.639> next<00:03:15.849> video
