you

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.940 

so<00:01:48.150> this<00:01:48.330> is<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> approach<00:01:49.020> leading<00:01:49.650> into

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
so this is the approach leading into

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.840 
so this is the approach leading into
raleys<00:01:50.280> store<00:01:51.180> machine<00:01:51.509> boat<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.700> this<00:01:53.700> is

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
raleys store machine boat and this is

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.580 
raleys store machine boat and this is
one<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.150> first<00:01:54.360> levels<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.200> game<00:01:55.350> we

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
one of the first levels of the game we

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.969 
one of the first levels of the game we
made<00:01:55.830> and<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.790> has<00:01:56.909> been<00:01:57.140> gone<00:01:58.140> over<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.830> over

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
made and it has been gone over and over

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.249 
made and it has been gone over and over
and<00:01:59.220> over<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.700> as<00:02:00.030> as<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.750> characters

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and over and as as the characters

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.950 
and over and as as the characters
changed<00:02:01.920> as<00:02:02.399> his<00:02:02.610> jump<00:02:02.970> length<00:02:03.240> change<00:02:03.630> and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
changed as his jump length change and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.540 
changed as his jump length change and
jump<00:02:04.110> height<00:02:04.320> change<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.950> level<00:02:05.340> got

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
jump height change this level got

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.150 
jump height change this level got
changed<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.119> right<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.050> it's<00:02:07.560> also<00:02:07.740> sort<00:02:08.100> of

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
changed to right and it's also sort of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.029 
changed to right and it's also sort of
like<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.489> testbed<00:02:08.970> for<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.300> lighting<00:02:09.570> right

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
like the testbed for the lighting right

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.229 
like the testbed for the lighting right
Tokyo<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.190> did<00:02:11.340> all<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.700> lighting<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
see the game right now the older you

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.530 
see the game right now the older you
have<00:02:55.890> till<00:02:56.700> ish<00:02:57.530> shadow<00:02:58.530> all<00:02:59.070> over<00:02:59.370> that<00:03:00.360> is

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
have till ish shadow all over that is

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.530 
have till ish shadow all over that is
our<00:03:00.750> shadow<00:03:01.140> most<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.920> game<00:03:02.130> uses<00:03:02.910> black

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
our shadow most of the game uses black

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.039 
our shadow most of the game uses black
as<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.900> shadow<00:03:04.320> but<00:03:05.130> we<00:03:05.370> have<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:06.049> different

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
as a shadow but we have a different

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.330 
as a shadow but we have a different
lighting<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:08.220> can<00:03:08.850> make<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.590> shadow<00:03:10.590> we<00:03:11.160> can

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
lighting that can make the shadow we can

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.850 
lighting that can make the shadow we can
choose<00:03:11.579> the<00:03:11.610> color<00:03:12.269> shadow<00:03:12.630> we<00:03:13.380> can<00:03:13.560> make<00:03:13.709> it

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
choose the color shadow we can make it

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.699 
choose the color shadow we can make it
pink<00:03:14.070> blue<00:03:14.670> whatever<00:03:15.450> color<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.230> we<00:03:16.350> can<00:03:16.530> give

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
pink blue whatever color and we can give

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.240 
pink blue whatever color and we can give
their<00:03:16.950> intensity<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:18.590> stuff<00:03:19.590> like<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:19.799> so

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
their intensity and stuff like that so

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.349 
their intensity and stuff like that so
just<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.299> lot<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.690> time<00:03:21.959> consuming<00:03:22.590> just<00:03:22.950> tryin

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
just a lot of time consuming just tryin

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.080 
just a lot of time consuming just tryin
which<00:03:24.359> shadow<00:03:25.140> is<00:03:25.530> works<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.400> best<00:03:26.579> with

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
which shadow is works the best with

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.140 
which shadow is works the best with
these<00:03:27.269> textures<00:03:27.959> that<00:03:28.260> was<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:29.010> most<00:03:29.820> time

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
these textures that was the most time

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.780 
these textures that was the most time
consuming<00:03:30.180> was<00:03:30.900> with<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.410> textures<00:03:31.950> does<00:03:32.609> it

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
consuming was with the textures does it

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.890 
consuming was with the textures does it
works<00:03:33.030> well<00:03:33.420> with<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.870> blue<00:03:34.140> you<00:03:34.560> know

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
works well with the blue you know

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.000 
works well with the blue you know
doesn't<00:03:36.319> we<00:03:37.280> slightly<00:03:37.819> change<00:03:38.299> the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
doesn't we slightly change the

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.100 
doesn't we slightly change the
saturations<00:03:40.010> or<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.939> know<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.689> colors<00:03:42.079> of

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
saturations or you know the colors of

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.649 
saturations or you know the colors of
the<00:03:42.260> textures<00:03:42.890> we<00:03:43.519> did<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.700> lot<00:03:43.819> of<00:03:43.879> process<00:03:44.480> on

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
the textures we did a lot of process on

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.140 
the textures we did a lot of process on
those<00:03:44.870> in<00:03:45.290> this<00:03:45.439> matter<00:03:45.739> how<00:03:46.310> many<00:03:46.489> times<00:03:46.849> you

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
those in this matter how many times you

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.270 
those in this matter how many times you
reckon<00:03:47.450> you<00:03:47.720> went<00:03:47.989> through<00:03:48.439> this<00:03:48.769> level<00:03:49.189> and

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
reckon you went through this level and

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.119 
reckon you went through this level and
real<00:03:49.549> it<00:03:49.700> it<00:03:49.819> may<00:03:50.239> be<00:03:50.379> more<00:03:51.379> than<00:03:51.439> 30<00:03:51.890> times

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
real it it may be more than 30 times

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.110 
real it it may be more than 30 times
well<00:03:53.000> yeah<00:03:53.480> that<00:03:53.900> is<00:03:53.930> intense<00:03:54.590> because<00:03:55.220> dia<00:03:55.519> is

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
well yeah that is intense because dia is

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.170 
well yeah that is intense because dia is
we're<00:03:56.599> dealing<00:03:56.989> with<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.409> fog<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:58.180> the

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
shadow and the most important thing is

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.280 
shadow and the most important thing is
to<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:03.590> brightness<00:04:04.540> if<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.750> game<00:04:05.930> is<00:04:06.079> too

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290
