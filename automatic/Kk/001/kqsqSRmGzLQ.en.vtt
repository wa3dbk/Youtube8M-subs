impression plates which we made out of
Cup<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:06.610> was<00:01:06.790> a<00:01:06.820> disgusting<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.710> now<00:01:08.830> we<00:01:08.890> have

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
a negative mold of our teeth we can pour

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.780 
a negative mold of our teeth we can pour
plaster<00:01:12.270> or<00:01:13.270> plastic<00:01:13.870> in<00:01:14.080> there<00:01:14.799> make<00:01:15.610> that

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
positive mold and then we can make our

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.020 
positive mold and then we can make our
fangs<00:01:17.650> on<00:01:17.830> top<00:01:17.979> of<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.220> I<00:01:18.400> mean<00:01:18.790> that's<00:01:18.940> really

got two or three minutes of work time on
this<00:01:48.670> but<00:01:48.910> to<00:01:48.940> move<00:01:49.180> fast

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.340 

you'll<00:01:53.730> know<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.030> dry<00:01:54.210> because<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.930> liquid

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
you'll know it's dry because the liquid

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.200 
you'll know it's dry because the liquid
goes<00:01:55.500> from<00:01:55.680> clear<00:01:55.830> to<00:01:56.100> white<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.880> turned

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
goes from clear to white this is turned

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.030 
goes from clear to white this is turned
white<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.660> it's<00:01:57.900> actually<00:01:58.230> quite<00:01:58.530> hot<00:01:58.770> it's

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
white and it's actually quite hot it's

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:08.900 
white and it's actually quite hot it's
an<00:01:59.160> exothermic<00:01:59.460> reaction<00:02:03.920> in<00:02:04.920> there<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:07.910> don't

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
an exothermic reaction in there I don't

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.250 
an exothermic reaction in there I don't
think<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.270> could<00:02:09.390> be<00:02:09.420> any<00:02:09.630> better<00:02:09.780> that

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
think that could be any better that

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.880 
think that could be any better that
looks<00:02:10.440> good

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
looks good

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.800 
looks good
so<00:02:11.310> we're<00:02:11.580> outside<00:02:11.970> because<00:02:12.390> we're<00:02:12.540> gonna<00:02:12.630> be

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
so we're outside because we're gonna be

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.160 
so we're outside because we're gonna be
mixing<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:14.010> stuff<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.460> make<00:02:14.580> our<00:02:14.760> teeth

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
mixing the stuff to make our teeth

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.210 
mixing the stuff to make our teeth
before<00:02:16.170> we<00:02:16.260> do<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:16.770> one<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:16.950> made<00:02:17.040> earlier

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
before we do this is one I made earlier

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.540 
before we do this is one I made earlier
I<00:02:17.990> want<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.080> make<00:02:19.230> sure<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:19.980> got<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.220> tooth

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
I want to make sure that I got the tooth

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.990 
I want to make sure that I got the tooth
away<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.710> really<00:02:23.070> squeezed<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.700> up<00:02:23.820> in

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
away that I really squeezed it up in

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.960 
away that I really squeezed it up in
between<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.690> little<00:02:24.840> parts<00:02:25.230> there<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.970> that

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
between the little parts there and that

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.570 
between the little parts there and that
I<00:02:27.000> got<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.750> up<00:02:27.930> along<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.560> gum<00:02:28.740> line<00:02:28.770> right<00:02:29.400> up

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
I got it up along the gum line right up

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.680 
I got it up along the gum line right up
there<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.690> when<00:02:30.960> I<00:02:31.020> put<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.320> in<00:02:31.440> my<00:02:31.530> mouth

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
there so that when I put it in my mouth

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.290 
there so that when I put it in my mouth
it<00:02:33.590> just<00:02:33.800> sticks<00:02:33.980> right<00:02:34.040> on<00:02:34.160> ya<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.000> don't<00:02:35.120> have

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
it just sticks right on ya I don't have

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.820 
it just sticks right on ya I don't have
to<00:02:35.390> put<00:02:35.510> anything<00:02:35.720> in<00:02:35.870> there<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.230> vacuum<00:02:36.650> just

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
to put anything in there a vacuum just

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.190 
to put anything in there a vacuum just
forms<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.460> there<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.700> is

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
forms and there it is

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.900 
forms and there it is
so<00:02:39.200> this<00:02:39.380> is<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.590> clear<00:02:40.160> nail<00:02:40.340> acrylic<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:40.880> I

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
so this is a clear nail acrylic that I

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.030 
so this is a clear nail acrylic that I
got<00:02:41.090> at<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.240> drugstore<00:02:41.450> for<00:02:41.840> about<00:02:41.990> $7<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.890> has

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
got at the drugstore for about $7 it has

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.490 
got at the drugstore for about $7 it has
a<00:02:43.070> powder<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:43.850> then<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.480> liquid<00:02:44.780> we<00:02:45.110> mix<00:02:45.350> the

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
a powder and then a liquid we mix the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.410 
a powder and then a liquid we mix the
two<00:02:45.710> and<00:02:45.740> it'll<00:02:46.670> start<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:46.940> get<00:02:47.060> hardened<00:02:47.360> we

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
two and it'll start to get hardened we

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.950 
two and it'll start to get hardened we
can<00:02:47.570> inform<00:02:47.900> our<00:02:48.020> tooth<00:02:48.230> oh<00:02:49.570> that<00:02:50.570> does<00:02:50.780> smell

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
can inform our tooth oh that does smell

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.940 
can inform our tooth oh that does smell
really<00:02:51.110> bad

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
really bad

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.970 
really bad
cool<00:02:52.430> can<00:02:53.420> almost<00:02:53.840> start<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.260> make<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> ball<00:02:54.770> out

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
cool can almost start to make a ball out

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.490 
cool can almost start to make a ball out
of<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.190> not<00:02:55.460> quite<00:02:55.880> yet<00:02:56.210> very<00:02:56.540> soon<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.320> more

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
of it not quite yet very soon the more

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.990 
of it not quite yet very soon the more
liquid<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.890> use<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.370> quicker<00:02:58.550> this<00:02:58.760> stuff

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
liquid to use the quicker this stuff

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.570 
liquid to use the quicker this stuff
hardens<00:02:59.420> so<00:03:00.170> I<00:03:00.500> actually<00:03:00.830> used<00:03:01.160> quite<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.400> bit

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
hardens so I actually used quite a bit

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.770 
hardens so I actually used quite a bit
of<00:03:01.670> liquid<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.120> we're<00:03:02.270> gonna<00:03:02.360> work<00:03:02.540> pretty

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
of liquid so we're gonna work pretty

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.280 
of liquid so we're gonna work pretty
fast<00:03:03.020> in<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:03.410> next<00:03:04.340> step<00:03:04.550> mix<00:03:05.480> it<00:03:05.630> up<00:03:05.780> until

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
fast in this next step mix it up until

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.520 
fast in this next step mix it up until
it<00:03:06.380> goes<00:03:06.740> into<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.400> solid<00:03:08.000> Misha<00:03:08.360> bowl<00:03:08.600> ball<00:03:08.870> so

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
it goes into a solid Misha bowl ball so

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.750 
it goes into a solid Misha bowl ball so
here's<00:03:09.740> the<00:03:10.730> facsimile<00:03:11.090> agree<00:03:12.490> we<00:03:13.490> want<00:03:13.670> to

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
here's the facsimile agree we want to

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.790 
here's the facsimile agree we want to
find<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.030> canine<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:14.690> we<00:03:14.780> got<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.080> two<00:03:15.530> front

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800

teeth that little t4 beside it and

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.080 
teeth that little t4 beside it and
there's<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.870> canine<00:03:18.200> we're<00:03:19.190> gonna<00:03:19.280> smush<00:03:19.820> this

there's a canine we're gonna smush this

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.060 
there's a canine we're gonna smush this
right<00:03:20.540> up<00:03:20.720> on<00:03:20.900> there

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
right up on there

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.900 
right up on there
trying<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.190> get<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.370> good<00:03:26.460> impression<00:03:27.460> of<00:03:27.760> that

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
trying to get a good impression of that

tooth<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:29.680> better<00:03:29.890> impression<00:03:30.310> we<00:03:30.580> get<00:03:30.850> the

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
tooth the better impression we get the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.700 
tooth the better impression we get the
better<00:03:31.270> it's<00:03:31.450> going<00:03:31.600> to<00:03:31.660> stick<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.110> it<00:03:32.260> so<00:03:32.440> we

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
better it's going to stick to it so we

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.220 
better it's going to stick to it so we
want<00:03:32.860> to<00:03:32.950> make<00:03:33.070> sure<00:03:33.250> this<00:03:33.580> stuff<00:03:33.790> sticks<00:03:34.230> in

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
want to make sure this stuff sticks in

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.560 
want to make sure this stuff sticks in
there<00:03:36.040> pretty<00:03:36.250> good<00:03:36.340> we're<00:03:37.060> gonna<00:03:37.150> carve<00:03:37.450> away

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
there pretty good we're gonna carve away

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.140 
there pretty good we're gonna carve away
the<00:03:37.810> excess<00:03:38.140> later<00:03:38.640> so<00:03:39.640> this<00:03:39.820> shouldn't<00:03:40.030> take

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
the excess later so this shouldn't take

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.210 
the excess later so this shouldn't take
that<00:03:40.420> long<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.750> dry<00:03:40.930> within<00:03:41.560> five<00:03:41.770> minutes<00:03:41.920> it

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
that long to dry within five minutes it

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.410 
that long to dry within five minutes it
should<00:03:42.370> start<00:03:42.550> to<00:03:42.640> get<00:03:42.730> really<00:03:43.060> hot<00:03:43.240> to<00:03:43.390> the

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
should start to get really hot to the

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.150 
should start to get really hot to the
touch<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:44.200> that's<00:03:44.470> when<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:44.770> know<00:03:44.920> you<00:03:44.980> got

use the Dremel pop these things off and
we're<00:03:55.840> gonna<00:03:55.960> make<00:03:56.170> these<00:03:56.350> into<00:03:56.800> razor-sharp

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
we're gonna make these into razor-sharp

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.130 
we're gonna make these into razor-sharp
