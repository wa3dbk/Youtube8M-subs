00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
right on the side of it so I'm hoping

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.200 
right on the side of it so I'm hoping
these<00:01:53.369> tool<00:01:53.670> live<00:01:54.950> for<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> process<00:01:57.030> of

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
these tool live for the process of

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.149 
these tool live for the process of
cycling<00:01:57.750> they'll<00:01:58.350> be<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.710> fine<00:02:00.860> I've<00:02:01.860> been

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
cycling they'll be just fine I've been

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.569 
cycling they'll be just fine I've been
checking<00:02:02.399> my<00:02:02.729> levels<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:04.009> finally<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.280> a

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
checking my levels I finally have a

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.690 
checking my levels I finally have a
spike<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.479> ammonia<00:02:06.960> at<00:02:07.259> about<00:02:07.469> point<00:02:07.920> zero

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
spike of ammonia at about point zero

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.320 
spike of ammonia at about point zero
zero<00:02:09.030> point<00:02:09.929> two<00:02:10.020> five<00:02:10.319> parts<00:02:10.739> per<00:02:10.920> million

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
zero point two five parts per million

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.670 
zero point two five parts per million
I'm<00:02:12.330> not<00:02:12.540> going<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.780> be<00:02:12.930> doh

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
I'm not going to be doh

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.679 
I'm not going to be doh
singer<00:02:13.980> real<00:02:14.099> heavy<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.849> marine<00:02:15.329> snow

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
singer real heavy on the marine snow

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:22.520 
singer real heavy on the marine snow
anymore<00:02:16.760> but<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.939> am<00:02:18.209> going<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:20.030> start<00:02:21.530> watching

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
anymore but I am going to start watching

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.699 
anymore but I am going to start watching
the<00:02:23.010> nitrates<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.659> noticed<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:25.500> do

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
the nitrates and I noticed that I do

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.000 
the nitrates and I noticed that I do
have<00:02:26.189> a<00:02:26.489> little<00:02:26.549> bit<00:02:26.849> of<00:02:26.939> nitrates<00:02:27.510> already<00:02:28.010> so

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
have a little bit of nitrates already so

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.869 
have a little bit of nitrates already so
i<00:02:29.280> think<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.909> cycle<00:02:30.420> process<00:02:30.659> is<00:02:31.879> hopefully

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
i think the cycle process is hopefully

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.339 
i think the cycle process is hopefully
about<00:02:33.150> done<00:02:34.189> just<00:02:35.189> showing<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:36.170> my<00:02:37.170> little

use<00:03:39.879> zip<00:03:40.180> ties<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.599> hold<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:40.900> together<00:03:41.019> and

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
use zip ties to hold it together and

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.720 
use zip ties to hold it together and
then<00:03:42.569> super<00:03:43.569> glue<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.920> cut<00:03:45.159> the<00:03:45.310> zip<00:03:45.370> ties

seems<00:05:15.420> to<00:05:15.540> be<00:05:15.600> doing<00:05:15.750> really<00:05:15.870> nice<00:05:17.420> I've<00:05:18.420> put

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
seems to be doing really nice I've put

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.470 
seems to be doing really nice I've put
in<00:05:20.060> a<00:05:21.860> bunch<00:05:22.860> of<00:05:23.100> foam<00:05:23.400> here<00:05:23.730> because<00:05:24.210> I'm

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
in a bunch of foam here because I'm

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.480 
in a bunch of foam here because I'm
getting<00:05:24.720> tons<00:05:24.990> of<00:05:25.080> microbubbles<00:05:25.620> so<00:05:26.040> I'm<00:05:26.130> not

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
getting tons of microbubbles so I'm not

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.190 
getting tons of microbubbles so I'm not
sure<00:05:26.550> what<00:05:26.760> I'm<00:05:26.940> going<00:05:27.060> to<00:05:27.150> do<00:05:27.330> there<00:05:27.570> it's

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200
