00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:14.809
 everyone is tied to press his armada today 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.510
 we will have at 400 sixteenth facility 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.130
 I promised to make a video on it under 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.930
 this 4 this is the 4th 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.060
 video made it's time all the same 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.360
 fulfill the second part of my promise and 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.980
 Today we will see the fight on the map of Lasville 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.280
 let's say the pain I really liked 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.780
 unfortunately they will kill me in it but 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.640
 the result I'm in is mutual 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.920
 envious Nicky at first a little 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.809
 traces the result of that 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.730
 martial of amazing how I struck me 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.339
 I will give you parasites first here 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.800
 very lucky the vision was pretty 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.780
 still large and perhaps it is no 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.350
 the secret is that at level 8 few people manage 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.229
 bring 4 5 6 damage but me in this violent 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.420
 there will be able to clean 6 thousand 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:58.280
 the damage is a bit on the city ​​map 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.149
 considering that we had a son 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.399
 meeting engagement 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.239
 tell me my favorite card is not 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.160
 my favorite mode on this map 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.260
 Poprad only Odessa will 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.080
 to lead why now we will all this business 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.160
 watch mean early i'm showing 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.170
 I don't have any 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.620
 There was no fight for this fight because I 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.440
 counted on what a typical bout 2000 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.960
 drain all because I ride time 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.540
 some aleshi come across a team 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.510
 sorry if there are such among you and 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.370
 so it means notice give names turn on 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.130
 all the same 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.980
 by marker to show the icon 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.550
 technology and he is not technology hundreds still model 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:43.880
 because you don't want to upset you 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.520
 so here and let's see 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.899
 Means shoots with beer especially not yet 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.890
 so interesting yet 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.930
 full hp but now I certainly should 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.899
 get some orto orto splash 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.880
 will see the best fight just come to 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.600
 success means makeda last time 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.100
 Olympus and here I am also 351 for the harp 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.689
 of course the only big best 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.759
 the problem of this tank is its small 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.429
 hope that 1200 units that is 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.970
 four shells absolutely any 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.700
 let's say a sibling t and our 416 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.220
 go to the hangar nonetheless if 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.709
 let's say there are hands there is at least some 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.019
 the slightest breath bend i think that u 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.910
 you get these pc to the end of the battle 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.739
 hold back especially since tanchik is pretty 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.290
 such inconspicuous little skilful he 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.269
 well shoots mean including 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.760
 cumulative projectile because i see from 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.420
 and 15 to break it is very difficult even 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.599
 gold 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.549
 there some places will not be taken but 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.799
 I'm here to buy food that is fully 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.799
 less than 500 hp we sort of win and i 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.720
 just say mister no matter what 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.790
 I take and exchange our hepe for him 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.650
 I see that I have to be amazed once and 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.140
 here are what so three hundred will not live 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.030
 30 millimeters penetration does not change 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.400
 manages ruler dubna another exchange 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.829
 let's say pretty illiterate then 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.459
 I have sex 111 a.p. 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.380
 and here begins my all say luck 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.359
 because with 111, etc. 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.120
 Probably not only eat the eighth level 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.799
 does not live long because even if 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.019
 the battle of victory is anyway the slightest 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.450
 shot arta under there propped 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.670
 any any ally there or 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.930
 hit the case the cluster studio will save 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.480
 never but i'm especially here let's say not 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.280
 tensed continued to ride on the buzz 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.329
 let's say enjoy the pain so you 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.060
 you can 2 classes 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:35.480
 any of them will punch me that is like in 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.220
 of my nld and vld armor towers there angles 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.920
 the tower was brought up but not enough to 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.959
 cram the projectile someone with but i like 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.840
 this meadow and not afraid of him then 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:48.739
 humiliate let's say aiming class and he 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.770
 the tower doesn't mask me pretty 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.440
 not bad I'm leaving 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.990
 take away first class pick up 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.360
 already as we see three thousand damage so far 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.300
 is not the limit means and is still 1st 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.640
 class and here we won't have some 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.860
 let's say problems because he hid 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.370
 let's see the statistics 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.490
 let's say a person can be 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.170
 thought of 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.170
 maybe just lucky he calls 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.620
 Fell see already down from e7 am not 111 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.480
 cafe very much on his knee all means I 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.360
 you already bebehe manage somehow 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.670
 he can see another class 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.860
 I see that you have already shot kvass on him 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.280
 I understand that his damage must be reached 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.160
 after all there in the man's cheek 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.970
 that's 160 a break through already enough yes even 150 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.040
 go to see me and do not fall 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.900
 to college and this is really cool i mean he 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.090
 had to finish off but as we know very much 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.790
 many he aria archers who are in the game 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.090
 who see there 60s will go there 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.910
 mindlessly find 60s drink it merges there your 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.270
 full on these here is the 60th 70th kopek 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.670
 often you happen this is 10 for something 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.460
 shoots at our isu third I him 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.520
 the answer was set on fire at 600 x n in total with 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.490
 four thousand 700 damage is already taken 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.950
 all with the same will be fp here it is 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.690
 will show it all the same as possible 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.360
 not even strange that hop and left 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.120
 a little bit of skill and luck and 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.880
 you can already drag that is not said that 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.550
 dragged yes but let's say without my actions 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.700
 most likely this city would not be so 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.490
 effectively broken through then I believe that already 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.020
 there stay yashka and shelves on the type myself 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.850
 Do not pay attention although this is mine 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.720
 the main offender in this fight now in 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.230
 end of that and 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.169
 and kill me again upset me 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.540
 she is not that problem because i'm night 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:43.180
 I leave here for another 6 slightly hurt at 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.810
 it is not particularly concerns means leaving on 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.730
 Yashu 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.400
 and you understand the toastmaster already all the same on houses 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.150
 to play, so I enter x straight 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.600
 and and the poor 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.480
 throws up 5000 damage and I run away 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.760
 unfolds to happiness take and this 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.550
 so go and 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.040
 what will happen of course i am trying to understand 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.830
 What kind of party will come out type I see that I 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.800
 on the minimap to you here understanding 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.020
 what's in front and he say rushing bore 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.480
 head for some reason choose 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.590
 me and merges from me 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.270
 I take off the battering ram had some there 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:22.810
 strength unit to ram and 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.360
 accordingly, let us say battle slide here 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.610
 so here's the guys fight on if 5000 let's 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.050
 round off 500 damage not 6 of course like me 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.650
 said two of which was sung a little bit like that 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:36.280
 I was interested in the damage points, that is, having 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:38.140
 120 x p pretty well it would seem 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.340
 so here's the fight I think he liked 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:44.230
