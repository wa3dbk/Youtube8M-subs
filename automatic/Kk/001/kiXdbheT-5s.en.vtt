Thomas Quackenbush he made an experiment

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.420 
Thomas Quackenbush he made an experiment
in<00:00:03.510> Florida<00:00:04.049> he<00:00:04.620> took<00:00:04.890> hundred<00:00:05.250> volunteers

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
in Florida he took hundred volunteers

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.350 
in Florida he took hundred volunteers
and<00:00:06.259> he<00:00:07.259> would<00:00:07.529> he<00:00:08.040> said<00:00:08.250> fifty<00:00:08.670> people<00:00:09.090> took

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
and he would he said fifty people took

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.650 
and he would he said fifty people took
dark<00:00:10.110> glasses<00:00:10.410> on<00:00:10.769> fifty<00:00:11.219> didn't<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.150> he

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
dark glasses on fifty didn't and he

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.799 
dark glasses on fifty didn't and he
placed<00:00:12.929> them<00:00:13.170> on<00:00:13.410> shore<00:00:13.769> on<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.790> beach<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.360> he

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
placed them on shore on the beach and he

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.200 
placed them on shore on the beach and he
was<00:00:15.960> measuring<00:00:16.260> what<00:00:16.980> kind<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.430> sunburn

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
was measuring what kind of a sunburn

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.540 
was measuring what kind of a sunburn
they<00:00:18.630> will<00:00:18.779> have<00:00:19.020> those<00:00:19.650> people<00:00:19.920> who<00:00:20.310> were

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
they will have those people who were

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.849 
they will have those people who were
wearing<00:00:20.820> dirty<00:00:21.539> glasses<00:00:21.869> had<00:00:22.260> much<00:00:22.529> more

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
wearing dirty glasses had much more

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.370 
wearing dirty glasses had much more
sunburn<00:00:23.519> than<00:00:23.730> those<00:00:23.910> who<00:00:24.150> didn't<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.720> then

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
sunburn than those who didn't and then

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.410 
sunburn than those who didn't and then
he<00:00:25.560> started<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.070> make<00:00:26.220> research<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.000> he<00:00:27.150> found

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
he started to make research and he found

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.999 
he started to make research and he found
out<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.890> 99%<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.250> all<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.670> receptors<00:00:30.000> that

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
out that 99% of all the receptors that

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.190 
out that 99% of all the receptors that
we<00:00:32.780> saved<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.989> information<00:00:34.350> about<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.160> lulav

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
we saved the information about the lulav

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.350 
we saved the information about the lulav
the<00:00:37.200> density<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.950> Sun<00:00:38.250> located<00:00:39.210> around

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the density of the Sun located around

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.650 
the density of the Sun located around
eyes<00:00:39.860> so<00:00:40.860> when<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.280> covered<00:00:41.760> those<00:00:41.910> receptors

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
eyes so when we covered those receptors

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.540 
eyes so when we covered those receptors
we<00:00:42.899> send<00:00:43.200> an<00:00:43.320> incorrect<00:00:43.860> message<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.489> our

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
we send an incorrect message to our

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.100 
we send an incorrect message to our
brains<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.059> hey<00:00:45.360> there's<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.690> Twilight<00:00:46.350> relax

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
brains and hey there's a Twilight relax

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.439 
brains and hey there's a Twilight relax
and<00:00:49.110> when<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.680> don't<00:00:49.890> then<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.820> receptors

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
and when we don't then this receptors

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.420 
and when we don't then this receptors
become<00:00:51.840> active<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.320> then<00:00:52.500> they<00:00:52.920> send<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
become active and then they send the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.700 
become active and then they send the
impulse<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:54.360> our<00:00:54.480> hormonal<00:00:54.989> system<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.620> say

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
impulse to our hormonal system and say

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.350 
impulse to our hormonal system and say
hey<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.070> need<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.430> some<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.149> some

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
hey we need to some to do some

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.279 
hey we need to some to do some
protection<00:00:57.989> from<00:00:58.140> sunburn<00:00:59.449> yet<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.780> all<00:01:00.960> think

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
protection from sunburn yet we all think

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.450 
protection from sunburn yet we all think
I<00:01:01.410> was<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.739> smart

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
I was so smart

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.359 
I was so smart
but<00:01:02.820> put<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.149> their<00:01:03.329> glasses<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.019> then<00:01:04.830> when<00:01:05.129> we

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
but put in their glasses on then when we

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.020 
but put in their glasses on then when we
keep<00:01:05.700> all<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.030> those<00:01:06.390> dark<00:01:06.810> glasses<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:08.030> we

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
keep all of those dark glasses on we

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.620 
keep all of those dark glasses on we
begin<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.750> vitamin<00:01:10.320> D<00:01:11.000> Tom<00:01:12.000> Quackenbush

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
begin to like vitamin D Tom Quackenbush

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.870 
begin to like vitamin D Tom Quackenbush
and<00:01:12.840> his<00:01:12.990> book<00:01:13.290> relearning<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.100> see<00:01:14.310> he<00:01:14.549> states

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and his book relearning to see he states

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.010 
and his book relearning to see he states
that<00:01:15.830> we<00:01:16.830> absorb<00:01:17.280> most<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.909> vitamin<00:01:18.540> D<00:01:18.720> by<00:01:18.960> this

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
that we absorb most of vitamin D by this

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.190 
that we absorb most of vitamin D by this
part<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.860> our<00:01:20.040> body<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.909> if<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.600> always

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
part of our body and if it's always

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.469 
part of our body and if it's always
covered<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:22.860> glasses<00:01:23.340> either<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.000> clearer

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
covered with glasses either a clearer

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.510 
covered with glasses either a clearer
glasses<00:01:25.049> or<00:01:25.200> dar<00:01:25.470> glass<00:01:25.740> because<00:01:26.189> clear

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
glasses or dar glass because clear

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.090 
glasses or dar glass because clear
glasses<00:01:26.820> also<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.750> UV<00:01:28.200> protection<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.920> them

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
glasses also have UV protection in them

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.819 
glasses also have UV protection in them
we<00:01:29.729> begin<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.329> develop<00:01:30.570> lack<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.170> vitamin<00:01:31.650> D

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
we begin to develop lack of vitamin D

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.700 
we begin to develop lack of vitamin D
what<00:01:32.460> does<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.850> sign<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.299> lack<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.110> vitamin<00:01:34.530> D

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
what does the sign of lack of vitamin D

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.789 
what does the sign of lack of vitamin D
is<00:01:35.299> irritability<00:01:36.299> by<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> sunshine<00:01:37.409> when<00:01:37.650> you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
is irritability by the sunshine when you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.490 
is irritability by the sunshine when you
have<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.310> squint<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.900> means<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.380> already

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
have to squint that means you already

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.300 
have to squint that means you already
like<00:01:40.860> vitamin<00:01:41.610> D<00:01:41.790> roughly<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.320> then<00:01:43.350> when<00:01:44.130> you

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
like vitamin D roughly and then when you

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.190 
like vitamin D roughly and then when you
squint<00:01:44.729> then<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.180> wanna<00:01:45.360> wear<00:01:45.659> more<00:01:45.960> dark

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
squint then you wanna wear more dark

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.899 
squint then you wanna wear more dark
glasses<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.829> then<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.280> trapped<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.759> a

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
glasses and then you trapped in a

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.630 
glasses and then you trapped in a
vicious<00:01:48.000> circle<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:49.009> remember<00:01:50.009> how<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.220> was

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
vicious circle I remember how I was

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.139 
vicious circle I remember how I was
always<00:01:50.850> irritated<00:01:51.600> by<00:01:51.750> by<00:01:52.740> bright<00:01:53.490> light<00:01:53.820> or

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
always irritated by by bright light or

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.289 
always irritated by by bright light or
some<00:01:54.509> snow<00:01:55.170> or<00:01:55.530> sunshine<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.520> then<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.060> would

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
some snow or sunshine and then I would

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.649 
some snow or sunshine and then I would
always<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.810> lines<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.890> then<00:01:59.759> now<00:02:00.060> when

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
always have lines here and then now when

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.289 
always have lines here and then now when
I<00:02:00.710> learnt<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.950> from<00:02:02.009> Tom<00:02:02.490> question<00:02:02.909> was<00:02:03.060> I

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
I learnt this from Tom question was I

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.389 
I learnt this from Tom question was I
throw<00:02:03.630> away<00:02:03.840> all<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.350> dark<00:02:04.560> glasses<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:05.219> had

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
throw away all the dark glasses we had

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.550 
throw away all the dark glasses we had
in<00:02:05.549> my<00:02:05.729> family<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.780> stopped<00:02:07.170> wearing<00:02:07.439> them
