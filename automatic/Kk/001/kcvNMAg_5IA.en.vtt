basically<00:00:17.580> when<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:17.910> started<00:00:18.210> working<00:00:18.420> on<00:00:18.600> it

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
basically when we started working on it

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.560 
basically when we started working on it
we<00:00:19.109> didn't<00:00:19.380> want<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.590> make<00:00:19.859> another<00:00:20.160> sequel<00:00:20.640> so

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
we didn't want to make another sequel so

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.820 
we didn't want to make another sequel so
we<00:00:21.750> sort<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.050> stripped<00:00:22.320> everything<00:00:22.439> out

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
we sort of stripped everything out

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
started from scratch and just built the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.500

in<00:01:18.000> drops<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.630> crates<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.020> you're<00:01:19.950> able<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
in drops of crates and you're able to

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.370 
in drops of crates and you're able to
capture<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.810> crate<00:01:22.049> you're<00:01:22.259> either

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
capture and in that crate you're either

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.950 
capture and in that crate you're either
going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> get<00:01:22.799> ammo<00:01:23.189> or<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.330> random<00:01:24.570> kill

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
going to get ammo or a random kill

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.609 
going to get ammo or a random kill
streak<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.920> they're<00:01:26.369> all<00:01:26.490> weighted<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.619> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
streak and they're all weighted so the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.679 
streak and they're all weighted so the
lower<00:01:28.799> kill<00:01:29.100> tracer<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:30.000> comment<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
lower kill tracer in comment but you

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.810 
lower kill tracer in comment but you
could<00:01:30.869> possibly<00:01:31.350> an<00:01:31.530> ac-130<00:01:31.950> insert<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.700> can

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
could possibly an ac-130 insert you can

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.179 
could possibly an ac-130 insert you can
do<00:01:32.909> blood<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.150> gun<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.829> then<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.009> fifth

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
do blood this gun and then the fifth

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.490 
do blood this gun and then the fifth
kill<00:01:35.400> streak<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.299> predator<00:01:36.930> missile<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
kill streak is the predator missile and

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.490 
kill streak is the predator missile and
that<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.430> basically<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.240> remote<00:01:40.229> control

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
that is basically a remote control

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.050 
that is basically a remote control
missile<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.920> control<00:01:41.220> hook<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:41.909> your

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
missile if you control hook up your

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.999 
missile if you control hook up your
laptop<00:01:42.150> you're<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> ground<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.860> got<00:01:43.920> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
laptop you're on the ground you got a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.429 
laptop you're on the ground you got a
few<00:01:44.220> seconds<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> bad<00:01:45.630> guys<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.290> blow

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
few seconds to see the bad guys and blow

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.920 
few seconds to see the bad guys and blow
up<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.460> there's<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.700> lot<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.880> different<00:01:48.509> ways<00:01:48.720> to

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
up so there's a lot of different ways to

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.800 
up so there's a lot of different ways to
play<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.409> lot<00:01:50.040> different<00:01:50.430> lock

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
play a lot different lock

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
about all this stuff is we have two

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.950 
about all this stuff is we have two
basic<00:05:09.830> philosophies<00:05:10.460> that<00:05:10.490> we<00:05:10.960> incorporates

and<00:05:12.080> everything<00:05:12.320> we're<00:05:12.440> adding<00:05:12.650> to<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:12.830> game

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
and everything we're adding to the game

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.860 
and everything we're adding to the game
so<00:05:13.729> we<00:05:13.789> have<00:05:13.909> to<00:05:13.969> make<00:05:14.090> sure<00:05:14.180> it's<00:05:14.300> fun<00:05:14.510> there's

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
so we have to make sure it's fun there's

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.529 
so we have to make sure it's fun there's
obvious<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:16.580> we<00:05:16.700> also<00:05:16.849> make<00:05:17.090> sure<00:05:17.120> that<00:05:17.240> it's
