00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
so this time we're going to spice things

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.160 
so this time we're going to spice things
up<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.490> little<00:00:11.639> bit<00:00:11.880> we're<00:00:12.660> still<00:00:12.900> going<00:00:13.080> to

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
up a little bit we're still going to

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.939 
up a little bit we're still going to
stick<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.559> our<00:00:13.590> 145<00:00:14.429> progression<00:00:15.740> however<00:00:16.740> if

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
stick to our 145 progression however if

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.800 
stick to our 145 progression however if
we're<00:00:17.190> going<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.400> venture<00:00:17.820> out<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.330> our<00:00:18.510> by<00:00:18.779> a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
we're going to venture out of our by a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.710 
we're going to venture out of our by a
thinker<00:00:19.199> position<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.890> use<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.000> whole<00:00:21.240> scale

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
thinker position and use the whole scale

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.980 
thinker position and use the whole scale
as<00:00:22.230> our<00:00:23.189> playground<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.779> key<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.710> C<00:00:26.010> again<00:00:26.990> all

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
as our playground so key of C again all

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:37.700 
as our playground so key of C again all
right<00:00:28.170> here<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:28.500> go<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:36.809> we're<00:00:37.230> still<00:00:37.469> going<00:00:37.590> to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
right here we go so we're still going to

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.690 
right here we go so we're still going to
randomly<00:00:37.950> change<00:00:43.040> it<00:00:44.040> kind<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.309> mix<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.610> up

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
randomly change it kind of mix it up

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:54.270 
randomly change it kind of mix it up

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
you guys should practice the scale at

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.979 
you guys should practice the scale at
home<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:57.010> is<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.280> fingering<00:00:57.699> Florida<00:00:58.059> goes

for now let's just hold all notes

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.710 
for now let's just hold all notes
actually<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.310> was<00:02:13.549> doing<00:02:13.879> a<00:02:13.970> little<00:02:14.209> variation

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
actually I was doing a little variation

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.330 
actually I was doing a little variation
right<00:02:14.870> there<00:02:15.049> with<00:02:15.620> half<00:02:15.769> notes<00:02:16.069> in<00:02:16.220> there

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
right there with half notes in there

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.420 
right there with half notes in there
let's<00:02:16.879> do<00:02:17.000> all<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.329> still<00:02:17.629> ok<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.470> use

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
let's do all that still ok so use

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.600 
let's do all that still ok so use
charges<00:02:20.239> using<00:02:20.569> one<00:02:20.750> scale<00:02:21.140> first<00:02:21.500> okay<00:02:24.610> maybe

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
charges using one scale first okay maybe

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.000 
charges using one scale first okay maybe
do<00:02:26.239> an<00:02:26.360> exercise<00:02:26.750> first<00:02:27.079> to<00:02:27.349> learn<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.739> scale

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
do an exercise first to learn the scale

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.210 
do an exercise first to learn the scale
just<00:02:28.280> go<00:02:28.459> up<00:02:28.579> and<00:02:28.730> down<00:02:28.879> so<00:02:29.829> you<00:02:30.829> know<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.190> can

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
just go up and down so you know you can

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.589 
just go up and down so you know you can
kind<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.269> use<00:02:33.519> rhythmic<00:02:34.519> variations<00:02:35.090> here<00:02:35.299> but

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
kind of use rhythmic variations here but

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.990 
kind of use rhythmic variations here but
just<00:02:35.900> keep<00:02:35.989> going<00:02:36.379> up<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.650> down<00:02:36.769> okay<00:02:37.129> so<00:02:37.700> for

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
just keep going up and down okay so for

00:02:38.000 --> 00:03:04.640 
just keep going up and down okay so for
example

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.390

again<00:03:22.660> any<00:03:22.930> Nazi<00:03:23.970> NBC<00:03:24.970> News<00:03:25.120> 5<00:03:25.360> that<00:03:27.480> might

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
again any Nazi NBC News 5 that might

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.480 
again any Nazi NBC News 5 that might
experiment<00:03:28.990> and<00:03:29.770> you're<00:03:30.010> not<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.130> different

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
experiment and you're not a different

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.860 
experiment and you're not a different
note<00:03:30.610> on<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.790> right<00:03:30.940> hand<00:03:31.120> but<00:03:31.300> left<00:03:31.690> hand

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
note on the right hand but left hand

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.640 
note on the right hand but left hand
course<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:32.320> see<00:03:33.990> so<00:03:34.990> let's<00:03:35.170> say<00:03:35.290> if<00:03:35.380> we<00:03:35.500> end

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
course you see so let's say if we end

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.500 
course you see so let's say if we end
our<00:03:35.830> G

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.170 

10<00:03:41.110> your<00:03:41.739> panel<00:03:42.010> left<00:03:42.159> hanging<00:03:42.519> there<00:03:42.700> kind<00:03:43.090> of

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
10 your panel left hanging there kind of

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.399 
10 your panel left hanging there kind of
feels<00:03:43.599> like<00:03:43.720> there<00:03:43.900> needs<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.170> be<00:03:44.200> some

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
feels like there needs to be some

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.110 
feels like there needs to be some
revolution<00:03:44.980> try<00:03:45.250> all<00:03:45.430> these<00:03:45.579> different<00:03:45.790> notes

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
revolution try all these different notes

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.440 
revolution try all these different notes
and<00:03:46.360> endings<00:03:46.780> like<00:03:47.049> you<00:03:47.829> know<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:49.239> one

okay<00:03:54.400> so<00:03:54.820> you<00:03:54.880> got<00:03:55.060> experiment<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:55.930> see<00:03:56.140> what

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
okay so you got experiment and see what

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.210 
okay so you got experiment and see what
sounds<00:03:56.830> good<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:58.710> these<00:03:59.710> sounds<00:04:00.100> like

better than others okay and always if

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.500 
better than others okay and always if
you<00:04:29.220> play<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:29.460> wrong<00:04:29.760> note<00:04:30.000> you<00:04:30.150> can<00:04:30.210> try<00:04:30.450> the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
you play a wrong note you can try the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:44.160 
you play a wrong note you can try the
next<00:04:30.750> note<00:04:31.220> okay<00:04:32.220> for<00:04:32.850> example

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:51.529 

the

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.200 

sound<00:04:52.539> like<00:04:53.400> there<00:04:54.400> was<00:04:54.520> any<00:04:54.550> closure<00:04:54.940> to<00:04:55.180> it

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
sound like there was any closure to it

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.980 
sound like there was any closure to it
so<00:04:55.449> I<00:04:55.479> moved<00:04:55.810> it<00:04:55.990> to<00:04:56.139> Annie<00:04:57.479> passing

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
so I moved it to Annie passing

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.400 
so I moved it to Annie passing
so<00:05:02.240> if<00:05:03.240> you<00:05:03.450> hear<00:05:03.780> enough<00:05:04.080> that<00:05:04.260> you<00:05:04.350> don't

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
so if you hear enough that you don't

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.050 
so if you hear enough that you don't
like<00:05:04.620> move<00:05:05.070> on<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.430> different<00:05:05.490> note<00:05:05.850> and

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
like move on to a different note and

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.600 
like move on to a different note and
maybe<00:05:06.450> you'll<00:05:06.720> like<00:05:06.870> it<00:05:06.980> maybe<00:05:07.980> you<00:05:08.160> won't<00:05:08.310> but

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
hand and different order to okay I'm

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.530 
hand and different order to okay I'm
still<00:05:25.800> going<00:05:25.920> to<00:05:25.980> go<00:05:26.610> up<00:05:26.760> and<00:05:26.910> down<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.270> scale

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
still going to go up and down the scale

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.260 
still going to go up and down the scale
like<00:05:27.870> so<00:05:28.800> so<00:05:29.340> I'm<00:05:29.490> not<00:05:29.610> going<00:05:29.760> to<00:05:29.820> be<00:05:29.910> skipping

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
like so so I'm not going to be skipping

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.690 
like so so I'm not going to be skipping
around<00:05:30.390> her<00:05:30.690> okay<00:05:31.350> but<00:05:31.980> I<00:05:32.040> might<00:05:32.250> go<00:05:32.370> back<00:05:32.400> and

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
around her okay but I might go back and

00:05:32.700 --> 00:06:05.300 
around her okay but I might go back and
forth<00:05:32.850> for<00:05:33.150> example

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.620 

you

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.110 

so<00:06:11.630> it<00:06:11.690> gives<00:06:11.810> us<00:06:12.050> a<00:06:12.080> little<00:06:12.290> bit<00:06:12.500> more

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
so it gives us a little bit more

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:20.420 
so it gives us a little bit more
variation<00:06:14.120> so<00:06:14.390> slower

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.690 

sickly<00:06:21.030> sometime

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.540

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:45.159

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.379 

ok<00:06:45.740> now<00:06:46.310> you<00:06:46.340> can<00:06:46.460> skip<00:06:46.759> around<00:06:46.939> a<00:06:47.060> little<00:06:47.180> bit

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:47.389 
ok now you can skip around a little bit

00:06:47.389 --> 00:07:14.459 
ok now you can skip around a little bit
too

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:14.469 

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:20.519 

okay<00:07:17.049> so<00:07:18.049> you<00:07:18.859> can<00:07:19.429> practice<00:07:19.639> that<00:07:19.999> at<00:07:20.179> home

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:20.529 
okay so you can practice that at home

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:26.469
