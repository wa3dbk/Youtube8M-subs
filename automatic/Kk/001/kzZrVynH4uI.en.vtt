00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.269
 hello my name is simon of one 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.580
 quali building DE in this video 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.210
 I again on the training cycle 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.490
 enter 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.500
 the training cycle means the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.510
 sequence of workouts like them 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.220
 successive follow one another 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.320
 mistake that is made in my eyes 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.029
 it is often tried that one 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.320
 training schedule in a seven-day week 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.599
 accommodate 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.039
 organized the seven-day week and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.470
 his everyday life and his life completely 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.690
 but it is decisive for our body 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.730
 it is not necessary that we take ours 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.620
 training schedule in seven days scheme 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.210
 press 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.890
 seven days schema means that yourself 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.870
 the workouts every seven days 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.000
 repeat because they are from Monday 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.370
 until sunday all workouts 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.260
 would like to accommodate and next 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.510
 following monday, then, so to speak 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.370
 whole to new starts is good 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.469
 not possible the body demands of 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.329
 Do not you that you in seven days 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.190
 train week in the seventh day theme 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.969
 under some circumstances it is even much 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.920
 meaningful 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.890
 especially in the 3er much more at 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.630
 four split or five do not split that 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.030
 in seven days schema but to make 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.439
 to go beyond this topic and 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.939
 consecutive workouts 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.340
 to have so that the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.320
 workouts maybe all eight 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.900
 Repeat nine or ten days first 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.770
 which advantage is there in the advantage 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.570
 is obvious 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.479
 you are much better off too 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.229
 regenerate you're better yours 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.759
 adjust regeneration times 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.110
 you are not that limited in yours 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.630
 possibilities that means you do not have to 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.180
 all workouts inevitably from 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.740
 monday to sunday accommodate one 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.229
 Another advantage for me as well 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.560
 It is important that it is not always 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.509
 will be possible every monday in the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.490
 studio to go and your breast program 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.750
 to graduate may be that you on 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.640
 monday maybe longer at work 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.320
 you're in school for a long time or longer 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.350
 have to do in the afternoon or still 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.000
 an important appointment 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.460
 so that you will not be able to 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.780
 on this monday for training too 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.070
 go and get a boost program 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.140
 for example 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.610
 the result would be that you maybe am 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.290
 Wednesday then gestures back to water 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.880
 But then make the back program and 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.470
 It will deliberately fall off program too 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.820
 not repeated so this 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.709
 training unit is lost and 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.300
 Make her shapes following 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.860
 Monday happens exactly the same again 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.400
 this training session is also possible 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.140
 lost 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.760
 and where does it grow again on wednesday? 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.069
 same scheme to train on 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.959
 and would then on the duration, so to speak 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.360
 always a monday to lose and 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.830
 this, of course, also somewhere 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.930
 training unit so a muscle group 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.880
 always leave out if you are not in the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.190
 It can be very 7-day shining 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.110
 be good that Monday is your day off 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.430
 the first in the following week 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.080
 on tuesday or wednesday the breast 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.450
 is trained again so that you do not 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.910
 Can clearly say Monday chest day 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.069
 noon on Wednesdays back day and so on 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.630
 Further the advantage is obvious 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.069
 you are unusual in a position 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.410
 to repeat workouts 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.269
 You will be able to regenerate so 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.860
 as your body demands of her when 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.630
 you just notice the last one 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.090
 training session had been so tough 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.680
 that I'm not back to training 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.450
 I can just go and have one more 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.980
 need more day to regenerate 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.079
 then it would have to be able to 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.540
 that means you do not go rigid 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.549
 After a training plan on paper 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.560
 and you just blindly folk 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.420
 but belong to the body 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.760
 you can really read the signals of 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.500
 body, for example, muscle soreness 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.959
 clearly interpret and can say no me 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.329
 let go I'll get mine tomorrow 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.620
 program for one of those who 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.660
 do not know exactly how I do 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.910
 my what the difference is 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.380
 the difference between the seven days 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.049
 stand and not the seven-day scheme 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.880
 it's just that you're at seven 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.840
 days china tries all the units one 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.390
 week to accommodate 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.730
 Mondays the chest day Wednesdays you have 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.980
 your back day on friday you have 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.150
 your next training session and the 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.209
 Also tied to the day again 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.720
 if you do not have seven days china 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.220
 then you have a sequence of 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.530
 Workouts of muscle groups and 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.609
 that means that they do not belong to one 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.500
 weekday are tied 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.530
 that means you know exactly my next one 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.140
 workout 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.620
 bridges are but you just can not 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.260
 say 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.400
 I always press on Wednesdays 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.140
 think the advantage is clear 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.970
 You do not have to have your training plan in 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.410
 seven days to write that 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.850
 no one before your body is the one 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.430
 last idea will be that 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.690
 so I try to have a bit 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.569
 to make independent and just stop 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.959
 the signals of his body gives the 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.880
 Regeneration times the body 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.889
 you would like to see 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.970
 muscle building then it works wonderfully so 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.980
 I hope I was fine with you now 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.450
 explain why it is not so important 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.460
 in a stiff seven-day scheme 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.500
 train but a free sequence 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.540
 to have workouts for you 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.850
 it's best to do it better 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.350
 can regenerate is unbound and 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.520
 even in the situation are fancy 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.560
 training sessions 11:00 am to 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.330
 repeat the following day so far 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.460
 this little part of my series for 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.540
 theme training plans study still mine 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.250
 other videos 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.780
 if you liked this video 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.700
 I'm glad if you like me and one 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.410
 give positive rating that was s then 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.410
 many greetings simon
