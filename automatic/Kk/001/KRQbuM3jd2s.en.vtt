00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.799
 the traditional refreshing based drink 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.020
 in medium-term corn is what it tastes 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.180
 to make Mr. Manuel Ornelas GÃ³mez that 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.519
 over 60 years he has managed to catch 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.440
 with the authentic flavor inherited from the 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.630
 Huichol indigenous the owner of the 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.460
 recipe better known as don marcelino 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.410
 says he started selling in a 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.140
 Street trolley in a pewter pot 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.599
 with 10 liters of tejuino now sells more 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.480
 of 100 liters per day convinces me in a 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.390
 cart down the street in stations 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.370
 then here on the street of Jesus and 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.530
 angle of different states of the country 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.600
 visit the fourth municipal market 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.640
 centenary just to prove the tejuino 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.739
 that prepared in marcelino noted in addition 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.109
 one of the difficulties he suffered 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.109
 when he started selling the good tejuino 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.969
 the difficulty that I had that I had was 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:53.390
 what better was I there in my 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.739
 cart the ones from the town hall me 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.050
 they removed 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.409
 but I was turning them around the corner 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.820
 I turned around like that and I came to a stop 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:05.260
 They believed that I had already left 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.030
 until the last eyebrow 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.400
 and surely they realized that 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.920
 badly turned around and the last one 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.290
 they lifted a cart the yew recipe 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.330
 and it does not consist in sewing the corn after 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.790
 is milled in a mill to get the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.680
 mass which is then diluted with water and 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.020
 kitchen with piloncillo taking as 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.570
 result a jam and it is served 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.900
 adding well crushed ice salt and lemon 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.340
 Don Marcelino is originally from Zacatecas 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.460
 he learned to do tejuino for his uncle 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.710
 27 years old is now 86 years old 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.750
 and now his whole family makes up the 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.710
 business commented that one of the locals 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:46.380
 where he started he bought it for good 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.380
 I do not know how much 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.690
 and I said that he no longer pays rent so 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:58.350
 soon after three or four years of 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.439
 I'll be there he says he hears me martial no 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.390
 The more you owe me, the more you choose 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.640
 So, therefore, choose everything because it 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.310
 saw 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.100
 give me give me windows numbers and now 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.800
 we are at hand says it came out as a gift 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.959
 who says local is don marcelino was 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.970
 called the corn shaman 2013 by 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.680
 the secretariat of culture of Jalisco says 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.740
 that prepares and ferments from one day to the next 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.370
 the tejuino shares the recipe the secret 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.350
 It is what I do not, because I do not have 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.340
 secrets more than the something the tejuino and 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.340
 they like it and they keep coming
