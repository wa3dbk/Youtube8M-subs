00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.660
 to receive me in their homes then yes 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.170
 I know I have this chickpea here 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.470
 which is already cooked I have approximately 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:23.119
 a cup the chickpea the requirement 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.550
 necessary is to let it soak without more or 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.079
 less about 12 hours that I put you 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.659
 in the night and the next day it 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:33.500
 lift and say good it 's time to cook it 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:35.540
 Believe me it's going to be sewn so softly that 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.790
 anyone who has never eaten 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.970
 chickpea will like it realizes not 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.690
 I have not played because I'm going to put 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.010
 water in this preparation in the blender 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.930
 You may add some liquid 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.950
 Now that I 'm going to do, I 'm going to put here 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:56.090
 cornmeal 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:01:00.740
 this is wheat flour we are going to 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.180
 mix we integrate very well to leave 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.300
 some granites but there are no 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.520
 problem so let's put water the 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.010
 necessary and how to know what is the 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.460
 necessary you have to hydrate very well 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:17.360
 corn flour combined with wheat 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.060
 if you let rest in a moment it 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.729
 will realize that it is again hard and 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.430
 you will realize that you will need water 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.770
 therefore it is convenient to rest a 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.040
 half an hour will be fine and already flour 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.759
 it tells us that we both need 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.280
 hydrate again hernán the grandmothers 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.619
 know what they were doing they took a 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.320
 little each time they kneaded they got wet 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.290
 hands and began to tortear so 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.020
 this was what he did very well then 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.430
 what to do the gorditas good 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.979
 First of all, see the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.530
 consistency was perfect then 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.440
 let's make the gorditas with tortillas 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.870
 where we see that they have to 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.320
 get chubby like that 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.830
 let's do them this way let's 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.229
 put to cook then we turn and already we 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.380
 is a chubby ready to fill and 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.740
 we have some gorditas in local 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.680
 close here are commercial gorditas and 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.770
 believe me they put pork in 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.680
 salsa verde el chicharrón el chorizo ​​with 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.840
 potatoes the chorizo ​​with egg and I think 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.150
 depends on the time they are consumed 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.180
 there you can put the little egg on 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.640
 little egg in so many ways so we have 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.980
 great variety of fillings and I will 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.330
 I was talking about those scare cymbals 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.720
 that you prepare that you are staying 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.140
 Well surely there will be something there that 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.750
 It was left over and you can use it as 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.150
 filling 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.360
 to prepare gorditas with chickpeas 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.660
 we need 2 cups of corn flour 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:59.140
 a cup of chickpea cooked a quarter 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:05.010

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.040
 important that you open here is 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.310
 important that the knife introduce you 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.980
 to the bottom and make a kind of 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.349

 put beef steak introduce 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.440
 we feel the knife where it goes 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.079
 walking so carefully there is a 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.230
 little bit hot knows that we just 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.100
