00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
put the whole scheme together because

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.170 
put the whole scheme together because
now<00:02:11.220> we<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.580> know<00:02:11.700> seven<00:02:12.000> different

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
now we have you know seven different

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.820 
now we have you know seven different
phone<00:02:12.480> wait<00:02:12.660> formations<00:02:13.319> out<00:02:13.440> there

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
phone wait formations out there

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.560 
phone wait formations out there
and<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.700> know<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.850> lot<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.090> different<00:02:15.390> plays

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
and you know a lot of different plays

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.230 
and you know a lot of different plays
and<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.890> film<00:02:17.100> rooms<00:02:17.310> really<00:02:17.550> do<00:02:17.760> put<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
and so the film rooms really do put the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.240 
and so the film rooms really do put the
concepts<00:02:18.750> together<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.290> make<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.440> where<00:02:19.710> you

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
concepts together and make it where you

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.830 
concepts together and make it where you
know<00:02:20.400> what's<00:02:20.580> going<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.240> really<00:02:21.720> do<00:02:21.780> you

know what's going on I really do you

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.970 
know what's going on I really do you
think<00:02:22.020> that's<00:02:22.200> what<00:02:22.350> separates<00:02:22.710> us<00:02:22.920> from

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
think that's what separates us from

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.210 
think that's what separates us from
anybody<00:02:23.730> else<00:02:23.910> we<00:02:24.180> don't<00:02:24.330> just<00:02:24.510> put<00:02:24.690> out<00:02:25.220> you

can bump them down the field as you can
see<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.880> with<00:02:48.030> pretty<00:02:48.660> relatively<00:02:49.230> ease<00:02:49.670> this

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
see it with pretty relatively ease this

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.370 
see it with pretty relatively ease this
game<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.240> different<00:02:51.480> than<00:02:51.660> any<00:02:51.900> other<00:02:51.990> past

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
Madden's took a little while to get used

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.780 
Madden's took a little while to get used
to<00:02:54.380> for<00:02:55.380> me<00:02:55.530> more<00:02:55.800> so<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.010> defense<00:02:56.610> because

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
to for me more so on defense because

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.460 
to for me more so on defense because
once<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.090> figured<00:02:57.390> out<00:02:57.510> listen<00:02:57.840> can't<00:02:58.230> pass

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
once I figured out listen can't pass

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.610 
once I figured out listen can't pass
lead<00:02:58.800> some<00:02:59.550> of<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.700> different<00:02:59.970> at<00:03:00.060> different

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
lead some of the different at different

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.290 
lead some of the different at different
routes<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.860> used<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.130> be<00:03:02.220> good<00:03:02.430> out<00:03:02.670> routes

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
routes that used to be good out routes

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.890 
routes that used to be good out routes
or<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.540> lot<00:03:03.660> about<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:04.380> know<00:03:04.500> routes<00:03:04.980> from<00:03:05.250> your

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
or a lot about you know routes from your

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.650 
or a lot about you know routes from your
outside<00:03:06.900> receivers<00:03:07.800> aren't<00:03:08.010> as<00:03:08.160> effective<00:03:08.660> as

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
outside receivers aren't as effective as

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.390 
outside receivers aren't as effective as
previous<00:03:10.140> years<00:03:10.350> have<00:03:10.590> been<00:03:10.770> you<00:03:11.220> know<00:03:11.280> you

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
previous years have been you know you

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.430 
previous years have been you know you
had<00:03:11.520> to<00:03:11.640> adapt<00:03:11.910> your<00:03:12.060> game<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.990> you<00:03:13.230> know<00:03:13.350> it's

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
had to adapt your game and you know it's

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.199 
had to adapt your game and you know it's
exactly<00:03:13.770> what<00:03:13.890> we<00:03:13.920> did<00:03:14.130> I<00:03:14.340> think<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.090> biggest

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
exactly what we did I think the biggest

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.570 
exactly what we did I think the biggest
difference<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.780> defense<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.950> can't<00:03:17.160> run<00:03:17.490> the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
difference is defense you can't run the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.060 
difference is defense you can't run the
same<00:03:17.760> play<00:03:17.970> over<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.209> over<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:19.590> elephant<00:03:19.950> say

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
same play over and over the elephant say

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.160 
same play over and over the elephant say
I<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.430> lot<00:03:20.580> smarter<00:03:20.850> however<00:03:21.600> there<00:03:21.989> are

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
I is a lot smarter however there are

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.710 
I is a lot smarter however there are
definitely<00:03:22.769> definitely<00:03:23.220> gaps<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.150> AI<00:03:24.269> and

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
definitely definitely gaps in the AI and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.770 
definitely definitely gaps in the AI and
we<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.980> know<00:03:26.070> we<00:03:26.190> essentially<00:03:26.910> use<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.630> hell

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
we you know we essentially use the hell

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.090 
we you know we essentially use the hell
out<00:03:27.959> of<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.440> as<00:03:28.560> you'll<00:03:28.739> see<00:03:28.920> in<00:03:29.010> our

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
out of it you as you'll see in our

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.240 
out of it you as you'll see in our
defense<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.489> guide<00:03:29.670> um<00:03:30.019> anyway<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.260> my<00:03:31.950> phone<00:03:32.130> is

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
defense a guide um anyway so my phone is

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.259 
defense a guide um anyway so my phone is
in<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:32.550> game<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:32.880> we're<00:03:33.239> actually

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
in this game is that we're actually

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.060 
in this game is that we're actually
having<00:03:33.570> a<00:03:33.750> close<00:03:34.380> game<00:03:34.620> i<00:03:34.680> think<00:03:34.860> it's<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
having a close game i think it's the

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.800 
having a close game i think it's the
first<00:03:35.280> close<00:03:35.670> game<00:03:35.880> we've<00:03:36.060> had<00:03:36.090> now<00:03:36.390> with<00:03:36.660> the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
first close game we've had now with the
