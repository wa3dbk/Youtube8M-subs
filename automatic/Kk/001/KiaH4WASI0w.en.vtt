00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
outside and shooting around and having

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.420 
outside and shooting around and having
fun<00:00:28.140> well<00:00:29.140> there<00:00:29.230> used<00:00:29.410> to<00:00:29.500> be<00:00:29.680> it<00:00:30.130> used<00:00:30.220> to<00:00:30.340> be

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
fun well there used to be it used to be

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.220 
fun well there used to be it used to be
a<00:00:30.460> tennis<00:00:30.850> court<00:00:31.060> there<00:00:31.360> so<00:00:31.660> they<00:00:31.780> had<00:00:31.900> a<00:00:31.930> fence

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
a tennis court there so they had a fence

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.500 
a tennis court there so they had a fence
and<00:00:32.500> we'd<00:00:32.680> bring<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:33.640> net<00:00:33.789> over<00:00:33.969> there<00:00:34.239> and

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
and we'd bring the net over there and

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.950 
and we'd bring the net over there and
shoot<00:00:35.050> over<00:00:35.320> there<00:00:35.440> so<00:00:35.679> it<00:00:35.739> was<00:00:35.800> a<00:00:35.920> little<00:00:36.039> more

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
shoot over there so it was a little more

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.840 
shoot over there so it was a little more
inconvenient<00:00:37.960> for<00:00:38.140> me<00:00:38.289> to<00:00:38.739> have<00:00:39.309> to<00:00:39.460> work<00:00:39.640> at

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
inconvenient for me to have to work at

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.029 
inconvenient for me to have to work at
doing<00:00:40.059> it<00:00:40.239> but<00:00:40.359> we'd<00:00:40.510> do<00:00:40.690> it

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
doing it but we'd do it

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.369 
doing it but we'd do it
normally<00:00:42.039> I'd<00:00:42.129> never<00:00:42.309> had<00:00:42.519> help<00:00:43.140> picking<00:00:44.140> up

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379
