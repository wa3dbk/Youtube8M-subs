 there is a lot in between 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.090
 This dishwasher is also protected against 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.210
 leaks at the moment that ergs a leak 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.729
 in the machine then it closes the 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.840

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.840
 water not look through your 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.159
 the operation of this dishwasher is one 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.560
 quite simple on the left is the 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.210
 you also see knocking on the display 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.979
 you see it appear on the 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.219

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.070
 button spinning with five positions 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.899
 70 degrees and often for the heavy 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.579
 contaminated dishes because once you eat well 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.920
 then he can 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.960
 so get clean then have the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.640
 automatic mode between 45 and 65 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.170
 degrees we will go something immediately 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.079
 explain in more detail 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.360
 have the eco mode at 50 degrees well that 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.870
 speaks for itself that it is economical 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.840
 position then have the 45 degree dishes 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.340
 us for the little cups and the little ones 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.530
 quantity that he also sees through 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.420
 namely only 33 minutes left 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.069
 and if you want to go for it 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.950
 rinse because you really 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.349
 contaminated dishes then have this position 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.720
 and that takes 15 minutes then have 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.670
 two more functions that so we 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.980
 be delayed start that's this 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.400
 buttons you can determine yourself when you 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.829
 want the dishwasher to run and 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.870
 that is up to twenty-four hours 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.600
 then we also have half the load 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.640
 button was allowed the water was only half there 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.680
 full then use this button then 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.389
 ie ready a little faster and then cut it 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.489
 of course also water and electricity 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:55.250
 take another three warning lights 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.130
 one is for the water supply the other 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.000
 is for salt and other types 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.000
 rinse aid 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.170
 This dishwasher uses the IQ 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.330
 drive motor as a special motor 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.190
 which makes less noise so one 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.090
 piece quieter is also one more time 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.800
 much more economical 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.510
 but also lasts longer 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.060
 then the water was 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.440
 We put the tablet here in the container 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.850
 we do so down if you after 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.350
 To open the container , press it 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.610
 dark gray button so that you are there again 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.440
 at may 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.239
 but what we wanted to study 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.830
 dishwasher uses the 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.230
 dosing assistant 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.450
 which means it was allowed to top you 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.989
 Dishwasher is not covered by Dennis 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.660
 in 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.040
 worth somewhere skin so that it is constant 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.970
 the nicely taught 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.200
 it all picks up making that 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.200
 optimally cleans 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.580
 this dishwasher use two 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.280
 drawers the bottom drawer 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.230
 there you could even signs are so 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.600
 you could fold down 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.610
 so that you can also lose the pans here 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.209
 It is also a cutlery basket that is completely 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.769
 loose and you would be straight 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.450
 the cutlery can put the ring but you 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.040
 could also make it a little bigger 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.540
 maastricht turnover, they are just for a moment 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.150
 somewhat easier 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.390
 the top drawer is for the small one 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.220
 plates or the small glasses 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.930
 if you had some larger glasses we could 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.640
 can also put sashimi against it 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.590
 if they are very large then we can 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.660
 these also fill siege 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.220
 the top floor is also still in height 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.360
 to adjust if you were already extra 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.789
 have glasses 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.520
 take it out for a moment with smooth 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:31.520
 on the other rolls 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.580
 and that way you have something extra 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.770
 space at the top 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.130
 so if you really had very tall glasses 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.130
 to have 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.110
 then at the bottom left the salt is against 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.610
 the lime scale 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.110
 make sure that it is always neatly filled 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.070
 if you do not use the 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.440

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.570

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.250
 maybe filter the arrows on my 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.199
 dear and turns left then you can do it 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.280
 and can take it out 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.949
 make you once a week 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.270
 briefly clean if you do 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.380
 effort 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.460
 please note that the 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.889
 arrows are facing each other again 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.229
 so that it is ready for use here 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.669
 then go into the dishwasher tablet 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.530
 you don't use one 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.830
 all-in-one 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.090
 tablets then here the box for it 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.800
 rinse aid that you fill afterwards 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.870
 types of glasses optimal 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.789
 shine this dishwasher make use of 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.500
 2 spray heads 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.930
 one is at the bottom of the top 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.729
 drawer we also see the holes on it 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.370
 He also splashed to the center to 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.530
 down and then at the bottom in the 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.720
 bottom is also a spray head 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.759
 we also recommend one in the month 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.770
 just remove the spray heads and 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:45.110
 has to see if the holes are still beautiful 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.160
 being open that way very worried 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.110
 this dishwasher 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.370
 this boy optimally cleans you 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.449
 also up to date with the digital 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.400
 display 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.240
 how long it will take for the program 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.240
 what you have chosen 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.680
 the great thing about this dishwasher is that it 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.750
 also has an anti-fingerprint coating 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.460
 so tomorrow the children and with a halma 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.889
 sit remains the front and missed 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.590
 neatly you could use it 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.530
 auto program there are sensors in the 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.780
 machine that measures how much your horse is 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.849
 when it is not dirty than he is 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.250
 so ready faster and the moment that 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:22.169
 he that dirty there is yes then it still grabs 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.970
 just one extra time 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.440
 therefore there is often always clean and 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.440
 never ask for much energy 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.360
 and
