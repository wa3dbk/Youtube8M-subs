added and also to give people who

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.870 
added and also to give people who
haven't<00:00:13.019> had<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.290> chance<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:14.040> try<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.400> on<00:00:14.610> live

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
haven't had a chance to try the on live

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.720 
haven't had a chance to try the on live
version<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.830> little<00:00:16.830> bit<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.010> feeling<00:00:17.520> for<00:00:17.670> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
version a little bit of feeling for the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.330 
version a little bit of feeling for the
game<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.960> case<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.650> haven't<00:00:19.830> tried<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
game so in case you haven't tried the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.620 
game so in case you haven't tried the
game<00:00:22.340> this<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> view<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.880> your<00:00:24.060> ship<00:00:24.269> it's<00:00:24.539> a

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
game this is a view of your ship it's a

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.650 
game this is a view of your ship it's a
cross-section<00:00:25.350> each<00:00:25.500> one<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.830> these<00:00:26.039> rooms

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
cross-section each one of these rooms

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.570 
cross-section each one of these rooms
has<00:00:27.660> its<00:00:27.900> own<00:00:28.050> function<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.740> has<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.949> symbol<00:00:29.429> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
has its own function it has a symbol and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.550 
has its own function it has a symbol and
those<00:00:29.730> functions<00:00:30.179> are<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.560> different

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
those functions are the different

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.440 
those functions are the different
systems<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> ship<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.700> shields<00:00:33.329> and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
systems on the ship so shields and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.870 
systems on the ship so shields and
engines<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.020> oxygen<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.770> medbay<00:00:35.070> all<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
engines and oxygen in medbay all the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.520 
engines and oxygen in medbay all the
various<00:00:36.180> things<00:00:36.420> are<00:00:36.600> necessary<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
various things are necessary to have the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.220 
various things are necessary to have the
ship<00:00:37.710> run<00:00:38.010> each<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.210> these<00:00:39.300> or<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.809> majority

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
ship run each of these or the majority

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.139 
ship run each of these or the majority
of<00:00:40.260> these<00:00:40.410> things<00:00:40.620> take<00:00:40.950> power<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.910> straw

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
of these things take power for straw

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.810 
of these things take power for straw
from<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.780> shared<00:00:43.590> pool<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.190> power<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.700> for

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
from a shared pool of power so for

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.760 
from a shared pool of power so for
example<00:00:45.739> if<00:00:46.739> Id<00:00:47.460> power<00:00:47.879> my<00:00:48.180> shields<00:00:48.719> i<00:00:48.930> would

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
example if Id power my shields i would

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.260 
example if Id power my shields i would
now<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:49.890> more<00:00:50.190> power<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.700> use<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.120> other

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
now have more power to use in other

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.560 
now have more power to use in other
systems<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:53.579> that's<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.940> quick<00:00:53.969> rundown

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
systems so that's just a quick rundown

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.200 
systems so that's just a quick rundown
and<00:00:54.989> I'm<00:00:55.079> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:56.190> play<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.730> bit<00:00:56.760> so

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and I'm going to just play for a bit so

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.720 
and I'm going to just play for a bit so
you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.390> see<00:00:57.980> some<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.280> new<00:00:59.460> stuff<00:00:59.699> that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
you can see some of the new stuff that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:10.429 
you can see some of the new stuff that
we've<00:00:59.969> added<00:01:07.880> well<00:01:08.880> here's<00:01:09.210> not<00:01:10.170> something

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
we've added well here's not something

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.929 
we've added well here's not something
entirely<00:01:10.740> new<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.220> we're<00:01:11.340> inside<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
entirely new but we're inside of a

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.179 
entirely new but we're inside of a
nebula<00:01:12.240> right<00:01:12.540> now<00:01:12.720> what<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.770> means<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
nebula right now what that means the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.840 
nebula right now what that means the
nebula<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.820> um<00:01:16.070> that<00:01:17.070> ok<00:01:17.460> hole<00:01:17.700> with<00:01:17.820> his

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
nebula is um that ok hole with his

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.460 
nebula is um that ok hole with his
borders<00:01:18.330> right<00:01:18.450> now<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:19.229> um<00:01:19.490> in<00:01:20.490> nebulas<00:01:21.470> you

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
borders right now but um in nebulas you

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
borders right now but um in nebulas you
can<00:01:22.710> your<00:01:22.979> sensors<00:01:23.369> don't<00:01:23.520> work<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.060> won't

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
can your sensors don't work so you won't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.640 
can your sensors don't work so you won't
be<00:01:24.450> able<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.110> inside<00:01:25.799> your<00:01:26.070> own<00:01:26.340> ship<00:01:27.650> for

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
be able to see inside your own ship for

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.289 
be able to see inside your own ship for
example<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.159> becomes<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.640> little<00:01:29.790> harrowing

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
example it becomes a little harrowing

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.460 
example it becomes a little harrowing
when<00:01:31.110> there<00:01:31.290> are<00:01:31.470> people<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.130> board<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:32.610> ship

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
when there are people on board your ship

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.429 
when there are people on board your ship
but<00:01:34.470> right<00:01:35.070> now<00:01:35.630> this<00:01:36.630> shouldn't<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.049> too<00:01:37.170> hard

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
but right now this shouldn't be too hard

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.050 
but right now this shouldn't be too hard
to<00:01:37.710> take<00:01:37.950> care

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.610 

so<00:01:44.060> each<00:01:44.210> one<00:01:44.240> of<00:01:44.390> these<00:01:44.510> a<00:01:44.570> little<00:01:44.840> oh<00:01:44.990> i<00:01:45.560> just

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
so each one of these a little oh i just

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.719 
so each one of these a little oh i just
lost<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:46.070> guy

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.039 

except<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:53.760> that<00:01:53.940> little<00:01:54.180> mistake<00:01:54.720> it

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
except for that little mistake it

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.070 
except for that little mistake it
shouldn't<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.710> prom<00:01:56.600> so<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.690> can<00:01:57.930> see

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
shouldn't you be prom so you can see

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.480 
shouldn't you be prom so you can see
most<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.590> the<00:02:00.050> combat<00:02:01.050> stuff<00:02:01.470> on<00:02:01.740> top<00:02:02.010> of<00:02:02.220> ships

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
most of the combat stuff on top of ships

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.330 
most of the combat stuff on top of ships
is<00:02:02.670> pretty<00:02:02.940> simple<00:02:03.210> right<00:02:03.510> now<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:04.340> your

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
is pretty simple right now you just your

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.890 
is pretty simple right now you just your
crew<00:02:05.520> members<00:02:05.909> will<00:02:06.119> automatically<00:02:06.690> fight

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
crew members will automatically fight

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.620 
crew members will automatically fight
anyone<00:02:07.290> using<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.710> same<00:02:07.920> square<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.630> in

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
anyone using the same square of you in

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.600 
anyone using the same square of you in
the<00:02:09.780> same<00:02:09.929> room<00:02:10.110> as<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.800> just<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:11.580> you

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the same room as you and just so you

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.120 
the same room as you and just so you
know<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.819> don't<00:02:12.000> actually<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:13.470> I'm<00:02:13.800> just

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
know I don't actually have I'm just

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.559

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
could be interesting or not too

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.380 
could be interesting or not too
interesting<00:02:19.680> as<00:02:19.800> we<00:02:19.950> go<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.310> email<00:02:21.000> may<00:02:21.209> also

female sprites for your crew members as
well<00:02:26.430> as<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:27.060> section<00:02:27.540> over<00:02:27.720> here<00:02:27.750> before

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
well as this section over here before

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.500 
well as this section over here before
seeing<00:02:28.920> their<00:02:29.160> health<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.550> names<00:02:29.790> little<00:02:30.360> bit

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
seeing their health and names little bit

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.949 
seeing their health and names little bit
easier<00:02:34.010> let<00:02:35.010> me<00:02:35.280> just<00:02:35.700> power<00:02:36.120> my<00:02:36.330> engines<00:02:36.720> and

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
easier let me just power my engines and

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:47.810 
easier let me just power my engines and
get<00:02:37.290> out<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.560> here<00:02:40.130> go<00:02:41.130> ahead<00:02:41.190> an<00:02:41.340> X<00:02:41.459> sector<00:02:46.820> so

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
get out of here go ahead an X sector so

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.670 
get out of here go ahead an X sector so
you<00:02:47.910> can<00:02:48.030> also<00:02:48.180> see<00:02:48.450> on<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.660> ship<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.870> I'm<00:02:49.290> I

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
you can also see on the ship that I'm I

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.790 
you can also see on the ship that I'm I
have<00:02:50.310> two<00:02:50.930> systems<00:02:51.930> on<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.350> ship<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.560> you

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
have two systems on the ship that you

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.140 
have two systems on the ship that you
can't<00:02:52.980> get<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.489> demo<00:02:53.670> right<00:02:53.970> now<00:02:54.090> the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
can't get in the demo right now the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.720 
can't get in the demo right now the
cursed<00:02:54.600> would<00:02:54.840> be<00:02:54.959> cloaking<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.370> second

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
cursed would be cloaking and the second

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.479 
cursed would be cloaking and the second
is<00:02:56.850> teleporting<00:02:57.510> not<00:02:58.049> a<00:02:58.079> teleporter<00:02:58.739> that'll

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
is teleporting not a teleporter that'll

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.930 
is teleporting not a teleporter that'll
be<00:02:59.579> more<00:02:59.760> obvious<00:02:59.910> once<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.930> get<00:03:01.079> into<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.440> battle

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
be more obvious once I get into a battle

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.440 
be more obvious once I get into a battle
but<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.060> purpose<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.690> pretty<00:03:03.989> obviously

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
but the purpose is pretty obviously

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.150 
but the purpose is pretty obviously
alright<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:06.690> here<00:03:06.989> I<00:03:07.170> am<00:03:07.350> getting<00:03:07.769> into<00:03:08.130> a

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
alright so here I am getting into a

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.300 
alright so here I am getting into a
battle<00:03:08.840> um<00:03:09.840> i<00:03:10.739> will<00:03:12.620> i'll<00:03:13.620> use<00:03:13.920> these<00:03:14.100> weapons

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
battle um i will i'll use these weapons

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.220 
battle um i will i'll use these weapons
and<00:03:14.760> also<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.360> know<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.570> can<00:03:15.750> reorder

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
and also so you know you can reorder

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.400 
and also so you know you can reorder
weapons<00:03:16.680> now<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.160> i'll<00:03:17.250> actually<00:03:18.320> you<00:03:19.320> know

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
weapons now and i'll actually you know

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.470 
weapons now and i'll actually you know
control<00:03:19.860> which<00:03:20.640> ones<00:03:20.910> will<00:03:21.120> get<00:03:21.209> shut<00:03:21.450> down

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
control which ones will get shut down

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.259 
control which ones will get shut down
first<00:03:21.989> you<00:03:22.470> know<00:03:22.530> it's<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.769> priority<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.579> power

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
first you know it's a priority and power

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.100 
first you know it's a priority and power
basically<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.590> here<00:03:25.860> if<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.780> power<00:03:27.780> up<00:03:27.870> some

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
basically so here if I power up some

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.520 
basically so here if I power up some
shields<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.769> teleport<00:03:29.489> onto<00:03:29.610> their<00:03:29.850> ship

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
shields and teleport onto their ship

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.830 
shields and teleport onto their ship
this<00:03:31.530> could<00:03:31.739> be<00:03:31.769> bad<00:03:32.010> so<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:33.360> can<00:03:33.480> teleport

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
this could be bad so I you can teleport

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.449 
this could be bad so I you can teleport
your<00:03:34.019> own<00:03:34.140> crew<00:03:34.350> members<00:03:34.680> on<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.040> ship<00:03:35.280> and

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
your own crew members on to the ship and

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.060 
your own crew members on to the ship and
let<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:35.970> fight<00:03:36.209> there<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.780> makes<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.920> game

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
let you fight there it makes the game

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.740 
let you fight there it makes the game
considerably<00:03:38.640> more<00:03:38.850> complicated<00:03:39.540> as<00:03:39.720> you

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
considerably more complicated as you

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.410 
considerably more complicated as you
have<00:03:40.049> to<00:03:40.200> deal<00:03:40.440> with<00:03:40.820> more<00:03:41.820> things<00:03:42.150> at<00:03:42.329> the

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
have to deal with more things at the

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.390 
have to deal with more things at the
same<00:03:42.600> time<00:03:42.900> however<00:03:45.890> they<00:03:46.890> actually<00:03:47.220> have<00:03:47.370> a

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
same time however they actually have a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.720 
same time however they actually have a
little<00:03:48.079> the<00:03:49.079> spot<00:03:49.410> right<00:03:49.680> here<00:03:49.709> this<00:03:50.130> drone<00:03:50.459> is

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
little the spot right here this drone is

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.690 
little the spot right here this drone is
a<00:03:51.109> combat<00:03:52.109> drama<00:03:52.410> he<00:03:52.709> will<00:03:52.799> be<00:03:52.950> easily<00:03:53.190> able<00:03:53.370> to

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
a combat drama he will be easily able to

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.009 
a combat drama he will be easily able to
kill<00:03:53.910> us<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:56.000> I<00:03:57.000> need<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.239> teleport<00:03:57.840> back

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
kill us and I need a teleport back

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.349 
kill us and I need a teleport back
because<00:03:58.440> my<00:03:58.650> guys<00:03:58.799> are<00:03:59.010> about<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.280> die<00:03:59.430> he's

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
because my guys are about to die he's

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:06.770 
because my guys are about to die he's
close<00:04:00.630> um

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.580 

excuse<00:04:07.780> me<00:04:07.959> from<00:04:08.170> focusing<00:04:10.380> so<00:04:11.380> I<00:04:11.440> actually

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
excuse me from focusing so I actually

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.930 
excuse me from focusing so I actually
don't<00:04:11.800> have<00:04:11.920> enough<00:04:12.190> crew<00:04:12.370> members<00:04:12.730> to

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
don't have enough crew members to

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.360 
don't have enough crew members to
effectively<00:04:13.569> be<00:04:13.750> able<00:04:14.020> to<00:04:14.200> take<00:04:15.040> them<00:04:15.220> out

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
effectively be able to take them out

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.740 
effectively be able to take them out
like<00:04:15.550> that<00:04:15.819> not<00:04:16.329> me<00:04:16.650> ran<00:04:17.650> away<00:04:17.799> anyway<00:04:21.480> so<00:04:22.480> as

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
like that not me ran away anyway so as

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.330 
like that not me ran away anyway so as
you<00:04:22.840> can<00:04:22.930> see<00:04:23.110> using<00:04:23.380> a<00:04:23.560> teleporter<00:04:24.160> allows

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
you can see using a teleporter allows

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.020 
you can see using a teleporter allows
you<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:25.889> fight<00:04:26.889> on<00:04:27.040> tight<00:04:27.280> on<00:04:27.490> their<00:04:27.760> ship<00:04:28.000> and

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
you to fight on tight on their ship and

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.000 
you to fight on tight on their ship and
so<00:04:28.419> for<00:04:28.750> example<00:04:28.810> if<00:04:29.080> you<00:04:29.230> can<00:04:29.380> kill<00:04:29.560> all<00:04:29.740> the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
so for example if you can kill all the

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.370 
so for example if you can kill all the
crew<00:04:30.250> members<00:04:30.280> you'll<00:04:30.790> take<00:04:31.750> their<00:04:31.960> ship<00:04:32.200> by

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
crew members you'll take their ship by

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.250 
crew members you'll take their ship by
force<00:04:32.440> which<00:04:33.040> actually<00:04:33.280> can<00:04:33.639> give<00:04:33.880> you<00:04:34.000> more

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
force which actually can give you more

rewards<00:04:35.260> especially<00:04:35.950> in<00:04:36.040> some<00:04:36.250> situations

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910

rewards especially in some situations
you<00:04:37.900> may<00:04:38.020> have<00:04:38.110> noticed<00:04:38.380> i'm<00:04:38.500> also<00:04:38.680> using<00:04:39.360> this

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
you may have noticed i'm also using this

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.200 
you may have noticed i'm also using this
i'm<00:04:42.040> not<00:04:42.160> sure<00:04:42.220> if<00:04:42.430> it<00:04:42.520> was<00:04:42.580> in<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:42.729> demo<00:04:42.940> but

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
i'm not sure if it was in the demo but

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.250 
i'm not sure if it was in the demo but

weapon called the ion ion blast and

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.260 
weapon called the ion ion blast and
cannons<00:04:51.220> which<00:04:51.790> they<00:04:52.660> fire<00:04:53.620> a<00:04:53.950> blast<00:04:54.400> of<00:04:54.639> ion

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
cannons which they fire a blast of ion

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.990 
cannons which they fire a blast of ion
and<00:04:55.479> the<00:04:55.690> energy<00:04:55.900> which<00:04:56.500> disables<00:04:57.250> a<00:04:57.639> system

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
and the energy which disables a system

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.580 
and the energy which disables a system
that<00:04:58.120> hits<00:04:58.450> for<00:04:58.750> a<00:04:58.780> certain<00:04:59.080> amount<00:04:59.260> of<00:04:59.350> time

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
that hits for a certain amount of time

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.909 
that hits for a certain amount of time
based<00:05:00.070> on<00:05:00.280> how<00:05:00.430> much<00:05:00.690> how<00:05:01.690> strong<00:05:02.020> it<00:05:02.200> is<00:05:02.290> so

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
based on how much how strong it is so

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.120 
based on how much how strong it is so
it's<00:05:03.370> useful<00:05:03.580> in<00:05:04.030> situations<00:05:04.240> that<00:05:04.870> you<00:05:05.320> know

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
it's useful in situations that you know

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.500 
it's useful in situations that you know
they<00:05:06.340> would<00:05:06.490> be<00:05:06.610> able<00:05:06.700> to<00:05:06.850> repair<00:05:07.150> it<00:05:07.270> quickly

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
they would be able to repair it quickly

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.510 
they would be able to repair it quickly
and<00:05:07.840> you<00:05:08.140> want<00:05:08.470> to<00:05:08.560> make<00:05:08.680> sure<00:05:08.710> it's<00:05:09.070> disabled

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
and you want to make sure it's disabled

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.219 
and you want to make sure it's disabled
for<00:05:09.669> a<00:05:09.700> time<00:05:09.940> since<00:05:10.270> it<00:05:10.390> just<00:05:10.600> goes<00:05:10.810> away<00:05:10.960> after

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
for a time since it just goes away after

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.230 
for a time since it just goes away after
a<00:05:11.380> short<00:05:11.650> time<00:05:11.830> it's<00:05:12.430> also<00:05:12.640> useful<00:05:12.850> if<00:05:13.150> you

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
a short time it's also useful if you

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.090 
a short time it's also useful if you
want<00:05:13.419> to<00:05:13.539> try<00:05:13.690> and<00:05:13.810> keep<00:05:14.289> the<00:05:14.470> ship<00:05:14.710> alive

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
want to try and keep the ship alive

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.950 
want to try and keep the ship alive
while<00:05:15.940> you're<00:05:16.060> fighting<00:05:16.300> which<00:05:16.630> is<00:05:16.750> really

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
while you're fighting which is really

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.710 
while you're fighting which is really
important<00:05:17.350> when<00:05:17.470> you're<00:05:18.360> teleported<00:05:19.360> on<00:05:19.479> top

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
important when you're teleported on top

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.940 
important when you're teleported on top
of<00:05:19.870> their<00:05:19.990> ship<00:05:20.200> and<00:05:20.380> you're<00:05:20.530> fighting<00:05:20.710> on

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
of their ship and you're fighting on

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.800 
of their ship and you're fighting on
board<00:05:21.220> their<00:05:21.400> ship<00:05:21.580> because<00:05:21.940> uh<00:05:21.970> your<00:05:22.660> crew

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
board their ship because uh your crew

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.540 
board their ship because uh your crew
members<00:05:23.169> will<00:05:23.410> be<00:05:23.590> killed<00:05:23.860> if<00:05:24.039> you<00:05:24.160> destroy

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
members will be killed if you destroy

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.630 
members will be killed if you destroy
the<00:05:24.760> ship<00:05:24.820> while<00:05:25.150> they're<00:05:25.360> still<00:05:25.539> on<00:05:25.690> it<00:05:26.310> I

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.700 

will<00:05:30.640> let's<00:05:31.180> just<00:05:31.690> leave

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.629 

and<00:05:35.710> it<00:05:35.889> looks<00:05:36.069> like<00:05:36.159> here's<00:05:37.030> a<00:05:37.090> ghost<00:05:37.360> ship

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
and it looks like here's a ghost ship

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.429 
and it looks like here's a ghost ship
that<00:05:39.639> has<00:05:39.849> some<00:05:40.300> really<00:05:40.569> damn<00:05:40.840> good<00:05:40.870> weapons

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:41.439 
that has some really damn good weapons

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:44.969 
that has some really damn good weapons
so<00:05:41.860> I<00:05:42.189> will<00:05:42.699> make<00:05:42.879> use<00:05:43.150> of<00:05:43.319> her<00:05:44.319> cloaking<00:05:44.800> this

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
so I will make use of her cloaking this

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.860 
so I will make use of her cloaking this
time<00:05:45.219> and<00:05:45.550> I'm<00:05:45.849> just<00:05:46.090> going<00:05:46.330> to<00:05:46.419> try<00:05:46.509> in<00:05:46.719> the

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
time and I'm just going to try in the

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.459 
time and I'm just going to try in the
States<00:05:47.280> so<00:05:48.280> I<00:05:48.580> paused<00:05:49.120> and<00:05:49.479> I'm<00:05:49.719> the<00:05:50.080> cloaking

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:50.469 
States so I paused and I'm the cloaking

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:52.350 
States so I paused and I'm the cloaking
where<00:05:50.590> does<00:05:50.800> is<00:05:51.039> it<00:05:51.189> me<00:05:51.699> the<00:05:51.879> enemy<00:05:52.120> can't

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
where does is it me the enemy can't

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.510 
where does is it me the enemy can't
target<00:05:52.750> your<00:05:52.990> ship<00:05:53.169> so<00:05:53.979> I<00:05:54.009> made<00:05:54.250> a<00:05:54.280> turn<00:05:54.490> on

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
target your ship so I made a turn on

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.100 
target your ship so I made a turn on
cloaking<00:05:55.030> and<00:05:56.069> so<00:05:57.069> for<00:05:58.000> that<00:05:58.030> short<00:05:58.389> time<00:05:58.659> the

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
cloaking and so for that short time the

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:07.140 
cloaking and so for that short time the
enemy<00:05:59.590> cannot<00:06:02.159> not<00:06:03.159> cheese<00:06:05.580> the<00:06:06.580> enemy<00:06:06.879> cannot

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
enemy cannot not cheese the enemy cannot

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.119 
enemy cannot not cheese the enemy cannot
target<00:06:07.449> me<00:06:07.689> while<00:06:07.870> I'm<00:06:08.050> cloaked<00:06:08.349> and<00:06:08.590> also<00:06:08.919> any

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:09.129 
target me while I'm cloaked and also any

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:12.659 
target me while I'm cloaked and also any
shots<00:06:09.669> fired<00:06:09.849> at<00:06:10.270> that<00:06:10.360> time<00:06:10.629> awesomes<00:06:11.669> this

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
shots fired at that time awesomes this

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:30.820 
shots fired at that time awesomes this
isn't<00:06:13.060> particularly<00:06:13.419> good<00:06:16.110> also

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.290 

one<00:06:31.830> thing<00:06:32.069> you<00:06:32.190> may<00:06:32.340> have<00:06:32.460> also<00:06:32.610> noticed<00:06:32.789> is

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
one thing you may have also noticed is

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.279 
one thing you may have also noticed is
that<00:06:33.330> if<00:06:33.720> the<00:06:34.139> people<00:06:34.470> are<00:06:34.620> working<00:06:34.919> on<00:06:35.190> little

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
that if the people are working on little

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.600 
that if the people are working on little
computers<00:06:37.289> now<00:06:37.500> and<00:06:37.710> they<00:06:37.830> note<00:06:38.039> in<00:06:38.250> all<00:06:38.400> the

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
computers now and they note in all the

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:47.330 
computers now and they note in all the
major<00:06:38.810> systems<00:06:39.810> but<00:06:40.050> its<00:06:40.259> necessary<00:06:42.199> geez<00:06:46.340> I'm

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
major systems but its necessary geez I'm

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:57.730 
major systems but its necessary geez I'm
just<00:06:47.520> trying<00:06:47.699> to<00:06:47.880> escape<00:06:48.060> at<00:06:48.360> this<00:06:48.509> point

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.860 

so<00:06:58.699> it<00:06:58.759> looks<00:06:58.789> like<00:06:58.940> I<00:06:59.090> put<00:06:59.270> out<00:06:59.360> the<00:06:59.479> fire<00:06:59.690> and

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
so it looks like I put out the fire and

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:06.939 
so it looks like I put out the fire and
I<00:07:00.050> can<00:07:00.440> get<00:07:00.650> away<00:07:00.889> on<00:07:01.430> that<00:07:02.030> crazy<00:07:02.479> ship<00:07:02.900> I<00:07:05.949> into

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:06.949 
I can get away on that crazy ship I into

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:10.350 
I can get away on that crazy ship I into
a<00:07:07.280> fight<00:07:08.030> in<00:07:08.330> an<00:07:08.479> asteroid<00:07:08.870> field<00:07:09.110> great<00:07:09.620> and

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 
a fight in an asteroid field great and

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.330 
a fight in an asteroid field great and
there's<00:07:11.360> also<00:07:11.539> borders<00:07:12.020> as<00:07:12.199> well<00:07:12.410> so<00:07:13.160> I'm

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 
there's also borders as well so I'm

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.870 
there's also borders as well so I'm
going<00:07:13.759> to<00:07:13.789> try<00:07:14.599> and<00:07:14.720> blood<00:07:15.440> this<00:07:15.650> area<00:07:16.039> of

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 
going to try and blood this area of
