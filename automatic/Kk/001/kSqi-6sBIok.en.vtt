perfectly as always by cannon on the
bottom<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.740> can<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.369> cannot<00:01:23.610> only

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
bottom you can see that we cannot only

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.280 
bottom you can see that we cannot only
change<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> battery<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.110> use<00:01:25.229> a
