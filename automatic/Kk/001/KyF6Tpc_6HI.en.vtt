functions here if you want to create a

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.779 
functions here if you want to create a
route<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:57.899> instance<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.160> push<00:00:59.399> there

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
route for instance you just push there

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.429 
route for instance you just push there
and<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.660> very<00:01:00.870> easy<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:02.809> do<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.350> then

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
and it's very easy just do that and then

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.859 
and it's very easy just do that and then
you<00:01:04.769> go<00:01:04.920> active<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.640> actually<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.750> do

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
you go active and actually you can do

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.310 
you go active and actually you can do
that<00:01:07.640> planning<00:01:08.640> at<00:01:09.150> home<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.810> then<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.140> can

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
that planning at home and then you can

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.260 
that planning at home and then you can
activate<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.950> when<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.520> come<00:01:11.700> down<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.119> about

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
activate it when you come down and about

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.640 
activate it when you come down and about
that<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.570> go<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.200> all<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> boats

and you have all these maps installed

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.170 
and you have all these maps installed
locally<00:01:16.560> here<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.640> don't<00:01:17.880> need<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
locally here so you don't need to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.600 
locally here so you don't need to
connect<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.930> internet<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.619> get<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.460> be

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
connect it to the internet to get to be
