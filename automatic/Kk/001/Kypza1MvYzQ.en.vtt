00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.109
 Good morning, we start today with the 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.609
 images of a video that shows 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.899
 good part of what happened in the 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.269
 Philadelphia International Airport 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.129
 when the Mexican team was ready 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.440
 to return to the city of mexico 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.150
 what we see on the screen are the 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.699
 images taken with a cell phone 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.490
 there we see christian martinoli being 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.890
 pushed by the one they describe in the 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.170
 Video as the daughter of Miguel Herrera 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.029
 coach of the Mexican national team we see 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.039
 members of the coaching staff and to own 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.750
 miguel herrera changing next to luís 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.309
 Garcia another sportscaster from the 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.559
 Aztec TV chain 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.660
 where he was headed apparently 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.960
 involved his daughter to this commentator 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.090
 sporting that then claims to have been 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.610
 assaulted by the technical director of the 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.590
 Mexican selection in a video too 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.879
 what are we going to see next this is 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.690
 the moment when the daughter of miguel 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:55.510
 herrera claims luís garcía and cachete 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.829
 we saw it there clearly and then it arrives 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.829
 Miguel Herrera with Luis García 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.340
 they have an exchange of words 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.530
 miguelera asks his daughter to keep 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.850
 silence and apparently arranges part of 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.950
 the situation we see some players 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.960
 members of the coaching staff trying to 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.700
 intervene there have an exchange 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.240
 words are trying to narrate because 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.860
 Sound 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.540
 and the video is not enough 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.799
 good to hear exactly what 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.930
 is what they say we are working on 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.340
 we received them some 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.890
 instants but that's why I try to 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.330
 narrate what happened there we see already 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.009
 later to luis garcía walking with 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.119
 Miguel Herrera embraced 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.689
 that is the entrance to the airport 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.649
 philadelphia international and this video 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.899
 this video shows what happens 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.060
 in the security line prior to 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.549
 entrance and waiting rooms for 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.530
 flights there you can see miguel herrera 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.479
 we see Carlos sailing in the video too 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.909
 in the row and on the other side of the row to 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.619
 christian martinoli the commentator 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.209
 sports of the Aztec TV chain that 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.350
 he claims to have been attacked 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.990
 several witnesses confirm this version 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.009
 love and then we see how miguel herrera 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.009
 skip the security lines 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.880
 martinelli keep your hands up 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.899
 after it is again confronted 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.899
 by miguel herrera
