00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
we're gonna go ahead and plug it into

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.170 
we're gonna go ahead and plug it into
the<00:03:10.630> microphone<00:03:10.900> side<00:03:14.160> now<00:03:15.160> that<00:03:15.190> is<00:03:15.550> all<00:03:15.730> set

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
the microphone side now that is all set

the microphone side now that is all set
and<00:03:16.360> now<00:03:17.310> instead<00:03:18.310> of<00:03:18.930> having<00:03:20.070> this<00:03:21.540> 3.5

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
and now instead of having this 3.5

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.850 
and now instead of having this 3.5
millimeter<00:03:22.930> thing<00:03:23.080> which<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.320> hooked<00:03:23.440> up<00:03:23.650> to

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
millimeter thing which is hooked up to

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.430 
millimeter thing which is hooked up to
the<00:03:24.300> speaker<00:03:25.300> being<00:03:25.690> plugged<00:03:26.019> into<00:03:26.230> the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
the speaker being plugged into the

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.470 
the speaker being plugged into the
controller<00:03:26.830> we're<00:03:27.820> going<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.000> take<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.269> out

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
controller we're going to take that out

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.990 
controller we're going to take that out
and<00:03:28.630> plug<00:03:29.440> it<00:03:29.560> into<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.830> non<00:03:30.130> microphone<00:03:30.790> side

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
and plug it into the non microphone side

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.940 
and plug it into the non microphone side
and<00:03:32.430> plug<00:03:33.430> that<00:03:33.550> straight<00:03:33.610> into<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.769> so<00:03:35.769> now

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
and plug that straight into that so now

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.070 
and plug that straight into that so now
we're<00:03:36.340> going<00:03:36.550> to<00:03:36.670> take<00:03:36.910> this<00:03:37.060> end<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.480> put<00:03:37.959> it

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
we're going to take this end and put it

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.190 
we're going to take this end and put it
straight<00:03:38.200> into<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:39.640> ps4<00:03:40.150> controller

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.059 

in<00:03:44.890> this<00:03:45.610> it's<00:03:46.420> a<00:03:46.540> lot<00:03:46.690> of<00:03:46.720> wires<00:03:46.990> but<00:03:47.950> it's

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
in this it's a lot of wires but it's

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.760 
in this it's a lot of wires but it's
pretty<00:03:48.220> easy<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.520> manage<00:03:48.760> actually<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:50.410> this

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
pretty easy to manage actually so this

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.280 
pretty easy to manage actually so this
you<00:03:51.730> are<00:03:52.150> going<00:03:52.330> to<00:03:52.420> have<00:03:52.599> your<00:03:52.720> headset<00:03:52.930> wire

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
you are going to have your headset wire

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.199 
you are going to have your headset wire
coming<00:03:53.980> out<00:03:54.130> this<00:03:54.250> way<00:03:54.430> which<00:03:54.670> you<00:03:54.849> can<00:03:55.030> talk

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
coming out this way which you can talk

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.449 
coming out this way which you can talk
into<00:03:55.390> through<00:03:55.660> your<00:03:55.750> microphone<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:56.470> then

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
into through your microphone and then

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.339 
into through your microphone and then
this<00:03:57.730> way<00:03:58.330> you're<00:03:58.510> going<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.780> have<00:03:58.930> your<00:03:59.080> chat

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
this way you're going to have your chat

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.660 
this way you're going to have your chat
audio<00:03:59.739> if<00:03:59.980> you<00:04:00.130> haven't<00:04:00.400> done<00:04:00.459> in<00:04:00.580> the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
audio if you haven't done in the

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.970 
audio if you haven't done in the
settings<00:04:01.000> going<00:04:01.870> down<00:04:02.050> through<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.470> wire<00:04:02.650> and

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
settings going down through the wire and

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.860 
settings going down through the wire and
into<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:04.090> speaker<00:04:04.420> where<00:04:04.600> it's<00:04:04.750> being

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
into the speaker where it's being

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.530 
into the speaker where it's being
received<00:04:05.470> by<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:06.160> microphone<00:04:06.640> or<00:04:06.940> your

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
received by the microphone or your

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.040 
received by the microphone or your
computer's<00:04:07.959> microphone<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:09.310> that<00:04:09.550> is

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
computer's microphone and that is

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.360 
computer's microphone and that is
probably<00:04:11.050> the<00:04:11.350> easiest<00:04:11.530> way<00:04:11.980> to<00:04:12.010> do<00:04:12.220> it

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
probably the easiest way to do it

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.630 
probably the easiest way to do it
without<00:04:12.519> an<00:04:13.090> elgato<00:04:13.599> got<00:04:14.440> a<00:04:14.470> screen<00:04:15.340> capture

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
without an elgato got a screen capture

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.080 
without an elgato got a screen capture
