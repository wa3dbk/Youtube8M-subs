to ask myself is it worth the price you

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.690 
to ask myself is it worth the price you
can<00:00:10.290> go<00:00:10.380> online<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.920> look<00:00:10.980> at<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.190> technical

and<00:00:14.099> see<00:00:14.280> which<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:15.000> has<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.240> options<00:00:15.750> that

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
and see which one has the options that

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.450 
and see which one has the options that
work<00:00:16.080> for<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.440> but<00:00:16.680> today<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.949> wanted<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.340> look

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
work for you but today I wanted to look

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.310 
work for you but today I wanted to look
at<00:00:17.580> something<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.420> isn't<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:18.900> those<00:00:19.080> sheets

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
at something that isn't on those sheets

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.620

and<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.220> image<00:00:20.550> quality<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:21.150> wanted<00:00:21.539> to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
and that is image quality I wanted to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.359 
and that is image quality I wanted to
look<00:00:21.720> at<00:00:21.869> areas<00:00:22.050> like<00:00:22.230> banding<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.039> fixed

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369

random<00:00:26.250> noise<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.430> see<00:00:26.820> which<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.330> these

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
random noise to see which of these

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.019 
random noise to see which of these
cameras<00:00:27.990> perform<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.590> best<00:00:28.740> also<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.789> few

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
cameras perform the best also have a few

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.330 
cameras perform the best also have a few
words<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.390> share<00:00:30.420> about<00:00:30.720> autofocus<00:00:31.500> at<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
words to share about autofocus at the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.799 
words to share about autofocus at the
conclusion<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:32.969> video<00:00:33.300> but<00:00:33.510> for<00:00:33.690> now

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
conclusion of this video but for now

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.119 
conclusion of this video but for now
let's<00:00:34.530> get<00:00:34.649> straight<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> test<00:00:35.340> images

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
let's get straight to the test images

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.260 
let's get straight to the test images
it's<00:00:38.129> going<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> be<00:00:38.489> difficult<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.149> to

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
it's going to be difficult for you to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.410 
it's going to be difficult for you to
tell<00:00:39.450> which<00:00:40.200> camera<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.710> superior<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.640> these

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
tell which camera is superior in these

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.810 
tell which camera is superior in these
circumstances<00:00:42.980> just<00:00:43.980> with<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> video<00:00:44.460> with<00:00:44.789> a

circumstances just with a video with a
lower<00:00:45.030> resolution<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.870> I've<00:00:46.140> uploaded<00:00:46.649> these

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039

please<00:01:01.199> note<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.469> we're<00:01:01.680> testing<00:01:01.829> three

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
please note that we're testing three

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.560 
please note that we're testing three
different<00:01:02.609> cameras<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.210> three<00:01:03.449> different

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
different cameras with three different

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.630 
different cameras with three different
pixel<00:01:04.080> densities<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.619> three<00:01:05.309> different

pixel densities and three different

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.910 
pixel densities and three different
resolutions<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.780> I've<00:01:06.990> decided<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.500> do<00:01:07.710> all<00:01:07.890> of

camera<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:41.610> you're<00:01:41.759> looking<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.090> now<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
camera what you're looking at now is the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.630 
camera what you're looking at now is the
first<00:01:42.720> full-size<00:01:43.350> test<00:01:43.710> image<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.280> not

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
first full-size test image it's not

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.830 
first full-size test image it's not
doing<00:01:45.060> us<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.270> lot<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.509> good

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
doing us a lot of good

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.539 
doing us a lot of good
so<00:01:45.960> let's<00:01:46.140> punch<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.860> see<00:01:47.100> what<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.340> have

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
so let's punch in and see what we have

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.190 
so let's punch in and see what we have
this<00:01:48.000> first<00:01:48.299> image<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> starting<00:01:49.170> point

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
this first image is a starting point

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.950 
this first image is a starting point
basically<00:01:49.979> for<00:01:50.490> all<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.210> cameras<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.810> is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
basically for all the cameras this is

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.889 
basically for all the cameras this is
ISO<00:01:52.350> 1600<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.640> when<00:01:53.759> DX<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> top<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
ISO 1600 but when DX is on the top the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.380 
ISO 1600 but when DX is on the top the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750

just<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:13.830> little<00:02:14.040> bit<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.280> edge<00:02:14.400> goes<00:02:14.640> to

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
just a little bit of the edge goes to

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.120 
just a little bit of the edge goes to
the<00:02:14.940> 1dx<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:16.260> seems<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.620> be<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.980> slightly

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
the 1dx that seems to be just slightly

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.460 
the 1dx that seems to be just slightly
better<00:02:17.550> but<00:02:17.850> basically<00:02:18.720> irrelevant<00:02:19.410> I

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
better but basically irrelevant I

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.990 
better but basically irrelevant I
believe<00:02:19.710> once<00:02:19.920> these<00:02:20.160> image<00:02:20.460> files<00:02:20.730> are

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
believe once these image files are

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.300 
believe once these image files are
cleaned<00:02:21.510> up<00:02:21.660> with<00:02:21.840> noise<00:02:22.080> reduction<00:02:22.310> you

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
cleaned up with noise reduction you

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.410 
cleaned up with noise reduction you
wouldn't<00:02:23.580> be<00:02:23.640> able<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.880> tell<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.120> difference

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
wouldn't be able to tell the difference

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.260 
wouldn't be able to tell the difference
between<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.900> two<00:02:25.520> well<00:02:26.520> this<00:02:26.670> next<00:02:26.880> image<00:02:27.060> is

the top and have the 5d mark 3 on the
bottom<00:02:33.660> now<00:02:34.050> as<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.260> said<00:02:34.320> in<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.680> intro<00:02:34.950> we're

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
bottom now as I said in the intro we're

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.650 
bottom now as I said in the intro we're
comparing<00:02:35.580> cameras<00:02:36.210> with<00:02:36.360> two<00:02:36.510> different

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
comparing cameras with two different

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.960 
comparing cameras with two different
resolutions<00:02:37.350> here<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:37.860> they're<00:02:38.400> not<00:02:38.580> entirely

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
resolutions here so they're not entirely

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.900 
resolutions here so they're not entirely
equal<00:02:39.600> however<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.440> think<00:02:40.560> with<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.370> results

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
equal however I think with the results

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.030 
equal however I think with the results
being<00:02:42.300> as<00:02:42.480> close<00:02:42.750> as<00:02:42.990> they<00:02:43.170> are<00:02:43.320> it's<00:02:43.650> really

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
being as close as they are it's really

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.770 
being as close as they are it's really
not<00:02:44.160> worth<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.580> trouble<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.970> downsample<00:02:45.690> the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
not worth the trouble to downsample the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.770 
not worth the trouble to downsample the
5d<00:02:46.140> Mark<00:02:46.170> 3<00:02:46.410> images<00:02:46.740> to<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.190> same<00:02:47.400> size<00:02:47.670> as<00:02:47.940> the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
5d Mark 3 images to the same size as the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.720 
5d Mark 3 images to the same size as the
1<00:02:48.930> DX<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.560> think<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.890> results<00:02:50.220> are<00:02:50.250> very<00:02:50.430> close

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
1 DX I think the results are very close

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.250 
1 DX I think the results are very close
you<00:02:50.880> can<00:02:51.030> see<00:02:51.060> slightly<00:02:51.570> more<00:02:51.750> chroma<00:02:51.990> noise

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
you can see slightly more chroma noise

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.410 
you can see slightly more chroma noise
on<00:02:52.590> part<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.250> 5d<00:02:53.550> Mark<00:02:53.760> 3<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.150> bottom

the<00:02:54.810> 1<00:02:54.990> DX<00:02:55.230> just<00:02:55.470> looks<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:55.920> handle<00:02:56.280> noise

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
the 1 DX just looks to handle noise

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.720 
the 1 DX just looks to handle noise
better<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.570> darker<00:02:57.959> areas<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.730> again

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
better in the darker areas and again

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.970 
better in the darker areas and again
have<00:02:59.910> them<00:03:00.030> 1d<00:03:00.450> mark<00:03:00.720> 4<00:03:01.020> on<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.470> bottom<00:03:01.800> in

have them 1d mark 4 on the bottom in

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.199 
have them 1d mark 4 on the bottom in

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
this frame and the 1 DX still on top and

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.720 
this frame and the 1 DX still on top and
you'd<00:03:06.209> say<00:03:06.480> maybe<00:03:07.320> a<00:03:07.440> one-stop<00:03:08.040> advantage<00:03:08.610> at

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
you'd say maybe a one-stop advantage at

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.070 
you'd say maybe a one-stop advantage at
this<00:03:08.880> point<00:03:09.209> 2/3<00:03:09.900> -<00:03:10.140> 1<00:03:10.170> stop<00:03:11.209> goes<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.540> 1<00:03:12.720> DX

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.230 
this point 2/3 - 1 stop goes to the 1 DX
on<00:03:13.380> top<00:03:13.860> just<00:03:14.550> because<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.000> way<00:03:15.120> it

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
on top just because of the way it

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.300 
on top just because of the way it
handles<00:03:15.570> chroma<00:03:15.870> noise<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.470> because<00:03:17.190> you

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
handles chroma noise and because you

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.740

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
the 5d Mark 3 and 1d mark 4 but again

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.970 
the 5d Mark 3 and 1d mark 4 but again
the<00:05:00.660> results<00:05:00.990> of<00:05:01.080> this<00:05:01.170> test<00:05:01.380> are<00:05:01.620> really<00:05:01.860> only

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
the results of this test are really only

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.350 
the results of this test are really only
relevant<00:05:02.460> to<00:05:02.490> those<00:05:02.670> of<00:05:02.850> us<00:05:02.970> who<00:05:03.150> are<00:05:03.240> out

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
relevant to those of us who are out

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.480 
relevant to those of us who are out
there<00:05:03.600> shooting<00:05:04.140> long<00:05:04.500> exposures<00:05:05.130> at<00:05:05.340> high

ISO<00:05:06.180> so<00:05:06.800> in<00:05:07.800> conclusion<00:05:07.980> what<00:05:08.550> I<00:05:08.580> saw<00:05:08.880> from

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
ISO so in conclusion what I saw from

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.970 
ISO so in conclusion what I saw from
these<00:05:09.270> test<00:05:09.570> images<00:05:09.960> is<00:05:10.110> that<00:05:10.410> these<00:05:10.590> cameras

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
these test images is that these cameras

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.100 
these test images is that these cameras
perform<00:05:11.340> very<00:05:11.700> similarly<00:05:12.180> under<00:05:12.720> what<00:05:13.020> you

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
perform very similarly under what you

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.230 
perform very similarly under what you
might<00:05:13.290> call<00:05:13.470> normal<00:05:14.160> shooting<00:05:14.520> circumstances

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
might call normal shooting circumstances

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.390 
might call normal shooting circumstances
the<00:05:15.930> one<00:05:16.110> day<00:05:16.230> mark<00:05:16.410> 4<00:05:16.590> starts<00:05:16.920> to<00:05:17.040> lag<00:05:17.220> behind

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
the one day mark 4 starts to lag behind

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.640 
the one day mark 4 starts to lag behind
a<00:05:17.640> little<00:05:17.880> bit<00:05:17.970> at<00:05:18.090> ISO<00:05:18.390> 1600<00:05:18.840> from<00:05:19.380> the<00:05:19.500> other

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
a little bit at ISO 1600 from the other

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.520 
a little bit at ISO 1600 from the other
two<00:05:19.890> mostly<00:05:20.820> due<00:05:20.940> to<00:05:20.970> luminance<00:05:21.480> noise<00:05:21.540> but

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
two mostly due to luminance noise but

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.380 
two mostly due to luminance noise but
one<00:05:22.680> DX<00:05:23.010> is<00:05:23.190> the<00:05:23.220> clear<00:05:23.610> winner<00:05:23.640> if<00:05:24.090> you<00:05:24.240> want

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
one DX is the clear winner if you want

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.390 
one DX is the clear winner if you want
to<00:05:24.450> talk<00:05:24.570> about<00:05:24.630> latitude<00:05:25.500> in<00:05:25.680> the<00:05:25.770> shadows<00:05:26.190> or

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
to talk about latitude in the shadows or

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.150 
to talk about latitude in the shadows or
fixed<00:05:27.000> pattern<00:05:27.330> noise<00:05:27.540> so<00:05:28.200> if<00:05:28.530> you're

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
fixed pattern noise so if you're

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.910 
fixed pattern noise so if you're
shooting<00:05:29.370> high<00:05:30.000> ISO<00:05:30.600> over<00:05:31.080> long<00:05:31.260> exposures<00:05:31.890> a

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
shooting high ISO over long exposures a

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.100 
shooting high ISO over long exposures a
lot<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.340> 1<00:05:32.550> DX<00:05:32.790> is<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.420> clear<00:05:33.660> winner<00:05:33.690> it's

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
lot the 1 DX is the clear winner it's

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.480 
lot the 1 DX is the clear winner it's
going<00:05:34.350> to<00:05:34.410> give<00:05:34.560> you<00:05:34.650> a<00:05:34.710> much<00:05:34.890> cleaner<00:05:35.160> file

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
going to give you a much cleaner file

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.790 
going to give you a much cleaner file
but<00:05:36.120> other<00:05:36.270> than<00:05:36.480> that<00:05:36.540> the<00:05:37.320> ISO<00:05:37.650> performance

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
but other than that the ISO performance

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.370 
but other than that the ISO performance
really<00:05:38.340> is<00:05:38.550> pretty<00:05:38.730> similar<00:05:39.110> especially<00:05:40.110> in

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
really is pretty similar especially in

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.620 
really is pretty similar especially in
the<00:05:40.530> area<00:05:40.800> of<00:05:40.830> criminals

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630

what<00:05:42.630> about<00:05:42.720> autofocus<00:05:43.470> well<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:43.890> 5d<00:05:44.280> Mark<00:05:44.310> 3

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
what about autofocus well the 5d Mark 3

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.970 
what about autofocus well the 5d Mark 3
has<00:05:45.390> the<00:05:45.540> same<00:05:45.720> autofocus<00:05:46.290> system<00:05:46.410> as<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:46.800> 1

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
has the same autofocus system as the 1

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.910 
has the same autofocus system as the 1
DX<00:05:47.280> only<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.150> 1<00:05:48.330> DX<00:05:48.600> inputs<00:05:49.470> metering

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
DX only the 1 DX inputs metering

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.950 
DX only the 1 DX inputs metering
information<00:05:50.490> into<00:05:50.940> the<00:05:51.060> autofocus<00:05:51.450> module

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
information into the autofocus module

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.600 
information into the autofocus module
but<00:05:52.230> that<00:05:52.350> only<00:05:52.470> happens<00:05:52.740> in<00:05:53.100> two<00:05:53.250> shooting

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
but that only happens in two shooting

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.310 
but that only happens in two shooting
modes<00:05:53.790> if<00:05:54.000> you're<00:05:54.150> shooting<00:05:54.330> automatic

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
modes if you're shooting automatic

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.320 
modes if you're shooting automatic
autofocus<00:05:56.070> where<00:05:56.400> you<00:05:56.760> let<00:05:56.940> the<00:05:57.060> camera

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
autofocus where you let the camera

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.150 
autofocus where you let the camera
decide<00:05:57.630> which<00:05:57.810> AF<00:05:58.110> point<00:05:58.320> it<00:05:58.410> wants<00:05:58.590> to<00:05:58.710> use<00:05:58.920> or

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
decide which AF point it wants to use or

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.000 
decide which AF point it wants to use or

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.160 
if you're shooting in zone autofocus now
I<00:06:02.040> don't<00:06:02.280> use<00:06:02.460> those<00:06:02.640> two<00:06:02.940> focus<00:06:03.660> modes<00:06:03.900> very

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
I don't use those two focus modes very

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.110 
I don't use those two focus modes very
much<00:06:04.380> so<00:06:04.680> it's<00:06:05.100> really<00:06:05.370> not<00:06:05.490> going<00:06:05.670> to<00:06:05.820> help<00:06:06.000> me

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
much so it's really not going to help me

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.820 
much so it's really not going to help me
out<00:06:06.240> I<00:06:06.510> can't<00:06:06.900> see<00:06:07.080> a<00:06:07.110> lot<00:06:07.170> of<00:06:07.380> difference<00:06:07.710> in

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
out I can't see a lot of difference in

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.010 
out I can't see a lot of difference in
the<00:06:07.950> speed<00:06:08.220> of<00:06:08.460> the<00:06:08.760> autofocus<00:06:09.120> system<00:06:09.420> if<00:06:09.750> any

the speed of the autofocus system if any

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.590 
the speed of the autofocus system if any

between the 1 DX and the 5d Mark 3 and

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.150 
between the 1 DX and the 5d Mark 3 and
I've<00:06:12.990> talked<00:06:13.200> to<00:06:13.290> some<00:06:13.410> reliable<00:06:13.860> sports

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
I've talked to some reliable sports

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.650 
I've talked to some reliable sports
shooters<00:06:14.460> as<00:06:14.610> well<00:06:14.790> who<00:06:14.940> say<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.240> same<00:06:15.390> thing

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
shooters as well who say the same thing

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.320 
shooters as well who say the same thing
about<00:06:16.110> the<00:06:16.380> autofocus<00:06:16.980> speed<00:06:17.100> of<00:06:17.430> the<00:06:17.820> 1d<00:06:18.150> Mark

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
about the autofocus speed of the 1d Mark

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.290 
about the autofocus speed of the 1d Mark
4<00:06:18.660> versus<00:06:19.410> the<00:06:19.530> 1<00:06:19.710> DX<00:06:19.980> so<00:06:20.970> what's<00:06:21.150> the

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
4 versus the 1 DX so what's the

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.390 
4 versus the 1 DX so what's the
conclusion<00:06:21.780> then<00:06:21.960> if<00:06:22.110> you're<00:06:22.530> a<00:06:22.560> 7d<00:06:23.070> shooter

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
conclusion then if you're a 7d shooter

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.640 
conclusion then if you're a 7d shooter
or<00:06:23.580> a<00:06:23.610> 5d<00:06:24.120> Mark<00:06:24.330> 3<00:06:24.390> shooter<00:06:24.870> looking<00:06:25.410> to<00:06:25.530> move

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
or a 5d Mark 3 shooter looking to move

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.860 
or a 5d Mark 3 shooter looking to move
up<00:06:25.830> to<00:06:25.890> the<00:06:26.070> 1d<00:06:26.430> range<00:06:26.460> you<00:06:27.300> really<00:06:27.630> need<00:06:27.780> to

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
up to the 1d range you really need to

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.050 
up to the 1d range you really need to

consider the 1d Mark 4 especially at its

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.450 
consider the 1d Mark 4 especially at its
current<00:06:30.240> price<00:06:30.480> point<00:06:30.930> compared<00:06:31.530> to<00:06:31.920> the<00:06:32.010> 1<00:06:32.190> DX
