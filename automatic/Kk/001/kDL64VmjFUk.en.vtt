00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.000
 option hard to learn bad memory 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.970

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.799
 handwriting is also our version of your friends 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.950
 conceived bad offer to try 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.350
 drugs to smoke or you as adequately 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.570
 react really that's just 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.430
 Yesterday I had a child come from the site at 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.040
 me ballist played football 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.750
 mom comes and says what does it mean 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.020
 some weed to smoke weed 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.570
 the boys asked smoked weed and I 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.670
 I realized that I bought the book very on time 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.250
 not always enough time 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.350
 parents competently adequate without 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.280
 hysterical without swearing explain to the child 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.140
 such important things in the future 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.030
 ensure his safety his health 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.970
 despite being a psychologist myself 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.890
 Education I, too, is that not 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.350
 enough time sometimes not enough 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.049
 nerves and so the book I give you is very 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.090
 I advise the child and read on one 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.750
 breathing I know it because I read 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.579
 reviews 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.430
 because talking to other small 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.420
 who bought the book itself I purchased 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.910
 on ozone 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.220
 and leave a reference on it and there such 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.470
 There are a lot of different parts of books 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.610
 publishing house of different prices and the second book 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.450
 where do children come from 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.800
 and now Iâ€™m confused but because 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.959
 show content 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.930
 the same was then this book 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.239
 I chose what page I do not open 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.450
 it all seems to me that some kind of picture 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.690
 vulgar that everything is too vulgar or 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.849
 too somehow that's wrong but this particular 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.220
 book again in the zone is a huge number 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.930
 positive reviews I ventured to buy 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.129
 age from 8 to 11 and now looking 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.349
 flipping through and and fluently I still think 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.200
 closer to eleven probably for 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.959
 eight years will be difficult but try 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.730
 give this book at least not here 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.640
 written about what the boy has 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.290
 faucet and the girl has the proceeds as in one 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.540
 the book was here very much and 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.480
 just enough so look what 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.909
 content sad time meeting 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.709
 couple in love to love marriage 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.519
 cohabitation why people min up 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.459

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.940
 head sexual relationship want 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.610

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.480
 want to have children what is speed like 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:31.470
 birth of life evolving license 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.599
 of the month the twins are half tales and legends 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.549
 this is going to be a child interesting for sure 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.769

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.060
 told him that we found in the cabbage that 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:51.360
 we bought it in a store I talked about 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.000
 that women have birth canal and through 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.000
 them a baby is born at some point 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.489
 This son's explanation suited but again 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.330
 Iâ€™m going to have a school right now 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.659
 September 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.640
 and this September literally passed 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.780
 a couple of weeks how he began to study he 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.120
 came and said mom 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.450
 and I was told that they are through the birth canal 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.510
 but somehow I saw him differently 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.070
 yet through the agaves and the paths but now 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.580
 need to explain where 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.470

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.300

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.660
 tummy cut tummy was cesarean but 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.730
 You understand that this topic can not enter 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.520
 country anyway especially considering 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.310
 how much girls we have now and 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.170
 boys show 1 interest 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.690

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:52.110

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:55.350

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.120
 maturing about girls about boys about 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.690
 pedophilia is also very at the moment 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:16.530
 actual 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:19.110
 what is the lisbor here in the picture here 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.510
 so for example one of the most difficult 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.580
 Sexual relationships are described as 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.170
 sexual relations is everyone's business 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.820

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.650
 often show us naked nudes 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.900
 bodies on the fact that they can not 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.740
 flaunt it because 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.560
 intimate moments of physical intimacy and 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:44.210
 written structure of the genitals all 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:48.560
 very simple without details from such 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.560
 here is about how desire is born 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:06.560
 Well, something like that I had such 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:11.090
 2 useful purchases I am very interested about 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.880
 how you told your children 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.250
 children about sex about sex can be 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.220
 You will not share it with me very much 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.820
