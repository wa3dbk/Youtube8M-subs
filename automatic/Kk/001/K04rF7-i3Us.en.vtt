00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
a point book call at this point a and

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.190 
a point book call at this point a and
then<00:03:29.609> let's<00:03:29.970> say<00:03:30.120> my<00:03:30.299> power<00:03:30.480> goes<00:03:30.720> out<00:03:30.870> in<00:03:31.049> this

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
then let's say my power goes out in this

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.410 
then let's say my power goes out in this
quits<00:03:31.560> let's<00:03:31.890> say<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.160> all<00:03:32.370> goes<00:03:32.609> out<00:03:32.760> now<00:03:33.390> I

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
quits let's say this all goes out now I

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.170 
quits let's say this all goes out now I
can<00:03:33.600> go<00:03:33.690> back<00:03:33.840> in<00:03:34.049> I<00:03:34.430> launch<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.579> back<00:03:35.730> up<00:03:35.970> and

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
can go back in I launch it back up and

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.599 
can go back in I launch it back up and
this<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:36.930> exactly<00:03:37.109> where<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.739> left<00:03:37.799> off<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.459> is

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
this is exactly where I left off this is

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.970 
this is exactly where I left off this is
amazing<00:03:38.940> i<00:03:39.150> auto-save<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:40.230> i<00:03:40.440> just<00:03:40.709> take

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
amazing i auto-save that i just take

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.949 
amazing i auto-save that i just take
command<00:03:41.340> q<00:03:41.609> and<00:03:41.940> it's<00:03:42.060> exactly<00:03:42.209> back<00:03:42.720> where<00:03:42.930> i

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
command q and it's exactly back where i

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.110 
command q and it's exactly back where i
left<00:03:43.139> off<00:03:43.350> i<00:03:43.590> have<00:03:43.859> fun<00:03:44.160> so<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.489> have<00:03:44.700> coloreds

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
left off i have fun so I have coloreds

well so that's this and if i do want to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.270 
well so that's this and if i do want to
save<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.209> there<00:03:51.810> is<00:03:51.959> no<00:03:52.109> you<00:03:52.739> know<00:03:52.829> say<00:03:53.040> that's

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
let's go to this one we're going to make

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.490 
let's go to this one we're going to make
this<00:04:14.280> a<00:04:14.820> blank<00:04:15.420> slide<00:04:15.750> we're<00:04:15.960> gonna<00:04:16.080> add<00:04:16.230> this

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
this a blank slide we're gonna add this

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.009 
this a blank slide we're gonna add this
in<00:04:16.680> here<00:04:17.010> we're<00:04:17.310> going<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.660> bump<00:04:18.660> it<00:04:18.810> up<00:04:18.900> a

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
in here we're going to bump it up a

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.600 
in here we're going to bump it up a
little<00:04:19.140> bit<00:04:19.260> size<00:04:19.620> by<00:04:20.010> pinching<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.550> zooming

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
little bit size by pinching and zooming

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.680 
little bit size by pinching and zooming
here<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.980> let's<00:04:22.980> save<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:24.360> then<00:04:24.510> let's

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
here and let's save that and then let's

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.320 
here and let's save that and then let's
decide<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.650> okay<00:04:26.130> we<00:04:26.490> need<00:04:26.700> something<00:04:26.970> here

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
decide that okay we need something here

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.930

so<00:04:27.480> I'm<00:04:27.540> going<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:27.720> copy<00:04:28.050> this<00:04:28.310> drop<00:04:29.310> this<00:04:29.640> in

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
so I'm going to copy this drop this in

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.000 
so I'm going to copy this drop this in
here<00:04:30.240> we'll<00:04:31.020> do<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.140> little<00:04:31.230> bit<00:04:31.500> of<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:31.620> mouthful

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
here we'll do a little bit of a mouthful

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.290 
here we'll do a little bit of a mouthful
this<00:04:32.130> will<00:04:32.220> be<00:04:32.310> a<00:04:32.340> terrible<00:04:32.700> alpha<00:04:33.060> but<00:04:33.210> we'll

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
this will be a terrible alpha but we'll

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.420 
this will be a terrible alpha but we'll
do<00:04:33.390> an<00:04:33.510> alpha<00:04:33.900> and<00:04:34.110> there<00:04:34.980> we<00:04:35.100> go<00:04:35.130> so<00:04:35.400> now

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
do an alpha and there we go so now

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.010 
do an alpha and there we go so now
that's<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.880> way<00:04:36.030> that<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:36.240> want<00:04:36.450> this<00:04:36.600> version

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
that's the way that I want this version

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.750 
that's the way that I want this version
so<00:04:37.200> now<00:04:37.320> I've<00:04:37.470> got<00:04:37.650> this<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.160> now<00:04:38.250> saved<00:04:38.610> it

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
so now I've got this and now saved it

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.360 
so now I've got this and now saved it
again<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.630> now<00:04:40.230> I<00:04:40.500> can<00:04:40.770> easily<00:04:40.890> go<00:04:41.160> in<00:04:41.280> two

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
again and now I can easily go in two

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.770 
again and now I can easily go in two
versions<00:04:41.550> just<00:04:41.940> like<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.150> showed<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:42.420> browse
