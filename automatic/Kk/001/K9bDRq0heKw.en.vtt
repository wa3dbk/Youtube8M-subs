so<00:00:45.059> often<00:00:45.390> times<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.930> kill<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> liberator<00:00:47.520> or<00:00:47.730> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
so often times to kill a liberator or a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.930 
so often times to kill a liberator or a
galaxy<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:49.140> d<00:00:49.469> cons<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.190> then<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.730> get

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
galaxy that's just d cons and then I get

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.760 
galaxy that's just d cons and then I get
shot<00:00:51.149> down<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.719> even<00:00:52.230> though<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.350> would<00:00:52.649> have

hundred<00:04:05.160> XP<00:04:05.580> for<00:04:05.820> that<00:04:05.940> like<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.300> I<00:04:06.420> caused

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
hundred XP for that like that I caused

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.360 
hundred XP for that like that I caused
him<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:06.959> die<00:04:07.080> he<00:04:07.650> would<00:04:07.770> not<00:04:07.950> have<00:04:08.100> died

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
him to die he would not have died

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.590 
him to die he would not have died
without<00:04:08.610> me<00:04:08.970> expressly<00:04:10.310> killing<00:04:11.310> him

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
without me expressly killing him

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.960 
without me expressly killing him
basically<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:12.810> this<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.680> similar<00:04:14.070> for<00:04:14.250> if<00:04:14.700> he

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
basically and this is similar for if he

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.900 
basically and this is similar for if he
jumps<00:04:15.239> out<00:04:15.450> of<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.600> airplane<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:17.519> last

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
jumps out of the airplane the last

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.909 
jumps out of the airplane the last
person<00:04:18.269> to<00:04:18.359> damage<00:04:18.720> his<00:04:18.870> vehicle<00:04:19.290> before<00:04:19.530> he

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
person to damage his vehicle before he

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.850 
person to damage his vehicle before he
dies<00:04:20.220> should<00:04:21.090> get<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.450> kill<00:04:21.690> on<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.229> person

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
dies should get the kill on a person

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.300 
dies should get the kill on a person
falling<00:04:23.039> to<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.280> ground<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.860> I<00:04:25.860> think<00:04:26.160> that's

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
falling to the ground and I think that's

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.080 
falling to the ground and I think that's
number<00:04:26.700> of<00:04:26.789> reason

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
number of reason

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.510 
number of reason
it's<00:04:27.720> nice<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:27.930> know<00:04:28.260> who<00:04:28.410> killed<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:28.860> if<00:04:29.040> I

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
it's nice to know who killed you if I

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.850 
it's nice to know who killed you if I
like<00:04:30.210> it's<00:04:30.449> nice<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.750> know<00:04:30.840> who<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.050> killed<00:04:31.230> too

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
if for example he's a hacker or whatever

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.409 
if for example he's a hacker or whatever

renders<00:05:30.510> and<00:05:30.780> you're<00:05:31.530> like<00:05:31.740> well<00:05:32.610> what<00:05:32.880> the

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
renders and you're like well what the

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.210 
renders and you're like well what the
fuck<00:05:33.300> why<00:05:33.660> didn't<00:05:33.960> it<00:05:34.020> render<00:05:34.470> so<00:05:34.830> I<00:05:34.860> knew<00:05:35.070> how

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
fuck why didn't it render so I knew how

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.700 
fuck why didn't it render so I knew how
to<00:05:35.280> dodge<00:05:35.550> it<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:36.050> this<00:05:37.050> has<00:05:37.200> happened<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.620> me

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.730 
to dodge it and this has happened to me
probably<00:05:38.210> 200<00:05:39.210> times<00:05:39.450> in<00:05:39.750> planetside<00:05:40.500> in<00:05:40.680> the

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
probably 200 times in planetside in the

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.710 
probably 200 times in planetside in the
last<00:05:40.919> four<00:05:41.130> months<00:05:41.240> it's<00:05:42.240> one<00:05:42.389> of<00:05:42.419> the<00:05:42.570> most

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
last four months it's one of the most

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.779 
last four months it's one of the most
frustrating<00:05:43.139> deaths<00:05:43.919> that<00:05:44.280> you<00:05:44.400> can<00:05:44.550> ever

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
make a mistake you're doing a great job

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.000 
make a mistake you're doing a great job
flying<00:05:48.180> and<00:05:48.510> use<00:05:48.720> blow<00:05:48.960> up<00:05:49.110> for<00:05:49.260> no<00:05:49.320> reason<00:05:49.740> so

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
flying and use blow up for no reason so

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.830 
flying and use blow up for no reason so
it's<00:05:50.639> something<00:05:50.910> that<00:05:51.120> needs<00:05:51.150> to<00:05:51.539> get<00:05:51.630> fixed

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
it's something that needs to get fixed

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.969 
it's something that needs to get fixed
as<00:05:52.050> well<00:05:52.229> and<00:05:52.380> it's<00:05:52.470> something<00:05:52.620> that<00:05:52.710> could<00:05:52.919> be

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
as well and it's something that could be

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.800 
as well and it's something that could be
fixed<00:05:53.160> very<00:05:53.550> very<00:05:53.820> easily<00:05:54.060> just<00:05:54.360> increasing

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
fixed very very easily just increasing

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.110 
fixed very very easily just increasing
them<00:05:54.960> out<00:05:55.110> of<00:05:55.260> render<00:05:55.680> distance<00:05:55.849> so<00:05:56.849> that<00:05:57.000> they

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
them out of render distance so that they

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.570 
them out of render distance so that they
render<00:05:57.510> at<00:05:57.750> 200<00:05:58.349> meters<00:05:58.650> instead<00:05:59.010> of<00:05:59.160> 0<00:05:59.340> meters

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
render at 200 meters instead of 0 meters

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.670 
render at 200 meters instead of 0 meters
like<00:06:00.120> just<00:06:00.570> make<00:06:00.750> them<00:06:01.020> have<00:06:01.410> a<00:06:01.440> higher

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
like just make them have a higher

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.920 
like just make them have a higher
priority<00:06:01.889> in<00:06:02.220> the<00:06:02.280> rendering<00:06:02.599> like<00:06:03.599> they<00:06:03.750> need

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
priority in the rendering like they need

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.719 
priority in the rendering like they need
to<00:06:04.080> be<00:06:04.169> rendered<00:06:04.440> sooner<00:06:04.800> so<00:06:05.099> to<00:06:05.160> the<00:06:05.430> SEO<00:06:05.639> a
