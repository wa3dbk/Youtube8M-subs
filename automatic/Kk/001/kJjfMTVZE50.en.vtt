00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
same dimensions so there's a couple of

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.629 
same dimensions so there's a couple of
differences<00:00:13.530> between<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.070> real<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.460> fake

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
one here go for the packaging first

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.320 
one here go for the packaging first
before<00:00:17.490> go<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.850> case<00:00:18.060> now<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.590> course<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
before go to the case now of course the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.269 
before go to the case now of course the
older<00:00:21.750> way<00:00:21.869> which<00:00:22.230> works<00:00:22.470> for<00:00:22.619> some<00:00:22.890> but<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
older way which works for some but the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.769 
older way which works for some but the
newer<00:00:23.430> ones<00:00:23.609> don't<00:00:23.850> but<00:00:24.029> for<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.300> case<00:00:24.510> does

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
newer ones don't but for this case does

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.839 
newer ones don't but for this case does
cuz<00:00:25.050> iphone<00:00:25.500> 5<00:00:25.710> isn't<00:00:26.779> you<00:00:27.779> know<00:00:28.279> bad<00:00:29.279> old<00:00:29.580> but
