can sort of see how in Doudna the front

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.340 
can sort of see how in Doudna the front
of<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.730> would<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> very<00:00:42.300> nice<00:00:42.870> modern

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
of more Victorian with more than wooden

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.479 
of more Victorian with more than wooden
roofs<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.749> arches<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.410> everything<00:00:49.800> now<00:00:50.460> I

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
roofs and arches and everything now I

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.549 
roofs and arches and everything now I
felt<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.300> gave<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> really<00:00:51.780> good<00:00:51.870> feel<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
felt this gave a really good feel and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.810 
felt this gave a really good feel and
the<00:00:52.980> reason<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.280> was<00:00:53.370> building<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.699> school

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the reason I was building this school

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.209 
the reason I was building this school
was<00:00:54.329> because<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:55.379> was<00:00:55.589> the<00:00:55.679> school<00:00:55.859> I<00:00:55.920> went

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
was because this was the school I went

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.279 
was because this was the school I went
to<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.489> baseness<00:00:57.179> off<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.539> school<00:00:57.749> I<00:00:57.960> went<00:00:58.170> to

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
to I baseness off the school I went to

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.680 
to I baseness off the school I went to
when<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.530> was<00:00:58.679> younger<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.249> I<00:00:59.999> thought<00:01:00.239> it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
when I was younger and I thought it

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.910 
when I was younger and I thought it
would<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.929> a<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.140> really<00:01:01.230> good<00:01:01.409> to<00:01:01.620> school

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
would be a really really good to school

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.259 
would be a really really good to school
them<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.129> build<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.640> knew<00:01:02.760> exactly<00:01:02.879> what<00:01:03.210> it

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
them to build so I knew exactly what it

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.910 
them to build so I knew exactly what it
looked<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.690> because<00:01:04.290> I'd<00:01:04.379> read<00:01:04.559> maps<00:01:04.739> like

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
looked like because I'd read maps like

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.219 
looked like because I'd read maps like
seven<00:01:05.309> years<00:01:05.550> so<00:01:06.390> I'm<00:01:06.540> gonna<00:01:06.720> try<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.050> get<00:01:07.170> as

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
seven years so I'm gonna try and get as

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.319 
seven years so I'm gonna try and get as
many<00:01:07.350> details<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.579> I<00:01:08.759> can

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 
many details of this as I can

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:10.940 
many details of this as I can
I<00:01:09.360> had<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.750> my<00:01:09.930> half<00:01:10.079> a<00:01:10.140> monster<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.680> Google

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
I had it on my half a monster on Google

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.859 
I had it on my half a monster on Google
Street<00:01:11.189> View<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.579> sort<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.880> knew<00:01:12.090> exactly

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
Street View so I sort of knew exactly

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.749 
Street View so I sort of knew exactly
how<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.619> look<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.549> honest

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
how it's going to look and to be honest

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.429 
how it's going to look and to be honest
it<00:01:14.850> looked<00:01:15.060> really<00:01:15.329> really<00:01:15.450> good<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:16.350> were

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
it looked really really good we were

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.410 
it looked really really good we were
using<00:01:16.619> hardened<00:01:17.159> clay<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.729> worked

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
using hardened clay and worked

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.120 
using hardened clay and worked
now<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.659> word<00:01:18.930> dissolve<00:01:19.380> meant<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.890> represent

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
now the word dissolve meant to represent

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.730 
now the word dissolve meant to represent
a<00:01:20.759> type<00:01:21.329> of<00:01:21.360> sandstone<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.350> didn't<00:01:22.619> want

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
a type of sandstone but I didn't want

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.350 
a type of sandstone but I didn't want
you<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> sandstone<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.880> Minecraft

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
you to sandstone we have in Minecraft

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.480 
you to sandstone we have in Minecraft
because<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.140> was<00:01:25.259> too<00:01:25.439> bright<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:26.070> sort<00:01:26.430> of

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
because that was too bright I sort of

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.050 
because that was too bright I sort of
wanted<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.880> very<00:01:27.060> pale<00:01:27.659> dark<00:01:28.380> ish<00:01:28.939> Tanning's<00:01:29.939> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
wanted a very pale dark ish Tanning's of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.730 
wanted a very pale dark ish Tanning's of
sandstone<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.719> thought<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> wooden<00:01:31.439> planks

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
sandstone I thought the wooden planks

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.560 
sandstone I thought the wooden planks
gave<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.070> best<00:01:32.250> fields<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.759> I've<00:01:33.420> been

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
gave the best fields that I've been

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
to shape things you can see above the

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.280 
to shape things you can see above the
walls<00:03:09.980> also<00:03:10.459> not<00:03:11.269> always<00:03:11.569> in<00:03:11.719> line<00:03:11.900> they<00:03:12.140> had

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
walls also not always in line they had

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.530 
walls also not always in line they had
to<00:03:12.379> alter<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.799> roof<00:03:12.950> quite<00:03:13.370> a<00:03:13.400> bit<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:13.969> thought

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
to alter the roof quite a bit I thought

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.910 
to alter the roof quite a bit I thought
this<00:03:14.659> was<00:03:14.840> really<00:03:15.079> good<00:03:15.260> because<00:03:15.469> he<00:03:15.680> didn't

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
this was really good because he didn't

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.770 
this was really good because he didn't
have<00:03:16.010> these<00:03:16.189> straight<00:03:16.609> and<00:03:16.969> triangular<00:03:17.420> prism

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
have these straight and triangular prism

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.209 
have these straight and triangular prism
shapes<00:03:18.019> going<00:03:18.260> across<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.650> roof<00:03:18.799> they<00:03:19.010> talked

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:19.219 
shapes going across the roof they talked

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:20.890 
shapes going across the roof they talked
old<00:03:19.489> tip<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:19.969> changed<00:03:20.450> as<00:03:20.599> she<00:03:20.629> went<00:03:20.810> along

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
old tip and changed as she went along

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:28.670 
old tip and changed as she went along
and<00:03:21.650> I<00:03:21.920> thought<00:03:22.099> it<00:03:22.250> was<00:03:22.400> really<00:03:22.700> really<00:03:22.819> good

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.990 

see<00:03:29.680> if<00:03:29.739> it's<00:03:29.829> gonna<00:03:29.920> continued<00:03:30.400> up<00:03:30.519> now<00:03:30.670> this

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
see if it's gonna continued up now this

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.459 
see if it's gonna continued up now this
section<00:03:31.390> was<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.510> little<00:03:31.780> bit<00:03:31.900> more<00:03:32.079> flat<00:03:32.439> than

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:32.469 
section was a little bit more flat than

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:33.660 
section was a little bit more flat than
the<00:03:32.739> others<00:03:33.010> because<00:03:33.129> there<00:03:33.370> weren't<00:03:33.549> as<00:03:33.640> many

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
the others because there weren't as many

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.119 
the others because there weren't as many
archways<00:03:34.299> they're<00:03:34.590> not<00:03:35.590> cool<00:03:35.799> if<00:03:35.859> you<00:03:35.890> haven't

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
archways they're not cool if you haven't

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.470 
archways they're not cool if you haven't
have<00:03:36.219> a<00:03:36.250> bit<00:03:36.400> arch<00:03:36.549> which<00:03:36.879> I'm<00:03:36.969> working<00:03:37.060> on<00:03:37.299> now

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
have a bit arch which I'm working on now

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.809 
have a bit arch which I'm working on now
and<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.930> can<00:03:38.079> sort<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.379> see<00:03:38.560> how<00:03:38.829> towards<00:03:39.700> the

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
and you can sort of see how towards the

and you can sort of see how towards the
right-hand<00:03:40.030> side<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.659> stairs<00:03:40.959> have<00:03:41.230> sort<00:03:41.439> of

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:41.469 
right-hand side the stairs have sort of

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:43.140 
right-hand side the stairs have sort of
come<00:03:41.530> out<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:41.889> curved<00:03:42.280> of<00:03:42.459> it<00:03:42.579> let's<00:03:42.969> make

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
come out and curved of it let's make

otherwise<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:46.150> wouldn't<00:03:46.450> it<00:03:46.569> looks<00:03:46.719> too<00:03:47.019> good

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.410 

but<00:03:50.439> lucky<00:03:50.680> for<00:03:50.799> me<00:03:51.069> i<00:03:51.099> build<00:03:51.459> these<00:03:51.670> final

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
but lucky for me i build these final

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.509 
but lucky for me i build these final
triangles<00:03:53.170> in<00:03:53.349> line<00:03:53.530> with<00:03:53.650> each<00:03:53.709> other<00:03:53.980> this

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
triangles in line with each other this

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.309 
triangles in line with each other this
is<00:03:54.579> a<00:03:54.730> nice<00:03:55.030> simple<00:03:55.329> trying<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.840> hook<00:03:55.930> tristan

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
is a nice simple trying to hook tristan

chalkboards on the wall because a

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.909 
chalkboards on the wall because a
