00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.160
 How is the situation 

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.400
 the situation is very curious at the moment yes yes the crisis does not have with us yet 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:09.339
 Percent still found no place and will 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.449
 Drove the situation rarely good as rare actually around 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:17.300
 yes I can only say now she makes me so stupid you are also cleantech 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.519
 they to 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.630
 Image with Word of Warcraft how is the situation at GM 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.529
 also very good so Ischler unfortunately has to say I have it again 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.970
 my husband added my working cycle so i have many now 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.030
 many months percent actually extreme 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.600
 But you can say that was that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.910
 fallow had little recorded on dyn 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.800
 yes, first of all the Studio Mommsen avoided the hot whole 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.350
 So I've been through it 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.150
 Percent of this add-on Suisse 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.940
 One of this month's moves there have been accordingly common also because of it 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.840
 could not invest that much time 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.210
 very far on the content and around 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.690
 that of course a point so I already play games 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.030
 Warcraft has always been before of Warcraft I have the Rock of Clyde 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.210
 gezockt 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.100
 then I'll do that too tomorrow Concordia Beuren so everything's all something out 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.200
 but Blizzard is coming 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.910
 This was shot down by the bird of Warcraft and 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.340
 just because it's just a virtual world in which I then practically synonymous 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.320
 Anonymous can move the word and really big point I rade 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.990
 the little anonymity also has so I do not find it for me then either 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.880
 play more 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.050
 Are you also a star in World of Warcraft or 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.330
 yes, I am because of the guild and because of our percent world 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
 By the way I am never theoretical choice as well 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.890
 Percent at the main content end almost arrived so to speak for the people who 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.800
 that understand each other 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.960
 the things you can reach or the opponents you can say 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.039
 can defeat in this game 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.700
 in this world percent we have now defeated almost everyone and so to speak 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.240
 this is characterized by titles like you get those to a character 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.400
 Names are added or percentages are left behind and 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.110
 Of course, he also dedicates his equipment to the horizontal bar 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.380
 who of course you then also visually easily recognize off the values ​​of the 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.690
 to strengthen the character, so to speak 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.340
 in Grohnde we all of course just see my genes very well and if 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.659
 we old and like any short form Red somewhere 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.930
 with 20 30 people in one place then Bammer but other players 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.639
 Just stand and 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.050
 so you look virtually like watching 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.580
 Sometimes he should click right when clicking Salt and then stand 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.480
 To be known again, to whisper a whisper or a shop in the group 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.019
 and 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.999
 since 1 1 percent off has a group invite the latter many 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.820
 have been fucking look long had to know the wrong of poison already 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.579
 Of course there is some recognition 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.579
 just because of the recognition I do not play because of this 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.019
 I enjoy so-called personal recognition in my job 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.259
 whether it's positive or negative 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:50.469
 and that's why I do not need any kind of power right now 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.189
 just as one likes to say it compensates for human weaknesses 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.439
 And so, like me, I'm in a certain world, but I'm very much there 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:59.399
 like and 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:02.979
 I love the game as it is the way your girlfriend lives Sonja 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:06.699
 Kochmann from halitosis or has also put on shit in the former room and 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.599
 Sauces game as well I love the game easy and just like you have his wife 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.569
 loves or something 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:12.419
 now the scales are on 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.419
 Enke gets the knee amount of World of Warcraft 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.269
 what was then 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.540
 the phenomenon of the mended is confused with something like ego-shooting 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.449
 So shoot games what World of Warcraft is not 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.489
 if you see the story percent, that's the result of the roles 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.179
 we played in the living room in the 80s at home 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:37.709
 with dice you also do not have before lesepaten and how to use them since 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.900
 Dice still played over the Erfurt with degrees and cello rehearsed everything 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:42.859
 and percent 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.930
 black eye and so what he is there with horror of the lights already 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.640
 died 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.420
 but you have to end this with the crew at every game 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.899
 Rooney Magna needs to do things the lines have no idea what and 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.609
 now just because that somehow monster are the other but with 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.729
 a pig other people yes 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:00.719
 and who goes shopping but through the demo 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.719
 Poppy or ghosts that is basically the same thing though 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:07.599
 there is the devil in detail I mean you have something again 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.219
 and then another politician plunges in with a statement or one 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.699
 big magazine writes a report about was Warcraft and all at once 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.879
 these are all the next assassins of the schools and and 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.609
 that's too easy, but that was exactly the same with me 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.699
 it just can not be done and you have to finance it and when people do 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.059
 have a healthy attitude to life 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:31.579
 then when neither by Marilyn Manson nor Bushido nor to vacation 

00:04:31.579 --> 00:04:34.579
 Warcraft and not by counter-strike to killers 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.300
 that also comes with "World of Warcraft" is my impression of what in the 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.490
 Environment one has when one 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.810
 Minute social environment one has that player 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.050
 Tonight make out again from the replacement 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.229
 if you have yourself 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:47.570
 then probably hang there 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.750
 theoretically yes only then it is also good for a state again 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.780
 social environment 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.090
 Echo «I do not have a good social environment and 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.889
 was of course my confrontation with law enforcement and 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.590
 had something like that but in the end I would just type that I'm relative 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.500
 reasonable or I know when I make mistakes and if I am 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.490
 make a mistake or if I do something forbidden 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.240
 then I know that I do that I carry the consequences also then has 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.469
 Also my mother always told me to make sensible boy 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.139
 even if you shit building you will someday 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.139
 be reasonable and now you understand 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.969
 my mother knows wafers that left 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.449
 do not you still have the feeling sometimes Hey that keeps me too long on 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.909
 Calculator I finally come the way what they still firmly 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:32.909
 I have this feeling every day 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.389
 I always have to play Schulz a bit because then sometimes I'll wait okay 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.300
 I'll take a quick look 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.900
 Maybe I sold out in the auction house or wrote another one 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.689
 or anyone to say hello 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.139
 but then usually not because I know anyway again I who three three four 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:48.599
 Hanging or hours 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.369
 if I then just for a short while if riots like Rainer Schratt fix without 

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:54.419
 that it is so fast and because it is not so fast and 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.479
 Sportsman already determined five hours deleted
