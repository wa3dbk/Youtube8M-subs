00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.220
 without how to play and multiplayer in a 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.799
 turner but we are in the program alÃ³ 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.179
 in chemistry machine we download it let 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.070
 the inter description so that what 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.620
 download all the members that 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.179
 go to play this have defend it already 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.480
 that his good presence has been installed 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.010
 we open it we will look more and good 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.010
 they do it connected in connect 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:33.010
 verifying without beginning this 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:36.530
 and for this you have to go to three network 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:40.360
 put the name that works 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.360
 or password or whatever 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.780
 just pass to your friends and the 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.730
 friends and if they are more than five people 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.060
 of the problem will be another network and still goes 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.190
 to keep working 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:57.810
 and now your friends have to copy the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.810
 what is it 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.670
 right click 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.290
 and good and already with this that is the server 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.050
 you do not have to do this from people 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.450
 that are going to join 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.060
 and that is good for example if we 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.369
 Let's go to the game 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.050
 7 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:24.190
 play 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:26.890
 host what is this 565 people that 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.780
 join your game I'm feeling that 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.570
 they have more complete whatever it is that 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.390
 so bring unbound and will not be 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.070
 nothing no problem the stars with 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.630
 direction to nation world leading the 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.950
 things but if a potato served not 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.350
 they will be like a new character 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.050
 you have five you can mess with 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.119
 all your things here is pp and is that it 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.310
 can kill between you itv is that no 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.600
 you can kill in you is normal that 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.280

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.170

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.960
 recommendable is like that again picassent 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.960
 host 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.560
 but the ip 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.489
 the pp 4 that we copy 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.480
 there it is and we left it as it was good 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.910
 if not then good to put 25 444 25 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.620

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.459
 they will be able to join 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.200
 so good if you have this art 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.580
 stipulated an error that can 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.660
 arrive 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.660

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.600
