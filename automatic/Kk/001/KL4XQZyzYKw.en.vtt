00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.010
 ah 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.200
 electoral country terol welcome we are 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.770
 back in a mini tutorial in which 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.450
 we will be able to change the color of what 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.940
 would be the bar to the lighthouse as 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.309
 you can see there there is purple and good 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.150
 it is very easy to do what 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.750
 it would be him 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.690
 the altar to be able to make the lighthouse or 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.190
 the beacon as you want to call it and then 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.410
 to be able to change colors that 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.410
 make shift and put the color that 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.680
 we want as you can see it can change if 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.680
 we turn 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.420
 to which we want 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.900
 and if we want to make more colors 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.000
 we can do also 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.000
 this black 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.530
 Well, I'm the end, we can put all together and 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.470
 we can see all the difference of the 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.710
 colors and good at the end ends like this and 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.080
 If you want me to finish normal, I think 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.100
 you have to put 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.119
 this 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.119
 no no 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.760
 it's white I think 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.200
 then it would be this is super solo 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.200
 because how can you see the vehicle 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.160
 and good enough 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:51.990
 it's cool to be able to do this is 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.750
 super cured tutorial I'm going to leave it 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.120
