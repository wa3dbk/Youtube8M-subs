 on cisco tivi alan dzagoev holland 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.220
 congratulations on your victory over ruby that 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.639
 say about the game 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.340
 well heavy game was in the first half we 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.500
 We did not score a lot of points you how 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.970
 in the second half, they created for themselves 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.279
 problems so that led 10 then in the end 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.199
 got nervous that is missed a goal and 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.710
 had to hammer in again 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.829
 more active 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.329
 come into play and everything could be decided yet 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.769
 and in the first half since we had 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.280
 many moments needed just 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:35.079
 use led implementation your goal 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.640
 became the first in this match remember 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.269
 please episode very good tight 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.460
 hit you got there shuffle 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.920
 between tuberous dumbia and i 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.530
 turned out to be a little behind the dumbia 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.040
 gave like tuber well not exactly i don't 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.649
 understood 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.070
 he or I eventually bounced the ball of stones 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.510
 that is, the air rally killed 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.190
 In general, such a pattern you always 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.660
 after disqualification which 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.149
 Sorry to happen with great desire 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.460
 you go out and usually you kill why 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.030
 so it turns out I always go out with a big 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:11.500
 by desire 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:14.110
 maybe this is everything and always 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.110
 ready to play the floor well, that is always 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.740
 I give myself here, regardless of the game 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.200
 rival so 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.780
 Well, yes, I remember that is, after certification 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.369
 in my own karen himself ace of mordovia went out and 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.899
 scored i think it's an accident because 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.780
 know yourself in every game coming out 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.549
 Please tell me completely the game 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.500
 still you have some amount of urine 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.299
 missed playing on the cup but nonetheless 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.340
 did any feel inadequate 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.610
 physical form may be you have to 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.009
 feelings the more I got sick exactly 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.649
 when the team went to Krasnodar then 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.630
 i got sick and missed three days here and this 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.020
 affected because literally 2 days I 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.690
 more or less I feel that is exactly 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.640
 after the illness, I felt that today 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.600
 what I felt physically to me 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.670
 tjazhelovato special in Toronto they were 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.619
 if you compare the match with Krasnodar 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.479
 I eat with Krasnodar superbly 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.390
 felt even missing 2 games here 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.299
 one game missed all the same disease 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.459
 it seemed as if coming from the tournament 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.720
 layouts it turned out that especially ruby 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.340
 nothing to fight nonetheless 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.880
 the commander is not well fought today 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.140
 what do you say about the game of the opponent team 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.609
 there was always fighting here Kurban Bekievich 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:34.609
 instilled and we are here that is precisely in 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:38.540
 so that they fight to the end forever with 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:39.730
 it's hard for them to play today 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.829
 day is no exception 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.870
 how do you evaluate our chances in the fight for 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.030
 the highest places still win 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.730
 we win but competitors unfortunately 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.209
 also his mother zenith play well 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.970
 score points well the next match they have 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.519
 among themselves let's see what will happen 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.440
 we will wait for misfires that is surrender 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.560
 no one is going and we will fight to 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.560
 the end 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.290
 so zhor shchennikova today is the day 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.760
 birth it seemed that George himself 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.140
 really wanted to score and teams like this 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.959
 a little more must have played 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.920
 correct impression is not i think it 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.640
 more 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.920
 it so happened that exactly what fell under 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.810
 these moments that it turned out to be 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.079
 two scoring chances of course if by 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.269
 would score it would be a great gift for 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:31.349
 himself but anyway we are today 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.609
 Georgy puppies won this present 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.180
