tough to say the general consensus is

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.070 
tough to say the general consensus is
that<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:13.110> about<00:01:13.400> seven<00:01:14.400> years<00:01:14.550> of<00:01:14.790> pound<00:01:15.080> but

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that it's about seven years of pound but

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.660 
that it's about seven years of pound but
that<00:01:16.260> kind<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.590> gets<00:01:16.800> skewed<00:01:17.220> when<00:01:17.369> they<00:01:17.490> get<00:01:17.640> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
that kind of gets skewed when they get a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.670 
that kind of gets skewed when they get a
little<00:01:17.790> larger<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.540> by<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.050> math<00:01:19.260> he's<00:01:19.470> about

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
little larger so by that math he's about

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.290 
little larger so by that math he's about
a<00:01:19.740> hundred<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.160> fifty<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:20.760> I<00:01:20.880> think<00:01:21.150> that's

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
a hundred and fifty but I think that's

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.140 
a hundred and fifty but I think that's
probably<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.780> little<00:01:22.080> bit<00:01:22.350> off
