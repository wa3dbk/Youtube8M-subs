00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.630 
game sorry I had the other support at a
high<00:00:16.619> demand<00:00:16.830> for<00:00:17.039> elements<00:00:17.400> was<00:00:17.490> this

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
high demand for elements was this

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.519 
high demand for elements was this
fantastic<00:00:18.210> player<00:00:18.420> actually<00:00:18.630> solid<00:00:19.320> bar

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
fantastic player actually solid bar

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.429 
fantastic player actually solid bar
place<00:00:19.770> but<00:00:20.640> uh<00:00:20.670> yeah<00:00:21.330> what<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> game<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.080> I

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
place but uh yeah what a game and I

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.870 
place but uh yeah what a game and I
think<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.070> just<00:00:23.220> immediately<00:00:23.369> jump<00:00:23.730> into

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
think we can just immediately jump into

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.689 
think we can just immediately jump into
our<00:00:24.029> first<00:00:24.269> replay<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:25.070> just<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.250> i<00:00:26.400> think<00:00:26.490> it

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
our first replay and just it i think it

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.429 
our first replay and just it i think it
quite<00:00:26.910> sums<00:00:27.210> up<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.570> way<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.810> game<00:00:28.050> went<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
quite sums up the way this game went and

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.890 
quite sums up the way this game went and
this<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.980> where<00:00:29.160> sk<00:00:29.970> we're<00:00:30.179> doing<00:00:30.390> pattern<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
this is where sk we're doing pattern the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.830 
this is where sk we're doing pattern the
press<00:00:31.140> sivir<00:00:31.380> they<00:00:32.250> went<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.329> signature

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
press sivir they went in the signature

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.660 
press sivir they went in the signature
double<00:00:34.050> ulti<00:00:34.530> from<00:00:34.710> killer<00:00:35.010> Stan<00:00:35.219> Alistair

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
double ulti from killer Stan Alistair

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.940 
double ulti from killer Stan Alistair
kind<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.030> come<00:00:36.149> up<00:00:36.300> but<00:00:36.390> then<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:37.530> happened

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
kind of come up but then this happened

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.690 
kind of come up but then this happened
and<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.760> think<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.809> sums<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> game

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
and I think this really sums up the game

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.020 
and I think this really sums up the game
sk<00:00:41.899> wait<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.930> bit<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.140> an<00:00:43.230> oopsie<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
sk wait a bit of an oopsie and then the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.700 
sk wait a bit of an oopsie and then the
elements<00:00:45.539> finally<00:00:45.870> back<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.050> control<00:00:46.379> i<00:00:46.469> went

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
elements finally back in control i went

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.790 
elements finally back in control i went
back<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:46.860> forth<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.219> lot<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:48.320> yeah<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.530> I

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
back and forth a lot and yeah was I

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.410 
back and forth a lot and yeah was I
guess<00:00:50.100> swapping<00:00:50.460> both<00:00:50.610> sides<00:00:50.850> there<00:00:51.149> was<00:00:51.239> some

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
guess swapping both sides there was some

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.150 
guess swapping both sides there was some
good<00:00:51.539> place<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.500> think<00:00:53.039> it

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
good place here but I I think it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.770 
good place here but I I think it
highlights<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> position<00:00:54.360> both<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.690> these

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
highlights the position both of these

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.950 
highlights the position both of these
guys<00:00:54.989> are<00:00:55.170> as<00:00:55.469> there's<00:00:55.680> apparently<00:00:55.920> fly<00:00:56.960> all

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
guys are as there's apparently fly all

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.900 
guys are as there's apparently fly all

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
back and actually look at the game it's

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.510 
back and actually look at the game it's
quite<00:01:01.469> interesting<00:01:01.680> because<00:01:01.920> neither<00:01:02.250> team

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
quite interesting because neither team

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.889 
quite interesting because neither team
was<00:01:02.609> particularly<00:01:03.059> good<00:01:03.149> at<00:01:03.359> pressing<00:01:03.690> any

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
was particularly good at pressing any

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.070 
was particularly good at pressing any
advantage<00:01:04.439> or<00:01:04.650> creating<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.900> what<00:01:06.900> ended

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
advantage or creating one and what ended

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.050 
advantage or creating one and what ended
up<00:01:07.140> deciding<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.770> game<00:01:07.920> was<00:01:08.250> another<00:01:08.520> massive

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
know about the not a single person a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.920 
know about the not a single person a
single<00:01:17.549> spell<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> single<00:01:18.330> cast<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> right

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
single spell a single cast in the right

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.660 
single spell a single cast in the right
scenario<00:01:19.229> at<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> right<00:01:20.040> time<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.520> game

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
scenario at the right time in the game

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.090 
scenario at the right time in the game
and<00:01:21.049> yes<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.229> was<00:01:22.320> good<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.560> elements<00:01:23.009> was

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
and yes it was good that elements was

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.490 
and yes it was good that elements was
able<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.460> at<00:01:23.580> least<00:01:23.729> all<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.509> long<00:01:24.659> enough<00:01:24.900> but

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
able to at least all for long enough but

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.620 
able to at least all for long enough but
i<00:01:25.530> think<00:01:25.619> both<00:01:26.009> teams<00:01:26.040> showed<00:01:26.640> very<00:01:27.330> clear

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
i think both teams showed very clear

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.870 
i think both teams showed very clear
weaknesses<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.500> getting<00:01:29.159> an<00:01:29.280> advantage<00:01:29.579> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
weaknesses in getting an advantage and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.880 
weaknesses in getting an advantage and
pressing<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> map<00:01:31.020> i<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:31.740> though

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
pressing it on the map i think though

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.010 
pressing it on the map i think though
when<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.159> look<00:01:32.189> down<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.479> map<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.840> each

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
when you look down the map in each

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.289 
when you look down the map in each
particular<00:01:34.290> lane<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> mid<00:01:35.520> laners<00:01:35.850> did

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
particular lane at the mid laners did

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.030 
particular lane at the mid laners did
somewhat<00:01:36.960> stand<00:01:37.229> out<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.590> game<00:01:37.799> both

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
somewhat stand out in this game both

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.249 
somewhat stand out in this game both
were<00:01:38.220> playing<00:01:38.430> fairly<00:01:38.700> late<00:01:39.030> scaling<00:01:39.570> mid

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
were playing fairly late scaling mid

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.280 
were playing fairly late scaling mid

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.889 
laners played up to a point at which
they<00:01:53.430> still<00:01:53.880> had<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> lot<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.299> impact<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
they still had a lot of impact in the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.469 
they still had a lot of impact in the
game<00:01:55.049> regardless<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.890> maybe<00:01:56.700> an<00:01:56.850> oopsie<00:01:57.240> here

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
game regardless of maybe an oopsie here

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.179 
game regardless of maybe an oopsie here
or<00:01:57.630> there<00:01:57.780> as<00:01:57.960> crapper<00:01:58.229> would<00:01:58.439> put<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.740> yeah

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
or there as crapper would put it yeah

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.249 
or there as crapper would put it yeah
definitely<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.329> think<00:02:00.689> they<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.810> kind<00:02:01.200> of

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
definitely and I think they just kind of

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.319 
definitely and I think they just kind of
ended<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.710> mimicking<00:02:02.310> each<00:02:02.490> other's<00:02:02.820> play<00:02:03.180> and

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
ended up mimicking each other's play and

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.969 
ended up mimicking each other's play and
just<00:02:03.420> got<00:02:03.509> lost<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:04.020> all<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> chaos<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.860> was

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
just got lost in all the chaos as it was

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.469 
just got lost in all the chaos as it was
yeah<00:02:05.340> they<00:02:05.460> really<00:02:05.670> did<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.360> for

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
yeah they really did and I think for

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.910 
yeah they really did and I think for
both<00:02:06.630> teams<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.259> know<00:02:07.350> they<00:02:07.439> both<00:02:07.530> came<00:02:07.710> into

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
both teams you know they both came into

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.669 
both teams you know they both came into
this<00:02:08.009> at<00:02:08.160> 216<00:02:08.610> losses<00:02:09.060> now<00:02:09.569> it's<00:02:09.720> 27<00:02:10.289> 36

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
this at 216 losses now it's 27 36

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.550 
this at 216 losses now it's 27 36
they're<00:02:11.129> still<00:02:11.580> down<00:02:12.180> at<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
they're still down at the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.660 
they're still down at the
bottom<00:02:12.739> of<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.890> pile<00:02:13.069> there's<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.340> lot<00:02:13.640> of

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
bottom of the pile there's a lot of

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.370 
bottom of the pile there's a lot of
climbing<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.239> needs<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.510> happen<00:02:14.569> if<00:02:14.930> either

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
climbing that needs to happen if either

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.170 
climbing that needs to happen if either
team<00:02:15.620> wants<00:02:16.040> even<00:02:16.340> realistically<00:02:16.970> make<00:02:17.150> a

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
team wants even realistically make a

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.870 
team wants even realistically make a
shot<00:02:17.420> at<00:02:17.569> playoffs<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.400> that's<00:02:19.400> what<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:19.640> think

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
shot at playoffs and that's what I think

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.400 
shot at playoffs and that's what I think
the<00:02:19.970> concern<00:02:20.300> has<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.540> be<00:02:20.750> here<00:02:20.989> it's<00:02:21.200> good

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
the concern has to be here it's good

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.870 
the concern has to be here it's good
that<00:02:21.560> Neff<00:02:21.709> is<00:02:21.830> back<00:02:22.069> it's<00:02:22.340> good<00:02:22.730> that

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
that Neff is back it's good that

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.699 
that Neff is back it's good that

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
elements managed to dig deep but we

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:25.990 
elements managed to dig deep but we
still<00:02:24.770> seeing<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.280> same<00:02:25.400> problems<00:02:25.760> in<00:02:25.910> my

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
still seeing the same problems in my

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.650 
still seeing the same problems in my
opinion<00:02:26.330> a<00:02:26.510> lot<00:02:26.690> of<00:02:26.810> late<00:02:26.959> scaling<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.620> lot<00:02:28.010> of

opinion a lot of late scaling a lot of

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.680 
opinion a lot of late scaling a lot of
inactivity<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.580> playing<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.849> not<00:02:32.030> lose<00:02:32.330> as

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:25.839 
interesting to note the tie for second
place<00:05:24.620> of<00:05:24.949> course<00:05:25.099> because<00:05:25.370> origin<00:05:25.729> has

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
place of course because origin has

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.969 
place of course because origin has
beaten<00:05:26.089> hdk<00:05:26.900> already<00:05:27.169> technically<00:05:27.770> according

but<00:05:29.990> I<00:05:30.050> really<00:05:30.469> want<00:05:30.620> to<00:05:30.680> see<00:05:30.740> how<00:05:31.039> these<00:05:31.250> two

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
but I really want to see how these two

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.490 
but I really want to see how these two
teams<00:05:31.669> plan<00:05:31.969> on<00:05:32.180> continuing<00:05:32.779> the<00:05:33.229> split

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
teams plan on continuing the split

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.929 
teams plan on continuing the split
because<00:05:33.889> now<00:05:34.189> we<00:05:34.250> need<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.490> start<00:05:34.639> looking<00:05:34.729> at

00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:34.939 
because now we need to start looking at

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:36.040 
because now we need to start looking at
championship<00:05:35.449> points<00:05:35.689> when<00:05:35.810> you<00:05:35.839> start

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
championship points when you start

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.629 
championship points when you start
looking<00:05:36.080> at<00:05:36.349> the<00:05:36.620> different<00:05:36.979> ways<00:05:37.099> to<00:05:37.129> qualify

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
looking at the different ways to qualify

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.070 
looking at the different ways to qualify
from<00:05:37.789> world<00:05:38.060> either<00:05:38.240> when<00:05:38.479> the<00:05:38.599> summer<00:05:38.810> split

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
from world either when the summer split

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.990 
from world either when the summer split
you<00:05:39.650> have<00:05:39.889> the<00:05:40.039> most<00:05:40.159> championship<00:05:40.400> points<00:05:40.939> so

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
you have the most championship points so

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.670 
you have the most championship points so
you<00:05:41.089> win<00:05:41.240> the<00:05:41.330> regional<00:05:41.479> qualifier<00:05:42.050> and<00:05:42.259> for<00:05:42.649> a

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
you win the regional qualifier and for a

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.860 
you win the regional qualifier and for a
team<00:05:42.830> like<00:05:42.860> origin<00:05:43.539> championship<00:05:44.539> points<00:05:44.810> is

team like origin championship points is

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.510 
team like origin championship points is
a<00:05:44.899> difficulty<00:05:45.500> because<00:05:45.680> of<00:05:46.159> the<00:05:46.250> fact<00:05:46.399> that

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
a difficulty because of the fact that

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.920 
a difficulty because of the fact that
they<00:05:46.669> weren't<00:05:46.789> here<00:05:47.000> in<00:05:47.089> spring<00:05:47.360> so<00:05:47.779> these<00:05:47.870> are
