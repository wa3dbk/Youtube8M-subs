00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
right snare for the song so you get the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.269 
right snare for the song so you get the
best<00:00:18.510> sound<00:00:18.900> for<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.289> song<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.710> also<00:00:19.949> mic

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
placement and all that stuff is really

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.540 
placement and all that stuff is really
important<00:00:21.900> but<00:00:22.439> after<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> fact<00:00:23.220> during

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
important but after the fact during

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.250 
important but after the fact during
mixing<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.269> can<00:00:24.300> actually<00:00:24.750> manipulate<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
mixing you can actually manipulate a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.290 
mixing you can actually manipulate a
snare<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.920> sound<00:00:26.220> wildly<00:00:26.880> different

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
snare to sound wildly different

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000 
snare to sound wildly different
depending<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.109> song<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.650> if<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.830> feel

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
depending on the song so if you feel

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.529 
depending on the song so if you feel
like<00:00:29.130> you're<00:00:29.279> stuck<00:00:29.580> with<00:00:29.820> one<00:00:30.119> specific

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
like you're stuck with one specific

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.540 
like you're stuck with one specific
snare<00:00:31.140> sound<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> recording<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.520> can

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
snare sound on a recording you can

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.950 
snare sound on a recording you can
probably<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> few<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.480> these<00:00:33.600> tricks<00:00:33.840> I'm

fairly slow attack and I'm middle the
road<00:01:27.240> release<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.619> has<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> nice<00:01:29.100> punch

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520

get for a more maybe a a pop type of
song<00:02:11.110> or<00:02:11.410> something<00:02:11.590> where<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:11.830> don't<00:02:11.890> need

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
song or something where you don't need

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.130 
song or something where you don't need

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
that big thick snare you want a nice

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.110 
that big thick snare you want a nice
snappy<00:02:14.800> one<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.400> for<00:02:15.549> this<00:02:15.640> one<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.819> put<00:02:16.000> the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
snappy one so for this one I put the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.089 
snappy one so for this one I put the
compressor<00:02:16.510> first<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:17.140> really<00:02:17.530> fast<00:02:17.739> attack

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
compressor first a really fast attack

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.490 
compressor first a really fast attack
really<00:02:18.849> squashing<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.450> in<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.660> long<00:02:19.900> release<00:02:20.319> so

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
really squashing it in a long release so

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.690 
really squashing it in a long release so
that<00:02:20.530> we're<00:02:20.739> kind<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:20.980> killing<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.370> lot<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.519> that

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
that we're kind of killing a lot of that

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.369 
that we're kind of killing a lot of that
sustain<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.330> drum<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:22.780> just<00:02:23.019> getting<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
sustain of the drum and just getting the

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.800 
sustain of the drum and just getting the
snap<00:02:23.650> for<00:02:24.310> EQ<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.730> got<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.120> rid<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.569> lot<00:02:25.780> of

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
snap for EQ I got a rid of a lot of

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.900 
snap for EQ I got a rid of a lot of
mid-range<00:02:26.110> took<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.799> ring<00:02:27.129> out<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.670> boost

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
mid-range took that ring out and boost

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.949 
mid-range took that ring out and boost
it<00:02:28.090> up<00:02:28.209> around<00:02:28.709> what<00:02:29.709> is<00:02:29.799> that<00:02:29.920> about<00:02:30.010> 58<00:02:30.750> 5.8<00:02:31.750> K

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
it up around what is that about 58 5.8 K

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.039 
it up around what is that about 58 5.8 K
or<00:02:32.110> so<00:02:32.290> ended<00:02:32.950> up<00:02:33.069> with<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:33.370> sound<00:02:37.049> so

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
or so ended up with this sound so

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.080 
or so ended up with this sound so
there's<00:02:38.200> just<00:02:38.349> not<00:02:38.500> really<00:02:38.860> any<00:02:39.040> low<00:02:39.310> in<00:02:39.519> lots

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
there's just not really any low in lots

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.990 
there's just not really any low in lots
of<00:02:40.239> snap<00:02:40.569> lots<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:41.110> crack<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.190> but<00:02:42.819> not<00:02:42.940> a

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
of snap lots of crack to it but not a

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.440 
of snap lots of crack to it but not a
lot<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.269> beef<00:02:43.450> as<00:02:44.230> opposed<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.620> our<00:02:44.709> beef<00:02:44.860> track

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.300 

lot<00:02:49.450> different<00:02:49.959> same<00:02:50.230> snare<00:02:50.470> part<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:51.129> third

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
lot different same snare part the third

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.860 
lot different same snare part the third
part<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:51.790> what<00:02:52.060> I'm<00:02:52.150> gonna<00:02:52.239> call<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.569> ringy

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
part is what I'm gonna call the ringy

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.350

for<00:02:55.720> kind<00:02:55.989> of<00:02:56.079> IB<00:02:56.860> almost<00:02:57.670> like<00:02:57.989> some<00:02:58.989> of<00:02:59.079> those

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
for kind of IB almost like some of those

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.479 
for kind of IB almost like some of those
reggae<00:02:59.470> songs<00:02:59.709> where<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.010> snare<00:03:00.190> really

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
reggae songs where the snare really

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.220 
reggae songs where the snare really
rings<00:03:00.730> out<00:03:00.970> this<00:03:01.480> is<00:03:01.599> just<00:03:01.750> kind<00:03:02.049> of<00:03:02.079> taking

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
rings out this is just kind of taking

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.910 
rings out this is just kind of taking
advantage<00:03:02.470> of<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:03.400> here's<00:03:03.579> that<00:03:03.670> sound

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.050 

so<00:03:11.920> for<00:03:12.069> this<00:03:12.160> one<00:03:12.310> you're<00:03:12.400> kind<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:12.910> an

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
so for this one you're kind of an

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.120 
so for this one you're kind of an
in-between<00:03:13.660> both<00:03:13.930> your<00:03:14.260> we're<00:03:14.590> boosting<00:03:15.010> that

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
in-between both your we're boosting that

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.710 
in-between both your we're boosting that
ringing<00:03:15.430> frequency<00:03:15.970> instead<00:03:16.209> of<00:03:16.299> cutting<00:03:16.569> it

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
ringing frequency instead of cutting it

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.910 
ringing frequency instead of cutting it
we're<00:03:16.870> just<00:03:16.989> kind<00:03:17.139> of<00:03:17.170> taking<00:03:17.470> advantage<00:03:17.560> of

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
we're just kind of taking advantage of

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.650 
we're just kind of taking advantage of
that<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.250> we're<00:03:18.670> rolling<00:03:19.000> off<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.150> lot<00:03:19.480> of<00:03:19.510> the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
that and we're rolling off a lot of the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.629 
that and we're rolling off a lot of the
low-end<00:03:20.109> and<00:03:20.349> then<00:03:20.709> for<00:03:20.889> the<00:03:21.040> compressor

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
low-end and then for the compressor

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.490 
low-end and then for the compressor
we're<00:03:21.910> doing<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.239> fairly<00:03:22.750> fast<00:03:22.930> attack<00:03:23.319> and

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
we're doing a fairly fast attack and

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.410 
we're doing a fairly fast attack and
release<00:03:23.620> quick<00:03:24.370> release<00:03:24.700> here<00:03:25.000> is<00:03:25.060> gonna<00:03:25.209> help

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
release quick release here is gonna help

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.360 
release quick release here is gonna help
with<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.630> sustain<00:03:26.019> so<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:26.530> hear<00:03:26.889> that<00:03:27.010> wring

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
with the sustain so you hear that wring

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.979 
with the sustain so you hear that wring
out<00:03:27.549> a<00:03:27.579> little<00:03:27.790> bit<00:03:27.970> more<00:03:28.150> it's<00:03:28.660> not<00:03:28.750> as

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
out a little bit more it's not as

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.599 
out a little bit more it's not as
something<00:03:29.380> I<00:03:29.440> use<00:03:29.620> as<00:03:29.769> much<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.130> use<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.400> beef

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
and the snap a lot more than I do the

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.539 
and the snap a lot more than I do the
ring<00:03:32.319> but<00:03:32.829> it's<00:03:32.950> good<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.069> know<00:03:33.160> how<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.400> get

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
ring but it's good to know how to get

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.250 
ring but it's good to know how to get
