00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.670
 very good afternoon here as we come 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.790
 explaining throughout our project 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.010
 our document is basically a 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.219
 engine that is controlled by 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.650
 programming of arduino speeds like 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.480
 we can see here our flour 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.490
 that is connected to each of the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.300
 elements and components that we are going to 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.730
 need 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.450
 within our program as we can 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:34.510
 see here we have 5 LEDs connected on 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:37.120
 green tells us the speed 0 1 2 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.789
 three and four are five speeds 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.339
 starting to count from zero then here 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.859
 we have what our vows 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.750
 basically I'm here serves to go 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:50.469
 increasing this speed to go 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.839
 descending then here we have indicated 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:56.760
 what is our engine as you can see 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.760
 the engine has an opening 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.250
 this opening helps us to give a 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.920
 counting how our engine is turning 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.140
 that the number of laps is giving as 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.990
 we achieve this basically here we have 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.140
 a horseshoe sensor with what we can 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.140
 watch 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:21.930
 to him is connected a led the led 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.780
 indicating with this opening the sensor of 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.820
 horseshoe go detecting this 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.810
 as it could be said then the step of 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.810
 current current flow 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.070
 exactly the current step looks 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.159
 reflected on the led as we can see 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.320
 and every time the presence is happening 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.020
 of the led through the opening that has the 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.310
 this engine is accumulating one then this 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.909
 means that it is increasing if the 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.359
 turns 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.069
 and then if this is this the 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.270
 general operation of our 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.579
 draft 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.920
 and I hope it is of your help here 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.310
 a small practice an example and how 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.310
 works 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.950
 pressing the button that 's the speed 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.619
 zero that the engine does not work as it 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.090
 can tell the speed where 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.960
 starts spinning with little speed has been 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.430
 given slowly 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.680
 how are you increasing the switch 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.970
 comprising a led and increasing the 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.470
 engine speed 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.070
 here we are going to move on to what is the 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.070
 speed 3 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.060
 finally the speed 4 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.090
 stop now 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.180
 and going down we have what our 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.099
 button 2 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.200
 and there you can see how they are going 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.829
 shutting down the freights as we go 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.829
 pressing 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.549
 and until you reach zero speed and 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.549
 finally turn our project
