00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 What's up to a lot of friends? 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.540
 lower and gaming tv and cordial 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.230
 Welcome to 44 episode of our pack 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.120
 road to glory 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.800
 we are just on the tau stack 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.269
 actually, as always, we have one more 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.679
 contract card left over we will 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.109
 Of course, directly back on it 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.910
 now come directly to the first pack 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.289
 this episode and at the same time to 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.039
 Last, so we will only this time 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.619
 move in 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.019
 and the name fellaini is puffed up 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.910
 and the guy is just over kracher there 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.779
 we still have renato who comes to it and 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.210
 Fellaini 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.640
 he really had very good stats 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.110
 really smart body and his afro is 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.760
 of course, very chic, too 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.739
 comes to and from but to have seen 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.129
 and of course that's absurd 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.739
 fast 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.170
 he can go down the line until he 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.090
 It will come naturally and the rest 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.460
 Let's just take it easy 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.719
 we are here in our jan at ours 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.969
 teams and now play with 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.350
 our premier league team with it 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.570
 of course always such a critical thing 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.730
 with the formation and we have here 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.440
 again these other chic jerseys 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.600
 play is chosen but again 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.879
 with our gladbach jerseys and the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.250
 opponent has the following team a 4-2-3-1 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.340
 that looks very German to the same 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.619
 on the defense there are three others 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.000
 nationalities with represented then it works 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.010
 also start directly with the first scene 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.630
 ramirez forwarded to the ball and then 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.430
 the beautiful pass in the gap and nasri 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.439
 failed because of the goalkeeper doing really 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.540
 first the first combination on 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.159
 witty but absolutely we have the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.960
 first chance seen by the opponent and then 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.430
 We could have been through valencia 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.630
 he is now dribbling with the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.340
 roulette with the superior 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.650
 barlachstadt draws the opponents 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.329
 now on the gate in the 1600 still the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.640
 Goalkeeper in front of him at the lattice 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.570
 and then such a conclusion against the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.130
 outside post 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.290
 there just has to go into the empty gate 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.689
 and then it's time for that 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.030
 debut of fellaini comes in for 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.560
 kaka and ramires then return to the central 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.450
 offensive midfield now we have 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.009
 valencia again on the ball of as just 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.450
 gone well but the conclusion 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.549
 just is not one hundred percent 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.219
 and now we climb the second half 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.130
 a silan ballo you with the 0 2 1 for 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.509
 the opponent in about 50 minutes like that 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.490
 let's go we have the fat ones 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.540
 chances of the opponents then pretty much that 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.369
 first time from the gate 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.750
 and then rings and has here too 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.840
 directly the next chance but the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.670
 Goalkeeper was in a good mood today 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.250
 But today the corner of lass gets caught 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.489
 you have entered and there are ours 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.110
 mistake with the head and afro the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.580
 really clean with his hair 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.010
 moved look at the again 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.450
 does not rise like a building lion bull 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.260
 chance someone higher there 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.730
 intervene 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.830
 yes and unfortunately it is already 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.230
 been the game's over one to 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.610
 One we separate ourselves from the opponent so there 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.959
 we could really just so the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.019
 but it was also 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.299
 Highly deserved you just have to say 460 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.769
 coins come on our account and unfortunately 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.120
 So we do not stay unfortunately 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.890
 we can stay but unfortunately we can 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.750
 Do not get the league title again 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.340
 that's my goal or should that be 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.849
 actually be the goal that times too 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.500
 create 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.470
 and now we will be with ours 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.120
 Italian series a team with right 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.150
 a lot of flair against the coming 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.739
 opponent that means office united and his 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.019
 team does not even look that way 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.940
 bad from eto'o with 68 ps of course 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.650
 well-known phenomena that right 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.060
 then, of course, he has david there 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.739
 luiz and the scene in the 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.180
 home defense and we jump too 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.769
 right in the first scene we are 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.989
 of course very well done on the ball 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.440
 Schewski with the easy but against the 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.560
 bar 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.450
 So the pitch does not tear off always latte 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.549
 post aluminum as well as in the 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.350
 previous episodes but we leave that 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.950
 Do not get up and sit pepe on the ball 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.170
 moves in the 16er with the exaggerated 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.730
 thursday of people 17 minutes straight 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.190
 played and then one 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.870
 beautiful goal lip goes so much 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.269
 Tempo in the 16er one and the 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.470
 optimally used we are 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.450
 then in the next scene for the 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.099
 opponent of the blasphemy not long with 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.200
 wait for the equalizer 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.180
 salad makes that rather clarified there was 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.069
 the sow's distribution pretty bad 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.030
 but of course we keep trying 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.829
 to make another goal 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.870
 The goalkeeper gets the man but the 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.430
 scene is not over yet drops off 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.109
 and shear gets the ball but 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.880
 Unfortunately, the goalkeeper is there and we can 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.190
 this advantage is not in our favor 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.239
 we use the 32 minute jump now 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.889
 marcellino on the ball 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.290
 Until then, there were many opportunities 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.030
 really, really a lot we only had 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.590
 Really good options here 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.419
 but now to achieve a lead 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.370
 the opponent on the ball and then one 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.599
 unnecessary slide I was then with the 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.760
 nerves in the end be 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.270
 I do not know ten chances just that 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.070
 actually all would have 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.680
 can be in and now eto'o the runs 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.510
 and he makes just once the one 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.710
 We are still lying to two now 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.290
 That's how it goes in the back 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.300
 now really big but what comes 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.650
 bock has the equalizer here 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.570
 Achieve now pulls the line along 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.970
 passes and then he speaks in the 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.830
 16er one is now rebuilt so for 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.810
 my circumstances for my view 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.250
 clear elfmeter I do not know what the 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.110
 the referee saw 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.640
 but we'll let it go again 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.250
 do not let it go on over 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.990
 lazaridis palazzo but can you please me 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.420
 explain why the advice takes the head 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.460
 and me his right packed foot and 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.050
 Just take a look here 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.940
 we also see the superiority 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.060
 one in the chances of two opponents 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.380
 Shots and 22 shots from goals 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.510
 of which three gates that one again 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.580
 logic of ea definitely you go 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.800
 continue directly the next chance in the 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.110
 second half of the will be blocked off 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.940
 corner comes in and there is the 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.330
 steam but what does the goalkeeper do there 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.730
 again 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.400
 So bad luck, there is really no more 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.230
 we're already 1 3 behind and then 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.540
 it continues after 65 minutes now paypal 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.130
 passes by vargas must now 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.820
 insert and just shoot the 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.590
 goal area 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.300
 So I was really crazy 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.070
 really pissed during the game 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.990
 but of course we keep going 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.060
 with palacio nice pass in the course of 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.980
 but Wagner failed again on 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.510
 Goalkeeper Pepe gets his ball pulled 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.100
 then has to go over in the sixteen rows 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.780
 then only one opponent in front of the 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.820
 Leicester stand with the superior 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.860
 if he passes, it will be clear 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.790
 and that just has to do that 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.260
 give eleven meters 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.750
 That's it, too, and that's one 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.420
 case for the felled self pepe runs 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.370
 standing on the left and in the middle just once 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.590
 it popped into the middle of the goalkeeper 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.090
 decides for a corner and thus 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.350
 he is wrong so the 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.150
 connecting hit 23 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.919
 everything still open we can do the game 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.720
 yet for us now but decide to 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.190
 rate is sent with the block v and 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.180
 he goes against the post 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.860
 There we have a little bit more 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.000
 otherwise luck would have been the game now 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.830
 already decided but now 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.480
 jankovic just raved david 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.040
 luiz the first real art container 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.410
 probably sits there all day 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.940
 in the container and has nothing to do 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.070
 and now it goes on the enemy 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.290
 but again , the flank brings a lot 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.940
 faintly defended the feet of mikel 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.000
 arteta and the without problems 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.440
 just under 90 minutes with the 2 2 4 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.120
 and there I have one again 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.620
 scene for you palace has been sent 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.750
 the difficulties in the ball with it 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.430
 take and ultimately is the lottery 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.110
 only free in front of the gate but the bangs 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.270
 the ball against cost so here 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.340
 but symbolically that's not the case 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.590
 palacio ran a lot with difficulties 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.479
 to take along and of course 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.280
 still sciarrino against the post thus 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:47.290
 the player is over too 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.150
 lose two to 4 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.650
 bitter bitter is the whole that was that 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.330
 first game in the new league 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.310
 respectively in the new season and 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.040
 directly to a defeat 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.760
 It's really shit like that 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.380
 you can call it 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.389
 and that's why we have to be in the next 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.639
 Episode all the more gas that we give 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:05.380
 real victory can drive that was it 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.889
 from me until next time skin in 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.889
 and ciao
