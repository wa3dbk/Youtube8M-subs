00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
pots the pots actually took from another

texture<00:02:33.850> pack<00:02:34.030> these<00:02:34.390> aren't<00:02:34.570> mine<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.110> only

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
texture pack these aren't mine the only

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.860 
texture pack these aren't mine the only
really<00:02:35.530> custom<00:02:36.220> part<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.970> survival<00:02:37.840> mode

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
really custom part is the survival mode

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.900 
really custom part is the survival mode
to<00:02:38.140> inventory<00:02:40.350> see<00:02:41.350> what<00:02:41.500> else<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.920> grass<00:02:42.489> and

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
to inventory see what else the grass and

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.910 
to inventory see what else the grass and
I'm<00:02:43.270> think<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.840> logs<00:02:44.020> would<00:02:44.290> cost<00:02:44.440> them<00:02:44.590> also

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
I'm think the logs would cost them also

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.760 
I'm think the logs would cost them also
but<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.060> rest<00:02:46.239> are<00:02:46.360> just<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.690> combination<00:02:47.380> of

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
but the rest are just a combination of

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.340 
but the rest are just a combination of
my<00:02:47.950> favorite<00:02:48.549> parts<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.840> other<00:02:50.049> texture
