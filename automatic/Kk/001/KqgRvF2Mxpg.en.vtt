Fisher<00:01:58.709> it's<00:01:59.459> gonna<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.789> testing<00:02:00.149> out<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
Fisher it's gonna be testing out the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.910 
Fisher it's gonna be testing out the
motor<00:02:00.629> on<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.840> pro<00:02:01.080> Fisher<00:02:01.379> with<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> slightly

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.089 
motor on the pro Fisher with a slightly
smaller<00:02:02.340> battery<00:02:02.879> and<00:02:03.860> hopefully<00:02:04.860> we'll<00:02:05.009> be

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:05.099 
smaller battery and hopefully we'll be

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:06.380 
smaller battery and hopefully we'll be
able<00:02:05.190> to<00:02:05.280> land<00:02:05.459> a<00:02:05.580> few<00:02:05.729> fish<00:02:05.970> while<00:02:06.179> we're<00:02:06.300> at

able to land a few fish while we're at

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.320 
able to land a few fish while we're at
it<00:02:06.440> definitely<00:02:07.440> looks<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:07.649> fishy<00:02:07.979> territory
