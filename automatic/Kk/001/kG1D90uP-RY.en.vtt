00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.420 
the day but I'll ease up on the
antioxidant<00:04:22.750> sometimes<00:04:23.110> but<00:04:23.860> think<00:04:24.100> it<00:04:24.190> drink

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
antioxidant sometimes but think it drink

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.070 
antioxidant sometimes but think it drink
it<00:04:24.490> throughout<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.729> day<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.180> then<00:04:25.389> through

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
it throughout the day and then through

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.420 
it throughout the day and then through
my<00:04:26.940> weight<00:04:27.940> lifting<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.540> into<00:04:28.990> my<00:04:29.110> cardio<00:04:29.440> but

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
my weight lifting and into my cardio but

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.050 
my weight lifting and into my cardio but
then<00:04:30.550> additionally<00:04:31.210> I<00:04:31.450> will<00:04:31.690> take<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:33.430> BCAAs

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
then additionally I will take the BCAAs

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.930 
then additionally I will take the BCAAs
in<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.300> form<00:04:34.600> of<00:04:34.630> capsules

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
in the form of capsules

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.379 
in the form of capsules
so<00:04:37.470> capsules<00:04:38.470> there's<00:04:39.430> different<00:04:39.880> dosages

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
so capsules there's different dosages

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.200 
so capsules there's different dosages
but<00:04:40.870> I<00:04:40.900> aim<00:04:41.320> for<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:42.070> non-caloric<00:04:42.669> version

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
but I aim for the non-caloric version

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.420 
but I aim for the non-caloric version
there<00:04:43.630> are<00:04:43.830> pay<00:04:44.830> attention<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.280> that<00:04:45.370> too

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
there are pay attention to that too

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.420 
there are pay attention to that too
because<00:04:45.639> if<00:04:45.940> you're<00:04:46.090> on<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:47.430> calorie

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
because if you're on a calorie

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.420 
because if you're on a calorie
restricted<00:04:48.970> diet<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.570> you're<00:04:50.200> taking<00:04:50.530> in<00:04:50.680> be

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
restricted diet and you're taking in be

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.190 
restricted diet and you're taking in be
today's<00:04:51.820> that<00:04:52.060> have<00:04:52.150> calories<00:04:52.419> and<00:04:52.930> you're

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
today's that have calories and you're

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.950 
today's that have calories and you're
taking<00:04:53.500> quite<00:04:53.650> a<00:04:53.710> few<00:04:53.950> of<00:04:54.039> them<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:55.600> calories

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
taking quite a few of them the calories

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.330 
taking quite a few of them the calories
can<00:04:56.110> add<00:04:56.229> up<00:04:56.320> quite<00:04:56.560> quickly<00:04:56.800> like<00:04:57.160> one

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
can add up quite quickly like one

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.279 
can add up quite quickly like one
serving<00:04:57.729> can<00:04:57.880> be<00:04:58.000> as<00:04:58.090> many<00:04:58.240> as<00:04:58.330> 15<00:04:58.750> calories<00:04:59.110> if

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
serving can be as many as 15 calories if

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:00.740 
serving can be as many as 15 calories if
you're<00:04:59.410> doing<00:04:59.530> that<00:04:59.710> five<00:05:00.100> six<00:05:00.340> times<00:05:00.550> a<00:05:00.640> day

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
you're doing that five six times a day

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.210 
you're doing that five six times a day
that's<00:05:01.750> a<00:05:01.810> meal<00:05:01.960> so<00:05:02.760> I<00:05:03.990> just<00:05:04.990> cross<00:05:05.740> board

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
that's a meal so I just cross board

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.860 
that's a meal so I just cross board
aim<00:05:06.340> for<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.700> non-caloric<00:05:07.180> in<00:05:07.419> this<00:05:07.600> you'll

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
aim for the non-caloric in this you'll

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.330 
aim for the non-caloric in this you'll
see<00:05:08.080> on<00:05:08.229> there<00:05:08.410> BCAAs

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
see on there BCAAs

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.050 
see on there BCAAs
all<00:05:09.460> it<00:05:09.640> should<00:05:09.789> have<00:05:09.880> in<00:05:10.030> it

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
all it should have in it

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.630 
all it should have in it
leucine<00:05:11.900> isoleucine<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.620> valine<00:05:13.160> those<00:05:13.430> are

leucine isoleucine and valine those are

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.040 
leucine isoleucine and valine those are
your<00:05:13.820> branched<00:05:14.060> amino<00:05:14.210> acids<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:14.930> then<00:05:15.020> a

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
your branched amino acids and then a

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.570 
your branched amino acids and then a
couple<00:05:15.350> of<00:05:15.440> ingredients<00:05:15.680> like<00:05:16.070> gelatin

magnesium<00:05:17.090> no<00:05:17.660> big<00:05:17.780> deal<00:05:17.900> so<00:05:18.380> I<00:05:18.410> take<00:05:18.680> a<00:05:18.950> dosage

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
magnesium no big deal so I take a dosage

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.940 
magnesium no big deal so I take a dosage
of<00:05:19.880> these<00:05:20.030> and<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.360> dosages<00:05:21.080> range<00:05:21.380> from<00:05:21.680> two

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
of these and the dosages range from two

brand<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:24.140> everything<00:05:24.560> that<00:05:24.800> you're<00:05:24.890> gonna

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
brand and everything that you're gonna

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.670 
brand and everything that you're gonna
get<00:05:25.190> but<00:05:25.520> for<00:05:26.180> me<00:05:26.270> it's<00:05:26.420> three<00:05:26.720> I<00:05:26.900> take<00:05:27.350> three

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
get but for me it's three I take three

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.920 
get but for me it's three I take three
before<00:05:28.130> I<00:05:28.340> start<00:05:28.610> my<00:05:28.670> workout<00:05:29.000> and<00:05:29.300> if<00:05:29.810> it's

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
before I start my workout and if it's

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.330 
before I start my workout and if it's
going<00:05:30.080> to<00:05:30.140> be<00:05:30.260> a<00:05:30.290> few<00:05:30.530> minutes<00:05:30.800> before<00:05:31.010> I'm

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
going to be a few minutes before I'm

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.780 
going to be a few minutes before I'm
going<00:05:31.460> to<00:05:31.520> get<00:05:31.640> my<00:05:31.820> post-workout<00:05:32.480> shake<00:05:32.540> and

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
going to get my post-workout shake and

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.340 
going to get my post-workout shake and
carbohydrate<00:05:34.790> in<00:05:34.970> then<00:05:35.390> I'll<00:05:35.570> take<00:05:35.810> a<00:05:35.840> dose<00:05:36.080> at

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
carbohydrate in then I'll take a dose at

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.940 
carbohydrate in then I'll take a dose at
the<00:05:36.440> end<00:05:36.590> of<00:05:36.710> my<00:05:36.830> workout<00:05:37.790> as<00:05:37.940> well<00:05:37.970> and<00:05:38.950> that's

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
the end of my workout as well and that's

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.400 
the end of my workout as well and that's
pretty<00:05:40.070> much<00:05:40.220> my<00:05:40.400> idea<00:05:40.430> that's<00:05:40.790> how<00:05:40.940> I

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
pretty much my idea that's how I

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.460 
pretty much my idea that's how I
surround<00:05:42.410> myself<00:05:43.420> inside<00:05:44.420> with<00:05:45.020> the

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
surround myself inside with the

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.890 
surround myself inside with the
available<00:05:45.830> BCAAs<00:05:46.490> to<00:05:46.940> help<00:05:47.240> maintain<00:05:47.450> that

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
available BCAAs to help maintain that

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.960 
available BCAAs to help maintain that
muscle<00:05:48.230> mass<00:05:48.410> I<00:05:48.620> work<00:05:48.830> so<00:05:49.010> hard<00:05:49.040> to<00:05:49.250> rob<00:05:49.460> and<00:05:49.760> if

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
muscle mass I work so hard to rob and if

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.610 
muscle mass I work so hard to rob and if
you<00:05:50.150> are<00:05:51.130> restricting<00:05:52.130> your<00:05:52.780> calories<00:05:53.780> a<00:05:54.170> lot

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
you are restricting your calories a lot

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.390 
you are restricting your calories a lot
for<00:05:54.830> some<00:05:55.010> reason<00:05:55.370> first<00:05:55.880> going<00:05:56.240> into<00:05:56.330> show

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
for some reason first going into show

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.780 
for some reason first going into show
it's<00:05:58.400> a<00:05:58.550> good<00:05:58.760> thing<00:05:59.060> to<00:05:59.420> take<00:06:00.200> the<00:06:00.590> BCAAs<00:06:01.310> in

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
it's a good thing to take the BCAAs in

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.320 
it's a good thing to take the BCAAs in
between<00:06:02.720> meals<00:06:03.290> as<00:06:03.980> well<00:06:04.040> so<00:06:04.730> that<00:06:04.880> you<00:06:05.030> don't

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
between meals as well so that you don't

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.510 
between meals as well so that you don't
sacrifice<00:06:06.110> that<00:06:06.590> that<00:06:06.920> lee

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
sacrifice that that lee

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.909 
sacrifice that that lee
and<00:06:07.610> I<00:06:08.300> will<00:06:08.750> put<00:06:09.139> together<00:06:09.289> a<00:06:10.990> drink<00:06:11.990> pretty

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 
and I will put together a drink pretty

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.159 
and I will put together a drink pretty
much<00:06:13.130> with<00:06:13.340> just<00:06:13.610> the<00:06:13.729> green<00:06:13.910> tea<00:06:14.210> and<00:06:14.539> the

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
much with just the green tea and the

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.960 
much with just the green tea and the
BCAAs<00:06:15.830> a<00:06:16.250> powder<00:06:17.180> in<00:06:17.509> the<00:06:18.500> water<00:06:18.650> and<00:06:18.979> then<00:06:19.699> add

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
BCAAs a powder in the water and then add

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.430 
BCAAs a powder in the water and then add
a<00:06:20.000> packet<00:06:20.419> of<00:06:20.479> stevia<00:06:20.840> if<00:06:20.930> I<00:06:21.020> want<00:06:21.199> it<00:06:21.259> to<00:06:21.349> be

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
a packet of stevia if I want it to be
