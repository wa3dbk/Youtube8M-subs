 the songs whether I sing that 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.150
 I compose to get the best out of what 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.580
 I have a little saved so many things from 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.869
 love as things of indifference to me always 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.050

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.280
 express myself as I tell you to 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.640

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.670
