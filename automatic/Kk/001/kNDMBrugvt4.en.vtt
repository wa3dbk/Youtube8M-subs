that if this couple should have another
child<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.859> child<00:00:29.189> will<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.939> sickle<00:00:30.420> cell

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
child the child will have sickle cell

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.080 
child the child will have sickle cell
anemia<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.410> if<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.309> think<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.910> can

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
anemia and if you think that you can

answer with my answer and explanation
and<00:00:44.870> I<00:00:45.870> want<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.950> start<00:00:47.360> solving<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.719> problem

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
and I want to start solving this problem

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.910 
and I want to start solving this problem
by<00:00:50.489> drawing<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:51.149> pedigree<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.989> both<00:00:52.320> families

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
by drawing a pedigree of both families

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.760 
by drawing a pedigree of both families
so<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.940> know<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.590> parents<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:57.920> Curan<00:00:58.920> and

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
so we know that parents of the Curan and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:07.730 
so we know that parents of the Curan and
Steve<00:01:03.140> doesn't<00:01:04.189> show<00:01:05.810> this<00:01:06.810> genetic

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
Steve doesn't show this genetic

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.929 
Steve doesn't show this genetic
disorders<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.530> don't<00:01:10.890> feel<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.580> solid

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
disorders so I don't feel we solid

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.960 
disorders so I don't feel we solid
calcium<00:01:12.920> because<00:01:13.920> they<00:01:14.100> finna<00:01:14.400> typically

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
calcium because they finna typically

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.539 
calcium because they finna typically
normal<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.909> we<00:01:17.909> also<00:01:18.150> know<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:19.549> each

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
normal and we also know that in each

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.240 
normal and we also know that in each
family<00:01:22.220> one<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.640> child<00:01:24.950> one<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
family one of the child one of the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.580 
family one of the child one of the
children<00:01:26.729> would<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.829> affected<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:31.590> means

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
children would be affected so that means

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.950 
children would be affected so that means
that<00:01:35.420> this<00:01:36.439> children<00:01:37.670> would<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:39.030> two

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
that this children would have two

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.359 
that this children would have two
recessive<00:01:40.740> alleles<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:42.110> right<00:01:43.110> away<00:01:43.310> now<00:01:44.310> we

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
recessive alleles so right away now we

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.670 
recessive alleles so right away now we
can<00:01:46.759> say<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:48.079> they<00:01:49.079> are<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.470> be

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
can say that they are going to be

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.870 
can say that they are going to be
homozygous<00:01:50.210> recessive<00:01:51.409> so<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.729> to

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
homozygous recessive so this is going to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.840 
homozygous recessive so this is going to
be<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.270> example<00:01:54.659> if<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.899> use<00:01:55.009> small<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.250> to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
be for example if I use small a to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.630 
be for example if I use small a to
designate<00:01:57.320> recessive<00:01:58.320> allele<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.719> two

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
designate recessive allele so two

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.399 
designate recessive allele so two
recessive<00:02:02.640> alleles<00:02:03.180> would<00:02:03.540> means<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.079> this

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
recessive alleles would means that this

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.459 
recessive alleles would means that this
is<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.719> affected<00:02:06.719> person<00:02:07.229> with

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
is going to be affected person with

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.580 
is going to be affected person with
sickle<00:02:07.829> cell<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.280> another<00:02:09.179> family<00:02:09.780> also<00:02:10.379> has

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
sickle cell and another family also has

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.589 
sickle cell and another family also has
a<00:02:10.619> child<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.220> would<00:02:11.520> be<00:02:11.840> affected<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.050> all

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
a child that would be affected so all

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.789 
a child that would be affected so all
small<00:02:14.079> a<00:02:14.290> small<00:02:15.129> a<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:16.090> now<00:02:16.299> we<00:02:16.359> know<00:02:16.799> genotypes

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
small a small a so now we know genotypes

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:23.989 
small a small a so now we know genotypes
of<00:02:18.180> two<00:02:19.180> siblings<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:21.359> also<00:02:22.359> that<00:02:22.840> means<00:02:23.079> that

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:23.999 
of two siblings and also that means that

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:28.860 
of two siblings and also that means that
their<00:02:24.999> parents<00:02:25.900> those<00:02:26.290> they<00:02:27.129> look<00:02:27.870> normally

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
their parents those they look normally

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.550 
their parents those they look normally
in<00:02:29.799> a<00:02:29.889> typically<00:02:30.219> normal<00:02:30.750> both<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.959> them<00:02:32.200> must

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
in a typically normal both of them must

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.289 
in a typically normal both of them must
carry<00:02:33.599> one<00:02:34.599> recessive<00:02:35.139> allele<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:36.299> this

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
carry one recessive allele so this

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.330 
carry one recessive allele so this
parent<00:02:37.689> must<00:02:38.170> be<00:02:38.469> heterozygous<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.639> this<00:02:40.450> one

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
parent must be heterozygous and this one

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.909 
parent must be heterozygous and this one
so<00:02:42.629> we<00:02:43.629> also<00:02:43.870> can<00:02:44.079> use<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:46.540> can<00:02:46.569> also<00:02:47.019> fill<00:02:47.739> in

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:47.919 
so we also can use you can also fill in

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:51.599 
so we also can use you can also fill in
half<00:02:48.430> each<00:02:49.000> box<00:02:49.389> to<00:02:49.659> represent<00:02:50.609> heterozygous

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
half each box to represent heterozygous

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:58.470 
half each box to represent heterozygous
form<00:02:52.230> or<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:55.079> parents<00:02:56.079> would<00:02:56.290> be<00:02:56.530> occurs<00:02:57.480> so

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
form or that parents would be occurs so

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.740 
form or that parents would be occurs so

also capital a small a here and capital
a<00:03:01.870> small<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:03.069> here<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:03.699> this<00:03:03.879> is<00:03:04.060> going<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.510> be

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
a small a here so this is going to be

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.580 
a small a here so this is going to be
current<00:03:05.109> and<00:03:07.829> this<00:03:08.829> is<00:03:09.010> going<00:03:09.219> to<00:03:09.430> be<00:03:09.579> Steve

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
current and this is going to be Steve

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.819 
current and this is going to be Steve
and<00:03:13.349> now<00:03:14.349> we<00:03:15.099> have<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.489> find<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:16.209> probability

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
and now we have to find the probability

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.170 
and now we have to find the probability
for<00:03:17.829> them<00:03:18.069> to<00:03:18.430> have<00:03:18.669> affected<00:03:19.299> child<00:03:19.629> and<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:22.060> am

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
for them to have affected child and I am

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.170 
for them to have affected child and I am
using<00:03:22.599> rhombus<00:03:23.439> because<00:03:24.040> gender<00:03:25.030> is<00:03:25.150> not

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
using rhombus because gender is not

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.439 
using rhombus because gender is not
specified<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.319> this<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:26.739> not<00:03:26.949> important<00:03:27.489> for

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:28.449 
specified and this is not important for

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:32.309 
specified and this is not important for
our<00:03:28.739> calculations<00:03:29.739> so<00:03:30.579> now<00:03:31.509> we<00:03:31.569> have<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.049> find

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
our calculations so now we have to find

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.309 
our calculations so now we have to find
the<00:03:32.530> probability<00:03:32.829> for<00:03:33.609> Steve<00:03:33.939> occurring<00:03:34.810> to

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
the probability for Steve occurring to

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.530 
the probability for Steve occurring to
be<00:03:35.470> carriers<00:03:35.949> and<00:03:36.250> how<00:03:36.729> we<00:03:36.790> are<00:03:36.970> going<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.389> do

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
be carriers and how we are going to do

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.749 
be carriers and how we are going to do
it<00:03:37.689> we<00:03:38.470> are<00:03:38.590> going<00:03:38.889> to<00:03:39.870> solve<00:03:40.870> this

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:41.759 
it we are going to solve this

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:45.179 
it we are going to solve this
probabilities<00:03:42.759> by<00:03:42.970> drawing<00:03:43.299> a<00:03:44.189> punnett

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:45.189 
probabilities by drawing a punnett

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.719 
probabilities by drawing a punnett
square

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:45.729 
square

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:48.089 
square
so<00:03:45.970> we<00:03:46.659> know<00:03:46.840> that<00:03:47.109> both<00:03:47.379> parents<00:03:47.949> are

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
so we know that both parents are

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.659 
so we know that both parents are
heterozygous<00:03:49.019> so<00:03:50.019> we<00:03:50.229> would<00:03:50.409> use<00:03:50.680> people<00:03:51.519> a

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
heterozygous so we would use people a

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:56.009 
heterozygous so we would use people a
small<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.389> for<00:03:52.750> one<00:03:53.319> side<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:54.329> capital<00:03:55.329> a<00:03:55.479> small

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
a for the other side and now let's find

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.390 
a for the other side and now let's find
the<00:04:00.519> probability<00:04:01.439> for<00:04:03.030> parents<00:04:04.030> of<00:04:04.229> both

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
the probability for parents of both

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.390 
the probability for parents of both
Steve<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.430> current<00:04:07.469> to<00:04:08.469> have<00:04:08.739> affected

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
Steve and current to have affected

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.749 
Steve and current to have affected
children<00:04:10.359> so<00:04:11.109> here<00:04:11.590> they<00:04:12.039> would<00:04:12.219> have<00:04:12.250> people

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:12.759 
children so here they would have people

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:16.529 
children so here they would have people

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
have affected child

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.990 
have affected child
would<00:04:27.610> be<00:04:27.880> 1<00:04:28.630> out<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:29.020> 4<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:31.210> 1<00:04:31.510> out<00:04:32.199> of<00:04:32.260> 4<00:04:33.000> would

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
would be 1 out of 4 so 1 out of 4 would

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.469 
would be 1 out of 4 so 1 out of 4 would
be<00:04:34.229> chances<00:04:35.229> to<00:04:35.380> have<00:04:35.590> affected<00:04:36.160> baby<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:36.699> as

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
be chances to have affected baby and as

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.570 
be chances to have affected baby and as
you<00:04:37.690> see<00:04:38.100> each<00:04:39.780> family<00:04:40.780> have<00:04:41.590> such<00:04:42.160> a<00:04:42.190> child

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
you see each family have such a child

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.770 
you see each family have such a child
and<00:04:43.229> also<00:04:44.229> they<00:04:44.560> would<00:04:44.800> have<00:04:46.229> three<00:04:48.720> out<00:04:49.720> of

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
and also they would have three out of

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.870 
and also they would have three out of
four<00:04:50.790> chances<00:04:52.650> to<00:04:53.650> have<00:04:53.889> in<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.460> typically

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
four chances to have in a typically

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.990 
four chances to have in a typically
normal<00:04:56.340> children<00:04:57.340> so<00:04:58.000> three<00:04:58.540> out<00:04:58.810> of<00:04:58.870> four

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
normal children so three out of four

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.590 
normal children so three out of four
phenotypically<00:05:01.000> normal<00:05:01.199> children<00:05:02.199> but<00:05:03.600> as

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
phenotypically normal children but as

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.270 
phenotypically normal children but as
you<00:05:05.139> can<00:05:05.770> see<00:05:06.660> two<00:05:07.660> of<00:05:07.690> them<00:05:09.150> would<00:05:10.150> be

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
you can see two of them would be

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.010 
you can see two of them would be
carriers<00:05:12.280> or<00:05:12.580> heterozygous<00:05:13.530> so<00:05:14.530> as<00:05:14.830> you<00:05:15.100> see

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
carriers or heterozygous so as you see

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.640 
carriers or heterozygous so as you see
two<00:05:17.020> out<00:05:17.289> of<00:05:17.350> three<00:05:18.220> phenotypically<00:05:19.150> normal

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
two out of three phenotypically normal

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.610 
two out of three phenotypically normal
children<00:05:20.650> would<00:05:21.580> be<00:05:22.320> carriers<00:05:23.320> or

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
children would be carriers or

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.040 
children would be carriers or
heterozygous<00:05:24.220> so<00:05:24.820> that<00:05:25.630> means<00:05:25.919> two<00:05:26.919> out<00:05:27.820> of

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
heterozygous so that means two out of

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.770 
heterozygous so that means two out of
three<00:05:29.050> chances<00:05:29.560> so<00:05:30.130> for<00:05:30.460> Steve<00:05:30.760> to<00:05:31.360> be<00:05:31.539> a

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
three chances so for Steve to be a

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.589 
three chances so for Steve to be a
carrier<00:05:32.410> chances<00:05:33.370> would<00:05:33.580> be<00:05:33.789> two<00:05:34.270> out<00:05:34.539> of

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
carrier chances would be two out of

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.580 
carrier chances would be two out of
three<00:05:35.410> and<00:05:35.680> for<00:05:36.520> the<00:05:36.700> current<00:05:37.150> alsa<00:05:37.660> chances

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
three and for the current alsa chances

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.050 
three and for the current alsa chances
would<00:05:38.770> be<00:05:38.979> two<00:05:39.550> out<00:05:39.820> of<00:05:40.650> three

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
would be two out of three

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.930 
would be two out of three
once<00:05:43.479> again<00:05:44.880> this<00:05:46.889> current<00:05:47.889> and<00:05:48.039> Steve<00:05:48.669> are

phenotypically normal but chances for

phenotypically normal but chances for

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
them to be heterozygous for this trait

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.629 
them to be heterozygous for this trait
or<00:05:54.250> have<00:05:55.090> one<00:05:55.389> recessive<00:05:56.199> allele<00:05:56.680> would<00:05:57.370> be

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
or have one recessive allele would be

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:03.719

two<00:05:57.910> out<00:05:58.180> of<00:05:58.260> three<00:05:59.310> so<00:06:01.590> now<00:06:02.590> we<00:06:02.650> can<00:06:03.070> solve

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
two out of three so now we can solve

to<00:06:13.180> multiply<00:06:13.800> all<00:06:14.800> these<00:06:15.310> probabilities<00:06:16.440> so

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
to multiply all these probabilities so

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.370 
to multiply all these probabilities so
what<00:06:17.949> is<00:06:18.130> the<00:06:18.310> probability<00:06:18.669> for<00:06:19.389> the<00:06:19.570> current

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
what is the probability for the current

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.080 
what is the probability for the current
to<00:06:21.099> be<00:06:22.139> heterozygous<00:06:23.139> for<00:06:23.440> this<00:06:23.789> trait<00:06:24.789> and

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
to be heterozygous for this trait and

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.080 
to be heterozygous for this trait and
this<00:06:25.720> is<00:06:25.870> going<00:06:26.110> to<00:06:26.260> be<00:06:26.410> two<00:06:26.680> out<00:06:27.220> of<00:06:27.280> three

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
this is going to be two out of three

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.040 
this is going to be two out of three
chances<00:06:28.630> and<00:06:28.870> we<00:06:29.860> have<00:06:30.160> two<00:06:30.400> x<00:06:30.940> chances<00:06:31.870> of

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
chances and we have two x chances of

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.629 
chances and we have two x chances of
Steve<00:06:32.530> to<00:06:32.860> be<00:06:33.010> carrier

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 
Steve to be carrier

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:37.760 
Steve to be carrier
two<00:06:34.630> out<00:06:35.320> of<00:06:35.380> three<00:06:35.890> also<00:06:36.490> for<00:06:36.969> the<00:06:37.090> Steve<00:06:37.360> and

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
two out of three also for the Steve and

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.250 
two out of three also for the Steve and
also<00:06:38.770> as<00:06:39.669> you<00:06:39.729> see<00:06:40.150> here

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
also as you see here

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.140 
also as you see here
if<00:06:41.410> they<00:06:41.920> would<00:06:42.100> have<00:06:43.350> child<00:06:44.670> they<00:06:45.670> would<00:06:45.820> have

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
if they would have child they would have

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.800 
if they would have child they would have
1<00:06:46.810> out<00:06:47.140> of<00:06:47.940> 4<00:06:48.940> chances<00:06:49.450> for<00:06:50.380> him<00:06:51.570> to<00:06:52.570> be

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810 
1 out of 4 chances for him to be

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.750 
1 out of 4 chances for him to be
homozygous<00:06:54.090> recessive<00:06:56.010> so<00:06:57.010> we<00:06:57.280> have<00:06:57.550> to

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:57.760 
homozygous recessive so we have to

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.270 
homozygous recessive so we have to
multiply<00:06:58.300> all<00:06:58.540> these<00:06:58.900> chances<00:06:59.320> together<00:06:59.980> and

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
multiply all these chances together and

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.470 
multiply all these chances together and
what<00:07:01.210> we<00:07:01.240> are<00:07:01.480> going<00:07:01.540> to<00:07:01.930> get<00:07:02.220> would<00:07:03.220> be<00:07:03.520> 2

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:04.480 
what we are going to get would be 2

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.680 
what we are going to get would be 2
multiplied<00:07:05.050> by<00:07:05.080> 2<00:07:05.320> and<00:07:05.560> by<00:07:05.920> 1<00:07:06.240> this<00:07:07.240> is<00:07:07.420> going

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690 
multiplied by 2 and by 1 this is going

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:13.560 
multiplied by 2 and by 1 this is going
to<00:07:07.840> be<00:07:07.990> 4<00:07:08.430> over<00:07:10.020> 3<00:07:11.020> x<00:07:11.560> 3<00:07:11.830> and<00:07:12.370> by<00:07:12.550> 4<00:07:12.880> this<00:07:13.390> is

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:13.570 
to be 4 over 3 x 3 and by 4 this is

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.820 
to be 4 over 3 x 3 and by 4 this is
going<00:07:13.780> to<00:07:13.960> be<00:07:14.170> 36<00:07:14.950> and<00:07:15.550> we<00:07:16.510> can<00:07:16.750> reduce<00:07:16.960> it<00:07:17.350> by<00:07:17.500> 4

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:17.830 
going to be 36 and we can reduce it by 4

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.990 
going to be 36 and we can reduce it by 4
so<00:07:18.190> the<00:07:18.640> answer<00:07:19.060> would<00:07:19.180> be<00:07:19.240> 1<00:07:19.660> out<00:07:20.530> of<00:07:20.670> 9<00:07:21.670> and

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 
so the answer would be 1 out of 9 and

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.150 
so the answer would be 1 out of 9 and
this<00:07:22.870> is<00:07:23.080> going<00:07:23.380> to<00:07:23.560> be<00:07:23.710> our<00:07:24.210> answer<00:07:25.210> today<00:07:26.160> so

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 
this is going to be our answer today so

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.620 
this is going to be our answer today so
this<00:07:27.400> is<00:07:27.580> 1<00:07:28.120> out<00:07:28.390> of<00:07:28.450> 9<00:07:29.140> chances<00:07:30.040> for<00:07:30.790> them<00:07:31.060> to

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:31.630 
this is 1 out of 9 chances for them to

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.690 
this is 1 out of 9 chances for them to
have<00:07:31.870> affected<00:07:32.640> with<00:07:33.640> sickle-cell<00:07:34.060> disorder

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:35.700 
have affected with sickle-cell disorder

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.500 
have affected with sickle-cell disorder
baby<00:07:36.700> so<00:07:37.770> this<00:07:38.770> is<00:07:38.920> all<00:07:39.160> for<00:07:39.370> today<00:07:39.400> thank<00:07:39.850> you
