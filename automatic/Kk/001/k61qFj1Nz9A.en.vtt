 it will not be 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.930
 necessarily extremely bad 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.910
 these long in the sense that it takes 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.010
 quite some time 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.300
 to realize I have seen people with a little bit of tired of you stamping 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.360

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.200
 I put

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.820

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.110
 for 3% on the role on all terrains 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.320
 you have to know that from time to time 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.810
 to ensure that we have two or three places of free in the group 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.120
 we can just surprise heart and invite people so we had this 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.419
 are those who were with us were more 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:16.139
 participate 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.760
 at this rather successful part she plays with a class 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.340
 the most used ever before of which actually does holy mother not hurt in 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.230
 general 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.969
 to let the people who play in looking for destruction 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.399
 and who are silent all the time 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.069
 so I tell myself if everyone is playing 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.269
 or with a silent the agreement 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.290
 6 alone and who is able to play with a muffler and all 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.719
 other places it's mostly been really way too high 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:44.180
 the offer payable late and I said to myself we'll stop forever 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.179
 search 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.699
 to play as in match this therapy a little bit get used 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.629
 multiplayer and that's why ben jelloun 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.920
 a muffler on which 47 I am as severe maliciously helpful or 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.419
 a little abusive to win but not even affected 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.529
 and it really hurts a lot 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.739
 so I advise you to try so young 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.209
 in e at the level of assets like want to stop featherweight sleight of hand 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:12.729
 a young 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:14.399
 and at the level of the spouses 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:18.109
 lol in search but still without too much we will take jammers 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.439
 and a joker of that name for him and play modes where he has a little bit more 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.590
 from whom he is dealing as usual mission I put drones or revoyure 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.179
 uplifting blackburn 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:32.079
 which allows you to continue to go kilometers 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.109
 tambunan your army of t'choupi with who you are 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.129
 to kill the enemies anyway me it makes me happy even if you were not 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.289
 directly from weight a little bit to talk because actually these 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:45.439
 lately I have not too much video output 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.439
 and look at the scope of the pop mans shrub 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.319
 I just talked about the death of Vincent 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.319
 e yes it's nice to talk to you again 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.049
 and to be prayed 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.709
 the pace of the courses the recession will affect simple hypermedia I wish 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:03.609
 do my best 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.030
 but for now and well for now 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.439
 that again 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.099
 it's the kumo know it as I talk a lot about my criterion 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.269
 there are three big projects coming soon 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.130
 their arrival 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.979
 then one of the three groups 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.090
 it would be good a video number 307 will be announced before 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.240
 the other you already know him 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.759
 it's red 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.779
 on these aspects see m's evening 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:29.620
 who exit % 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.620
 November 18 if I'm not mistaken 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.970
 the third big projects if you will greatly enjoy it I already wanted 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.009
 said 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.129
 finally African who was already talking 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.089
 I've never told myself what it would be like to be jogging 

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:45.729
 people overcome 8 hours 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.879
 % it's simple it's not a word 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.120
 17 45 meters 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.919
 and you say of course but also you have to see it 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.520
 cameron they were ready to search for 1 6027 but 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.639
 let's say of course it's a shy 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.300
 alairac a4 or both 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.849
 so of course I did not say it was because right now in 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:03.370
 facts 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.410
 but there was one person who found out what it was 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.640
 one year we sell their acts what you need to know and that I 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.270
 have not announced yet 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.569
 this one is still not a big project it's not all directly related to 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.569
 the chain even if it's going a little bit anyway 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.139
 it is in relation with bette is the son 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.930
 an agent says little more but it's something that's here 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.659
 he was going yes I know I know I'm excited about the idea of 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:31.349
 to be able to 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.479
 to be able to get in there but once again to the agents of the people 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.030
 it's another project 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.360
 over all of next year lately and I find that really 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.020
 interesting 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.240
 but rest assured 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.569
 for many people I do not like 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.610
 the changes the novelties and I'm first like that I reassure you 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:51.020
 kriens will change 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.309
 at the youtube channel level 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:54.600
 that I promise you 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.980
 we are together from beginning to end we have reached 220 thousand subscribers 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.030
 recently on the main channel 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.409
 and soon descend on the chain cnn rest assured I will never let go 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:09.219
 and it's always a great pleasure for me to offer you video so I 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.839
 saw a lot of people had a little tired of colloquia from time to time 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.509
 even though the majority of people 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:17.389
 when some offered me gameplay commented on the site of France 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:18.189
 3 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:21.819
 on which I take a lot of pleasure I have a video tests to realize here 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:25.169
 and for the 6 it will be on my main channel 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.580
 for 100 euros 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.020
 the next zelda 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.909
 slice the country what will be put in place 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.550
 and I sincerely hope that you 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.150
 who kept the case of the places that the victims those who listen to teams who 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.759
 are in this case 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:41.759
 it's true the effort to look I would say 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:46.779
 the first two two episodes because why am I not saying just the first 

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:48.389
 simply because the first 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:51.699
 in general the prodigy of the withdrawal is always a little soporific 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:53.919
 goes nothing then 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.629
 this effort tells you that nothing is work Thursday in Lille 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:00.610
 I gave pleasure to a maximum of people in a hazy hamlet on this 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.759
 sector for me it's going to be a huge pleasure 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:06.350
 for all the people who made it clear that he was in a hurry to see on this kind of 

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:08.710
 game would be great and if more 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.960
 jari-matti was little people who are rather than fire 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.729
 on the wings of an extremely pleasure center here I think I have said everything 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:21.050
 for this video a game that comes out of 13% is always a pleasure 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.620
 and I hope that this video will be more accurate and also be able to release the video 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.729
 number 300 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:28.800
