 well, I'm fine with you and today. 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.199
 friday I bring you a video 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.260
 the video that you converse a video about 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.750
 change and I came to talk about change 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.000
 change of 6 to talk about the change that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.579
 You see I changed the tone. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.160
 Yes, I changed the hair because 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.340
 change sometimes it's good to change sometimes 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.440
 I need to change sometimes it 's necessary 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.090
 Okay, it's no use if you want to stay with 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.910
 one thing you're not feeling 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.280
 well with her that there will not be people and this 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.770
 in all aspects of life 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.469
 It's no use staying at work. 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.910
 You do not like it because it will not flow. 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.160
 will not render 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.120
 You're not going to be successful. 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.859
 It helps to stay stagnant in the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.090
 college you're doing that 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.040
 it 's not your area 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.250
 It's no use you 're dating the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.290
 person you know is not what you do not 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.670
 It's for you that sometimes it takes 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.369
 change understood and I changed I changed more 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.180
 once hair color with normal 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.000
 brown not as vibrant as it was 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.240
 in the last video that I recorded then the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.540
 Now let's get into the difficult weather to 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.229
 this friday involving change and everything 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.350
 more 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.390
 I come to talk about food re-education 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.930
 Yes, because most of the doubts that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.299
 appear on my profile if I 'm not happy 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.020
 because I do not eat the yummy things from 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:50.670
 life my writes the pizza ice cream them 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.340
 brigadiers milk candy to these 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.920
 delicious things that comes in the supermarket 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.079
 these things that people in the background know 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.630
 that are not good for our health 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.600
 Not now, we're 20 years old now. 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.189
 People have 15 things, but they do not. 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.439
 will be fine when he is what 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.080
 older not 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.110
 food reeducation enters this 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.200
 context with 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.560
 The Bible comes in because if you talk 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.420
 re-educate to change some foods 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.630
 What do you eat in your daily life? 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.640
 others to replace this will already 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.200
 help in many examples that I can 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:33.030
 gives you a chance to exchange pasta with whole grains 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:36.250
 exchange sweets for fruit exchange 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.850
 soda by natural juices exchange 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.730
 Stuffed fried things for grilled trocar 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.300
 industrial products 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.459
 natural that was born without sprouting 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.130

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:57.820

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.140
 with the child born people already try 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.989
 to educate is to grow 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.930
 So you will not be any different, like 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.390
 if I had a little baby re-educating 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.760

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.459
 thought it hard but we are here for 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.110
