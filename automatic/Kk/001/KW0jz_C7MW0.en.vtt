00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:15.000
 what we see in front and companion 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:17.430
 hybrid operating system android 42.1 ce 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.439
 we have it here with the tablet sense 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.119
 we have 4 2 1 as the operating system 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.070
 android of this tablet 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.410
 this is a tablet in effect 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.789
 then the tablet operating system 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.199
 tegra tablet hardware as a processor 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.030
 applications that we can use are 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.840
 applications also designed for the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.150
 mobile world 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.930
 we have a photoshop touch for example 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:43.350
 application designed exclusively but 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.870
 very useful for designers for i 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.790
 graphs sensitivity to the issue 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.840
 electromagnetic induction technology 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.870
 wacom award-winning so e 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.339
 sensitivity to the pressure of the pen 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.760
 inclination sensitivity e 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:04.489
 sensitivity to hand voting 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.900
 connections present on the device from 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.000
 this part 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.120
 we have a connector that encloses in 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.910
 itself a whip which brings with it three cables 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.120
 power cable video cable and cable 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.340
 usb video cable because this kind of 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.070
 tablet is called the two then why 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.080
 it also becomes a port symbol 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.700
 that is, it disappears when 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.120
 we connect a computer 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.950
 the android tablet disappears and the appears 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.940
 so our computer is windows a 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.360
 mac there is no difference 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:43.080
 one usb port another usb reader port 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.780
 microsd and audio jack complete the 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.150
 we have a stand on the glad 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.600
 to be able to place on different ones 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.600
 heights 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.729
 the tablet 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.340
 therefore depending on the use that 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.520
 we do in creative mode we can 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.460
 work the keys at different heights 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.659
 side are programmable keys this 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.580
 it can be programmed 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.440
 configured for individual applications 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.530
 then to events in photoshop touch 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.000
 could a certain recall in sketch 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.900
 book could another kind of 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.380
 application passing the version 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.380
 windows instead 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.180
 the thing starts more than a tablet we have 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.290
 a real computer in format 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.480
 Tablet 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.349
 here too the warning is a 13-inch like 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.959
 the android version 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.330
 we have always informed on the hot for 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.099
 regarding the resolution in 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.390
 endowment regarding 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.370
 the communication interface to 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.489
 so a short, own accomplished 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.640
 two usb ports 3 a mini port 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.620
 displayport to have a warning output 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.360
 therefore even more confirmation of the fact 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.530
 that this is really a computer and not 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.350
 a simple tablet audio jack port of 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.940
 microsd player power supply 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.760
 possibility of blockage and increase of 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.170
 volume as well as interfaces for what 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.069
 therefore it concerns the image position 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.640
 front webcam webcam and webcam on 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.519
 back this also for the version 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.410
 companion hybrid this is only 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:16.530
 companion because it means that it is not 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.880
 hybrid therefore does not become a hangman 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.860
 the moment we connect 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.410
 a video entry but we'll do that 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.280
 we can go out on a video screen 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.800
 external 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.480
 also here 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.220
 programmable keys in our case 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.610
 we also obviously have touch 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.110
 windows 8 operating system installed 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.720
 let's move on to what could be 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.550
 truly the queen of applications 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.830
 to use with this type of tablet 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:45.000
 for mobility then we move on to 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:48.210
 photoshop in the cf version 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.410
 the cc cloud version the version that 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.780
 we are using is not a version 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.420
 designed and developed for tablets I repeat 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.760
 it is in effect a true windows 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.580
 so we can work with all the 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.320
 applications we usually know 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.630
 the most important in this case being able to 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.200
 work with the issue so I could 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.570
 choose to dose the passion that 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.950
 we are using to change the type 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.110
 of result 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.950
 for example 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.660
 if we have a heavy stroke we will have a 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.970
 greater imprint of our flow 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.360
 follows we call you law 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.200
 pointed very very thin useful for 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.210
 all the corrections that can be 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:35.180
 applied during retouching rather 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.180
 that artistic or photographic creation 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.740
 and it's gone 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:46.099
 as for the hardware we have 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.690
 also here a computer system of its own 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:54.710
 so the process is a 7 8 GB ram 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:58.150
 256 and 512 GB of hard disk connection 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.060
 wifi present on all tablets 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.990
 completes the equipment the pen holder with 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.750
 penn included the pen as usual 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.420
 wacom does not need a battery as it is 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.430
 with electromagnetic induction the pen is 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.150
 composed of tip on front for i 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.770
 click here right button and a button 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.240
 central can be completely 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.210
 configured to our liking 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.900
 we also have the rubber on the back 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.300
 inside the package 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.930
 of the case we can find a series 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.460
 remarkable of spare pines the pines 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.110
 spare parts can be used 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.320
 the moment we go to eat it 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.500
 excessively the nib present in 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.540
 this moment for our pleasure 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.910
 so when the nib is worn out 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.160
 we're going to change it 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.100
 last but not least we could also 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.930
 find colored rings for 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.710
 distinguish our tips from those 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.050
 of our fellow friends and relatives 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.610
