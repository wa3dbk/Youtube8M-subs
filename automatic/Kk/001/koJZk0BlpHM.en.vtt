exact time that you go to climb on top

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.230 
exact time that you go to climb on top

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
of the car and if done correctly with

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880 
of the car and if done correctly with
the<00:01:36.689> correct<00:01:36.930> timing<00:01:37.140> which<00:01:37.380> isn't<00:01:37.560> super

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the correct timing which isn't super

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.010 
the correct timing which isn't super
hard<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> do<00:01:38.579> what<00:01:39.150> will<00:01:39.270> happen<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.720> your<00:01:39.869> guy

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
hard to do what will happen is your guy

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.310 
hard to do what will happen is your guy
will<00:01:40.079> launch<00:01:40.500> directly<00:01:41.189> up<00:01:41.460> into<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> air<00:01:42.060> and

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
will launch directly up into the air and

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.600 
will launch directly up into the air and
you<00:01:43.320> will<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.560> done<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.829> launch<00:01:44.070> glitch<00:01:44.369> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
you will have done the launch glitch and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.639 
you will have done the launch glitch and
a<00:01:45.000> really<00:01:45.210> cool<00:01:45.329> thing<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.899> noticed<00:01:46.590> about

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
a really cool thing that I noticed about

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.499 
a really cool thing that I noticed about
this<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:47.700> don't<00:01:47.970> ever<00:01:48.210> die

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
this is that you really don't ever die

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.660 
this is that you really don't ever die
even<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.170> don't<00:01:49.409> deploy<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:50.070> parachute

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
even if you don't deploy a parachute

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.219 
even if you don't deploy a parachute
occasionally<00:01:51.479> you'll<00:01:51.570> take<00:01:51.750> damage<00:01:51.899> as<00:01:52.200> you

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
occasionally you'll take damage as you

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.560 
occasionally you'll take damage as you
see<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.680> one<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.790> watch<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
see in that one but if you watch the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.240 
see in that one but if you watch the
next<00:01:54.899> clip<00:01:55.140> which<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.380> also<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.770> last<00:01:55.950> clip

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
next clip which is also the last clip

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.190 
next clip which is also the last clip
you'll<00:01:57.000> see<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> don't<00:01:57.390> even<00:01:57.600> take<00:01:57.899> any

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
you'll see that I don't even take any

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.630 
you'll see that I don't even take any
damage<00:01:58.469> when<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.829> fall<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> ground<00:01:59.310> which

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
damage when I fall to the ground which

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.910 
damage when I fall to the ground which
is<00:01:59.670> kind<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.000> interesting<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:01.229> anyways<00:02:01.740> guys
