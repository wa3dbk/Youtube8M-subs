00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.705
 From farm to fork 

00:00:21.715 --> 00:00:23.958
 There are twenty-two Baham only 14 of them for production 

00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:27.560
 At the beginning of the year I sold two to three Bahami 

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:35.735
 I also had a great request for meat 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.640
 I bought cattle from the neighboring peasants 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.120
 We try to have almost the same quality of beasts 

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:48.140
 And also to have a cow to graze 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.743
 Which are in nature and growing according to their cycle 

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:58.015
 We pay attention to the food where we buy humming grass 

00:00:58.255 --> 00:01:00.255
 In the winter, we eat grass that goes out even when the snow falls 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.030
 It is sometimes difficult, but it is done 

00:01:05.955 --> 00:01:10.250
 Usually, after slaughtering the beasts, we leave them in the cold room 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.670
 About fifteen days 

00:01:12.955 --> 00:01:17.955
 So that the taste of meat is delicious and ours 

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:19.455
 This is what we call maturity 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.675
 Two hymns per week 

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:27.580
 One mature and the other goes to the morgue 

00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:32.030
 Almost everything is sold on demand 

00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:34.895
 People talk about this with each other, and no publicity has been made 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.300
 It's a wonderful car 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.175
 The pass from everywhere is light 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.170
 And when you want to walk in a narrow road this car can 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.260
 While the Kat Cat cars can not do all this increase that this car does not consume a lot of fuel and when you want to spin in a narrow road this car can 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.670
 While the Kat Cat cars can not do all this increase because this car does not consume much fuel 

00:01:54.905 --> 00:01:56.760
 As I have since settled down 

00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:01.940
 I was able to get four hundred and fifty animals 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.995
 Part of which is directly dedicated for sale 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.165
 And the other part of Eid al-Adha 

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:16.780
 And these sheep shall eat only of the grass 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.146
 Strain that adapts to this mountain 

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:23.035
 Today we will go to the slaughterhouse before loading the boxes 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.943
 The beast will come out of the room cold and will be re-weighed 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.745
 According to the weight of the remaining meat is not suitable for consumption 

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:37.955
 The amount of division will be determined 

00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:51.785
 Snapped boxes, to put the meat in 

00:02:52.335 --> 00:02:55.785
 Sacks of boxes to put the meat inside and we have to clean them before putting the boxes down 

00:02:57.745 --> 00:03:01.385
 You should not have Charlotte, a clean gown 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.005
 Anti-bacterial shoes 

00:03:07.165 --> 00:03:10.470
 We have one person who slaughters a halal license 

00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:18.335
 It has strict specifications that guarantee us halal meat 

00:03:20.135 --> 00:03:24.470
 By cutting the animal's weight, we will take it to the cuttings 

00:03:35.995 --> 00:03:38.465
 We sell meat without mediation at the known and average price 

00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:43.920
 I have to count my time in cutting meat and at the altar and when delivered 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.135
 And count everything that is consumed, such as bags and sandals 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.360
 We put our margin and put the final price 

00:04:06.595 --> 00:04:11.440
 We monitor the meat on arrival and make sure it is warm 

00:04:12.905 --> 00:04:17.561
 For our cold respect we have a cool room that respects these standards 

00:04:19.255 --> 00:04:22.400
 We have a hall to cut meat on the shapes and types we want 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.220
 To tie the meat, put it in bags of empty air 

00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:35.470
 The goal is to provide a variety of products from our farm 

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:38.980
 Such as living sheep or, in general, live animals 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.375
 Lamb, beef or meat 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.035
 And then give space to convert 

00:04:49.615 --> 00:04:53.186
 Both meat cuts called phyllis and succes 

00:04:54.398 --> 00:04:55.660
 This is your request 

00:04:55.835 --> 00:04:57.785
 God bless you, thank you
