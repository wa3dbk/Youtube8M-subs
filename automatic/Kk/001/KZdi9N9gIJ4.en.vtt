if<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:32.020> got<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.350> chance<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.860> be<00:03:32.980> any<00:03:33.250> other

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
if you got the chance to be any other

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.520 
if you got the chance to be any other
character<00:03:33.940> from<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.450> marvel<00:03:34.780> universe<00:03:34.810> who

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
character from the marvel universe who

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.830 
character from the marvel universe who
would<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.890> choose<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:37.060> can<00:03:37.180> be<00:03:37.270> female<00:03:37.630> or

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
would you choose it can be female or

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.860 
would you choose it can be female or
male<00:03:37.990> um<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:39.910> should<00:03:40.120> be<00:03:40.270> a<00:03:40.300> doctor

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
male um and it should be a doctor

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.330 
male um and it should be a doctor
probably<00:03:41.170> why<00:03:41.980> well<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:44.590> doesn't<00:03:44.920> have<00:03:45.070> to<00:03:45.310> be

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
probably why well it doesn't have to be

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.160 
probably why well it doesn't have to be
but<00:03:45.700> it'd<00:03:45.940> probably<00:03:46.240> be<00:03:46.390> better<00:03:46.660> if<00:03:46.870> it<00:03:47.020> was

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
but it'd probably be better if it was

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.790 
but it'd probably be better if it was
why<00:03:47.500> are<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:47.710> being<00:03:47.920> so<00:03:48.190> specific<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:50.380> would

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
why are you being so specific I would

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.110
