00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello and welcome to kitchen for all 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.759
 today we are going to make heaven's tosino for 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.670
 two people the ingredients that we're going 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.620
 needing are the following for the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.620
 five egg yolks dough 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:20.029
 125 milliliters of water 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.880
 250 grams of sugar and for the candy 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:27.329
 one and a half tablespoon of sugar 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.060
 one tablespoon and half a cup of water and 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.489
 two droplets of lemon juice first 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.220
 what we have to do is put the 125 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.540
 milliliters of water in a saucepan 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.690
 Then we add the 250 grams of 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.690
 sugar 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.680
 once we have it, move it 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.840
 little and let it simmer for 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.370
 about 20 minutes until we have a 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.079
 thick syrup 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.030
 It's been 20 minutes and we've already 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.590
 got a consistent syrup 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.900
 then we can put out the fire 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.180
 and we will pass it to another container where 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.190
 we'll let it cool well the following 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.530
 what are we going to do in the candy so 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.230
 we eat a case like this we add the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.990
 spoonful of and a half big love 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.990
 and the forward and middle sugar function 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.510
 we add 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.510
 two lemon droplets 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.450
 and we put it over medium heat we have 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.520
 to leave like this until it starts to 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.320
 that's when we should start it 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.390
 to move as you see is already starting 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.190
 because it's golden, so we turn off the 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.680
 fire to finish doing with 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.680
 the heat that you have with a little 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.290
 and we keep letting them give a little 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.110
 more the candy is ready 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.070
 so we take the container in which 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.210
 let's take 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.210
 bacon of heaven 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.620
 and we add the candy 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.620
 we met 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.880
 and we leave it like this and the next thing that 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.099
 we have to do is add the yolks of 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.099
 egg in a deep bowl 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.030
 added with a rod blender the 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.530
 We move well but even before 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.560
 do esteem do not let them foam 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.569
 once we have the yolks beaten 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.670
 we are adding the syrup that is already 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.030
 pretty cold 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.690
 we add it to the yolks little by little and 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.690
 let's see 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.019
 before mind financial challenge in the 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.670
 oven we should put it to preheat 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.519
 200 degrees with heat above and by 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.459
 down we have already finished to beat the 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.920
 syrup and take it and the candy is 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.200
 cold so we take the container in the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.510
 that we have the candy we take a 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.970
 strainer 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.950
 and we are going 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.950
 the mixture of syrup and yolks 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.140
 once we have finished straining what 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.620
 we take another vessel in which it can 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.340
 fit this with the buds we add a 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.300
 finger of water so you have to think that 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.910
 when you put this container and the water 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.940
 boil in the oven do not enter here 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.700
 then we added a little 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.580
 we put the other container inside and you see 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.770
 that there is plenty of space between a 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.780
 vessel and another and the water and then 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.700
 you're ready to put in the oven already 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.450
 is the oven at 200 degrees and then already 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.450
 we can put it 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.090
 and we leave it equal to 200 degrees with 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.040
 heat above and below has passed 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.959
 20 minutes and already the ground bacon is 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.959
 ready so we stopped the oven 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.400
 we pay them 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.989
 to check that it is well done 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:23.630
 that you can do this with a pinch 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:26.690
 like this lock the vice law that is hard 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.340
 and as you can see it is already clean and gentlemen of 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.220
 what is done so we leave it 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.900
 cool here to be able to overflow it already 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.250
 it has cooled down a bit but to create 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.710
 to cool down is faster we're going to 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.270
 put it in the fridge so we took it out 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.070
 of the container that has water 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.000
 we put 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.160
 the cover 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.020
 and when we have finished putting the 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.900
 we put it in the fridge until 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.790
 cool down they are already in the fridge and 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.190
 it's cold then we can take it off 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.460
 the mold we removed the cap that 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.460
 we have put 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:08.710
 and with the help of a knife we're going 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:10.480
 separating the edge as well as this 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.500
 mold earl in wanting the compounds of 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.910
 aluminum you can do like this and you see 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.470
 that is taking off but with care 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.080
 always again brought a piece of 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.150
 bacon to heaven and once we 've already 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.160
 separated all the sky bacon from the 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.380
 walls we take the plate in which 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.380
 let's go put it on top 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.310
 we take off well we hold here 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.770
 we turn it around 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.440
 and we take off and we have our bacon 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.030

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.699
 mounted and if you want you can save it 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.400
