quickly as possible and with lightweight

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.720 
quickly as possible and with lightweight
it<00:02:31.750> makes<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:32.799> much<00:02:32.980> more<00:02:33.040> easier

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
it makes it so much more easier

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.000 
it makes it so much more easier
partnering<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.540> with<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.019> stock<00:02:35.319> attachment

means that you can be super super agile

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
while you're using this weapon it also

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.220 
while you're using this weapon it also
means<00:02:40.090> if<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:40.299> do<00:02:40.480> find<00:02:40.720> yourself<00:02:40.780> in<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.079> dodgy

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
means if you do find yourself in a dodgy

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.530 
means if you do find yourself in a dodgy
situation<00:02:41.889> you<00:02:42.040> try<00:02:42.219> and<00:02:42.400> run<00:02:42.609> away<00:02:42.969> you'll

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
situation you try and run away you'll

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.119 
situation you try and run away you'll
often<00:02:43.689> find<00:02:43.870> yourself<00:02:44.079> getting<00:02:44.379> shot<00:02:44.709> just

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
often find yourself getting shot just

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.379 
often find yourself getting shot just
around<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.549> corners<00:02:45.879> we're<00:02:45.970> about<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.299> get

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
around the corners we're about to get

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.420 
around the corners we're about to get
away<00:02:46.659> which<00:02:47.139> sucks<00:02:47.470> but<00:02:47.739> with<00:02:47.889> lightweight<00:02:48.340> it

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
away which sucks but with lightweight it

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.559 
away which sucks but with lightweight it
means<00:02:48.579> you<00:02:48.639> can<00:02:48.760> be<00:02:48.819> a<00:02:48.849> little<00:02:49.090> bit<00:02:49.299> quicker

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
means you can be a little bit quicker

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:50.759 
means you can be a little bit quicker
and<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.870> can<00:02:50.019> get<00:02:50.200> out<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.409> those<00:02:50.530> situations

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
and you can get out of those situations

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.819 
and you can get out of those situations
a<00:02:51.400> lot<00:02:51.819> easier<00:02:52.359> it<00:02:52.870> also<00:02:53.049> means<00:02:53.409> that<00:02:53.530> at<00:02:53.680> the

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
a lot easier it also means that at the

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.289 
a lot easier it also means that at the
start<00:02:54.069> of<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.340> map<00:02:54.519> you<00:02:54.669> can<00:02:54.790> get<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.150> position

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
start of a map you can get to a position

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.319 
start of a map you can get to a position
quicker<00:02:55.930> because<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.680> salt<00:02:56.980> rifles<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.669> what

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
quicker because you salt rifles and what

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.759 
quicker because you salt rifles and what
their<00:02:58.510> running<00:02:58.780> speeds<00:02:59.049> actually<00:02:59.230> slower

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
their running speeds actually slower

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.740 
their running speeds actually slower
than<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.400> standard<00:03:00.879> submachine<00:03:01.329> gun<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:01.659> if

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
than the standard submachine gun so if

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.089 
than the standard submachine gun so if
you<00:03:01.840> put<00:03:02.139> light<00:03:02.349> weight<00:03:02.530> on<00:03:02.650> your<00:03:02.829> salt<00:03:03.069> wife

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
you put light weight on your salt wife

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.500 
you put light weight on your salt wife
it<00:03:03.310> means<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.579> can<00:03:03.700> get<00:03:03.909> two<00:03:04.090> positions

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
it means you can get two positions

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.199 
it means you can get two positions
quicker<00:03:04.840> as<00:03:05.139> well<00:03:05.519> but<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.700> trade-off<00:03:07.000> for

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
quicker as well but the trade-off for

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.970 
quicker as well but the trade-off for
that<00:03:07.299> is<00:03:07.419> that<00:03:07.540> I'm<00:03:07.659> not<00:03:07.870> using<00:03:08.109> hardline<00:03:08.739> so

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
that is that I'm not using hardline so

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.679 
that is that I'm not using hardline so
normally<00:03:09.340> I<00:03:09.370> would<00:03:09.549> say<00:03:09.819> if<00:03:10.329> you're<00:03:10.450> not<00:03:10.569> going

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
normally I would say if you're not going

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.599 
normally I would say if you're not going
to<00:03:10.750> use<00:03:10.840> hardline<00:03:11.319> it's<00:03:12.099> not<00:03:12.280> really<00:03:12.459> worth

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
to use hardline it's not really worth

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.220 
to use hardline it's not really worth
going<00:03:12.849> for<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.120> higher<00:03:13.359> streaks<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:13.959> have

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
going for the higher streaks I have

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.110 
going for the higher streaks I have
caught<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.620> swarm<00:03:14.889> on<00:03:15.099> I<00:03:15.280> just<00:03:15.879> wanted<00:03:16.030> to

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
caught the swarm on I just wanted to

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.330 
caught the swarm on I just wanted to
show<00:03:16.269> you<00:03:16.329> guys<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:17.109> big<00:03:17.530> streak<00:03:17.829> while<00:03:18.040> using

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
want and then from my explode

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.470 
want and then from my explode
I've<00:04:24.620> got<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:25.070> standard<00:04:25.580> c4<00:04:26.090> that<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.270> really

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
I've got the standard c4 that I really

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.540 
I've got the standard c4 that I really
like<00:04:26.630> to<00:04:26.840> use<00:04:26.870> within<00:04:27.860> ghosts<00:04:28.190> it's<00:04:28.340> gonna<00:04:28.430> be

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
like to use within ghosts it's gonna be

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.100 
like to use within ghosts it's gonna be
interesting<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:28.940> see<00:04:29.120> how<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.330> explosives

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
interesting to see how the explosives

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.220 
interesting to see how the explosives
and<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.370> sidearms<00:04:31.370> differ<00:04:32.240> -<00:04:32.510> black<00:04:32.690> ops<00:04:32.870> -

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
and the sidearms differ - black ops -

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.690 
and the sidearms differ - black ops -
because<00:04:33.500> they're<00:04:33.620> very<00:04:33.890> very<00:04:34.130> powerful

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
because they're very very powerful

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.000 
because they're very very powerful
within<00:04:34.940> black<00:04:35.180> ops<00:04:35.420> 2<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:35.990> I<00:04:36.530> guess<00:04:36.830> within

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
within black ops 2 and I guess within

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.350 
within black ops 2 and I guess within
ghost<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:37.430> may<00:04:37.520> be<00:04:37.580> a<00:04:37.790> little<00:04:38.030> bit<00:04:38.180> weaker

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
ghost it may be a little bit weaker

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.940 
ghost it may be a little bit weaker
we'll<00:04:38.600> have<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:38.960> see<00:04:39.140> but<00:04:39.170> there<00:04:39.530> is<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.680> class
