00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.360
 so keep learning to compete 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.239
 and stuck it costs me work but behind 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.890
 It's too strong and good to compete with 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.200
 the best with one with one of the 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.770
 best Spanish for stealing and good and 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.750
 continue after competing the same but 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.090
 you wear well not with what you see good 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.510
 oh yes 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:23.460
 There are many people out there but good 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.560
 it's good for example I do not know the people that 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.600
 will say good this man who eats or 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.390
 how many kilos of meat do you eat per day or 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.860
 as trains as it is as strong as 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.520
 depending on the phase we are in the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.480
 season if we are in phases of 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.940
 competition for the truth that our 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.500
 much food there and have a lot of rice 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.810
 we can eat 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.340
 of average 2 kilos of veal a day and 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.990
 then we can also eat by fencing 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.190
 one to go a kilo and peak of dry rice or 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.440
 heavy that is expensive to keep you is 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.580
 really that we put up with that 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.050
 we stand before the competition three 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.420
 weeks a maximum that neither is that 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.160
 let's be a long time later and after your 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.410
 feed you go to the amounts 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.570
 of course I try to look for what more 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.060
 variety of both protein and 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.160
 hydrates not always before the competition 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.050
 I always dare to have to retain 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.880
 tried a little bit after what the 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.470
 of a championship clean is to say me 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.230
 I take more vegetables I have more fruits 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.880
 we put another one or more mother arms of 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.170
 always and also a little bit to leave 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.750
 of the monotony 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.860
 just like they eat many kilos of meat 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:30.959
 also in many other sweet ice creams and 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:36.440
 good as a good diet and arturo not 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.440
 you have to train too sacrificed 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:44.810
 that you train with me I do not understand much 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.950
 but how do I train now what for 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.960
 we have enough 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.460
 electro competition because I the truth 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.650
 that the gym or the floor of that 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.280
 program what I do every day what 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.350
 what I do is apparatus to catch technique and 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.750
 that prepared what competition is 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.430
 that we have the competition in June 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.010
 we are preparing what are the tests 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.230
 and then what the gym 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.760
 no I do not floor it once we've 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.500
 ends the season that already in 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.390
 September then what only 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.400
 basic exercise like the deadlift the 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.720
 squat and the pre-bench then only 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.790
 exercises that we put more cane that 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.470
 us arab helps us a lot for later 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.300
 when the stroman season begins 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.920
 but a bad curiosity that's 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.900
 curiosity I guess it's one of those that 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.950
 they see me for example I know how many 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.620
 kilos catch pressed or squat 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.190
 the I'll do because you have to put him 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.720
 too many kilos I do not all legs 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.400
 it no longer calls you what is the back the 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.380
 lumbar and the wall and the pressure that 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.780
 deserves in the ribcage then I 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.800
 what am i like squats weight 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.410
 dead 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.270
 man and cypress we smell depending on the 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.980
 week i work what are a week 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.780
 ago and another week four other weeks 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.580
 two repetitions later I follow the 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.410
 next week again 6 4 and 2 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.340
 depending on the week that you touch 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.890
 make me take kilo less 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.610
 If it's a sport the truth is complicated in 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.420
 the good the bodybuilding is known knows 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.370
 that is hard training but the strong man 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.739
 I believe that between bodybuilding and 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.430
 electro man that you suffered enough 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.769
 what diet diet but we 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.510
 we suffer much more what the 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.820
 training because joint pains 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.710
 and it has to continue it's raining and 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.389
 have to put you with a yoke of 400 yo 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.150
 watching in the middle of the road with some 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.290
 400 salt wheels garzÃ³n where it comes out 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.330
 he has to do it because the 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.740
 championship and you can not lose the 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.780
 intention and technique and it has to be 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.270
 there holding on enduring then I 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.919
 I think what a training of 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.840
 strong for a long time 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.180
 It is very hard and few people can tolerate it 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.940
 good but good here are two
