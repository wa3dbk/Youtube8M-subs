00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
point is you actually choose a team go

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.140 
point is you actually choose a team go
unfortunately<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.250> teams<00:00:37.460> are<00:00:37.670> set<00:00:37.820> out<00:00:37.970> as

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
unfortunately the teams are set out as

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.030 
unfortunately the teams are set out as
you<00:00:38.270> can<00:00:38.420> see<00:00:38.600> you<00:00:38.810> can't<00:00:39.020> actually<00:00:39.200> mix<00:00:39.860> and

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
you can see you can't actually mix and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.890 
you can see you can't actually mix and
match<00:00:40.220> so<00:00:40.400> you<00:00:40.490> can't<00:00:40.700> say<00:00:40.850> have<00:00:41.060> one<00:00:41.600> of<00:00:41.720> the

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
match so you can't say have one of the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.900 
match so you can't say have one of the
Italian<00:00:42.650> squads<00:00:43.010> with<00:00:43.190> one<00:00:43.340> of<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:43.520> Koreans

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
and then one of the Brits unfortunately

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.500 
and then one of the Brits unfortunately
you<00:00:45.500> have<00:00:45.530> to<00:00:45.680> play<00:00:45.950> as<00:00:46.160> a<00:00:46.190> team<00:00:46.329> which<00:00:47.329> is<00:00:47.480> a

get<00:01:34.100> powerful<00:01:34.490> by<00:01:34.790> blocking<00:01:35.090> attacks<00:01:35.540> or<00:01:35.900> by

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
get powerful by blocking attacks or by

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.770 
get powerful by blocking attacks or by
holding<00:01:36.920> down<00:01:36.950> for<00:01:37.400> your<00:01:37.520> buttons<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.060> when

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
holding down for your buttons and when

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.810 
holding down for your buttons and when
that's<00:01:38.900> fully<00:01:39.200> charged<00:01:39.680> then<00:01:40.010> doesn't<00:01:40.640> like

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
that's fully charged then doesn't like

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.780 
that's fully charged then doesn't like
you<00:01:40.909> do<00:01:41.000> any<00:01:41.150> special

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
you do any special

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.150 
you do any special
or<00:01:41.880> anything<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.930> does<00:01:43.140> increase<00:01:43.920> your

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
or anything but it does increase your

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.740 
or anything but it does increase your
overall<00:01:44.550> power<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.060> attacks<00:01:45.360> which<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
overall power of the attacks which is

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.830 
overall power of the attacks which is
really<00:01:46.170> good<00:01:46.410> you<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.280> add<00:01:47.460> huge<00:01:48.000> attacks<00:01:48.630> as

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
really good you can add huge attacks as

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.840 
really good you can add huge attacks as
well<00:01:49.050> and<00:01:49.380> unfortunately<00:01:50.190> i<00:01:50.250> started<00:01:50.700> dodge

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
well and unfortunately i started dodge

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.750 
well and unfortunately i started dodge
that<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.240> then<00:01:51.360> got<00:01:51.780> up<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.230> the<00:01:52.350> floor<00:01:52.760> but

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
that and then got up to the floor but

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.700 
that and then got up to the floor but
you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.570> dodged<00:01:54.810> commands<00:01:55.260> by<00:01:55.470> pushing

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
you can have dodged commands by pushing

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.290 
you can have dodged commands by pushing
till<00:01:55.980> the<00:01:56.100> bugs<00:01:56.280> together<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:56.970> push<00:01:57.150> it

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
till the bugs together you can push it

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.420 
till the bugs together you can push it
on<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.510> bones<00:01:57.690> together<00:01:57.900> where<00:01:58.410> do<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> power

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
on the bones together where do a power

on the bones together where do a power
attack<00:01:59.880> which<00:02:00.120> i'll<00:02:00.270> try<00:02:00.480> and<00:02:00.630> show<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.810> here

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
attack which i'll try and show you here

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.210 
attack which i'll try and show you here
just<00:02:02.460> there<00:02:02.670> very<00:02:02.970> quickly<00:02:03.180> when<00:02:03.420> he<00:02:03.510> starts

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
just there very quickly when he starts

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.010 
just there very quickly when he starts
now<00:02:05.220> so<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.640> was<00:02:05.850> possibly<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.510> attack<00:02:06.810> but

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
now so that was possibly the attack but

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.990 
now so that was possibly the attack but
unfortunately<00:02:07.470> started<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.610> doesn't<00:02:08.850> look

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
unfortunately started it it doesn't look

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.520 
unfortunately started it it doesn't look
very<00:02:09.060> powerful<00:02:09.630> but<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.780> does<00:02:09.990> take<00:02:10.200> quite<00:02:10.410> a

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
very powerful but it does take quite a

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.980 
very powerful but it does take quite a
bit<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.740> power<00:02:10.950> you've<00:02:11.610> am<00:02:11.790> got<00:02:12.480> attacked<00:02:12.780> when

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
order is to see it in team would

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.930 
order is to see it in team would
basically<00:02:24.900> rather<00:02:25.590> than<00:02:25.830> going<00:02:26.280> two<00:02:26.580> rounds

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
basically rather than going two rounds

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.580 
basically rather than going two rounds
per<00:02:27.090> bite<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.570> have<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.900> defeat<00:02:28.350> all<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
per bite you have to defeat all the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.410 
per bite you have to defeat all the
opponent's<00:02:29.160> when<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.850> do<00:02:30.000> defeat<00:02:30.300> an

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
opponent's when you do defeat an

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.090 
opponent's when you do defeat an
opponent<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.900> do<00:02:31.020> get<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> bit<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.470> energy<00:02:31.770> back

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
opponent you do get a bit of energy back

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.280 
opponent you do get a bit of energy back
but<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.520> doesn't<00:02:32.670> fill<00:02:32.940> up<00:02:33.060> again<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.959> it's

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
but it doesn't fill up again so it's

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.870 
but it doesn't fill up again so it's
kind<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.709> sudden<00:02:35.130> illumination<00:02:35.280> more

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
kind of like a sudden illumination more

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.630 
kind of like a sudden illumination more
from<00:02:36.090> being<00:02:36.300> much<00:02:36.450> alike

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
from being much alike

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:53.380 
from being much alike
call<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.270> listener<00:02:38.600> billion<00:02:38.900> years<00:02:39.050> ago<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:53.150> we

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
call a listener billion years ago so we

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.240 
call a listener billion years ago so we
go<00:02:53.569> perfectly<00:02:54.230> as<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:54.500> can<00:02:54.650> say<00:02:54.830> that<00:02:55.070> the

personally<00:03:22.760> prefer<00:03:22.850> having<00:03:23.300> the<00:03:23.480> enemy<00:03:23.780> as<00:03:23.900> we

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
personally prefer having the enemy as we

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.979 
personally prefer having the enemy as we
keep<00:03:24.170> buttons<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:24.769> x<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.190> y<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.340> punch<00:03:25.730> walls

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
keep buttons and x and y to punch walls

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.600 
keep buttons and x and y to punch walls
so<00:03:26.989> if<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.380> like<00:03:27.530> customizing<00:03:28.220> actual

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
so if you like customizing actual

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.280 
so if you like customizing actual
function<00:03:28.970> controls<00:03:29.360> enough<00:03:29.660> because<00:03:29.989> you<00:03:30.110> use

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
function controls enough because you use

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.530 
function controls enough because you use
two<00:03:30.530> other<00:03:31.100> vehicles<00:03:31.370> then<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.150> will<00:03:32.300> take<00:03:32.510> a

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
two other vehicles then it will take a

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.630 
two other vehicles then it will take a
little<00:03:32.690> while<00:03:32.870> because<00:03:33.290> quite<00:03:34.100> often<00:03:34.340> you'll

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
little while because quite often you'll

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.740 
little while because quite often you'll
try<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:34.940> do<00:03:35.030> fireballs<00:03:35.600> with<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.380> long<00:03:36.530> ball

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
try and do fireballs with the long ball

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.970 
try and do fireballs with the long ball
thankfully<00:03:38.750> that<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:38.959> can<00:03:39.230> do<00:03:39.440> that

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
thankfully that I can do that

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.729 
thankfully that I can do that
but<00:03:40.959> take<00:03:41.959> that's<00:03:42.170> pretty<00:03:42.379> much<00:03:42.500> other<00:03:42.680> than

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
but take that's pretty much other than

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.920 
but take that's pretty much other than
those<00:03:42.920> 26<00:03:43.310> as<00:03:43.580> I<00:03:43.610> see<00:03:43.819> a<00:03:43.849> substandard<00:03:44.390> big<00:03:44.690> mob

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
those 26 as I see a substandard big mob

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.630 
those 26 as I see a substandard big mob
is<00:03:45.170> there<00:03:45.319> no<00:03:45.440> born<00:03:45.680> of<00:03:45.830> stages<00:03:46.190> or<00:03:46.280> anything

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
is there no born of stages or anything

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.520 
is there no born of stages or anything
so<00:03:47.120> you<00:03:47.180> just<00:03:47.420> fight<00:03:47.720> through<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:48.080> air<00:03:48.170> teams

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
so you just fight through the air teams

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.680 
so you just fight through the air teams
or<00:03:48.830> fight<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.370> get<00:03:49.670> go<00:03:49.970> he's<00:03:50.150> like<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:50.510> be<00:03:50.569> on

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
or fight to get go he's like to be on

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.600 
or fight to get go he's like to be on
single<00:03:51.080> thing<00:03:51.260> or<00:03:51.409> just<00:03:51.440> like<00:03:51.739> you'll<00:03:52.370> still

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
single thing or just like you'll still

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.160 
single thing or just like you'll still
go<00:03:52.819> through<00:03:52.849> the<00:03:53.150> year<00:03:53.239> teams<00:03:53.599> what<00:03:53.930> will<00:03:54.049> only

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
go through the year teams what will only

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.350 
go through the year teams what will only
fight<00:03:54.409> one<00:03:54.620> person<00:03:55.069> 13<00:03:55.580> so<00:03:55.879> it<00:03:55.970> doesn't<00:03:56.239> mean

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
fight one person 13 so it doesn't mean

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.490 
fight one person 13 so it doesn't mean
that<00:03:56.390> you've<00:03:56.599> got<00:03:56.750> like<00:03:56.930> twenty<00:03:57.319> four

that you've got like twenty four
fighters<00:03:57.739> debate<00:03:58.129> and<00:03:58.459> then<00:03:59.090> you'll<00:03:59.209> get<00:03:59.360> back
