00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
sure that query in this game different

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.380 
sure that query in this game different
it<00:02:38.370> doesn't<00:02:38.549> increase<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.569> hipfire<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:42.209> hit

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
it doesn't increase the hipfire you hit

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.780 
it doesn't increase the hipfire you hit
fire<00:02:42.599> accuracy<00:02:42.900> or<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.560> does<00:02:43.739> not<00:02:43.769> aim<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.700> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
fire accuracy or it does not aim to the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.539 
fire accuracy or it does not aim to the
zombie<00:02:45.060> head<00:02:45.590> yeah<00:02:46.590> because<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.280> way<00:02:47.400> the

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
zombie head yeah because the way the

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.509 
zombie head yeah because the way the
zombies<00:02:47.880> are<00:02:48.030> health<00:02:48.299> works<00:02:48.980> they<00:02:49.980> start<00:02:50.310> with

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
zombies are health works they start with

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.960 
zombies are health works they start with
150<00:02:51.180> health<00:02:51.660> on<00:02:51.870> round<00:02:52.079> one<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.760> going<00:02:53.760> up<00:02:53.819> by

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
150 health on round one and going up by

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.100 
150 health on round one and going up by
102<00:02:54.569> around<00:02:54.810> 10<00:02:54.989> then<00:02:55.260> it's<00:02:55.410> just<00:02:56.810> they<00:02:57.810> go<00:02:57.959> up

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
102 around 10 then it's just they go up

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.970 
102 around 10 then it's just they go up
by<00:02:58.140> 10<00:02:58.590> percent<00:02:58.920> every<00:02:59.670> room<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.799> if<00:03:01.799> I'm

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
by 10 percent every room so if I'm

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.000 
by 10 percent every room so if I'm
getting<00:03:02.190> got<00:03:03.150> down<00:03:03.299> there<00:03:03.540> if<00:03:04.530> I'm<00:03:04.829> getting

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
getting got down there if I'm getting

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.940 
getting got down there if I'm getting
one<00:03:05.220> shot<00:03:05.250> kills<00:03:05.790> on<00:03:06.060> round<00:03:07.700> 4<00:03:09.290> I'm<00:03:10.290> around<00:03:10.680> 3

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
one shot kills on round 4 I'm around 3

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.059 
one shot kills on round 4 I'm around 3
but<00:03:11.190> not<00:03:11.310> around<00:03:11.400> 4<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.150> means<00:03:12.209> I'm<00:03:13.069> my

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
but not around 4 so that means I'm my

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.780 
but not around 4 so that means I'm my
gun<00:03:14.310> damage<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:15.090> between<00:03:15.799> 350<00:03:16.799> and<00:03:16.829> 340<00:03:17.609> so

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
gun damage is between 350 and 340 so

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.809 
gun damage is between 350 and 340 so
that's<00:03:17.970> average<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.359> out<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.660> say<00:03:18.810> 400<00:03:19.819> and

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
that's average it out and say 400 and

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.569 
that's average it out and say 400 and
then<00:03:21.209> if<00:03:22.200> I'm<00:03:22.410> getting<00:03:22.620> shots<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.400> head

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
then if I'm getting shots the head

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.800 
then if I'm getting shots the head
around<00:03:24.000> 6<00:03:24.600> from<00:03:25.019> around<00:03:25.170> 7<00:03:26.180> we<00:03:27.180> dead<00:03:27.480> shot<00:03:27.660> that

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
around 6 from around 7 we dead shot that

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.720 
around 6 from around 7 we dead shot that
query<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:29.220> means<00:03:29.430> I'm<00:03:29.930> fuck<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.579> went<00:03:32.579> to<00:03:32.639> put

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
query that means I'm fuck I went to put

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.589 
query that means I'm fuck I went to put
guns<00:03:32.910> between<00:03:33.230> 650<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.260> 700<00:03:34.650> PP<00:03:35.599> average

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
guns between 650 and 700 PP average

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:43.220 
guns between 650 and 700 PP average
that's<00:03:36.840> 700<00:03:37.560> so<00:03:40.700> dead<00:03:41.700> shot<00:03:41.880> query<00:03:42.359> increases

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
that's 700 so dead shot query increases

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.970 
that's 700 so dead shot query increases
the<00:03:43.549> importance<00:03:44.549> headshot<00:03:45.090> damage<00:03:45.980> by

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
the importance headshot damage by

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.240 
the importance headshot damage by
roughly<00:03:47.310> around<00:03:47.730> 75%<00:03:48.599> so<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.799> applies<00:03:50.069> to

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
roughly around 75% so that applies to

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.150 
roughly around 75% so that applies to
all<00:03:50.370> gun<00:03:50.549> so<00:03:50.849> yeah<00:03:51.530> -<00:03:52.530> up<00:03:52.709> that<00:03:52.889> query

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
all gun so yeah - up that query

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.530 
all gun so yeah - up that query
increases<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.880> headshots<00:03:55.069> by<00:03:56.069> 35%<00:03:56.880> so

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
increases the headshots by 35% so

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.190 
increases the headshots by 35% so
fucking<00:03:58.169> yeah<00:03:58.290> it's<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.500> good<00:03:58.650> bonus<00:04:00.109> it's<00:04:01.109> a
