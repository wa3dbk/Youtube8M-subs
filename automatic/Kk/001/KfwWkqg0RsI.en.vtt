00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
I'm really just kind of starting out in

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.700 
I'm really just kind of starting out in
this<00:00:38.610> whole<00:00:38.899> arena<00:00:39.899> I've<00:00:40.170> never<00:00:40.320> tried<00:00:40.559> one

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
this whole arena I've never tried one

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.560 
this whole arena I've never tried one
before<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:41.219> used<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.760> know<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> friend<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.390> had

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
before I used to know a friend that had

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.240 
before I used to know a friend that had
one<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.379> thought<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:43.739> pretty<00:00:43.890> cool<00:00:44.100> but

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
one and I thought it was pretty cool but

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.520 
one and I thought it was pretty cool but
I<00:00:44.309> never<00:00:44.520> committed<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.000> buying<00:00:45.210> my<00:00:45.450> own<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.930> I

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
I never committed to buying my own and I

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.200 
I never committed to buying my own and I
think<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.800> wife<00:00:46.950> was<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> little<00:00:47.489> skeptical<00:00:47.850> as

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
think my wife was a little skeptical as

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.389 
think my wife was a little skeptical as
to<00:00:48.270> how<00:00:49.200> much<00:00:49.320> use<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:49.829> actually<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
to how much use it's actually going to

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.920 
to how much use it's actually going to
get<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:52.340> factoring<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.059> decided<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.809> go

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
get so factoring that in I decided to go

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.619 
get so factoring that in I decided to go
for<00:00:55.140> something<00:00:55.410> not<00:00:55.829> quite<00:00:56.100> high<00:00:56.850> end<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.449> not

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
for something not quite high end but not

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.630 
for something not quite high end but not
the<00:00:57.780> absolute<00:00:58.170> bare<00:00:58.649> minimum<00:00:58.680> cheapest<00:00:59.489> one

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
you can buy it either so case anyone

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.649 
you can buy it either so case anyone
