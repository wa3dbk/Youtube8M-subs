00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
through this version because I don't

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.160 
through this version because I don't
like<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.730> gameplay<00:04:59.940> as<00:05:00.390> much<00:05:00.600> as<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.840> Gambel

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
like the gameplay as much as the Gambel

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.410 
like the gameplay as much as the Gambel
version<00:05:01.500> so<00:05:01.950> if<00:05:02.250> I<00:05:02.520> was<00:05:02.640> playing<00:05:02.910> this<00:05:03.120> in<00:05:03.330> The

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
version so if I was playing this in The

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.420 
version so if I was playing this in The
Gambler<00:05:03.780> version<00:05:04.200> I'd<00:05:04.560> rather<00:05:04.770> play<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.280> game

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
Gambler version I'd rather play the game

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.910 
Gambler version I'd rather play the game
boy<00:05:05.640> version<00:05:05.670> because<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.930> game<00:05:07.140> plays<00:05:07.410> is<00:05:07.710> so

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
boy version because the game plays is so

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.160 
boy version because the game plays is so
well<00:05:08.190> balanced<00:05:08.970> and<00:05:09.150> just<00:05:09.360> works<00:05:09.630> so<00:05:09.810> much

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
well balanced and just works so much

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.720 
well balanced and just works so much
better<00:05:10.410> than<00:05:10.560> this<00:05:10.680> version<00:05:11.070> even<00:05:11.520> though

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
better than this version even though

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.160 
better than this version even though
this<00:05:11.850> version<00:05:12.030> looks<00:05:12.360> cool<00:05:12.600> being<00:05:12.840> in<00:05:12.930> color

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
this version looks cool being in color

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.110 
this version looks cool being in color
and<00:05:13.350> all<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:13.710> having<00:05:13.890> the<00:05:13.980> blood<00:05:14.190> and<00:05:14.490> and

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
and all and having the blood and and

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:22.690 
and all and having the blood and and
everything<00:05:16.910> yeah<00:05:18.200> so<00:05:19.250> probably<00:05:20.250> give<00:05:20.460> MK<00:05:21.360> to

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
everything yeah so probably give MK to

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:28.400 
everything yeah so probably give MK to
gameboy<00:05:23.700> and<00:05:24.890> that<00:05:25.890> is<00:05:26.130> 7<00:05:26.700> 7<00:05:27.630> out<00:05:27.870> of<00:05:27.900> 10

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
gameboy and that is 7 7 out of 10

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.320 
gameboy and that is 7 7 out of 10
yeah<00:05:29.270> obviously<00:05:30.270> better<00:05:30.930> than<00:05:31.140> MK<00:05:31.350> 1<00:05:31.880> but<00:05:32.880> not

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
yeah obviously better than MK 1 but not

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.090 
yeah obviously better than MK 1 but not
