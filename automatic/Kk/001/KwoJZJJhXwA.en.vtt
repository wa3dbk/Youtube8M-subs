the<00:01:27.670> voice<00:01:27.790> interface<00:01:28.060> came<00:01:28.570> on<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:28.900> it<00:01:29.020> was

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
the voice interface came on and it was

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.969 
the voice interface came on and it was
David<00:01:29.409> Tennant<00:01:29.770> um<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.869> I<00:01:32.200> think<00:01:32.590> people<00:01:32.890> are

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
David Tennant um but I think people are

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.359 
David Tennant um but I think people are
wondering<00:01:33.369> is<00:01:33.820> this<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.299> brand<00:01:34.810> new<00:01:34.960> figure<00:01:35.369> or

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
wondering is this a brand new figure or

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.210 
wondering is this a brand new figure or
is<00:01:36.640> it<00:01:36.880> like<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:38.380> figure<00:01:38.799> that<00:01:38.890> was<00:01:39.009> never

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
is it like a figure that was never

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.700 
is it like a figure that was never
released<00:01:39.430> for<00:01:39.939> series<00:01:40.270> 3<00:01:40.600> 4<00:01:41.259> in<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.409> series<00:01:41.439> 3

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
released for series 3 4 in the series 3

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.010 
released for series 3 4 in the series 3
range<00:01:42.159> I<00:01:42.460> think<00:01:42.970> it's<00:01:43.180> a<00:01:43.329> finger<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:43.900> was

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
range I think it's a finger that was

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.450 
range I think it's a finger that was
never<00:01:44.200> released<00:01:44.350> in<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.650> series<00:01:45.009> 3<00:01:45.220> range

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
never released in the series 3 range

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.130 
never released in the series 3 range
because<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:46.360> didn't<00:01:46.630> even<00:01:46.810> have<00:01:46.930> proper

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
because it didn't even have proper

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.510 
because it didn't even have proper
packaging<00:01:47.439> it<00:01:47.890> was<00:01:47.979> just<00:01:48.130> in<00:01:48.250> this<00:01:48.369> little

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
packaging it was just in this little

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.670 
packaging it was just in this little
plastic<00:01:48.820> bag<00:01:49.210> they<00:01:49.810> had<00:01:49.930> loads<00:01:50.200> of<00:01:50.380> them<00:01:50.530> and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
plastic bag they had loads of them and

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.050 
plastic bag they had loads of them and
they<00:01:50.770> were<00:01:50.829> selling<00:01:51.070> quite<00:01:51.399> fast<00:01:51.670> because

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
they were selling quite fast because

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.100 
they were selling quite fast because
they're<00:01:52.299> probably<00:01:52.509> never<00:01:52.750> going<00:01:52.930> to<00:01:53.020> be

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
they're probably never going to be

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.389 
they're probably never going to be
available<00:01:53.560> again<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.619> figure<00:01:56.920> for

verdict<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:06.229> let's<00:02:06.409> get<00:02:06.530> on<00:02:06.649> with<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.890> review

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
verdict so let's get on with the review

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.170 
verdict so let's get on with the review
so<00:02:09.560> I'm<00:02:09.619> starting<00:02:09.950> with<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.340> head<00:02:12.370> so<00:02:13.370> the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
so I'm starting with the head so the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.509 
so I'm starting with the head so the
managed<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.630> put<00:02:15.019> the<00:02:15.110> face<00:02:15.349> on<00:02:15.650> even<00:02:16.430> though

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
managed to put the face on even though

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.990 
managed to put the face on even though
it's<00:02:16.670> transparent<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:17.540> that's<00:02:17.720> good<00:02:18.019> but

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
it's transparent so that's good but

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.120 
it's transparent so that's good but
obviously<00:02:20.000> because<00:02:20.269> it's<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.480> hologram<00:02:21.130> there

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
obviously because it's a hologram there

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.020 
obviously because it's a hologram there
is<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:23.140> don't<00:02:24.140> know<00:02:24.230> Devan<00:02:24.950> there's<00:02:25.670> not<00:02:25.819> really

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
is I don't know Devan there's not really

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.690 
is I don't know Devan there's not really
any<00:02:26.269> sort<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:26.780> darker<00:02:27.319> I<00:02:27.560> was<00:02:28.400> not<00:02:28.519> really

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
any sort of darker I was not really

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.850 
any sort of darker I was not really
different<00:02:28.940> shades<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.540> paint<00:02:30.290> on<00:02:30.470> this

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
different shades of paint on this

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.280 
different shades of paint on this
because<00:02:31.099> it's<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.430> hologram<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:32.000> do<00:02:32.900> think<00:02:33.110> they

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
because it's a hologram I do think they

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.309 
because it's a hologram I do think they
could<00:02:33.470> have<00:02:33.560> perhaps<00:02:33.709> me<00:02:34.130> mate<00:02:34.880> but<00:02:35.630> coated

could have perhaps me mate but coated

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.130 
had some sort of like depth the depth is
the<00:02:47.060> wrong<00:02:47.209> word<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.630> don't<00:02:47.840> know<00:02:47.959> you<00:02:48.110> know

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
the wrong word I don't know you know

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.490 
the wrong word I don't know you know
what<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.440> mean<00:02:48.650> moving<00:02:49.610> on<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:50.230> suit<00:02:51.230> the

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
what I mean moving on to suit the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.170 
what I mean moving on to suit the
pinstripes<00:02:52.069> been<00:02:52.310> painted<00:02:52.700> in<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.880> lovely

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
pinstripes been painted in a lovely

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.479 
pinstripes been painted in a lovely
silver<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:53.750> they<00:02:53.950> reflective<00:02:54.950> just<00:02:55.190> like<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
silver so they reflective just like the

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.130 
silver so they reflective just like the
best<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.910> figure<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.329> is<00:02:56.480> good<00:02:56.690> i<00:02:56.720> like<00:02:56.930> that

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
best to figure that is good i like that

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.500 
best to figure that is good i like that
and<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:58.160> feels<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.760> bit<00:02:58.790> weird<00:02:59.030> actually

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
and it feels a bit weird actually

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.559 
and it feels a bit weird actually
because<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.709> coat<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.160> still<00:03:02.060> made<00:03:02.269> of<00:03:02.450> the

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
because the coat is still made of the

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.380 
because the coat is still made of the
same<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:04.220> jaws<00:03:04.430> jacket<00:03:04.880> still<00:03:05.030> made<00:03:05.180> of<00:03:05.299> the

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
this matt smith regeneration figure

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.539 
this matt smith regeneration figure
which<00:03:11.120> i<00:03:11.209> also<00:03:11.390> bought<00:03:11.690> at<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.930> event<00:03:12.230> and

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
which i also bought at the event and

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.920 
which i also bought at the event and
then<00:03:13.549> you<00:03:13.850> can<00:03:14.000> see<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.299> tight<00:03:14.540> through<00:03:14.900> the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
then you can see the tight through the

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.559 
then you can see the tight through the
jacket<00:03:15.470> which<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.980> not<00:03:16.970> accurate<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.540> the

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
jacket which is not accurate to the

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.930 
jacket which is not accurate to the
house<00:03:18.200> in<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.620> show<00:03:18.829> but<00:03:18.859> i<00:03:19.250> like<00:03:19.549> it<00:03:19.790> i<00:03:19.850> think

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
house in the show but i like it i think

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.170 
house in the show but i like it i think
it's<00:03:20.209> quite<00:03:20.930> good<00:03:21.170> but<00:03:21.920> then<00:03:22.100> they're<00:03:22.280> my<00:03:22.519> only

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
it's quite good but then they're my only

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.000 
it's quite good but then they're my only
problem<00:03:23.510> with<00:03:23.810> transparent<00:03:24.650> figures<00:03:24.889> like

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
problem with transparent figures like

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.539 
problem with transparent figures like
this<00:03:25.190> is<00:03:25.480> then<00:03:26.480> they've<00:03:26.810> got<00:03:26.840> these<00:03:27.549> numbers

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
this is then they've got these numbers

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:29.800 
this is then they've got these numbers
on<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.700> back<00:03:28.910> which<00:03:29.120> i'm<00:03:29.269> assuming<00:03:29.359> something

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
on the back which i'm assuming something

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.370 
on the back which i'm assuming something
to<00:03:30.019> do<00:03:30.139> with<00:03:30.519> production<00:03:31.519> of<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.750> figures<00:03:33.139> and

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
to do with production of the figures and

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.710 
to do with production of the figures and
then<00:03:34.069> you<00:03:34.220> can<00:03:34.400> see<00:03:34.639> them<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.090> then<00:03:35.269> you<00:03:35.540> can

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
then you can see them and then you can

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.830 
then you can see them and then you can
see<00:03:35.930> through<00:03:36.590> them<00:03:36.739> all<00:03:36.859> the<00:03:37.329> screw<00:03:38.329> holes<00:03:38.600> and

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
see through them all the screw holes and

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.539 
see through them all the screw holes and
stuff<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:39.319> said<00:03:39.859> it<00:03:39.950> doesn't<00:03:40.040> bother<00:03:40.310> the

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
stuff I said it doesn't bother the

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.550 
stuff I said it doesn't bother the
amount<00:03:40.760> that<00:03:40.850> much<00:03:41.180> it's<00:03:41.720> quite<00:03:41.900> cool<00:03:42.139> how<00:03:42.530> you

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
amount that much it's quite cool how you

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.670 
amount that much it's quite cool how you
can<00:03:42.889> just<00:03:43.040> see<00:03:43.160> them<00:03:43.660> through<00:03:44.660> but<00:03:45.079> I<00:03:45.319> don't

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
can just see them through but I don't

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.460 
can just see them through but I don't
know<00:03:45.769> it's<00:03:45.950> kind<00:03:46.010> of<00:03:46.400> messy<00:03:46.819> and<00:03:47.109> not<00:03:48.109> very

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
know it's kind of messy and not very

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.729 
know it's kind of messy and not very
accurate<00:03:48.680> to<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.340> show<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:53.380> moving<00:03:54.380> on<00:03:54.590> you

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
accurate to the show so moving on you

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.110 
accurate to the show so moving on you
still<00:03:54.950> got<00:03:55.069> all<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.310> same<00:03:55.489> details<00:03:55.910> on<00:03:56.090> a

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
still got all the same details on a

um<00:04:40.639> I<00:04:41.210> probably<00:04:41.780> missed<00:04:42.020> bit<00:04:42.320> so<00:04:42.500> I<00:04:42.590> don't<00:04:42.800> know

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919

um I probably missed bit so I don't know
this<00:04:43.550> will<00:04:43.700> probably<00:04:43.730> be<00:04:44.030> one<00:04:44.270> of<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.480> only

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
this will probably be one of the only

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.740 
this will probably be one of the only
reviews<00:04:45.110> of<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.380> figure<00:04:45.650> on<00:04:45.680> YouTube<00:04:46.190> I<00:04:46.750> don't

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
know but anyway I'm going to go through

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.540 
know but anyway I'm going to go through
the<00:04:49.190> articulation<00:04:50.180> next<00:04:50.630> because<00:04:50.840> why<00:04:51.110> not<00:04:51.550> so

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
the articulation next because why not so

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.750 
the articulation next because why not so

the head can turn from side to side it's

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.180 
the head can turn from side to side it's

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.950 
kind of restricted by the jacket it
could<00:04:58.310> probably<00:04:58.460> could<00:04:58.760> do<00:04:58.880> a<00:04:58.910> 360<00:04:59.600> if<00:04:59.810> it

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
risk it in a good example actually i'm

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.930 
risk it in a good example actually i'm
going<00:06:03.800> to<00:06:03.860> go<00:06:03.979> yet<00:06:04.190> this<00:06:04.340> actually<00:06:04.700> because

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
going to go yet this actually because

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.990 
going to go yet this actually because
it's<00:06:05.060> quite<00:06:05.210> a<00:06:05.270> good<00:06:05.450> example<00:06:06.080> of<00:06:07.000> what

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
it's quite a good example of what
