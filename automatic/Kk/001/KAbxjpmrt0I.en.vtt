percentage because homogenized milk

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.780

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
yeah basically what that allows is

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.680 
yeah basically what that allows is
better<00:01:11.320> or<00:01:12.160> more<00:01:12.400> air<00:01:12.670> to<00:01:13.000> stay<00:01:13.240> in<00:01:13.300> with<00:01:13.570> the
