grabbers<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.260> could<00:00:28.380> find<00:00:28.619> make<00:00:28.830> something

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
grabbers you could find make something

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.620 
grabbers you could find make something
useful<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.760> you're<00:00:30.090> pretty<00:00:30.269> much<00:00:30.359> guaranteed

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
useful and you're pretty much guaranteed

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.860 
useful and you're pretty much guaranteed
to<00:00:30.960> pass<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:32.160> anyways<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.910> thought<00:00:33.630> it'd<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.780> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
to pass but anyways I thought it'd be a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.600 
to pass but anyways I thought it'd be a
good<00:00:34.079> opportunity<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.070> good<00:00:35.219> excuse<00:00:35.579> to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
good opportunity and a good excuse to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.520 
good opportunity and a good excuse to
make<00:00:35.820> something<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> saw<00:00:36.899> jack<00:00:37.290> white

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
make something that I saw jack white

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.310 
make something that I saw jack white
from<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.800> white<00:00:37.890> stripes<00:00:38.340> doing<00:00:38.670> this

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
from the white stripes doing this

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.209 
from the white stripes doing this
documentary<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.040> saw<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.399> TV<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:42.180> day<00:00:42.210> um

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219

go at school in the tech shopping I got
a<00:00:52.079> plank<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.739> wood<00:00:52.800> better<00:00:53.250> than<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.640> it's

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
a plank of wood better than that it's

it's useful and here we have it an

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.810 
it's useful and here we have it an
electric<00:01:05.580> guitar<00:01:05.689> so<00:01:07.340> basically<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> basic

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
electric guitar so basically the basic

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.120 
electric guitar so basically the basic
material<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.360> need<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:10.130> effect

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
can call it an instrument is a plank of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
can call it an instrument is a plank of
wood<00:01:13.619> ah<00:01:15.439> you'll<00:01:16.439> want<00:01:16.680> at<00:01:16.770> least<00:01:16.860> one<00:01:17.130> pick<00:01:17.400> up

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
wood ah you'll want at least one pick up

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.840 
wood ah you'll want at least one pick up
I<00:01:17.790> got<00:01:18.180> three<00:01:18.509> pickups<00:01:18.750> cuz<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:20.189> had<00:01:20.610> three

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
I got three pickups cuz I I had three

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.310 
I got three pickups cuz I I had three
pickups<00:01:21.060> then<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.659> want<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.990> put<00:01:22.140> three

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
pickups then I just want to put three

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.840 
pickups then I just want to put three
pickups<00:01:23.210> two<00:01:24.210> screws<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.460> always<00:01:26.580> put<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
pickups two screws you can always put a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.819 
pickups two screws you can always put a
third<00:01:27.060> screw<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.600> tuning<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.140> did<00:01:28.350> incorporate

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
third screw for tuning I did incorporate

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.140 
third screw for tuning I did incorporate
tuning<00:01:29.579> into<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.970> piece<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.509> junk<00:01:30.650> um

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
tuning into this piece of junk um

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.700 
tuning into this piece of junk um
because<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.360> had<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.810> idea<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.470> thought

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
because I had the idea and I thought

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.460 
because I had the idea and I thought
maybe<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.250> will<00:01:35.460> work<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.030> hopefully<00:01:36.180> will

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
maybe it will work and I hopefully will

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.660 
maybe it will work and I hopefully will
so<00:01:37.470> anyway<00:01:37.680> that's<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:38.189> your<00:01:38.369> tuning

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
so anyway that's you that's your tuning

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.850 
so anyway that's you that's your tuning
screw<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> just<00:01:39.210> gave<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.570> new<00:01:39.750> word<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.740> is

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
screw I just gave it a new word this is

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.730 
screw I just gave it a new word this is
your<00:01:40.979> tuning<00:01:41.250> screw<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.390> these<00:01:42.600> two<00:01:42.869> screws

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
your tuning screw and these two screws

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.719 
your tuning screw and these two screws
is<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.399> keep<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.540> strings<00:01:46.040> or<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.280> string

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
is just I keep the strings or the string

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.050 
is just I keep the strings or the string
it's<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.180> one<00:01:48.329> string<00:01:48.630> instruments<00:01:50.060> together

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
it's a one string instruments together

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.289 
it's a one string instruments together
as<00:01:51.530> well<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.590> took<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.920> glass<00:01:53.159> bottle<00:01:53.670> supposedly

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
as well I took a glass bottle supposedly

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.420 
as well I took a glass bottle supposedly
glass<00:01:54.570> resonates<00:01:55.140> better<00:01:55.350> than<00:01:55.590> plastic<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.399> I

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
glass resonates better than plastic so I

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
glass resonates better than plastic so I
stuck<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.000> glass<00:01:58.579> I'm<00:01:59.579> going<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.880> put<00:02:00.420> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
stuck the glass I'm going to put a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.530 
stuck the glass I'm going to put a
coca-cola<00:02:00.990> bottle<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:02.280> match<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.790> coca-cola

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
coca-cola bottle to match the coca-cola

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
jack it took me about two hours to put

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.929 
jack it took me about two hours to put
it<00:02:28.379> all<00:02:28.500> together<00:02:28.709> because<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.519> three<00:02:29.760> pic

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
it all together because of the three pic

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.569 
it all together because of the three pic
of<00:02:30.060> selection<00:02:30.659> and<00:02:30.900> plus<00:02:31.409> the<00:02:31.590> jack<00:02:32.129> wasn't<00:02:32.519> on

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
of selection and plus the jack wasn't on

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.490 
of selection and plus the jack wasn't on
the<00:02:32.700> pickups<00:02:33.060> already<00:02:33.389> so<00:02:33.599> how<00:02:33.659> to<00:02:33.719> solder

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
the pickups already so how to solder

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.369 
the pickups already so how to solder
that<00:02:34.680> together<00:02:35.659> this<00:02:36.659> projects<00:02:37.139> shouldn't

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
that together this projects shouldn't

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.750 
that together this projects shouldn't
take<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.680> more<00:02:37.709> than<00:02:37.859> 20<00:02:38.189> minutes<00:02:38.370> but<00:02:38.670> it

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
take you more than 20 minutes but it

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.110 
take you more than 20 minutes but it
took<00:02:38.849> me<00:02:39.000> three<00:02:39.209> hours<00:02:39.239> because<00:02:39.629> of<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.049> um

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
took me three hours because of that um

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.990 
took me three hours because of that um
but<00:02:42.120> yeah<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:43.010> my<00:02:44.010> goal<00:02:44.219> was<00:02:44.579> just<00:02:44.819> basically

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
but yeah so my goal was just basically

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.440 
but yeah so my goal was just basically
to<00:02:45.329> get<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.480> sound<00:02:45.750> out<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.169> I<00:02:46.970> got<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.150> managed

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
to get a sound out of it I got I managed

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.670 
to get a sound out of it I got I managed
to<00:02:48.480> get<00:02:48.629> three<00:02:48.840> or<00:02:48.870> four<00:02:49.109> notes<00:02:49.349> that<00:02:49.470> other

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
to get three or four notes that other

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.379 
to get three or four notes that other
thing<00:02:49.889> I'm<00:02:50.400> sure<00:02:50.459> if<00:02:50.669> I<00:02:50.760> tweaked<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.269> have

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
thing I'm sure if I tweaked and have

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.599 
thing I'm sure if I tweaked and have
more<00:02:51.569> time<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.019> maybe<00:02:52.230> have<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.799> little

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
more time and maybe have a little

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.970 
more time and maybe have a little
selection<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.329> notes<00:02:54.569> but<00:02:54.900> here<00:02:55.590> we<00:02:55.680> have<00:02:55.709> it

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
selection of notes but here we have it

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:06.530 
selection of notes but here we have it
all<00:02:56.540> right<00:02:57.540> now<00:02:57.629> I<00:02:57.659> think<00:02:57.959> it's<00:02:58.079> a<00:02:58.169> little<00:03:05.540> it's

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
all right now I think it's a little it's

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:14.140 
all right now I think it's a little it's
a<00:03:11.810> cheap

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
a cheap

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.530 
a cheap
so<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.280> got<00:03:16.280> my<00:03:16.400> trusty<00:03:16.640> screwdriver<00:03:17.030> right

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
here slightly we thought we're

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.789 
here slightly we thought we're
combusting<00:03:30.560> in<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.799> eye

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
enough so we'll test that out and see
