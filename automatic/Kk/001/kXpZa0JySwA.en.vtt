the nu tier which it's kind of

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.149 
the nu tier which it's kind of
surprising<00:01:15.240> considering<00:01:16.020> its<00:01:16.409> really<00:01:16.920> great

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
surprising considering its really great

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.200 
surprising considering its really great
amazing<00:01:18.030> base<00:01:18.420> stats<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.930> my<00:01:19.020> opinion<00:01:20.000> 110<00:01:21.000> HP

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
amazing base stats in my opinion 110 HP

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.320 
amazing base stats in my opinion 110 HP
and<00:01:21.689> 95<00:01:22.290> defenses<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.040> both<00:01:23.400> sides<00:01:23.759> making<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and 95 defenses on both sides making a

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.080 
and 95 defenses on both sides making a
very<00:01:24.780> robust<00:01:25.290> being<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.040> normal<00:01:26.280> type<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.880> does

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
very robust being a normal type it does

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.090 
very robust being a normal type it does
not<00:01:27.270> support<00:01:27.570> any<00:01:27.750> resistances<00:01:28.530> however<00:01:28.979> on

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
not support any resistances however on

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.010 
not support any resistances however on
the<00:01:29.220> plus<00:01:29.250> side<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.850> has<00:01:29.939> no<00:01:30.150> weaknesses<00:01:30.720> other

the plus side it has no weaknesses other
than<00:01:31.560> fighting<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.259> pretty<00:01:34.259> much<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.710> safe

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
than fighting so pretty much it's safe

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.800 
than fighting so pretty much it's safe
to<00:01:35.070> say<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.250> with<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> max<00:01:35.790> HP<00:01:36.030> investment

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
to say that with a max HP investment

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.670 
to say that with a max HP investment
this<00:01:37.439> thing<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:37.920> take<00:01:38.340> unstaffed<00:01:39.210> moves<00:01:39.720> non

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
this thing can take unstaffed moves non

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.380 
this thing can take unstaffed moves non
boosted<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.280> stab<00:01:41.549> moves<00:01:41.850> from<00:01:42.060> pretty<00:01:42.270> much

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
boosted on stab moves from pretty much

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.770 
boosted on stab moves from pretty much
anything<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:44.189> long<00:01:44.970> as<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.420> know<00:01:45.540> not

depending on the set you want to go for
and<00:02:26.520> explosion<00:02:27.520> now<00:02:27.970> this<00:02:28.150> set<00:02:28.390> works<00:02:28.600> best

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
and explosion now this set works best

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.410

for<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.260> fourth<00:02:29.590> generation<00:02:30.390> although<00:02:31.390> i

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
for the fourth generation although i

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.240 
for the fourth generation although i
think<00:02:31.570> it<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.110> completely<00:02:32.680> legal<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.160> valid

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
think it is completely legal and valid

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.850 
think it is completely legal and valid
for<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.730> fifth<00:02:33.910> generation<00:02:34.210> as<00:02:34.480> well<00:02:34.510> um<00:02:34.960> some

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
for the fifth generation as well um some

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.290 
for the fifth generation as well um some
people<00:02:36.130> have<00:02:36.250> questioned<00:02:36.670> whether<00:02:36.790> or<00:02:37.180> not

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
on like smogon you will that's because

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.980 
on like smogon you will that's because
which<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.910> I<00:02:49.090> believe<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.750> third<00:02:50.110> generation<00:02:50.410> a

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
which is I believe a third generation a

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.199 
which is I believe a third generation a
third<00:02:52.990> generation<00:02:53.230> event<00:02:54.040> move<00:02:54.340> for<00:02:54.970> licky

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
third generation event move for licky

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.630 
third generation event move for licky
licky<00:02:55.540> as<00:02:55.720> well<00:02:56.020> as<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.320> believe<00:02:56.470> he'll<00:02:56.830> bail<00:02:57.040> so

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
licky as well as I believe he'll bail so

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
licky as well as I believe he'll bail so
those<00:02:58.600> are<00:02:58.630> options<00:02:59.110> for<00:02:59.500> licky<00:02:59.980> licky<00:03:00.280> um

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
those are options for licky licky um

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.570 
those are options for licky licky um
just<00:03:01.660> keep<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:02.020> in<00:03:02.260> mind<00:03:02.590> as<00:03:02.860> long<00:03:03.250> as<00:03:03.490> you're

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
just keep that in mind as long as you're

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.760 
just keep that in mind as long as you're
not<00:03:03.640> using<00:03:03.880> any<00:03:04.209> like<00:03:04.450> egg<00:03:04.660> moves<00:03:04.900> because

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
not using any like egg moves because

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.000 
not using any like egg moves because
obviously<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.209> from<00:03:07.390> an<00:03:07.510> event<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:08.620> yeah

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
obviously it is from an event so yeah

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.120 
obviously it is from an event so yeah
you<00:03:09.250> use<00:03:09.430> wish<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:09.970> protect<00:03:10.390> along<00:03:10.900> with<00:03:11.130> his

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
you use wish and protect along with his

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.980 
you use wish and protect along with his
natural<00:03:12.670> bulk<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.270> pretty<00:03:13.480> much<00:03:13.600> be<00:03:13.780> able<00:03:13.930> to

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
natural bulk to pretty much be able to

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.380 
natural bulk to pretty much be able to
switch<00:03:14.200> into<00:03:14.320> anything<00:03:14.740> set<00:03:15.400> up<00:03:15.490> a<00:03:15.610> wish<00:03:15.790> go

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
switch into anything set up a wish go

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
it's just not really um because it's not

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.350
