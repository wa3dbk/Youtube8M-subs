Bulgarian<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.920> think<00:00:50.370> they<00:00:51.000> cover<00:00:51.239> it

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
Bulgarian one but I think they cover it

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.729 
Bulgarian one but I think they cover it
on<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.110> seventh<00:00:52.680> listen<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.350> every
