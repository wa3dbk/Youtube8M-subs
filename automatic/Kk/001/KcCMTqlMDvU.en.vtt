00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.180
 Murphy and you can remember that 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.180
 but just recently the detox 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.619
 series and I presented 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.390
 actually wanted to continue in this fled 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.529
 do that on the jobs 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.810
 introduce products 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.730
 unfortunately, really no matter in others 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.980
 circumstances and thus and became my plan 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.899
 a bit confused 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.460
 because I can tell you because now in 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.500
 the middle of the fourth month thank God 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.680
 arrived because the first weeks in 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.379
 Third month was a disaster 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.350
 I was smell sensitive I have 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.219
 I believe more of salt bars 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.480
 Sagittarius Fritz Kola Michaela 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.300
 there was even to think about it 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.249
 is saying begins with a the toxic among others 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.140
 not if you only have the whole day 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:59.319
 It's all vegan but it was scrap 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.909
 it was really just garbage 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:04.190
 yes I wanted to give you this before 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.269
 I imagine the texts of fictitious 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.100
 I've already something into the bowl 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.250
 Made to look like you look great 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.490
 Looks we have green tea that is 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.910
 Of course he is known as 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.250
 radical scavenger 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.840
 We have lions to pay that's not surprising 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.700
 because i have a lot to do as a teenager 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.770
 Dandelion drinking tea in hope 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.780
 detoxify my liver and so mine 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.220
 get a grip on the file 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.750
 Unfortunately that did not work and me 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.640
 could not drink this tea because he 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.320
 tasted so horribly bitter and 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.790
 it's really nice 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.670
 maybe also because of that 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.860
 in it and pineapple and apple chips 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.050
 So try them too 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.060
 should really 28 days drifted 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.380
 I've only been around for two weeks now 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.390
 I have to say so I'm fine 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.580
 much better 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.070
 I was in the beginning indeed so true 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.160
 but anyway such these bloated 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.350
 I notice somewhere well-feeling 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.479
 it helps me unbelievable who the morgans 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.580
 chain was incredibly good in shape as 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.710
 a circuit is activated but you have it 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.970
 not for the prophet and celebrated by 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.979
 be a hole in it again 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.020
 really comfortable super they could 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.899
 So also drink ways to be pregnant so 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.540
 how I could sing the only tdi 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.760
 the inner balance is the king in 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.900
 the beginning was anything else 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.430
 I really do not want to think about it 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.990
 it is why I again later in 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.410
 all rest to the individual theses 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.270
 offers e- and s-class is indeed synonymous 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.430
 really the wonderfruit in things 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.100
 radical catcher you know free 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.830
 Radicals are actually the ones 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.350
 main culprit for the aging processes 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.150
 and I also like to do a video 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.760
 This should have been until then 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.530
 By the way, he gets that ti 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.010
 ordered the complete set and with the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.290
 kot katharina 15 gets 15 discount 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.700
 I wish you a lot of fun with the one 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.950
 feedback if I tasted good 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.420
 and we effected in you also effected 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.420
 So far
