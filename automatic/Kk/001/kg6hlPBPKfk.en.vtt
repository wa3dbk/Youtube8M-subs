00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.970 
time of the Ascension as we're talking
about<00:00:12.090> 2012<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.200> destruction<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.950> earth

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
about 2012 and destruction of the earth

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.010 
about 2012 and destruction of the earth
but<00:00:14.639> we<00:00:14.730> said<00:00:14.849> we<00:00:15.000> wanted<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.299> focus<00:00:15.540> not<00:00:15.990> on

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
but we said we wanted to focus not on

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.349 
but we said we wanted to focus not on
calamity<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.010> destruction<00:00:17.550> but<00:00:18.029> what<00:00:18.240> are

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
calamity and destruction but what are

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.510 
calamity and destruction but what are
the<00:00:18.480> deeper<00:00:19.140> more<00:00:19.350> spiritual<00:00:19.980> meanings

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the light are going to come it so that

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.050 
the light are going to come it so that
cause<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.290> kind<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.619> runs<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:26.040> there<00:01:26.280> one<00:01:26.939> of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
cause it kind of runs in there one of

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.609 
cause it kind of runs in there one of
the<00:01:27.150> interesting<00:01:27.240> concepts<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.229> talked<00:01:28.470> about

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
the interesting concepts we talked about

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.950 
the interesting concepts we talked about
was<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:28.979> there<00:01:29.340> are<00:01:29.490> pure<00:01:30.030> water<00:01:30.299> channels

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
was that there are pure water channels

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.240 
was that there are pure water channels
within<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.920> salt<00:01:32.220> water<00:01:33.650> well<00:01:34.650> as<00:01:34.799> above<00:01:35.189> so

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
within the salt water well as above so

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.819 
within the salt water well as above so
below<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> common<00:01:36.930> concept<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.530> balance

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
below is a common concept of balance

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.010 
below is a common concept of balance
that<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.100> know<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.299> same<00:01:39.600> way<00:01:39.810> that

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
that we know and so the same way that

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.800 
that we know and so the same way that
there<00:01:40.320> are<00:01:41.570> waters<00:01:43.009> separating<00:01:44.009> as<00:01:44.390> sees<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
there are waters separating as sees the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.010 
there are waters separating as sees the
lands<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.409> earth<00:01:47.659> similarly<00:01:48.659> there<00:01:49.229> are

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
lands of the earth similarly there are

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.770 
lands of the earth similarly there are
seized<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.380> space<00:01:53.180> separating<00:01:54.180> planets

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
seized of space separating planets

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.889 
seized of space separating planets
within<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:56.520> galaxy<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.180> universe<00:01:57.630> and

within the galaxy on the universe and

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.020 
within the galaxy on the universe and
just<00:01:58.500> as<00:01:58.649> much<00:01:58.799> as<00:01:59.009> there<00:01:59.219> are<00:01:59.369> pure<00:01:59.729> water

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
just as much as there are pure water

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.719 
just as much as there are pure water

there<00:02:03.570> are<00:02:03.780> pure<00:02:04.320> water<00:02:04.820> traveling<00:02:05.820> channels

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
there are pure water traveling channels

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.040 
there are pure water traveling channels
within<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.409> seas<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.190> space<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:09.119> above<00:02:10.020> so

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
within the seas of space as above so

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.320 
within the seas of space as above so
below<00:02:10.289> as<00:02:11.039> below<00:02:11.760> so

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
below as below so

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.660 
below as below so
above<00:02:13.570> you<00:02:14.230> see<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.560> balance<00:02:14.920> goes<00:02:15.100> both<00:02:15.430> ways

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
above you see the balance goes both ways

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.830 
above you see the balance goes both ways
and<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.000> we're<00:02:16.120> going<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.300> be<00:02:16.390> talking<00:02:16.570> about

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
and so we're going to be talking about

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.660 
and so we're going to be talking about
some<00:02:17.050> interesting<00:02:17.470> concepts<00:02:18.010> here<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.340> just

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
some interesting concepts here I just

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.220 
some interesting concepts here I just
wanted<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.000> throw<00:02:19.210> that<00:02:19.300> one<00:02:19.480> out<00:02:19.690> there<00:02:20.050> since

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
wanted to throw that one out there since

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.260 
wanted to throw that one out there since
you<00:02:20.380> could<00:02:20.530> see<00:02:21.340> how<00:02:21.520> that<00:02:21.700> relates<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.150> the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
you could see how that relates to the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.760 
you could see how that relates to the
time<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.630> Noah<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.050> some<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.590> interesting

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
time of Noah and some of the interesting

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.010 
time of Noah and some of the interesting
things<00:02:24.160> we<00:02:24.280> talked<00:02:24.490> about<00:02:24.640> but<00:02:25.360> what<00:02:25.540> happens

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
things we talked about but what happens

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.020 
things we talked about but what happens
after<00:02:26.170> Noah<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:29.200> various<00:02:30.040> races<00:02:30.370> take<00:02:30.820> up

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
after Noah is that various races take up

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.330 
after Noah is that various races take up
different<00:02:31.510> stands<00:02:32.050> with<00:02:32.230> what<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.980> do<00:02:33.130> with

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
different stands with what to do with

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.980 
different stands with what to do with
humanity<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.240> a<00:02:35.910> process<00:02:36.910> gets<00:02:37.270> enacted

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
humanity and a process gets enacted

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.840 
humanity and a process gets enacted
again<00:02:38.260> where<00:02:38.560> most<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.190> beings<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.790> the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
again where most of the beings of the

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.400 
again where most of the beings of the
light<00:02:40.150> stay<00:02:41.110> away<00:02:41.380> from<00:02:42.000> humankind<00:02:43.410> because

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
light stay away from humankind because

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.320 
light stay away from humankind because
they<00:02:44.590> realize<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.550> interfere<00:02:46.120> with

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
they realize that to interfere with

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.590 
they realize that to interfere with
mankind<00:02:46.840> before<00:02:47.290> their<00:02:48.120> process<00:02:49.120> of<00:02:50.490> evolving

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
mankind before their process of evolving

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.250 
mankind before their process of evolving
spiritually<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.870> level<00:02:53.170> of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
spiritually to the level of

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.400 
spiritually to the level of
understanding<00:02:54.000> would<00:02:55.000> continue<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.690> lead<00:02:55.959> to

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
understanding would continue to lead to

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.290 
understanding would continue to lead to
an<00:02:58.020> improper<00:02:59.020> balance<00:02:59.680> or<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.070> break<00:03:01.000> in

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
an improper balance or a break in

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.390 
an improper balance or a break in
residence<00:03:02.110> or<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.350> fabric<00:03:03.010> or<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:05.400> proper

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
dissemination of light you see because

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.350 
dissemination of light you see because
many<00:03:08.260> times<00:03:08.620> people<00:03:09.190> with<00:03:09.490> noble<00:03:09.820> intentions

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
many times people with noble intentions

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.990 
many times people with noble intentions
try<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.660> do<00:03:10.930> something<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.890> was<00:03:12.220> not<00:03:12.520> based

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
try to do something that was not based

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.180 
try to do something that was not based
on<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.360> pattern<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:14.170> even<00:03:14.740> with<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:14.980> noble

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.790 
on the pattern and even with the noble
intentions<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.209> didn't<00:03:16.840> go<00:03:16.990> according<00:03:17.440> to

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
intentions it didn't go according to

divine decree and therefore ended up

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.890 
divine decree and therefore ended up
resulting<00:03:20.739> in<00:03:21.190> greater<00:03:21.400> chaos<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.540> we<00:03:22.660> see

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
resulting in greater chaos and we see

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.460 
resulting in greater chaos and we see
that<00:03:22.930> before<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.709> time<00:03:24.010> of<00:03:24.040> Noah<00:03:25.260> but<00:03:26.260> we

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.650 
that before the time of Noah but we
understand<00:03:27.250> some<00:03:27.519> interesting<00:03:28.060> concepts

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
understanding first with a concepts of

dark rift or a coming enlightenment then

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.880 
dark rift or a coming enlightenment then
we<00:04:44.770> see<00:04:45.010> that<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:46.300> idea<00:04:46.480> that<00:04:46.870> that<00:04:47.560> is

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
we see that the idea that that is

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.000 
we see that the idea that that is
related<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.550> flood<00:04:48.910> implies<00:04:49.450> that<00:04:50.010> first

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
related to the flood implies that first

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.700 
related to the flood implies that first
contacted<00:04:51.910> well<00:04:52.570> not<00:04:52.750> first<00:04:53.110> contact<00:04:53.590> but

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
contacted well not first contact but

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.480 
contacted well not first contact but
open<00:04:54.070> contact<00:04:54.670> once<00:04:55.300> again<00:04:55.690> should<00:04:55.990> happen

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
open contact once again should happen

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.140 
open contact once again should happen
before<00:04:57.490> those<00:04:57.790> changes<00:04:58.860> hmm<00:05:00.150> that's

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
before those changes hmm that's

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.360
