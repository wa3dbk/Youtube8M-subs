so I'm going to quickly talk about a

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.569 
so I'm going to quickly talk about a
hacking<00:03:13.019> stuff<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:13.620> what<00:03:13.980> points<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.430> get

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
hacking stuff and what points you get

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.089 
hacking stuff and what points you get
and<00:03:14.819> why<00:03:15.060> it's<00:03:15.299> really<00:03:15.599> good<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:15.989> instead<00:03:16.860> you

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
and why it's really good and instead you

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.920 
and why it's really good and instead you
should<00:03:17.129> use<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:17.489> instead<00:03:17.819> of<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.180> EMP<00:03:18.569> grenade

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
should use it instead of the EMP grenade

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.559 
should use it instead of the EMP grenade
so<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.560> yovie<00:03:19.920> gives<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.250> 75<00:03:20.730> points<00:03:20.970> the

but<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.400> main<00:04:20.639> reason<00:04:20.700> why<00:04:21.180> use<00:04:21.389> black<00:04:21.659> cats

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
but the main reason why use black cats

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.570 
but the main reason why use black cats
is<00:04:22.049> not<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.469> destroy<00:04:22.860> score<00:04:23.190> streets<00:04:23.490> the

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
is not to destroy score streets the

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.100 
is not to destroy score streets the
underscore<00:04:24.030> streets<00:04:24.300> are<00:04:24.450> really<00:04:24.780> relevant

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
underscore streets are really relevant

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.520 
underscore streets are really relevant
to<00:04:25.349> destroy<00:04:25.740> in

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
to destroy in

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.620 
to destroy in
you<00:04:26.920> such<00:04:27.340> Android<00:04:27.760> other<00:04:28.000> UAVs<00:04:28.420> in<00:04:28.570> the

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
you such Android other UAVs in the

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.390 
you such Android other UAVs in the
current<00:04:28.900> year<00:04:28.930> vs<00:04:29.350> because<00:04:29.830> they're<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.070> main

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
current year vs because they're the main

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.490 
current year vs because they're the main
ones<00:04:30.639> that<00:04:30.820> your<00:04:31.030> enemies<00:04:31.360> are<00:04:31.389> likely<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.110> get

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
ones that your enemies are likely to get

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.250 
ones that your enemies are likely to get
the<00:04:33.490> main<00:04:33.700> thing<00:04:33.940> I<00:04:34.060> usually<00:04:34.540> hacking<00:04:34.900> such<00:04:35.080> as

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
the main thing I usually hacking such as

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.740 
the main thing I usually hacking such as
Roy<00:04:35.470> is<00:04:35.740> equipment<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:36.820> you<00:04:36.970> get<00:04:37.150> 150<00:04:37.720> points

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
Roy is equipment and you get 150 points

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.930 
Roy is equipment and you get 150 points
for<00:04:38.169> hacking<00:04:38.500> each<00:04:38.680> equipment<00:04:39.280> which<00:04:39.790> is

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
for hacking each equipment which is

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.700 
for hacking each equipment which is
really<00:04:40.150> good<00:04:40.360> so<00:04:40.690> if<00:04:40.810> you<00:04:40.930> hack<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:41.350> equipment

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
really good so if you hack to equipment

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.970 
really good so if you hack to equipment
that<00:04:42.160> mean<00:04:42.340> that<00:04:42.370> that<00:04:43.060> is<00:04:43.770> that<00:04:44.770> is<00:04:44.889> an

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
that mean that that is that is an

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.190 
that mean that that is that is an
equivalent<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.639> kill<00:04:45.970> so<00:04:46.300> that's<00:04:46.630> really<00:04:46.900> good

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
equivalent to kill so that's really good

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.110 
equivalent to kill so that's really good
it<00:04:47.380> gets<00:04:47.590> you<00:04:47.710> closer<00:04:47.950> to<00:04:48.130> your<00:04:48.520> score<00:04:48.850> shrieks

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
it gets you closer to your score shrieks

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.360 
it gets you closer to your score shrieks
as<00:04:49.330> well<00:04:49.900> as<00:04:50.050> you<00:04:50.260> still<00:04:50.470> have<00:04:50.620> engineer<00:04:51.070> after

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
as well as you still have engineer after

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.400 
as well as you still have engineer after
you<00:04:51.520> hacked<00:04:51.880> it<00:04:52.180> with<00:04:52.419> black<00:04:52.660> cats<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.169> if<00:04:53.260> the

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
you hacked it with black cats and if the

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.200 
you hacked it with black cats and if the
enemy<00:04:53.740> teams<00:04:53.980> using<00:04:54.220> equipment<00:04:54.669> they're<00:04:55.030> more

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
enemy teams using equipment they're more

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.150 
enemy teams using equipment they're more
than<00:04:55.360> likely<00:04:55.540> to<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:55.900> B<00:04:56.110> isn't<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:56.770> more<00:04:56.980> than

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
than likely to the B isn't the more than

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.210 
than likely to the B isn't the more than
two<00:04:57.340> equipment<00:04:57.910> so<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:59.260> can<00:04:59.470> kill<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.950> you

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
two equipment so you can kill the you

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.010 
two equipment so you can kill the you
can<00:05:00.400> destroy<00:05:00.790> the<00:05:01.000> equipment<00:05:01.480> after<00:05:01.870> you've

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
can destroy the equipment after you've

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.140 
can destroy the equipment after you've
used<00:05:02.050> it<00:05:02.380> blackouts<00:05:02.830> with<00:05:03.040> your<00:05:03.220> gun<00:05:03.430> and<00:05:03.730> the

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
used it blackouts with your gun and the

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.970 
used it blackouts with your gun and the
main<00:05:04.360> reason<00:05:04.390> why<00:05:04.810> i<00:05:04.840> choose<00:05:05.290> black<00:05:05.590> outside

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
main reason why i choose black outside

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.159 
main reason why i choose black outside
of<00:05:06.070> EMP<00:05:06.490> grenades<00:05:06.880> is<00:05:07.060> a<00:05:07.120> reason<00:05:07.660> because<00:05:07.990> if

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
of EMP grenades is a reason because if

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.409 
of EMP grenades is a reason because if
you<00:05:08.620> hack<00:05:08.890> an<00:05:09.070> equipment<00:05:09.400> it<00:05:09.760> makes<00:05:10.030> it<00:05:10.240> your

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
you hack an equipment it makes it your

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.560 
you hack an equipment it makes it your
own<00:05:10.630> and<00:05:10.810> that<00:05:11.740> is<00:05:12.280> really<00:05:12.520> good<00:05:12.790> because<00:05:12.940> your

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
own and that is really good because your

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.810 
own and that is really good because your
enemy<00:05:13.870> my<00:05:14.050> trailer<00:05:14.350> might<00:05:15.010> not<00:05:15.040> realize<00:05:15.580> that

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
enemy my trailer might not realize that

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.130 
enemy my trailer might not realize that
you've<00:05:15.970> had<00:05:16.180> their<00:05:16.390> equipment<00:05:16.930> and<00:05:17.050> they

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
you've had their equipment and they

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.080 
you've had their equipment and they
might<00:05:17.410> think<00:05:18.010> that<00:05:18.100> their<00:05:18.400> equipments<00:05:18.940> got

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
might think that their equipments got

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.030 
might think that their equipments got
their<00:05:19.240> back<00:05:19.479> and<00:05:19.990> they<00:05:20.169> might<00:05:20.380> like<00:05:20.500> just<00:05:20.800> run

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
their back and they might like just run

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.190 
their back and they might like just run
into<00:05:21.280> their<00:05:21.580> equipment<00:05:22.210> and<00:05:22.360> just<00:05:22.690> die<00:05:22.900> to<00:05:22.960> it

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
into their equipment and just die to it

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.800 
into their equipment and just die to it
so<00:05:23.410> that's<00:05:23.590> a<00:05:23.740> really<00:05:23.770> good<00:05:24.250> thing<00:05:24.479> because<00:05:25.479> as

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
so that's a really good thing because as

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.420 
so that's a really good thing because as
well<00:05:26.050> as<00:05:26.169> getting<00:05:26.380> 50<00:05:26.680> points<00:05:26.950> from<00:05:27.040> hacking

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
well as getting 50 points from hacking

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.670 
well as getting 50 points from hacking
their<00:05:27.550> equipment<00:05:28.060> you<00:05:28.630> get<00:05:28.870> 100<00:05:29.290> points<00:05:29.470> from

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
their equipment you get 100 points from

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.740 
their equipment you get 100 points from
killing<00:05:30.040> them<00:05:30.190> so<00:05:30.370> you<00:05:30.430> get<00:05:30.610> 150<00:05:31.300> points<00:05:31.330> but

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
killing them so you get 150 points but

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.050 
killing them so you get 150 points but
just<00:05:32.050> by<00:05:32.229> hacking<00:05:32.740> and<00:05:32.860> equipment<00:05:33.400> you<00:05:33.850> don't

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
just by hacking and equipment you don't

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.280 
just by hacking and equipment you don't
even<00:05:34.180> have<00:05:34.360> to<00:05:34.450> go<00:05:34.630> through<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:34.930> trouble<00:05:35.110> of

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
even have to go through the trouble of

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.230 
even have to go through the trouble of
getting<00:05:35.440> into<00:05:35.650> a<00:05:35.770> gunfight<00:05:36.010> you<00:05:36.370> just<00:05:36.640> kill

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
getting into a gunfight you just kill

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.840 
getting into a gunfight you just kill
them<00:05:37.450> easily<00:05:37.750> it's<00:05:38.110> really<00:05:38.590> good<00:05:38.800> and<00:05:39.040> the

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
them easily it's really good and the

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.370 
them easily it's really good and the
main<00:05:40.090> reason<00:05:40.450> why<00:05:40.660> I<00:05:40.690> wanted<00:05:41.050> to<00:05:41.110> talk<00:05:41.350> about

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
main reason why I wanted to talk about

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.960 
main reason why I wanted to talk about
black<00:05:41.890> cats<00:05:42.039> in<00:05:42.220> this<00:05:42.340> commentary<00:05:42.669> was

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
because I know lot of people are not not

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.270 
because I know lot of people are not not
they<00:05:46.570> don't<00:05:46.840> know<00:05:46.960> what<00:05:47.320> black<00:05:47.710> cats<00:05:48.039> actually
