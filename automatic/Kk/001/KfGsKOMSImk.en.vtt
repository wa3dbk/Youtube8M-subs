we know and we've known for a hundred
years<00:00:05.160> now<00:00:05.609> that<00:00:06.540> all<00:00:06.750> cancers<00:00:07.500> are<00:00:07.919> due<00:00:08.250> to

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
years now that all cancers are due to

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.690 
years now that all cancers are due to
abnormalities<00:00:08.910> in<00:00:09.420> DNA<00:00:10.280> abnormalities<00:00:11.280> in

today<00:00:18.090> for<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.720> first<00:00:18.810> time<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.740> two

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:20.120 
today for the first time in two

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.060 
today for the first time in two
individual<00:00:21.120> cancers<00:00:21.690> and<00:00:22.140> melanoma<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:22.950> lung

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
individual cancers and melanoma and lung

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.240 
individual cancers and melanoma and lung
cancer<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:24.810> provided<00:00:25.200> the<00:00:25.710> complete

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
cancer we have provided the complete

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.350 
cancer we have provided the complete
list<00:00:26.610> of<00:00:27.410> abnormalities<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.950> DNA<00:00:29.370> in<00:00:29.670> each<00:00:30.150> of

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
list of abnormalities in DNA in each of

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.380 
list of abnormalities in DNA in each of
those<00:00:30.540> two<00:00:30.870> cancer's<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.400> one<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.210> there

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
those two cancer's so one can so there

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.170 
those two cancer's so one can so there
are<00:00:33.510> something<00:00:33.900> like<00:00:34.160> 30,000<00:00:35.180> mutations

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
are something like 30,000 mutations

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.070 
are something like 30,000 mutations
changes<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:36.930> DNA<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.830> the<00:00:37.920> other<00:00:38.040> about

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
changes in DNA and in the other about

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.690 
changes in DNA and in the other about
25,000<00:00:40.080> and<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.830> complete<00:00:41.220> list<00:00:41.400> so

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
25,000 and this is the complete list so

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.810 
25,000 and this is the complete list so
we<00:00:41.790> now<00:00:41.970> see<00:00:42.270> uncovered<00:00:42.960> all<00:00:43.830> the<00:00:44.010> forces<00:00:44.400> that

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
we now see uncovered all the forces that

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.410 
we now see uncovered all the forces that
have<00:00:45.720> generated<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.710> cancer<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:48.150> we<00:00:48.270> now

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
have generated that cancer and we now

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.720 
have generated that cancer and we now
see<00:00:48.720> all<00:00:48.900> the<00:00:49.050> genes<00:00:49.739> which<00:00:50.430> are<00:00:50.550> responsible

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
see all the genes which are responsible

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.049 
see all the genes which are responsible
for<00:00:51.510> driving<00:00:51.900> those<00:00:52.410> two<00:00:52.650> pencils<00:00:53.220> so<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:53.940> is

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
for driving those two pencils so this is

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.880 
for driving those two pencils so this is
an<00:00:54.180> important<00:00:54.660> moment<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.589> this<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.739> a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
an important moment so this is a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.030 
an important moment so this is a
fundamental<00:00:56.879> moment<00:00:57.330> in<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.809> cancer<00:00:58.500> research

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
fundamental moment in a cancer research

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.490 
fundamental moment in a cancer research
from<00:00:59.730> here<00:00:59.970> on<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.720> will<00:01:01.050> think<00:01:01.350> about

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
from here on in we will think about

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.399 
from here on in we will think about
cancers<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.790> very<00:01:03.030> different<00:01:03.390> way<00:01:03.839> we'll

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
cancers in a very different way we'll

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.649 
cancers in a very different way we'll
think<00:01:04.620> about<00:01:04.800> them<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.309> terms<00:01:05.550> of<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.210> numbers

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
think about them in terms of the numbers

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.320 
think about them in terms of the numbers
of<00:01:06.690> abnormalities<00:01:07.670> regimes<00:01:08.670> which<00:01:09.120> are

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
of abnormalities regimes which are

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.780 
of abnormalities regimes which are
abnormal<00:01:09.960> across<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.800> hall<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.340> human

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
abnormal across the hall of the human

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.000 
abnormal across the hall of the human
genome<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.450> individual<00:01:13.200> cancers<00:01:13.740> from

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
genome in individual cancers from

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.490 
genome in individual cancers from
individual<00:01:14.670> patients<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.360> what<00:01:16.170> does<00:01:16.380> this

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
individual patients and what does this

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.470 
individual patients and what does this
mean<00:01:16.770> ultimately<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.729> patients

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
mean ultimately for patients

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.070 
mean ultimately for patients
now<00:01:20.110> that<00:01:20.380> we<00:01:20.500> have<00:01:20.530> these<00:01:21.160> comprehensive

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
now that we have these comprehensive

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.080 
now that we have these comprehensive
complete<00:01:23.080> catalogues<00:01:23.860> of<00:01:24.190> mutations<00:01:24.880> and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
complete catalogues of mutations and

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.170 
complete catalogues of mutations and
individual<00:01:25.750> cancers<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.580> will<00:01:27.700> be<00:01:27.790> able<00:01:27.940> to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
individual cancers you will be able to

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.710 
individual cancers you will be able to
see<00:01:28.540> how<00:01:29.530> each<00:01:30.010> hand<00:01:30.460> so<00:01:30.730> developed<00:01:31.210> what<00:01:31.480> were

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
see how each hand so developed what were

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.800 
see how each hand so developed what were
the<00:01:32.050> exposures<00:01:32.680> that<00:01:32.950> were<00:01:33.640> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
the exposures that were the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.150 
the exposures that were the
environmental<00:01:34.810> factors<00:01:35.320> and<00:01:35.590> that's<00:01:35.830> going

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
environmental factors and that's going

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.550 
environmental factors and that's going
to<00:01:36.250> be<00:01:36.460> key<00:01:36.760> for<00:01:36.790> our<00:01:37.180> understanding

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
to be key for our understanding

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.970 
to be key for our understanding
generally<00:01:38.560> of<00:01:38.790> how<00:01:39.790> cancers<00:01:40.360> develop<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.770> for

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
generally of how cancers develop and for

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.240 
generally of how cancers develop and for
individual<00:01:42.640> patients<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:43.780> will<00:01:43.960> see<00:01:44.230> all<00:01:44.860> the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
individual patients we will see all the

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.430 
individual patients we will see all the
genes<00:01:45.520> that<00:01:45.760> are<00:01:45.970> abnormal<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.780> are<00:01:46.900> driving

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
genes that are abnormal and are driving

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.910 
genes that are abnormal and are driving
each<00:01:47.800> cancer<00:01:48.160> and<00:01:48.640> that's<00:01:49.060> really<00:01:49.330> critical

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
each cancer and that's really critical

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.700 
each cancer and that's really critical
because<00:01:50.920> that<00:01:51.370> will<00:01:51.610> tell<00:01:51.940> us<00:01:52.260> which<00:01:53.260> drugs

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
because that will tell us which drugs

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.090 
because that will tell us which drugs
are<00:01:54.610> likely<00:01:55.150> to<00:01:55.390> have<00:01:56.020> an<00:01:56.140> effect<00:01:56.500> on<00:01:56.650> that

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
are likely to have an effect on that

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.580 
are likely to have an effect on that
particular<00:01:57.580> cancer<00:01:58.150> or<00:01:58.630> which<00:01:58.840> drugs<00:01:59.140> are<00:01:59.410> not

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
particular cancer or which drugs are not

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.680 
particular cancer or which drugs are not
and<00:01:59.890> that<00:02:00.280> will<00:02:00.460> allow<00:02:00.670> us<00:02:00.730> to<00:02:00.880> make<00:02:01.120> much<00:02:01.420> more

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
and that will allow us to make much more

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.470 
and that will allow us to make much more
information<00:02:02.410> in<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.010> future<00:02:03.400> as<00:02:03.790> which<00:02:04.180> drugs

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
information in the future as which drugs

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.500 
information in the future as which drugs
to<00:02:04.660> treat<00:02:04.780> patients<00:02:05.200> with
