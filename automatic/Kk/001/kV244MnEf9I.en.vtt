00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
the most prepared the smartest the best

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.980 
the most prepared the smartest the best
quarterback<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:11.790> this<00:00:12.090> draft<00:00:12.150> yeah<00:00:12.780> his<00:00:12.960> only

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
quarterback in this draft yeah his only

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.680 
quarterback in this draft yeah his only
weakness<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.769> not<00:00:14.340> good<00:00:14.610> at<00:00:14.700> sliding<00:00:15.179> yeah<00:00:15.660> I

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
weakness is not good at sliding yeah I

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.970 
weakness is not good at sliding yeah I
think<00:00:15.900> that's<00:00:16.260> something<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.590> he's<00:00:16.770> working

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
think that's something that he's working

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.010 
think that's something that he's working
not<00:00:17.279> super<00:00:17.640> athletic<00:00:17.940> either<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.630> he<00:00:18.869> can

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
not super athletic either so he can

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.300 
not super athletic either so he can
extend<00:00:19.380> plays<00:00:19.619> but<00:00:19.859> when<00:00:19.949> something<00:00:20.130> breaks

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
extend plays but when something breaks

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.010 
extend plays but when something breaks
down<00:00:20.520> he's<00:00:21.000> not<00:00:21.180> somebody<00:00:21.449> that's<00:00:21.570> gonna<00:00:21.720> take

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
down he's not somebody that's gonna take

right<00:01:26.790> shoulder<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.330> think<00:01:27.810> that's<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
right shoulder I think that's that the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.450 
right shoulder I think that's that the
highest<00:01:28.619> point<00:01:28.829> he's<00:01:28.950> actually<00:01:29.130> more

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
highest point he's actually more

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.130 
highest point he's actually more
athletic<00:01:29.970> than<00:01:30.000> he<00:01:30.270> appears<00:01:30.360> he<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.900> sort<00:01:31.049> of

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
athletic than he appears he can sort of

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.200 
athletic than he appears he can sort of
scramble<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.619> throw<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.950> run<00:01:31.979> not<00:01:32.939> great

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
scramble and throw on the run not great

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.789 
scramble and throw on the run not great
under<00:01:33.450> pressure<00:01:33.479> not<00:01:34.229> great<00:01:34.470> at<00:01:34.590> sort<00:01:34.770> of

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
under pressure not great at sort of

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.770 
under pressure not great at sort of
picking<00:01:35.250> up<00:01:35.400> blitzes<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.090> different<00:01:36.450> sort<00:01:36.689> of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
picking up blitzes and different sort of

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.330 
picking up blitzes and different sort of
disguise<00:01:37.140> defenses<00:01:37.829> I'm<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.070> little<00:01:38.250> bit

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
disguise defenses I'm a little bit

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.219 
disguise defenses I'm a little bit
concerned<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.729> despite<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.689> big<00:01:39.960> arm<00:01:40.140> of

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
concerned that despite that big arm of

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.960 
concerned that despite that big arm of
his<00:01:40.350> he<00:01:40.560> threw<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.009> many<00:01:41.130> short<00:01:41.490> passes<00:01:41.850> and

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
his he threw so many short passes and

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.249 
his he threw so many short passes and
screens<00:01:42.210> oppressive<00:01:42.630> state<00:01:42.750> yeah<00:01:43.079> it

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
screens oppressive state yeah it

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.020 
screens oppressive state yeah it
inflates<00:01:43.619> his<00:01:43.710> completion<00:01:44.250> percentage<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:44.880> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
inflates his completion percentage but I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.030 
inflates his completion percentage but I
think<00:01:45.270> with<00:01:45.450> his<00:01:45.630> arm<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.350> right<00:01:46.530> system

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
think with his arm in the right system

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.649 
think with his arm in the right system
with<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> rent<00:01:47.490> quarterback<00:01:47.880> coach<00:01:48.119> because

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
with the rent quarterback coach because

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.149 
with the rent quarterback coach because
it<00:01:48.840> releases<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.500> quickly<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.829> think<00:01:49.920> he'll

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
it releases it so quickly I think he'll

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.770 
it releases it so quickly I think he'll
be<00:01:50.250> great<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.759> ball<00:01:50.909> downfield<00:01:51.090> okay

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
be great for on the ball downfield okay

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.969 
be great for on the ball downfield okay
number<00:01:51.960> five<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.560> where<00:01:52.770> things<00:01:52.890> start

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
number five this is where things start

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.560 
number five this is where things start
to<00:01:53.130> get<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.280> bit<00:01:53.340> money<00:01:53.610> who's<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.090> fifth<00:01:54.299> best

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
to get a bit money who's the fifth best

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.209 
to get a bit money who's the fifth best
quarterback<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.110> does<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.590> gets<00:01:55.799> money<00:01:56.070> around

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
quarterback it does it gets money around

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.649 
quarterback it does it gets money around
here<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.430> think<00:01:56.520> AJ<00:01:56.909> McCarron<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> guy<00:01:57.600> for

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
here I think AJ McCarron is the guy for

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.600 
here I think AJ McCarron is the guy for
me<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.200> because<00:01:58.229> he<00:01:58.560> played<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.070> well<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.280> so

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
me just because he played so well in so

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.190 
me just because he played so well in so
many<00:01:59.729> big<00:01:59.969> games<00:02:00.000> against<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.600> many<00:02:00.630> really

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
many big games against so many really

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.530 
many big games against so many really
really<00:02:01.500> good<00:02:01.680> defenses<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.399> SEC<00:02:02.909> has<00:02:03.090> a

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
really good defenses in the SEC has a

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.450 
really good defenses in the SEC has a
good<00:02:03.930> arm<00:02:04.110> not<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.409> great<00:02:04.770> arm<00:02:04.979> has<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> lot<00:02:05.369> to

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
good arm not a great arm has a lot to

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.740 
good arm not a great arm has a lot to
prove<00:02:05.579> at<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.790> combine<00:02:06.149> makes<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.540> ton<00:02:06.719> of

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
prove at the combine makes a ton of

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.150 
prove at the combine makes a ton of
really<00:02:07.020> good<00:02:07.200> throws<00:02:07.530> especially<00:02:07.979> outside

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
really good throws especially outside

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.130 
really good throws especially outside
the<00:02:08.520> numbers<00:02:08.849> not<00:02:09.209> crazy<00:02:09.479> about<00:02:09.660> his<00:02:09.840> ability

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
the numbers not crazy about his ability

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.540 
the numbers not crazy about his ability
to<00:02:10.200> recognize<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.860> offenses<00:02:11.250> pick<00:02:11.430> up

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
to recognize the offenses pick up

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.860 
to recognize the offenses pick up
blitzes<00:02:11.670> sort<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.180> getting<00:02:12.360> antsy<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
blitzes sort of getting antsy in the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.800 
blitzes sort of getting antsy in the
pocket<00:02:13.230> but

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
pocket but

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.330 
pocket but

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
better than he gets credit for being

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.130 
better than he gets credit for being
more<00:02:18.700> than<00:02:18.849> a<00:02:18.910> game<00:02:19.030> manager<00:02:19.270> yeah<00:02:19.540> yeah<00:02:19.780> those
