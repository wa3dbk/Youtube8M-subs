00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
their favorite so this is what we

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.270 
their favorite so this is what we

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
actually asked the computer base how

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.360 
actually asked the computer base how

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
or more do against a team that is coming

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.690 
or more do against a team that is coming
off<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.790> thirty<00:03:24.150> point<00:03:24.540> or<00:03:24.810> more<00:03:25.049> loss<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:26.220> as

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
off a thirty point or more loss and as

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.240 
off a thirty point or more loss and as
we<00:03:26.910> expected<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.630> slight<00:03:28.200> advantage<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:29.160> the

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
we expected a slight advantage to the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.770 
we expected a slight advantage to the
team<00:03:29.459> that's<00:03:29.579> actually<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.180> big<00:03:30.329> underdog

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
team that's actually the big underdog

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.599 
team that's actually the big underdog
playing<00:03:31.139> poorly<00:03:31.440> but<00:03:31.620> not<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.829> huge<00:03:32.160> advantage

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
playing poorly but not a huge advantage

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.930 
playing poorly but not a huge advantage
so<00:03:33.319> this<00:03:34.319> would<00:03:34.500> say<00:03:34.680> Atlanta<00:03:35.400> betting<00:03:35.669> one

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
so this would say Atlanta betting one

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.539 
so this would say Atlanta betting one
Atlanta<00:03:36.419> since<00:03:36.959> 1989<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:38.069> teams<00:03:38.310> under

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
Atlanta since 1989 in teams under

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.460 
Atlanta since 1989 in teams under
similar<00:03:38.849> circumstances<00:03:38.940> would<00:03:39.780> only<00:03:39.930> be<00:03:40.200> six

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
similar circumstances would only be six

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.339 
similar circumstances would only be six
and<00:03:40.709> nine<00:03:40.950> not<00:03:41.639> a<00:03:41.669> statistically<00:03:42.480> significant

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
and nine not a statistically significant

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.589 
and nine not a statistically significant
angle<00:03:43.560> but<00:03:43.769> this<00:03:43.980> just<00:03:44.250> shows<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:45.000> really

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
angle but this just shows you a really
