00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.610
 ok 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.890
 well back sen we were waiting for and 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.900
 in all honesty we were a bit 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.820
 tired of that kind action you had 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.070
 developed in the last two or three games 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.869
 because splinter cell is one of those 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.029
 series that has undergone over the years 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.740
 the inexorable process of randomness 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.600
 which brought some of the most 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.129
 large franchises to turn into 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.440
 games certainly more open to the public 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.489
 of mass but at the same time less faithful to the 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.590
 original concept 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.050
 yet the splinter cell developer 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.640
 back list is the soft montreal lo 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.590
 same as that conviction that it was 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.809
 often accused of excessive tendency 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.159
 to the action but unlike many 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.320
 other development studies 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.390
 ubisoft montreal has known in part 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.800
 listen to your audience by creating a 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.659
 product that maintains the right distances 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.430
 from the extremism of a niche game 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.729
 and from the big world of mass games 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.470
 I hide something without many 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.540
 surprises in black list of the threat 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.760
 terrorist is the fulcrum of the story 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.470
 a very organized group that is done 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.880
 call the engineers gave a 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.290
 ultimatum to america 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.420
 the united states must withdraw the 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.460
 own troops abroad or will suffer a 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.170
 attack every seven days to respond 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.939
 to the threat the president of the states 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.100
 united dismantles the secret organization 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.409
 after he ceron creating a new group 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.899
 anti terrorist called strong is celon 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.070
 led by the old sam is 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.380
 of the first novelty of this new one 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.600
 chapter of the saga as sam fisher 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.700
 he finds himself playing for the first time 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.409
 the role of the chief the first sequences of 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.299
 splinter cell black list set 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.130
 on the island of guam they give us right away 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.020
 an idea of ​​how this game is 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.299
 moved in the right direction is the 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.250
 right direction is a very dark road 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.990
 as the real mark of darkness 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.070
 series factory is finally 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.570
 returned 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.700
 the developers set the light 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.990
 of the game on naturally dark tones that 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.000
 make some moments in the shadows 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.710
 really exciting after a couple 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.880
 resignation in the light of the sun 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.710
 during the third mission 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.390
 we find one of the most mechanics 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.249
 love the game that requires us to 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.200
 move softly through the shadows 

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:06.999
 and to create darkness where it is not 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.800
 naturally present for example 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:11.319
 shooting at the bulbs and creating gods 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.060
 exciting diversions this game is not 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.740
 totally a return to the origins in 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.540
 as it introduces some elements of 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.360
 adaptability to different palates of 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.860
 players 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.720
 specifically the developers have 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.850
 introduced three possible methodologies of 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.520
 game that respond to the ghost name 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.930
 panther and assault the phantom style is 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.730
 what the historical fans of the series 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.380
 they have been clamoring for a long time 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.510
 and that requires you to bypass enemies 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.830
 rather than tackling style 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.020
 panther instead embodies that 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.910
 of the silent killer the enemies in 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.620
 this case are addressed but yes 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.030
 puts an end to their existence first 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.610
 still that they realize they are 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.320
 been attached to support this style 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.060
 the controversial tag returns 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.440
 yankiel and that will turn up their noses at 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.840
 purists but that was strongly 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.340
 limited, finally, possible to approach 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.110
 to the game with an assault style that 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.150
 however it does not greatly facilitate the 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.830
 task if the enemies are discovered 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.030
 they increase and with a couple of strokes it is 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.950
 easy to finish on the ground 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.930
 the game does not ask us to choose the 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.300
 the way we want to play is us at 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.070
 decide how to deal with each situation 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.989
 at the end of the level the summary is summarized 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.720
 score divided into three components 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.459
 panther ghost and assault in this 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.480
 so you can understand your own style 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.100
 of play 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.660
 one of the most surprising aspects of 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.910
 splinter cell black list is given by 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.140
 artificial intelligence assisted by 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.299
 some opportune choice of 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.709
 programming when not only enemies 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.720
 their intelligence is on alert 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.549
 strongly limited are limited to 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.290
 follow patterns and presets and it is 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.700
 easy to fool them the real surprise 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.959
 comes the moment the enemies 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.850
 they are put on alert 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.560
 not only tend to converge on the 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.810
 our position but they do too 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.970
 using secondary paths trying 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.690
 to surround ourselves and sometimes dividing into 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.580
 small groups 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.769
 the programmers also had 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.269
 a really brilliant idea if you are that 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.950
 kind of player who has bad approach 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.690
 stealth you will often find yourself at 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.030
 reload a game section after a 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.130
 error in black list the eirini pattern 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.750
 it is reset to us by the third party 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.190
 This attempt gone bad 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.989
 very simple idea makes the game 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.959
 more unpredictable than expected 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.280
 and of course very satisfying to 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.390
 end of each mission our seem 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.980
 gives up a politician 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.959
 the money obtained can be spent 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.150
 to improve the base or customize 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.890
 sam's auto pitt with more clothes weapons 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.019
 oriented to action or stealth 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.700
 good is also the equipment of the gadgets that 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.340
 includes various types of viewers and a bag 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.840
 of objects the 007 including a drone 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.700
 radio-controlled and fabulous 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.400
 Sticky cameras that can 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.080
 stun 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.970
 pc or self destroying itself causing death 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.410
 hostiles within a few meters 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.360
 to this are added numerous 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.280
 smoke diversions, smoke grenades 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.930
 clogging tear gas and explosives of 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.340
 various nature 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.340
 I can't fucking believe it 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.060
 splinter cell black list also enjoys 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.070
 a cooperative mode indeed 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.660
 fun despite the missions 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.850
 exclusively cooperatives are 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.860
 relatively few promiscuous ones for 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.630
 single coop are played with approaches 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.979
 completely different in the company of 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.780
 a friend and allow you to activate 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.490
 alternative routes otherwise 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.229
 inaccessible which often vary in 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.639
 almost totally the way in which there is 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.080
 he orientates himself in the map 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.000
 overall the game missions yes 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.500
 they approach the thirty but the twelve 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.389
 single player missions can be 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.949
 finish in about ten hours 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.660
 a step forward compared to very short 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.610
 conviction but certainly nothing 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.260
 striking is therefore obvious that for 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.030
 extend the duration of the package is 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.889
 advisable to address also the 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.810
 secondary missions that could almost 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.940
 triple the duration of the game though 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.710
 give the best of themselves in company 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.259
 the multiplayer ie mode 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.419
 spies versus mercks is finally back 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.280
 the game takes back the beloved mode 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.780
 online chaos theory with results 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.760
 really excellent in terms of 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.560
 player involvement without 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.300
 too many splinter cell black list surprises 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.490
 is the most graphically advanced game 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.169
 of the series in all honesty there are not 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.490
 giant steps forward compared to 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.500
 conviction from the point of view of 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.389
 models but the variegated conformation 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.949
 of the environments is certainly a place 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.440
 step higher than in the past 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.479
 the various locations are unique and well 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.639
 characterized accompanied by texture 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.409
 colorful and well defined by the point of 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.330
 view of the sound game states the expected 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.729
 return of luca ward to the voice of sam 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.470
 fisher the nostalgic will certainly love 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.150
 to hear the ductile voice of world 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.099
 interpret the cold protagonist 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.229
 almost all the good saga 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.120
 secondary characters while the characters 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:11.480
 minors often offer performances at 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.270
 limit of ridicule 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.160
 the last sons of bitches pushed on 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.080
 black list is a continuous crescendo 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.180
 when we believed the game would be 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.710
 was yet another turning point action i 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.630
 developers have surprised us with a 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.130
 title that winks at the past and 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.870
 which offers some glimpses of the game 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.860
 interpretable with an approach of others 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.180
 times 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.770
 the main campaign could 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.900
 turn out to be short and face each other 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.700
 but if your style of play embodies 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.530
 that of the first splinter cell will know 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.490
 give you great satisfaction even in 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.560
 terms of duration 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.540
 the beauty of black list is that it doesn't tell you 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.920
 how to play leaves you the chance to 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.870
 do it as you see fit 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.910
 new fans will find good reasons to 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.920
 buy this game and fortunately 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.870
 even old fans this year could 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.490
 enjoy a game of the saga that you don't 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.030
 you seem totally uprooted from his 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.680
 context 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.540
 if to this we add a full-bodied 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.520
 multiplayer is a co op mode 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.380
 really deserves to be played there 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.920
 overall quality of the package rises to 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:06.830
 excess 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:08.950
 sam is back with us and maybe I'll leave you 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.950
 to live
