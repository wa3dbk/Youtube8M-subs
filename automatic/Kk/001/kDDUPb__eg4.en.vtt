00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
several projects with them well the site

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.429 
several projects with them well the site
had<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> very<00:01:20.429> very<00:01:20.759> large<00:01:21.090> area<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:21.990> planting

we<00:01:22.920> put<00:01:23.130> together<00:01:23.219> a<00:01:24.030> plant<00:01:24.630> pallet<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.049> I

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
we put together a plant pallet that I

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.109 
we put together a plant pallet that I
think<00:01:25.469> is<00:01:25.590> going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.859> be<00:01:25.979> really<00:01:26.460> interesting

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
think is going to be really interesting

that sort of thing two years ago we
started<00:01:39.840> tooling<00:01:40.499> around<00:01:41.009> with<00:01:41.969> the<00:01:42.689> idea<00:01:42.719> of

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
started tooling around with the idea of

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.309 
started tooling around with the idea of
of<00:01:43.969> changing<00:01:44.969> the<00:01:45.209> diesel<00:01:45.749> and<00:01:45.869> adding<00:01:46.229> a
