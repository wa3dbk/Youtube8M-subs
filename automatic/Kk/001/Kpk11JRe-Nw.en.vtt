00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
in its early days that people were

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.730 
in its early days that people were
really<00:00:17.070> struggling<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:18.090> get<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.420> hang<00:00:18.630> of

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
really struggling to get the hang of

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.450 
really struggling to get the hang of
DJing<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.970> digital<00:00:20.970> DJ<00:00:21.119> controllers<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.460> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
DJing on digital DJ controllers and the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.340 
DJing on digital DJ controllers and the
reason<00:00:23.880> was<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.150> little<00:00:24.449> bit<00:00:24.570> strange<00:00:24.960> as<00:00:25.230> it

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
reason was a little bit strange as it

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.589 
reason was a little bit strange as it
turned<00:00:25.560> out<00:00:25.740> because<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.970> turned<00:00:27.240> out<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.390> if

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
turned out because it turned out that if

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.000 
turned out because it turned out that if
you<00:00:27.720> would<00:00:27.810> learn<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.019> DJ<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.590> something<00:00:28.890> like

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
you would learn to DJ on something like

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.910 
you would learn to DJ on something like
this<00:00:29.070> as<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.789> did<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.359> pair<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.689> record<00:00:30.990> X<00:00:31.199> but

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
this as I did on a pair of record X but

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.459 
this as I did on a pair of record X but
switching<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> DJ<00:00:33.210> controller<00:00:33.600> wasn't

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
switching to a DJ controller wasn't

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.680 
switching to a DJ controller wasn't
actually<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.040> difficult<00:00:35.219> yeah<00:00:36.180> sure<00:00:36.450> there

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
actually that difficult yeah sure there

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.670 
actually that difficult yeah sure there
were<00:00:36.780> different<00:00:37.079> things<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.350> had<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.500> learn

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
were different things you had to learn

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.350 
were different things you had to learn
about<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> music<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.520> collecting<00:00:38.940> tunes

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
about the music and collecting tunes

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.700 
about the music and collecting tunes
when<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.660> didn't<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:39.989> record<00:00:40.290> shops<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.590> go

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
when you didn't have record shops to go

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.650 
when you didn't have record shops to go
to<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.280> but<00:00:41.790> actually<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> skills

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
to and so on but actually the skills

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.619 
to and so on but actually the skills
were<00:00:42.899> quite<00:00:43.170> easy<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.530> transfer<00:00:44.329> but<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.450> you

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
were quite easy to transfer but if you

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.180 
were quite easy to transfer but if you
were<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:45.960> starting<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.739> one<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.039> these

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
were just starting on one of these

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.430 
were just starting on one of these
things<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:48.239> kind<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.809> became<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.140> bit<00:00:49.320> more

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
things it kind of became a bit more

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.189 
things it kind of became a bit more
difficult<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.550> didn't<00:00:50.820> really<00:00:51.000> know<00:00:51.329> what

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
difficult you didn't really know what

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.389

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
instruction manuals that came with these

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.029 
instruction manuals that came with these
were<00:00:54.870> kind<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.559> what<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.860> does

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
and this is what that does but there was

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.689 
and this is what that does but there was
no<00:00:57.510> why<00:00:58.170> there<00:00:58.620> was<00:00:58.710> no<00:00:58.739> why<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.160> do<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.489> that
