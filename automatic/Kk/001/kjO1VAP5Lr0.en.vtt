00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:46.709 

I've<00:00:45.249> got<00:00:45.460> some<00:00:45.640> blank<00:00:45.879> sheets<00:00:46.120> of<00:00:46.300> film<00:00:46.449> here

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
I've got some blank sheets of film here

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.529 
I've got some blank sheets of film here
to<00:00:46.839> show<00:00:47.050> you<00:00:47.429> how<00:00:48.429> we<00:00:48.489> can<00:00:48.699> load<00:00:48.879> it<00:00:51.539> emulsion

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
to show you how we can load it emulsion

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.259 
to show you how we can load it emulsion
side<00:00:52.749> in<00:00:52.989> so<00:00:53.729> take<00:00:54.729> it<00:00:54.879> out<00:00:54.969> of<00:00:54.999> the<00:00:55.089> film

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
holder of notching the upper hand right

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.950 
holder of notching the upper hand right
and<00:00:58.659> squeeze<00:00:59.019> it<00:00:59.229> and<00:00:59.379> put<00:01:00.100> it<00:01:00.190> in<00:01:00.280> one<00:01:00.399> side

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.499 

and<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.110> other<00:01:06.539> turn<00:01:07.539> it<00:01:07.630> around<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:10.240> can<00:01:10.420> do

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
and the other turn it around we can do

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:28.930 
and the other turn it around we can do
the<00:01:10.630> same<00:01:10.810> again<00:01:13.829> and<00:01:14.829> so<00:01:14.979> hold<00:01:15.159> six<00:01:15.430> sheets

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.250 

much<00:01:29.940> like<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.270> combi<00:01:30.570> plane<00:01:30.780> tank<00:01:31.050> it's

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
much like the combi plane tank it's

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.280 
much like the combi plane tank it's
probably<00:01:31.620> good<00:01:32.370> in<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> dark<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.120> feel<00:01:33.360> make

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
probably good in the dark to feel make

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.400 
probably good in the dark to feel make
sure<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> film<00:01:34.830> was<00:01:35.010> not<00:01:35.870> touching<00:01:36.870> when

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
sure the film was not touching when

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.610 
sure the film was not touching when
you've<00:01:37.530> got<00:01:37.740> them<00:01:37.890> stacked<00:01:39.260> there's<00:01:40.260> things

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
you've got them stacked there's things

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.980 
you've got them stacked there's things
that<00:01:40.740> stagger<00:01:41.160> the<00:01:41.430> film<00:01:41.670> apart<00:01:42.330> from<00:01:42.810> each

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
that stagger the film apart from each

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.070 
that stagger the film apart from each
other<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:44.430> then<00:01:45.360> when<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.630> put<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
other and then when you put it in the

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.490 
other and then when you put it in the
tank

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
tank

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.950 
tank
the<00:01:46.740> Patterson<00:01:47.729> spindle<00:01:48.300> will<00:01:48.420> go<00:01:48.600> up<00:01:48.720> through

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the Patterson spindle will go up through

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.800 
the Patterson spindle will go up through
there<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.400> can<00:01:50.670> assemble<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.120> tank<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
there and you can assemble the tank and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.249 
there and you can assemble the tank and
turn<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.650> lights<00:01:52.800> on<00:01:53.660> this<00:01:54.660> will<00:01:54.869> use<00:01:54.990> about

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
turn the lights on this will use about

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.990 
turn the lights on this will use about
as<00:01:55.410> much<00:01:55.560> space<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.160> chemical<00:01:56.580> in<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.759> tank

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
as much space and chemical in the tank

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.630 
as much space and chemical in the tank
is<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.360> 120<00:01:57.869> rolls<00:02:00.710> if<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.979> developing<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.580> the
