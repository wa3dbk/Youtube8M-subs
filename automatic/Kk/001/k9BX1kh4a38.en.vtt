00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
efficient for me to go peeking but just

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.400 
efficient for me to go peeking but just
like<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.520> said<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:29.790> would<00:03:30.120> need<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.390> camp<00:03:30.660> some

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
like I said I would need to camp some

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.979 
like I said I would need to camp some
green<00:03:31.620> dragons<00:03:32.070> for<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.580> Monica's<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.300> don't

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
green dragons for the Monica's I don't

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.810 
green dragons for the Monica's I don't
have<00:03:34.140> dialogue<00:03:34.620> but<00:03:34.950> Derick<00:03:35.430> actually

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
have dialogue but Derick actually

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.479 
have dialogue but Derick actually
crashed<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.900> around<00:03:37.140> 2.3<00:03:37.830> million<00:03:38.040> because<00:03:38.400> I

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
crashed to around 2.3 million because I

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.820 
crashed to around 2.3 million because I
sold<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:38.970> for<00:03:39.000> this<00:03:39.360> much<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:40.380> bought<00:03:40.650> it

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
sold it for this much and I bought it

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.060 
sold it for this much and I bought it
for<00:03:41.100> two<00:03:41.340> point<00:03:41.580> eight<00:03:41.820> so<00:03:42.810> two<00:03:43.739> point<00:03:43.950> three

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
for two point eight so two point three

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.710 
for two point eight so two point three
million<00:03:44.340> for<00:03:44.670> dialogue<00:03:45.060> that's<00:03:45.300> not<00:03:45.510> too<00:03:45.690> much

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
million for dialogue that's not too much

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.050 
million for dialogue that's not too much
that's<00:03:46.350> like<00:03:46.590> one<00:03:47.100> day<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.400> Green<00:03:47.640> Dragons

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
that's like one day of Green Dragons

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.449 
that's like one day of Green Dragons
maybe<00:03:48.360> even<00:03:48.660> less<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.739> could<00:03:50.010> get<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.310> by

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
maybe even less so I could get it by

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.479 
maybe even less so I could get it by
tomorrow<00:03:50.520> maybe<00:03:51.120> we'll<00:03:51.780> see<00:03:51.989> about<00:03:52.050> that<00:03:52.489> and

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
tomorrow maybe we'll see about that and

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.250 
tomorrow maybe we'll see about that and
maybe<00:03:53.670> I'll<00:03:53.910> make<00:03:53.940> some<00:03:54.150> peeking<00:03:54.720> videos<00:03:55.050> so<00:03:55.230> I

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
maybe I'll make some peeking videos so I

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.650 
maybe I'll make some peeking videos so I
can't<00:03:55.500> wait<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.739> pk<00:03:56.220> really<00:03:56.640> just<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.540> know

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
can't wait to pk really just you know

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.540 
can't wait to pk really just you know
questing<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.380> getting<00:03:58.680> my<00:03:58.800> stats<00:03:59.070> up<00:03:59.310> got

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
questing and getting my stats up got

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.449 
questing and getting my stats up got
kind<00:03:59.820> of<00:03:59.940> boring<00:04:00.209> right<00:04:00.330> now<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:01.080> I<00:04:01.680> actually

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
kind of boring right now and I actually

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.790 
kind of boring right now and I actually
looked<00:04:02.940> up<00:04:03.060> how<00:04:03.270> many<00:04:03.330> Alex<00:04:03.930> I<00:04:04.080> need<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.350> get<00:04:04.500> to

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
looked up how many Alex I need to get to

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.550 
looked up how many Alex I need to get to
level<00:04:04.830> 94<00:04:05.760> magic<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.900> was<00:04:08.000> 100,000<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:09.930> I

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
level 94 magic and it was 100,000 so I

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.710 
level 94 magic and it was 100,000 so I
pretty<00:04:11.430> much<00:04:11.519> can<00:04:11.850> tell<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.450> will

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
pretty much can tell you that I will

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.750 
pretty much can tell you that I will
never<00:04:12.930> going<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.380> be<00:04:13.530> getting<00:04:13.739> 94<00:04:14.340> magic

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
never going to be getting 94 magic

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.300 
never going to be getting 94 magic
unless<00:04:15.000> it's<00:04:15.390> gonna<00:04:15.540> happen<00:04:16.049> naturally<00:04:16.560> you

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
unless it's gonna happen naturally you

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.300 
unless it's gonna happen naturally you
know<00:04:17.459> like<00:04:18.200> I'm<00:04:19.200> not<00:04:19.290> gonna<00:04:19.620> try<00:04:19.890> to<00:04:19.919> get<00:04:20.160> my

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
know like I'm not gonna try to get my

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.159 
know like I'm not gonna try to get my
magic<00:04:20.489> level<00:04:20.940> up<00:04:21.060> but<00:04:21.299> I<00:04:21.330> will<00:04:21.660> get<00:04:21.900> it<00:04:22.020> up

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
magic level up but I will get it up

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.740 
magic level up but I will get it up
eventually<00:04:22.350> by<00:04:23.039> killing<00:04:23.430> bosses<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:24.210> you

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
eventually by killing bosses and you

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.060 
eventually by killing bosses and you
know<00:04:24.870> doing<00:04:25.140> things<00:04:25.860> that<00:04:26.130> require<00:04:26.280> magic

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
know doing things that require magic

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.250 
know doing things that require magic
that<00:04:27.250> may<00:04:27.520> happen<00:04:27.760> but<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.420> don't<00:04:28.900> think<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.200> will

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
that may happen but I don't think I will

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.400 
that may happen but I don't think I will
be<00:04:29.530> getting<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:30.270> intentionally<00:04:31.270> it<00:04:31.960> just<00:04:32.260> way

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
be getting it intentionally it just way

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.380 
be getting it intentionally it just way
too<00:04:32.470> much<00:04:32.770> 100k<00:04:33.760> Alex

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
too much 100k Alex

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.900 
too much 100k Alex
 that<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.590> all<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.430> other<00:04:36.610> methods

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
 that and all the other methods

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.790 
 that and all the other methods
are<00:04:37.240> quite<00:04:37.480> expensive<00:04:37.840> at<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.170> moment<00:04:38.290> so

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
are quite expensive at the moment so

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.600 
are quite expensive at the moment so
yeah<00:04:39.700> no<00:04:40.210> 94<00:04:40.810> magic<00:04:41.170> for<00:04:41.380> me<00:04:41.530> at<00:04:41.830> least<00:04:42.100> for<00:04:42.580> now

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
yeah no 94 magic for me at least for now

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.760 
yeah no 94 magic for me at least for now
and<00:04:43.300> I<00:04:43.480> think<00:04:43.720> that's<00:04:43.870> about<00:04:44.110> it<00:04:44.350> for<00:04:44.560> this

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
and I think that's about it for this

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.770 
and I think that's about it for this
video<00:04:45.100> I<00:04:45.160> said<00:04:45.640> everything<00:04:46.150> that<00:04:46.180> I<00:04:46.390> wanted<00:04:46.720> to

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
video I said everything that I wanted to

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.140 
video I said everything that I wanted to
say<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:47.320> I<00:04:47.410> guess<00:04:48.190> I<00:04:48.310> will<00:04:48.460> see<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.760> tomorrow

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
say and I guess I will see you tomorrow

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.590 
say and I guess I will see you tomorrow
or<00:04:49.450> maybe<00:04:49.600> in<00:04:49.810> two<00:04:49.960> days<00:04:50.170> with<00:04:50.620> a<00:04:50.650> PK<00:04:51.370> video

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
or maybe in two days with a PK video

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.900 
or maybe in two days with a PK video
maybe<00:04:52.600> I'm<00:04:53.050> not<00:04:53.440> sure<00:04:53.590> about<00:04:53.740> that<00:04:54.070> depends

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
maybe I'm not sure about that depends

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.290 
maybe I'm not sure about that depends
you<00:04:55.210> know<00:04:55.240> on<00:04:55.510> many<00:04:55.720> circumstances<00:04:56.580> so<00:04:57.580> yeah<00:04:58.120> I

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
you know on many circumstances so yeah I

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.740 
you know on many circumstances so yeah I
guess<00:04:58.540> I<00:04:58.660> will<00:04:58.780> see<00:04:58.990> you<00:04:59.110> later
