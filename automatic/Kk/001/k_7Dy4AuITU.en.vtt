in their blood they don't realize that
we<00:00:47.430> make<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> lesser<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.570> our<00:00:48.719> bodies<00:00:49.170> also<00:00:50.160> I

we make a lesser in our bodies also I
have<00:00:50.700> been<00:00:50.850> very<00:00:50.879> much<00:00:51.480> interested<00:00:51.840> in

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
have been very much interested in

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
have been very much interested in
dietary<00:00:52.920> cholesterol<00:00:53.629> mainly<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.840> eggs<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.559> hid

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
dietary cholesterol mainly in eggs I hid

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.310 
dietary cholesterol mainly in eggs I hid
inside<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.820> eggs<00:00:57.030> because<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.600> consider<00:00:58.050> them

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
inside the eggs because I consider them

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.459 
inside the eggs because I consider them
as<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.649> functional<00:00:59.340> food<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.109> my<00:01:01.109> study

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
as a functional food and my study

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.979 
as a functional food and my study
suggests<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.219> not<00:01:02.609> only<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.480> dietary

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
suggests that not only the dietary

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.500 
suggests that not only the dietary
cholesterol<00:01:04.250> has<00:01:05.250> no<00:01:05.549> effect<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.150> increasing

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
cholesterol has no effect in increasing

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.990 
cholesterol has no effect in increasing
the<00:01:06.659> risk<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:07.080> heart<00:01:07.260> disease<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:08.340> X<00:01:08.549> contain

when<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.549> eat<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.030> your<00:01:21.180> diet<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:22.080> pickup

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
when you eat it in your diet is a pickup

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.460 
when you eat it in your diet is a pickup
by<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.070> eye<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:24.420> increases<00:01:24.869> your<00:01:25.080> muddler

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
by the eye and it increases your muddler

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.310 
by the eye and it increases your muddler
pigment<00:01:26.159> density<00:01:26.759> why<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.659> important

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
pigment density why is this important

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.640 
pigment density why is this important
because<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.220> looting<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.880> your<00:01:30.090> eye<00:01:30.650> absorbs

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
because the looting in your eye absorbs

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.010 
because the looting in your eye absorbs
the<00:01:31.829> blue<00:01:32.070> light<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.759> protects<00:01:33.630> your<00:01:33.840> eye

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the blue light and protects your eye

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.039 
the blue light and protects your eye
against<00:01:34.920> macular<00:01:35.909> degeneration<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.869> the

looting that is present in eggs it's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.999 
looting that is present in eggs it's
very<00:01:45.299> very<00:01:45.570> available<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.920> the

going into you into your eyes it has

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.130 
going into you into your eyes it has
been<00:01:59.070> shown<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.759> numerous<00:02:00.149> studies<00:02:00.479> that

saturated fat in trans fatty acids they

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.609 
saturated fat in trans fatty acids they
increase<00:02:05.490> blood<00:02:05.759> cholesterol<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:07.049> sometimes

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
increase blood cholesterol so sometimes

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.639 
increase blood cholesterol so sometimes
because<00:02:08.489> dietary<00:02:09.090> cholesterol<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.929> present

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
the same subject like one week later

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.590 
the same subject like one week later
would<00:05:11.930> switch<00:05:12.230> to<00:05:12.410> the<00:05:12.530> other<00:05:12.680> breakfast<00:05:13.640> what

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
would switch to the other breakfast what

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.260 
would switch to the other breakfast what
we<00:05:14.810> found<00:05:15.110> is<00:05:15.410> when<00:05:15.980> subjects<00:05:16.490> were<00:05:16.700> consuming

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
we found is when subjects were consuming

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.920 
we found is when subjects were consuming
the<00:05:17.450> eggs<00:05:17.660> they<00:05:18.500> ate<00:05:18.800> fork<00:05:19.390> hundred<00:05:20.390> calories

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
the eggs they ate fork hundred calories

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.160 
the eggs they ate fork hundred calories
less<00:05:21.200> in<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.500> next<00:05:22.130> 24<00:05:22.580> hours<00:05:22.930> compare<00:05:23.930> when

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
less in the next 24 hours compare when

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.620 
less in the next 24 hours compare when
they<00:05:24.290> were<00:05:24.440> consuming<00:05:25.010> the<00:05:25.160> bagels<00:05:25.550> there<00:05:26.510> is

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
they were consuming the bagels there is

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.020 
they were consuming the bagels there is
also<00:05:26.840> a<00:05:26.990> hormone<00:05:27.500> called<00:05:27.740> ghrelin<00:05:28.100> that<00:05:28.910> is

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
also a hormone called ghrelin that is

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.150 
also a hormone called ghrelin that is
associated<00:05:29.360> with<00:05:29.810> increases<00:05:30.590> in<00:05:30.590> appetite

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
associated with increases in appetite

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.810 
associated with increases in appetite
that<00:05:31.990> hormone<00:05:32.990> was<00:05:33.230> reduced<00:05:33.740> in<00:05:33.950> the<00:05:34.220> subjects

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
that hormone was reduced in the subjects

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.270 
that hormone was reduced in the subjects
when<00:05:34.970> they<00:05:35.120> were<00:05:35.270> consuming<00:05:35.900> the<00:05:36.080> eggs<00:05:36.280> some

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
when they were consuming the eggs some

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.670 
when they were consuming the eggs some
of<00:05:37.430> my<00:05:37.490> studies<00:05:38.180> especially<00:05:38.510> those<00:05:39.110> in<00:05:39.470> which

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
of my studies especially those in which

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.920 
of my studies especially those in which
we<00:05:39.890> keep<00:05:40.040> the<00:05:40.220> subjects<00:05:40.760> only<00:05:41.150> 18<00:05:41.510> per<00:05:41.750> day

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
we keep the subjects only 18 per day

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.100 
we keep the subjects only 18 per day
instead<00:05:42.350> of<00:05:42.380> three<00:05:42.770> all<00:05:43.210> those<00:05:44.210> studies<00:05:44.840> in

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
instead of three all those studies in

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.940 
instead of three all those studies in
which<00:05:45.140> the<00:05:45.440> subjects<00:05:45.890> are<00:05:46.070> losing<00:05:46.520> weight<00:05:47.950> LDL

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
which the subjects are losing weight LDL

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.820 
which the subjects are losing weight LDL
doesn't<00:05:49.460> change<00:05:49.700> in<00:05:49.940> HDL<00:05:50.630> goes<00:05:50.840> up<00:05:51.140> and<00:05:51.530> I

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
doesn't change in HDL goes up and I

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.440 
doesn't change in HDL goes up and I
think<00:05:52.040> that's<00:05:52.220> a<00:05:52.340> very<00:05:52.460> interesting<00:05:52.730> finding

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
think that's a very interesting finding

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.280 
think that's a very interesting finding
so<00:05:53.860> people<00:05:54.860> do<00:05:54.950> not<00:05:55.070> understand<00:05:55.730> that<00:05:56.420> not

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
so people do not understand that not

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.230 
so people do not understand that not
only<00:05:57.530> the<00:05:57.830> bad<00:05:58.010> cholesterol<00:05:58.250> doesn't<00:05:58.910> go<00:05:59.060> up

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
only the bad cholesterol doesn't go up

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.380 
only the bad cholesterol doesn't go up
but<00:05:59.630> the<00:05:59.810> good<00:06:00.020> cholesterol<00:06:00.260> goes<00:06:00.830> up<00:06:01.180> in<00:06:02.180> all

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
but the good cholesterol goes up in all

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.690 
but the good cholesterol goes up in all
the<00:06:02.540> studies<00:06:02.960> that<00:06:02.990> I<00:06:03.200> have<00:06:03.470> reviewed<00:06:03.740> there

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
the studies that I have reviewed there

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.910 
the studies that I have reviewed there
is<00:06:04.790> a<00:06:04.820> population<00:06:05.690> that<00:06:05.720> might<00:06:06.110> not<00:06:06.320> benefit

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:06.920 
is a population that might not benefit

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.730 
is a population that might not benefit
from<00:06:06.980> making<00:06:07.520> date<00:06:07.760> and<00:06:08.030> that's<00:06:08.720> our<00:06:08.960> diabetic

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
from making date and that's our diabetic

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.550 
from making date and that's our diabetic
people<00:06:09.920> but<00:06:10.610> they<00:06:10.760> have<00:06:10.940> found<00:06:11.240> is<00:06:11.450> that<00:06:11.480> Ed<00:06:11.930> X

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
people but they have found is that Ed X

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.460 
people but they have found is that Ed X
in<00:06:12.980> diabetic<00:06:13.550> people<00:06:13.790> they<00:06:14.300> may<00:06:14.630> raise<00:06:15.020> some

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
in diabetic people they may raise some

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.690 
in diabetic people they may raise some
glucose<00:06:16.190> and<00:06:16.870> that's<00:06:17.870> blood<00:06:18.290> glucose<00:06:18.740> but

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
glucose and that's blood glucose but

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.020 
glucose and that's blood glucose but
again<00:06:20.000> I<00:06:20.090> think<00:06:20.120> the<00:06:20.870> the<00:06:21.580> clinical<00:06:22.580> studies

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
again I think the the clinical studies

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.060 
again I think the the clinical studies
there<00:06:23.330> are<00:06:23.450> focused<00:06:24.050> specifically<00:06:24.860> on

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
there are focused specifically on

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.640 
there are focused specifically on
diabetic<00:06:25.550> people<00:06:25.880> should<00:06:26.570> be<00:06:26.750> done<00:06:26.990> with<00:06:27.230> X<00:06:27.410> to

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
diabetic people should be done with X to

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.280 
diabetic people should be done with X to
really<00:06:28.010> clarify<00:06:28.280> what<00:06:28.790> is<00:06:28.910> going<00:06:29.210> on<00:06:29.300> but

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.290 
really clarify what is going on but

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.500 
really clarify what is going on but
that's<00:06:30.500> the<00:06:30.680> only<00:06:30.800> population<00:06:31.580> that<00:06:31.910> i<00:06:31.970> found

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
that's the only population that i found

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.750 
that's the only population that i found
the<00:06:32.810> did<00:06:32.990> not<00:06:33.170> benefit<00:06:33.680> from<00:06:33.890> egg<00:06:34.340> intake

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
the did not benefit from egg intake

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.390 
the did not benefit from egg intake
there's<00:06:35.419> one<00:06:35.510> egg<00:06:35.930> study<00:06:36.320> that<00:06:36.680> we<00:06:36.979> are<00:06:37.100> about

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
there's one egg study that we are about

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.190 
there's one egg study that we are about
to<00:06:37.430> start<00:06:37.940> I<00:06:38.210> think<00:06:38.690> we're<00:06:38.810> going<00:06:38.960> start

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
to start I think we're going start

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.310 
to start I think we're going start
tomorrow<00:06:39.710> actually<00:06:40.340> we're<00:06:40.490> recruiting

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
tomorrow actually we're recruiting

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.130 
tomorrow actually we're recruiting
objects<00:06:41.560> for<00:06:41.740> the<00:06:41.860> study<00:06:42.160> and<00:06:42.760> in<00:06:43.210> this<00:06:43.360> we<00:06:44.110> are

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
objects for the study and in this we are

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.900 
objects for the study and in this we are
doing<00:06:44.500> with<00:06:44.800> people<00:06:45.160> with<00:06:45.340> a<00:06:45.370> metabolic

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910 
doing with people with a metabolic

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.090 
doing with people with a metabolic
syndrome<00:06:46.270> because<00:06:47.170> we<00:06:47.500> want<00:06:47.770> to<00:06:47.890> demonstrate

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
syndrome because we want to demonstrate

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.410 
syndrome because we want to demonstrate
that<00:06:48.850> eggs<00:06:49.150> are<00:06:49.800> going<00:06:50.800> to<00:06:51.040> decrease<00:06:51.400> some<00:06:52.300> of

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.420 
that eggs are going to decrease some of

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.510 
that eggs are going to decrease some of
the<00:06:52.570> problems<00:06:52.810> that<00:06:53.080> they<00:06:53.290> have<00:06:53.320> so<00:06:54.190> this<00:06:54.370> is<00:06:54.490> a

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
the problems that they have so this is a

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.010 
the problems that they have so this is a
good<00:06:54.700> population<00:06:54.940> to<00:06:55.690> look<00:06:55.900> also<00:06:56.230> at<00:06:57.810> as<00:06:58.810> I

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020 
good population to look also at as I

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.610 
good population to look also at as I
mentioned<00:06:59.740> before<00:07:00.510> the<00:07:01.510> literature<00:07:02.050> suggests

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 
mentioned before the literature suggests

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.040 
mentioned before the literature suggests
that<00:07:02.830> X<00:07:03.370> my<00:07:03.640> not<00:07:03.850> good<00:07:04.120> for<00:07:04.390> people<00:07:04.750> with

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.050 
that X my not good for people with

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.650 
that X my not good for people with
diabetes<00:07:05.370> so<00:07:06.370> this<00:07:06.550> population<00:07:07.240> the<00:07:07.360> people

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.660 
diabetes so this population the people

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.270 
diabetes so this population the people
with<00:07:07.810> a<00:07:07.840> metabolic<00:07:08.350> syndrome<00:07:08.710> do<00:07:08.890> not<00:07:09.070> have

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 
with a metabolic syndrome do not have

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.090 
with a metabolic syndrome do not have
diabetes<00:07:09.760> yet<00:07:10.330> but<00:07:11.140> they<00:07:11.290> are<00:07:11.320> heading<00:07:11.950> that

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.100 
diabetes yet but they are heading that

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.300 
diabetes yet but they are heading that
way<00:07:12.160> so<00:07:13.120> this<00:07:13.300> is<00:07:13.420> a<00:07:13.570> good<00:07:13.780> opportunity<00:07:14.110> to<00:07:14.800> see

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310 
way so this is a good opportunity to see

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.540 
way so this is a good opportunity to see
if<00:07:15.490> the<00:07:15.760> eggs<00:07:16.060> increase<00:07:16.900> insulin<00:07:17.380> sensitivity

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
if the eggs increase insulin sensitivity

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.120 
if the eggs increase insulin sensitivity
and<00:07:18.720> decrease<00:07:19.720> inflammation<00:07:19.900> and<00:07:20.680> I<00:07:20.830> think

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.130 
and decrease inflammation and I think

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:30.830 
and decrease inflammation and I think
that<00:07:21.310> both<00:07:21.550> things<00:07:21.940> are<00:07:22.120> going<00:07:22.300> to<00:07:22.450> happen

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.900
