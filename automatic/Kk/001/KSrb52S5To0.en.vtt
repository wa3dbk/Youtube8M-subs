00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.459
 little cup of walnut and two tablespoons of 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.020
 butter here we have the others 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.660
 ingredients I also see cinnamon for the 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.840
 base we're going to need a cup of 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.840
 flour 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.780
 a cup of flour that is going to 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.680
 place in your container so it is and we're going 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.020
 to mix it with butter are 70 grams of 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.960
 Butter is vegetable shortening or it's shortening 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.640
 pork vegetable shortening 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.030
 is well stirred to the flour with the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.040
 Butter is going to add beer 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.590
 walk that yes rightly I knew it was rich 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.510
 because I said good, I do not get used to it 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.060
 a lot to drink beer but if you have 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.160
 a very rich taste very rich to see you will 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.070
 add the beer in that as this is 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.480
 add now that it 's okay to be fine 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:11.240
 mixed garÃ­n very well already we have here 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.940
 while marlene is kneading him 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.100
 that he is already giving 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.470
 consistency that the pie must have 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.770
 Well, we have what the apple is 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.860
 grated and it's here is the radiator and 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.560
 the apple that also previously striped 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.170
 I see good green tea is ready the 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.709
 mass has the consistency that 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.819
 take to the are preparing in the mold 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.920
 so is this can be any mold 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.680
 refractory glass or metal like 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.200
 this one we have here and it goes like this 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.240
 and the la conchita or the cake is true 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.310
 is 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.490
 good and at what time the 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.910
 filling is first caramelized sugar 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:57.430
 with butter, caramelizes 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:01.210
 I imagine that in seconds truth yes yes yes 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.690
 it's quick you have to move it fast and before 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:07.190
 of the hardening of the sugar we are going to 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.420
 add the nut 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:14.150
 It is already taking the color of candy 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.870
 is and as I tell you again there is no need 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.180
 let it harden a lot since it's 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:25.420
 well scrambled is not going to add the 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.420
 apple are two grated apples 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.940
 and this jewel will be ready to 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.890
 to be able to make the filling like that is missing 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.840
 also add cinnamon is cinnamon 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.840
 which will give the flavor 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.480
 and it smells because they smell really tasty and the 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.810
 cinnamon is the one that starts cinnamon the 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.150
 which starts to give flavor and has taken 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.420
