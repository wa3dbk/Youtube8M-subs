00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
the beginning of the day but overall I

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.979 
the beginning of the day but overall I
mean<00:02:53.640> it's<00:02:53.819> not<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.209> big<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.600> deal<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.750> me

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
mean it's not that big of a deal to me

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.300 
mean it's not that big of a deal to me
but<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.380> kind<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.799> little<00:02:56.040> bit<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.250> a

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
but it's kind of a little bit of a

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.550 
but it's kind of a little bit of a
bummer<00:02:56.549> so<00:02:57.299> if<00:02:57.690> that's<00:02:57.840> something<00:02:58.019> that<00:02:58.319> would

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
bummer so if that's something that would

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.320 
bummer so if that's something that would
kind<00:02:58.799> of<00:02:58.920> stray<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.370> away<00:02:59.700> from<00:02:59.760> using<00:03:00.239> it

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
kind of stray you away from using it

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.550 
kind of stray you away from using it
then<00:03:00.540> definitely<00:03:00.840> take<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.290> into<00:03:01.530> account

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
then definitely take that into account

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.220 
then definitely take that into account
because<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.310> does<00:03:02.519> wear<00:03:02.790> during<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.299> day<00:03:03.480> so

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
because it does wear during the day so

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.520 
because it does wear during the day so
if<00:03:04.709> you're<00:03:05.010> gonna<00:03:05.130> have<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.459> on<00:03:05.700> for<00:03:06.269> I<00:03:06.530> don't

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
if you're gonna have this on for I don't

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.009 
if you're gonna have this on for I don't
know<00:03:07.620> 12<00:03:08.010> hours<00:03:08.370> then<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.940> might<00:03:09.209> want<00:03:09.540> to

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
know 12 hours then you might want to

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.839 
know 12 hours then you might want to
consider<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.799> different<00:03:11.069> mascara<00:03:11.700> because

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
consider a different mascara because

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.390 
consider a different mascara because
this<00:03:12.120> one<00:03:12.269> doesn't<00:03:12.299> really<00:03:12.780> last<00:03:12.989> for<00:03:13.410> more

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
this one doesn't really last for more

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.120 
this one doesn't really last for more
than<00:03:14.459> probably<00:03:15.450> five<00:03:15.959> or<00:03:15.989> six<00:03:16.380> hours<00:03:16.560> on<00:03:16.950> me

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
than probably five or six hours on me

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.979 
than probably five or six hours on me
not<00:03:17.760> really<00:03:18.090> really<00:03:18.299> well<00:03:18.420> at<00:03:18.600> least<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.870> mean

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
not really really well at least I mean

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.390 
not really really well at least I mean
you<00:03:19.079> can<00:03:19.200> still<00:03:19.440> see<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.769> there's<00:03:19.920> mascara

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
you can still see that there's mascara

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.250 
you can still see that there's mascara
there<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.329> doesn't<00:03:21.630> look<00:03:21.690> quite<00:03:21.870> as<00:03:21.989> good

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
there it just doesn't look quite as good

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.170 
there it just doesn't look quite as good
as<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.530> did<00:03:22.650> at<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.890> beginning<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.370> day<00:03:23.519> so

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
as it did at the beginning of the day so

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.789 
as it did at the beginning of the day so
that's<00:03:24.450> pretty<00:03:24.600> much<00:03:24.750> gonna<00:03:24.930> happen<00:03:25.260> with<00:03:25.500> um

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
that's pretty much gonna happen with um

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.550 
that's pretty much gonna happen with um
any<00:03:26.579> mascara<00:03:27.239> give<00:03:27.810> give<00:03:28.140> or<00:03:28.260> take<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.440> little

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
any mascara give give or take a little

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.729 
any mascara give give or take a little
bit<00:03:28.859> but<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:30.600> one<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.049> little<00:03:31.440> bit<00:03:31.560> worse

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
bit but this one is a little bit worse

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.000 
bit but this one is a little bit worse
than<00:03:32.040> any<00:03:32.190> other<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.850> guess<00:03:33.840> favorite<00:03:34.530> mascara

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
than any other I guess favorite mascara

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.039 
than any other I guess favorite mascara
that<00:03:35.100> I've<00:03:35.400> used<00:03:35.430> if<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:36.000> makes<00:03:36.180> sense<00:03:36.390> but<00:03:37.019> i

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
that I've used if that makes sense but i

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.330 
that I've used if that makes sense but i
would<00:03:37.200> recommend<00:03:37.739> this<00:03:37.829> to<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:38.040> guys<00:03:38.130> i<00:03:38.310> think

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
would recommend this to you guys i think

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.420 
would recommend this to you guys i think
that<00:03:38.609> this<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.910> really<00:03:39.420> great<00:03:39.540> product<00:03:40.079> and

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
that this is a really great product and

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.710 
that this is a really great product and
i<00:03:41.430> think<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.120> if<00:03:42.239> they<00:03:42.359> do<00:03:42.420> have<00:03:42.690> a

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
i think that if they do have a

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.360 
i think that if they do have a
waterproof<00:03:43.079> version<00:03:43.440> not<00:03:43.950> something<00:03:44.280> i'll

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
waterproof version not something i'll

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.849 
waterproof version not something i'll
definitely<00:03:44.730> want<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:44.940> try<00:03:45.120> out<00:03:45.389> because<00:03:46.380> like

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
definitely want to try out because like

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.319 
definitely want to try out because like
i<00:03:46.980> said<00:03:47.010> i<00:03:47.220> don't<00:03:47.340> like<00:03:47.609> how<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.850> wears<00:03:48.030> on<00:03:48.269> me

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290
