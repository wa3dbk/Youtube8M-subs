00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.000 
okay goes out alright so we got the new
actual<00:02:21.250> pivot<00:02:21.610> brackets<00:02:22.060> in<00:02:22.209> here<00:02:22.690> and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
actual pivot brackets in here and

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.530 
actual pivot brackets in here and
support<00:02:24.010> brackets<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.580> they<00:02:24.700> came<00:02:24.940> with<00:02:25.180> I
