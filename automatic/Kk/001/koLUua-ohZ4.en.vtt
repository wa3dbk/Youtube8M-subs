Jenna and today's topic is what effect
physicists<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.480> well<00:00:09.480> if<00:00:09.719> we<00:00:09.870> have<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> sty<00:00:10.500> you

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
physicists I well if we have a sty you

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.230 
physicists I well if we have a sty you
probably<00:00:11.160> want<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.490> get<00:00:11.639> rid<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.090> really

quick so you probably want to know how
to<00:00:13.740> get<00:00:13.920> rid<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.280> faster<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.150> first<00:00:15.360> let's

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
to get rid of it faster the first let's

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.109 
to get rid of it faster the first let's
explain<00:00:15.990> what<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> sky<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:17.039> it's<00:00:17.430> simply<00:00:17.850> a

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
explain what a sky is it's simply a

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.080 
explain what a sky is it's simply a
pimple<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.080> lid<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:20.189> can<00:00:20.369> get<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> pimple

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
pimple on the lid you can get a pimple

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.210 
pimple on the lid you can get a pimple
on<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.300> pop<00:00:21.720> or<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.170> bottom<00:00:22.500> lip<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
on the pop or the bottom lip and the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.009 
on the pop or the bottom lip and the
reason<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.670> get<00:00:23.789> these<00:00:24.000> pimples<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.689> lid

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
reason you get these pimples on the lid

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.900 
reason you get these pimples on the lid
is<00:00:25.199> because<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.650> have<00:00:25.769> an<00:00:25.890> infection<00:00:26.730> of

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
is because you have an infection of

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.109 
is because you have an infection of
either<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> gland<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.590> will<00:00:28.859> secrete<00:00:29.189> oil<00:00:29.519> or

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
either a gland that will secrete oil or

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.600 
either a gland that will secrete oil or
a<00:00:30.689> hair<00:00:31.019> follicle<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.980> those<00:00:32.219> are<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.430> two

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
a hair follicle so those are the two

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.780 
a hair follicle so those are the two
places<00:00:32.880> who<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.480> get<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.110> spy<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.340> what

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
places who can get a spy and what

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.000 
places who can get a spy and what
happens<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.390> there's<00:00:36.660> an<00:00:36.899> infection<00:00:37.260> from

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
happens is there's an infection from

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.130 
happens is there's an infection from
probably<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.030> normal<00:00:39.420> bacteria<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.079> you

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
probably the normal bacteria that you

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.470 
probably the normal bacteria that you
have<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.620> your<00:00:40.770> eyelids<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.969> gets<00:00:42.149> out<00:00:42.450> of

enough anymore and you want apply heat

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.950 
enough anymore and you want apply heat
for<00:01:42.310> about<00:01:42.400> 10<00:01:42.490> minutes<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.330> way<00:01:43.450> I<00:01:43.480> do<00:01:43.660> it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
for about 10 minutes the way I do it

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.620 
for about 10 minutes the way I do it
real<00:01:44.230> simple<00:01:44.440> I<00:01:44.860> take<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.310> sock<00:01:45.670> and<00:01:46.060> I<00:01:46.240> put<00:01:46.450> rice

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
real simple I take a sock and I put rice

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.120 
real simple I take a sock and I put rice
in<00:01:46.660> it<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:47.170> that's<00:01:47.230> what<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.650> has<00:01:47.860> been

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
in it and that's what this has been

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.930 
in it and that's what this has been
stick<00:01:48.970> this<00:01:49.180> in<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.540> microwave<00:01:50.080> for<00:01:50.290> 15

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
stick this in the microwave for 15

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.370 
stick this in the microwave for 15
seconds<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.120> that<00:01:52.270> should<00:01:52.480> be<00:01:52.630> enough<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:53.170> get

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
seconds and that should be enough to get

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.590 
seconds and that should be enough to get
the<00:01:53.800> rice<00:01:54.040> that's<00:01:54.340> in<00:01:54.580> here<00:01:54.790> now<00:01:54.970> drannit<00:01:55.300> it's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
the rice that's in here now drannit it's

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.410 
the rice that's in here now drannit it's
dry<00:01:55.930> rice<00:01:56.230> it's<00:01:56.800> kind<00:01:56.980> of<00:01:57.040> like<00:01:57.190> a<00:01:57.220> bean<00:01:57.580> bag<00:01:57.820> it

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
dry rice it's kind of like a bean bag it

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.270 
dry rice it's kind of like a bean bag it
will<00:01:58.600> make<00:01:58.810> it<00:01:58.930> hot<00:01:59.140> enough<00:01:59.290> and<00:01:59.650> you<00:01:59.740> can<00:01:59.890> put

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
will make it hot enough and you can put

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.580 
will make it hot enough and you can put
it<00:02:00.370> over<00:02:00.520> your<00:02:00.730> eye<00:02:00.910> like<00:02:01.150> this<00:02:01.390> for<00:02:02.080> 10

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
it over your eye like this for 10

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.520 
it over your eye like this for 10
minutes<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.700> can<00:02:03.940> do<00:02:04.120> it<00:02:04.270> four<00:02:04.870> times<00:02:04.900> a<00:02:05.350> day

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
minutes you can do it four times a day

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.609 
minutes you can do it four times a day
and<00:02:05.800> that<00:02:06.340> will<00:02:06.520> help<00:02:06.790> improve<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
and that will help improve the

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.060 
and that will help improve the
expression<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:10.300> French<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.560> is<00:02:11.710> inside

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
expression of the French that is inside

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.600 
expression of the French that is inside
of<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.310> land<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.800> hopefully<00:02:14.800> you<00:02:15.040> will<00:02:15.070> be

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
of that land and hopefully you will be

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.030 
of that land and hopefully you will be
looking<00:02:16.330> normal<00:02:16.750> real<00:02:17.500> soon

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
looking normal real soon

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.940 
looking normal real soon
now<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.370> typical<00:02:18.880> cycle<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.900> sky<00:02:20.500> is

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
now the typical cycle of a sky is

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.410 
now the typical cycle of a sky is
probably<00:02:21.700> about<00:02:22.350> seven<00:02:23.350> days<00:02:23.739> maximum<00:02:24.459> if<00:02:25.150> you

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
probably about seven days maximum if you

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.720 
probably about seven days maximum if you
have<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.810> sky<00:02:26.080> for<00:02:26.440> longer<00:02:26.950> then<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.340> would

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
have the sky for longer then I would

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.120 
have the sky for longer then I would
recommend<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.870> did<00:02:29.050> see<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.320> doctor<00:02:29.830> if

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
you have the side that hurts a lot I

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.620 
you have the side that hurts a lot I
recommend<00:02:33.070> it<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.280> see<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.459> doctor<00:02:33.730> if<00:02:34.390> you

want to get rid of the sky quickly and

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.640 
want to get rid of the sky quickly and
you're<00:02:36.660> thinking<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:37.900> might<00:02:38.140> want<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.500> go

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
you're thinking you might want to go

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.100 
you're thinking you might want to go
ahead<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:38.920> poke<00:02:39.160> at<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.580> or<00:02:39.730> pinch<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.300> go<00:02:40.840> see

ahead and poke at it or pinch it go see
a<00:02:41.140> doctor<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:42.130> reason<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.550> say<00:02:42.820> that<00:02:42.850> is

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
a doctor and the reason I say that is

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.380 
a doctor and the reason I say that is
because<00:02:43.180> if<00:02:43.959> you<00:02:44.260> squeeze<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:45.220> sky<00:02:45.640> or<00:02:46.000> you

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
because if you squeeze the sky or you

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.560 
because if you squeeze the sky or you
poke<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.230> whatever<00:02:47.980> fluid<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.330> there

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
poke it and whatever fluid is in there

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.780 
poke it and whatever fluid is in there
which<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:49.959> pus<00:02:50.260> comes<00:02:50.860> out<00:02:51.070> and<00:02:51.190> goes<00:02:51.310> into

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
which is pus comes out and goes into
