of the most original if you want to
explain<00:00:19.850> kind<00:00:20.090> of<00:00:20.210> what<00:00:20.390> you<00:00:20.510> have<00:00:20.630> going<00:00:20.869> on

and<00:00:21.289> why<00:00:21.380> you<00:00:21.440> use<00:00:21.710> it<00:00:21.890> well<00:00:22.789> I<00:00:22.820> mean<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.420> basic

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
and why you use it well I mean the basic

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.570 
and why you use it well I mean the basic
reason<00:00:24.020> that<00:00:24.140> I<00:00:24.230> use<00:00:24.619> a<00:00:24.650> drop<00:00:24.920> ring<00:00:25.130> finger<00:00:25.430> is

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
reason that I use a drop ring finger is

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.790 
reason that I use a drop ring finger is
just<00:00:25.609> for<00:00:25.970> comfort<00:00:26.410> you<00:00:27.410> know<00:00:27.500> I<00:00:27.650> actually

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
just for comfort you know I actually

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.529 
just for comfort you know I actually
hurt<00:00:28.070> my<00:00:28.130> hand<00:00:28.430> about<00:00:28.580> 10<00:00:28.880> years<00:00:29.060> ago<00:00:29.240> when<00:00:29.480> I

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
hurt my hand about 10 years ago when I

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.060 
hurt my hand about 10 years ago when I
was<00:00:29.660> bowling<00:00:29.869> I<00:00:30.050> cracked<00:00:30.380> my<00:00:30.500> fingernail<00:00:30.920> is

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
was bowling I cracked my fingernail is

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.459 
was bowling I cracked my fingernail is
very<00:00:31.279> painful<00:00:31.760> and<00:00:32.719> I<00:00:32.960> wanted<00:00:33.199> to<00:00:33.260> continue

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
very painful and I wanted to continue

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.620 
very painful and I wanted to continue
bowling<00:00:33.920> so<00:00:34.430> you<00:00:34.850> know<00:00:34.940> basically<00:00:35.360> I<00:00:35.390> just

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
bowling so you know basically I just

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.760 
bowling so you know basically I just
dropped<00:00:35.870> that<00:00:35.930> ring<00:00:36.170> finger<00:00:36.440> to<00:00:36.470> take<00:00:36.680> the

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
dropped that ring finger to take the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.160 
dropped that ring finger to take the
pressure<00:00:36.980> off<00:00:37.100> my<00:00:37.370> nail<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:37.790> you<00:00:38.750> know<00:00:38.870> that's

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
pressure off my nail and you know that's

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.930 
pressure off my nail and you know that's
really<00:00:39.290> why<00:00:39.620> I<00:00:39.680> did<00:00:40.130> it<00:00:40.160> I<00:00:40.489> liked<00:00:40.700> it<00:00:40.820> right

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
really why I did it I liked it right

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.370 
really why I did it I liked it right
away<00:00:41.030> and<00:00:41.329> I've<00:00:41.719> been<00:00:41.780> using<00:00:42.020> it<00:00:42.170> ever<00:00:42.290> since

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
away and I've been using it ever since

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.799 
away and I've been using it ever since
so<00:00:43.070> it's<00:00:43.100> much<00:00:43.370> more<00:00:43.399> of<00:00:43.910> an<00:00:44.120> advanced<00:00:44.480> fit

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
so it's much more of an advanced fit

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.180 
so it's much more of an advanced fit
something<00:00:45.200> that<00:00:45.380> you<00:00:45.890> wouldn't<00:00:46.100> necessarily

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
something that you wouldn't necessarily

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.520 
something that you wouldn't necessarily
just<00:00:46.790> send<00:00:47.030> somebody<00:00:47.329> rate<00:00:47.690> in<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:47.989> try<00:00:48.230> but

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
just send somebody rate in to try but

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.200 
just send somebody rate in to try but
something<00:00:48.860> through<00:00:49.100> whether<00:00:49.550> it<00:00:49.670> be<00:00:49.760> injury

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
something through whether it be injury

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.030 
something through whether it be injury
or<00:00:50.719> through<00:00:51.050> trial<00:00:51.379> and<00:00:51.500> error<00:00:51.649> or<00:00:51.800> something

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
or through trial and error or something

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.040 
or through trial and error or something
that<00:00:52.280> just<00:00:52.309> you<00:00:52.670> came<00:00:52.879> about<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.360> not<00:00:53.840> only

from 10-15 years ago and you know the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:31.690 
from 10-15 years ago and you know the
actual<00:01:30.859> size<00:01:31.130> of<00:01:31.219> the<00:01:31.279> holes<00:01:31.459> are<00:01:31.609> pretty

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
actual size of the holes are pretty

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.459 
actual size of the holes are pretty
close<00:01:31.999> but<00:01:32.329> there's<00:01:32.779> no<00:01:32.929> way<00:01:33.049> I<00:01:33.079> could<00:01:33.289> throw

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
close but there's no way I could throw

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.289 
close but there's no way I could throw
it<00:01:33.590> now<00:01:33.709> I<00:01:33.740> mean<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.069> pitches<00:01:34.399> were<00:01:34.579> a<00:01:34.849> lot<00:01:35.270> of

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
it now I mean the pitches were a lot of

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.749 
it now I mean the pitches were a lot of
reverse<00:01:35.630> pitch<00:01:35.959> I've<00:01:36.889> had<00:01:37.219> a<00:01:37.249> lot<00:01:37.429> more<00:01:37.459> grip

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.219 
reverse pitch I've had a lot more grip
pressure<00:01:37.999> than<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.299> squeeze<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.840> ball<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.049> lot

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
pressure than I squeeze the ball a lot

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.709 
pressure than I squeeze the ball a lot
more<00:01:39.469> than<00:01:39.649> I<00:01:39.679> do<00:01:39.770> now<00:01:39.939> so<00:01:40.939> in<00:01:41.149> time<00:01:41.419> you<00:01:41.630> know

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
I've learned how to relax my hand and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.159 
I've learned how to relax my hand and
you<00:01:44.119> know<00:01:44.149> I've<00:01:44.329> changed<00:01:44.599> the<00:01:44.689> pitches<00:01:44.990> to

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:45.169 
you know I've changed the pitches to

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:47.229 
you know I've changed the pitches to
accommodate<00:01:45.889> for<00:01:45.919> that<00:01:46.159> yeah<00:01:46.429> so<00:01:46.639> that<00:01:46.999> brings

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:47.239 
accommodate for that yeah so that brings

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:48.729 
accommodate for that yeah so that brings
up<00:01:47.389> a<00:01:47.479> great<00:01:47.569> point<00:01:47.689> that<00:01:48.020> as<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.259> skill<00:01:48.590> level

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:48.739 
up a great point that as a skill level

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:51.789 
up a great point that as a skill level
increases<00:01:49.399> as<00:01:49.549> you<00:01:49.700> become<00:01:50.539> more<00:01:50.569> able<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.380> use

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
increases as you become more able to use

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.529 
increases as you become more able to use
lots<00:01:52.099> less<00:01:52.520> grip<00:01:52.789> pressure<00:01:53.029> you<00:01:53.209> can<00:01:53.329> get<00:01:53.450> away

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
lots less grip pressure you can get away

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.510 
lots less grip pressure you can get away
with<00:01:53.810> using<00:01:53.840> pitches<00:01:54.409> that<00:01:54.619> maybe<00:01:55.099> 10<00:01:55.369> years

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
with using pitches that maybe 10 years

with using pitches that maybe 10 years
ago<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:55.849> wouldn't<00:01:56.149> have<00:01:56.359> been<00:01:56.569> able<00:01:56.689> to<00:01:56.869> do
