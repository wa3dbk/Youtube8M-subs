videos will be very practical with just

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.010 
videos will be very practical with just
me<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.910> look<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:36.270> looking<00:00:36.719> over<00:00:36.809> my

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
me you look like looking over my

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.780 
me you look like looking over my
shoulder<00:00:37.469> when<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.680> code<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.190> applications

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
shoulder when I code the applications

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.780 
shoulder when I code the applications
and<00:00:39.230> you<00:00:40.230> know<00:00:40.350> just<00:00:40.530> explaining<00:00:40.950> what<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
and you know just explaining what the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.299 
and you know just explaining what the
script<00:00:42.180> does<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.770> kind<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.129> like

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
script does so this is just kind of like

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.190 
script does so this is just kind of like
a<00:00:44.489> little<00:00:44.789> formal<00:00:45.059> tutorial<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.780> introduce

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
a little formal tutorial to introduce

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.389 
a little formal tutorial to introduce
PHP<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:48.180> why<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.420> PHP<00:00:48.840> well<00:00:49.649> PHP<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.370> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
PHP so why is PHP well PHP is a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.310 
PHP so why is PHP well PHP is a
server-side<00:00:50.629> scripting<00:00:51.629> language<00:00:52.050> and

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
server-side scripting language and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.680 
server-side scripting language and
there's<00:00:53.219> no<00:00:53.399> other<00:00:53.640> way<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.239> really<00:00:54.480> put

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
there's no other way you can really put

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.840 
there's no other way you can really put
it<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.949> might<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.160> confusing

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
it like that so that might be confusing

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.910 
it like that so that might be confusing
10<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.230> pretty<00:00:58.440> much<00:00:58.620> just

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
10 to you but that pretty much just

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.150 
10 to you but that pretty much just
means<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.550> PHP<00:01:00.449> scripts<00:01:00.989> are<00:01:01.260> executed<00:01:02.039> on

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
means that PHP scripts are executed on

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.609 
means that PHP scripts are executed on
the<00:01:02.579> web<00:01:02.879> server<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> web

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the web server and not on the web

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.550 
the web server and not on the web
browser<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.659> client-side

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
browser so if you have a client-side

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.010 
browser so if you have a client-side
scripting<00:01:08.100> language<00:01:08.490> uses<00:01:08.820> JavaScript<00:01:09.450> that

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
scripting language uses JavaScript that

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.260 
scripting language uses JavaScript that
will<00:01:10.170> actually<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.950> know<00:01:11.070> execute<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
will actually you know execute on the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.960 
will actually you know execute on the
browser<00:01:12.650> so<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.799> not<00:01:13.920> very<00:01:14.250> dynamic<00:01:14.880> it's

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
browser so it's not very dynamic it's

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.120 
browser so it's not very dynamic it's
not<00:01:15.180> very<00:01:15.360> usable<00:01:15.630> when<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.560> comes<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.920> things

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
not very usable when it comes to things

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.070 
not very usable when it comes to things
that<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> server<00:01:17.880> because<00:01:18.689> what<00:01:18.840> PHP

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
that are on the server because what PHP

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.710 
that are on the server because what PHP
because<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.100> server-side<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.540> can

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
because it is server-side you can

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.020 
because it is server-side you can
integrate<00:01:22.020> PHP<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:22.979> things<00:01:23.189> like<00:01:23.369> my<00:01:23.580> sequel

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
integrate PHP with things like my sequel

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.450 
integrate PHP with things like my sequel
databases<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.560> quite<00:01:25.830> an<00:01:25.950> interesting

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
databases which is quite an interesting

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.249 
databases which is quite an interesting
subject<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.180> will<00:01:27.299> be<00:01:27.479> will<00:01:27.810> be<00:01:27.900> covering

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
subject that will be will be covering

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.520 
subject that will be will be covering
somewhere<00:01:28.680> down<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.920> line<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.990> PHP<00:01:31.409> is

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
somewhere down the line and so PHP is

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.990 
somewhere down the line and so PHP is
pretty<00:01:31.770> much<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.009> use<00:01:32.189> for<00:01:32.220> web<00:01:32.610> development

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
pretty much is use for web development

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.819 
pretty much is use for web development
because<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.110> used<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.409> create<00:01:34.590> dynamic

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
because it can be used to create dynamic

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.940 
because it can be used to create dynamic
pages<00:01:35.369> all<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.329> page<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.960> see<00:01:37.140> nowadays<00:01:37.409> you

pages all the page you see nowadays you
know<00:01:38.070> Facebook<00:01:38.720> let<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.079> OL<00:01:40.200> use<00:01:40.470> PHP<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
know Facebook let the OL use PHP to

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.850 
know Facebook let the OL use PHP to
create<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> website<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.710> PHP<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.829> a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
create the website it PHP is a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.520 
create the website it PHP is a
multi-platform<00:01:44.840> save<00:01:45.840> side<00:01:46.079> scripting

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
multi-platform save side scripting

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.880 
multi-platform save side scripting
language<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.119> know<00:01:48.240> very<00:01:48.619> easy<00:01:49.619> to
