00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.390
 I have to keep looking 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.200
 If you fuck there was nothing 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.929
 but this monkey sounding 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.820
 yes 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.289
 hear 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:35.290
 If no use is very dark 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.290
 I'm scared because the diamond monkey 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.590
 well I have two diamonds 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.290
 like youtube people here you opened me 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.860
 also like that of the mods good and today 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.350
 I bring you one as a lander mod 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.380
 the truth is not this is very cool the bike 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.810
 very useful 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.890
 in fact some parrots watching walking with 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.770
 a light bulb without the hand 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.060
 in fact and thinking more consists of a 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.060
 lantern that 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.679
 it's very simple it 's infinite you can 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.679
 place 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.690
 because I do not like the floor at all 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.659
 Peruvian 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.280
 over here about taking 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.999
 and we, this is very easy, 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.409
 you need 5 iron or one glass and 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.690
 one of balloons 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:55.550
 let's check it 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:59.090
 the 345 ready when groups upside down 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.330
 when good as well is very useful here 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.640
 as they saw here in the little TV that 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.920
 I made my friend half ugly construction 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.920
 epic at level 32 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.739
 when you go in it 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.150
 the good mine written a function the 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.150
 progression is that he could 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.160
 they kiss to enlighten who lives here leaves 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.000
 another around here 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.760
 do not leave it here it's fine it 's very useful and 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.730
 for example here is to finish 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.660
 here is the typical diamond and for more 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.550
 more steps to break for dad mom 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.420
 you were going to win and well that has been 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:52.390
 all the magma is very extensive that we say 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.390
 but the truth is that it is a little useful 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.120
 milk 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.370
 you know my name is Labor and we 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.290
 we see until the next 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.290
 it's the context of the night
