Barcelona this year as you can see

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.880 
Barcelona this year as you can see
there's<00:00:19.000> some<00:00:19.210> wedges<00:00:19.720> around<00:00:20.320> the<00:00:20.410> defender

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
there's some wedges around the defender

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.350 
there's some wedges around the defender
who's<00:00:21.250> in<00:00:21.610> possession<00:00:21.940> of<00:00:22.030> the<00:00:22.090> ball<00:00:22.120> at<00:00:22.300> the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
who's in possession of the ball at the

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.360 
who's in possession of the ball at the
beginning<00:00:22.690> of<00:00:22.780> the<00:00:22.900> video<00:00:23.020> and<00:00:23.380> these<00:00:23.890> wedges

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.370 
beginning of the video and these wedges

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.790 
beginning of the video and these wedges
is<00:00:25.330> what<00:00:25.540> we're<00:00:25.690> calling<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:26.140> vision<00:00:26.410> map<00:00:26.590> and

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
is what we're calling the vision map and

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.070 
is what we're calling the vision map and
is<00:00:27.340> the<00:00:27.490> concept<00:00:27.910> that<00:00:28.030> we've<00:00:28.210> created<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.900> try

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
is the concept that we've created to try

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.920 
is the concept that we've created to try
to<00:00:29.140> create<00:00:29.500> this<00:00:29.770> behavior<00:00:30.600> you<00:00:31.600> can<00:00:31.750> see<00:00:31.900> that

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
to create this behavior you can see that

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.720 
to create this behavior you can see that
the<00:00:32.110> defenders<00:00:32.439> vision<00:00:32.739> map<00:00:32.890> is<00:00:33.129> not<00:00:33.160> very<00:00:33.520> big

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
the defenders vision map is not very big

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.690 
the defenders vision map is not very big
he<00:00:34.570> doesn't<00:00:34.780> have<00:00:34.840> a<00:00:34.930> lot<00:00:35.050> of<00:00:35.550> vision<00:00:36.550> behind

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
he doesn't have a lot of vision behind

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.720 
he doesn't have a lot of vision behind
him<00:00:37.150> and<00:00:37.980> he<00:00:38.980> doesn't<00:00:39.310> see<00:00:39.460> all<00:00:39.579> the

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
him and he doesn't see all the

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.250 
him and he doesn't see all the
opportunities<00:00:40.210> that<00:00:40.239> are<00:00:40.480> presented<00:00:40.720> in<00:00:41.170> a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
opportunities that are presented in a

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.910 
opportunities that are presented in a
plate<00:00:41.440> at<00:00:42.040> a<00:00:42.100> given<00:00:42.250> moment<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:44.020> now<00:00:44.170> when<00:00:44.800> we

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
plate at a given moment but now when we

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.950 
plate at a given moment but now when we
run<00:00:44.950> the<00:00:45.220> video<00:00:45.430> and<00:00:45.790> he<00:00:46.390> passes<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.780> ball<00:00:46.899> to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
run the video and he passes the ball to

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.330 
run the video and he passes the ball to
Fabregas<00:00:47.470> who<00:00:47.620> is<00:00:47.739> around<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.040> middle<00:00:48.220> of<00:00:48.280> the

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
Fabregas who is around the middle of the

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.000 
Fabregas who is around the middle of the
field<00:00:48.579> as<00:00:48.910> he<00:00:49.630> gets<00:00:49.840> it<00:00:50.079> you<00:00:50.290> can<00:00:50.440> see<00:00:50.649> that<00:00:50.860> his

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
field as he gets it you can see that his

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.860 
field as he gets it you can see that his
vision<00:00:51.309> map<00:00:51.489> is<00:00:51.640> much<00:00:51.850> much<00:00:52.059> larger<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:52.630> this

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
vision map is much much larger and this

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.770 
vision map is much much larger and this
is<00:00:53.020> because<00:00:53.230> of<00:00:53.770> his<00:00:54.370> vision<00:00:54.700> attribute<00:00:55.120> and

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
is because of his vision attribute and

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.389 
is because of his vision attribute and
now<00:00:55.870> this<00:00:56.050> vision<00:00:56.380> map<00:00:56.559> changes<00:00:57.070> in<00:00:57.219> a<00:00:57.280> variety

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
now this vision map changes in a variety

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.250 
now this vision map changes in a variety
of<00:00:57.670> things<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.570> opportunities<00:00:59.110> and<00:00:59.200> threats

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
of things the opportunities and threats

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.549 
of things the opportunities and threats
that<00:00:59.559> i<00:00:59.590> mentioned<00:01:00.070> affect<00:01:01.020> how<00:01:02.020> much<00:01:02.290> the

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
that i mentioned affect how much the

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.829 
that i mentioned affect how much the
vision<00:01:03.399> map<00:01:03.550> slows<00:01:03.820> down<00:01:04.089> as<00:01:04.360> it<00:01:04.479> hits<00:01:04.659> that

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
vision map slows down as it hits that

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.129 
vision map slows down as it hits that
player<00:01:05.399> it<00:01:06.399> also<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:07.210> vision<00:01:07.509> attribute<00:01:07.959> also

00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:08.139 
player it also the vision attribute also

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:10.739 
player it also the vision attribute also
affects<00:01:08.409> how<00:01:08.590> how<00:01:09.039> big<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.030> vision<00:01:10.270> map<00:01:10.389> is<00:01:10.539> in

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:10.749 
affects how how big the vision map is in

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:14.039 
affects how how big the vision map is in
general<00:01:11.039> in<00:01:12.039> terms<00:01:12.340> of<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.869> angle<00:01:13.869> that<00:01:13.990> he

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
general in terms of the angle that he

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.020 
general in terms of the angle that he
can<00:01:14.289> see<00:01:14.530> in<00:01:14.799> terms<00:01:15.310> of<00:01:15.429> how<00:01:15.579> much<00:01:15.819> he

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
can see in terms of how much he

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.249 
can see in terms of how much he
remembers<00:01:16.479> after<00:01:16.780> seeing<00:01:17.049> an<00:01:17.139> opportunity

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
remembers after seeing an opportunity

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.139 
remembers after seeing an opportunity
and<00:01:18.130> all<00:01:18.310> these<00:01:18.490> different<00:01:18.609> things<00:01:18.819> that

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
and all these different things that

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.999 
and all these different things that
create<00:01:19.359> a<00:01:19.420> very<00:01:19.630> very<00:01:19.869> sophisticated<00:01:20.229> system

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
create a very very sophisticated system

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.699 
create a very very sophisticated system
to<00:01:21.399> replicate<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.869> behavior<00:01:23.319> of<00:01:23.350> players

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:23.709 
to replicate the behavior of players

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.069 
to replicate the behavior of players
like<00:01:23.799> Fabregas<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:24.399> shabby<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:25.869> can<00:01:25.990> see

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
like Fabregas and shabby so you can see

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:27.419 
like Fabregas and shabby so you can see
when<00:01:26.200> públicas<00:01:26.560> gets<00:01:26.740> it<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:26.979> he's<00:01:27.130> turning

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
when públicas gets it and he's turning

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.389 
when públicas gets it and he's turning
around<00:01:27.749> his<00:01:28.749> wedges<00:01:29.229> now<00:01:29.649> already<00:01:29.979> covered

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
around his wedges now already covered

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.709 
around his wedges now already covered
the<00:01:30.549> opportunity<00:01:31.060> that<00:01:31.119> he's<00:01:31.299> actually<00:01:31.450> going

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:31.719 
the opportunity that he's actually going

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:33.300 
the opportunity that he's actually going
to<00:01:31.810> capitalise<00:01:32.289> on<00:01:32.319> and<00:01:32.770> that<00:01:33.069> he<00:01:33.159> actually

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
to capitalise on and that he actually

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.559 
to capitalise on and that he actually
did<00:01:33.670> in<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.749> real-life<00:01:34.959> example<00:01:35.679> and<00:01:36.569> this

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
did in the real-life example and this

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.589 
did in the real-life example and this
this<00:01:38.049> path<00:01:38.259> then<00:01:38.529> creates<00:01:39.029> this<00:01:40.029> you<00:01:40.479> know

00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:40.599 
this path then creates this you know

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:43.859 
this path then creates this you know
amazing<00:01:40.899> opportunity<00:01:41.319> to<00:01:41.409> score<00:01:42.420> now<00:01:43.420> when<00:01:43.779> we

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
amazing opportunity to score now when we

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.309 
amazing opportunity to score now when we
run<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:44.729> test<00:01:45.729> again<00:01:45.880> by<00:01:46.689> keeping<00:01:46.899> all<00:01:47.200> the

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
run the test again by keeping all the

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.739 
run the test again by keeping all the
variables<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:48.310> same<00:01:48.609> but<00:01:49.179> only<00:01:49.389> substituting

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:49.749 
variables the same but only substituting

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:52.349 
variables the same but only substituting
Fabregas<00:01:50.499> for<00:01:50.709> another<00:01:51.159> player<00:01:51.549> in<00:01:51.819> this<00:01:52.149> case

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
Fabregas for another player in this case

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:53.580 
Fabregas for another player in this case
it's<00:01:52.509> jay<00:01:52.659> is<00:01:52.779> five<00:01:52.990> for<00:01:53.200> Manchester<00:01:53.560> United

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
it's jay is five for Manchester United

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.429 
it's jay is five for Manchester United
you<00:01:54.549> can<00:01:54.669> see<00:01:54.789> that<00:01:54.819> the<00:01:55.149> outcome<00:01:55.929> is<00:01:56.229> going<00:01:56.349> to

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
you can see that the outcome is going to

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.260 
you can see that the outcome is going to
be<00:01:56.529> different<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:57.579> first<00:01:57.789> defender<00:01:58.090> is<00:01:58.209> the

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
be different the first defender is the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.209 
be different the first defender is the
same<00:01:58.539> these<00:01:58.959> wedges<00:01:59.200> are<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.499> same<00:01:59.709> he<00:01:59.919> passes

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
same these wedges are the same he passes

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.699 
same these wedges are the same he passes
to<00:02:00.340> park<00:02:00.639> and<00:02:00.880> you<00:02:01.270> can<00:02:01.419> see<00:02:01.659> that<00:02:01.929> parks

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
to park and you can see that parks

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.129 
to park and you can see that parks
vision<00:02:03.459> map<00:02:03.639> is<00:02:03.819> much<00:02:04.569> larger<00:02:04.779> than<00:02:04.959> the

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:05.139 
vision map is much larger than the

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:08.100 
vision map is much larger than the
defender<00:02:05.560> but<00:02:05.919> it's<00:02:06.069> not<00:02:06.219> quite<00:02:06.399> as<00:02:06.639> big<00:02:06.880> as<00:02:07.179> an

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
defender but it's not quite as big as an

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.520 
defender but it's not quite as big as an
encompassing<00:02:08.679> as<00:02:09.190> Fabregas<00:02:10.260> because<00:02:11.260> of<00:02:11.410> this

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
encompassing as Fabregas because of this

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.300 
encompassing as Fabregas because of this
as<00:02:11.770> he<00:02:11.950> turns<00:02:12.250> he's<00:02:12.910> not

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
as he turns he's not

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.089 
as he turns he's not
yep<00:02:13.520> ready<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.870> make<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.230> pass<00:02:15.440> he<00:02:15.739> hasn't

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
yep ready to make that pass he hasn't

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.130 
yep ready to make that pass he hasn't
seen<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.550> opportunity<00:02:17.090> yet<00:02:17.300> up<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.870> field

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
seen that opportunity yet up the field

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.960 
seen that opportunity yet up the field
so<00:02:18.709> he's<00:02:18.890> still<00:02:19.010> considering<00:02:19.489> all<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.700> things

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
so he's still considering all the things

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.790 
so he's still considering all the things
and<00:02:20.300> eventually<00:02:21.050> he<00:02:21.080> does<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.530> can<00:02:21.620> see<00:02:21.770> that

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
and eventually he does you can see that

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.559 
and eventually he does you can see that
the<00:02:21.950> vision<00:02:22.340> map<00:02:22.489> eventually<00:02:22.760> gets<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.450> that

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
the vision map eventually gets to that

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.990 
the vision map eventually gets to that
place<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.080> field<00:02:24.349> but<00:02:24.980> now<00:02:25.580> it's<00:02:25.760> too<00:02:25.970> late

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
place of the field but now it's too late

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.390 
place of the field but now it's too late
he<00:02:26.480> takes<00:02:26.720> two<00:02:27.050> touches<00:02:27.319> on<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.620> ball<00:02:27.650> as<00:02:28.040> it

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
he takes two touches on the ball as it

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.979 
he takes two touches on the ball as it
takes<00:02:28.550> time<00:02:28.849> for<00:02:28.880> him<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.209> see<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.569> whole<00:02:29.810> play

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
takes time for him to see the whole play

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.110 
takes time for him to see the whole play
develop<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:30.680> when<00:02:31.040> he<00:02:31.130> plays<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.550> past<00:02:31.760> the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
develop and when he plays the past the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.490 
develop and when he plays the past the
defender<00:02:32.300> is<00:02:32.690> actually<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.080> one<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.260> ends

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
defender is actually the one that ends

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.140 
defender is actually the one that ends
up<00:02:33.590> with<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:33.860> ball<00:02:34.069> because<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.790> attacker

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
up with the ball because the attacker

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.229 
up with the ball because the attacker
has<00:02:35.390> now<00:02:35.510> given<00:02:35.660> up<00:02:35.930> on<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.910> as<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.120> can

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
has now given up on it and as you can

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.570 
has now given up on it and as you can
see<00:02:38.269> it's<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.660> subtle<00:02:38.989> difference<00:02:39.310> but<00:02:40.310> it

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
see it's a subtle difference but it

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.580 
see it's a subtle difference but it
makes<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.630> world<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:42.050> difference<00:02:42.110> when<00:02:42.560> it

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
makes a world of difference when it

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.410 
makes a world of difference when it
comes<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.459> outcome<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:43.940> play<00:02:43.970> and

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
comes to the outcome of a play and

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.820 
comes to the outcome of a play and
that's<00:02:44.780> what<00:02:44.930> we're<00:02:45.019> going<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.200> have<00:02:45.380> in<00:02:45.650> this

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
that's what we're going to have in this

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.480 
that's what we're going to have in this
series<00:02:46.040> game

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.550
