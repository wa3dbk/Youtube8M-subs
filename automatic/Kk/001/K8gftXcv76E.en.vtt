00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.330
 such swami friends are ozone and today we are with 

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:10.080
 again you continue lego homemade 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:13.530
 today's work is not the most 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.660
 small mini lego dispensary only 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:26.070
 four blocks four very small 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:28.640
 so let's look at it like this 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.640
 honestly 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:40.050
 us more then I'm sweet 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:43.340
 Yandex Well Well, let's eat it, I and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:53.280
 so you like platforms 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:01:03.989
 44 then take any a 2 on 1 any 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:06.509
 masonry take the same smooth 2 on 1 and 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.990
 we put it next to her 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:19.950
 such a two-by-two who block now take 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:23.430
 21 bend fasten them here yet 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.009
 take two for one with a fold too her 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.840
 fasten here well now the reason for these lines 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.880
 natusik or not we need to impose 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:47.520
 4 on 1. 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:51.079
 and so 2121 is fat and once again 2 legs still 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.079
 we wrap a layer and 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:06.910
 nodal take another corner 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.910
 you don't need gray 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.970
 box 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:24.110
 we take gray 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:28.040
 corner over here 21 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:40.420
 we just love her bulo any blocks 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:44.690
 wrapped three for one thick and 2 nike 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:54.100
 fine now we are wrapping the layer 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:58.940
 only here you as soon as here we are 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:09.590

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:15.670
 this place again everything is also so 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.670
 remember the same thing 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:34.130
 so small problem that is, see 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.720
 here we put the corner 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.720
 instead of 4 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.120
 here we also put on the corner everything we have 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.499
 dressed layer 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:56.249
 just behind the head it turned out now 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:56.249
 where we float, we attach the first 111 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:31.320
 throat like that now too just 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:31.320
 we wrap a layer and another 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:42.539
 now let's make it our 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:57.360
 workpiece we leave the mechanism for it 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:57.360
 need so now 4 put on a flat 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:12.909
 end here such as if alone with 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:18.669
 fold now become 2 on 1 flat too 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:20.849
 with a smooth coating put here take 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:24.880
 any smooth surface too 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:27.159
 2 for 1's will then have a gap 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:32.710
 stayed so that he would deft smoothly 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:37.210
 take 111 here we have such a mechanism 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:39.449
 the valve turned out now we take our 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.449
 billet 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.980

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.850
 so try it if you move it 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:56.030
 well as in persistent carpeted where 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:06:15.270
 tightened and again wrapped 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:21.240
