Gabe I thought like last year my my role

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.670 
Gabe I thought like last year my my role
on<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.739> team<00:02:24.860> changed<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.459> little<00:02:25.519> bit<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.680> I

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
always thought that the captain should

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.199 
always thought that the captain should
be<00:02:30.410> somebody<00:02:30.790> who<00:02:32.739> was<00:02:33.739> always<00:02:34.430> pretty<00:02:34.849> big<00:02:35.060> on

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
be somebody who was always pretty big on

idea what it's about and but but at the

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.539 
idea what it's about and but but at the
same<00:03:17.180> time<00:03:17.389> really<00:03:17.660> excited<00:03:18.049> and<00:03:18.169> you<00:03:19.040> know<00:03:19.370> a

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549

extremely said a little you know a

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.330 
extremely said a little you know a
little<00:05:43.169> weird<00:05:44.169> I<00:05:44.260> guess<00:05:44.440> or<00:05:44.620> not<00:05:45.010> weird<00:05:45.310> but

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
little weird I guess or not weird but

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.530 
little weird I guess or not weird but
low<00:05:46.090> surreal<00:05:46.470> it's<00:05:47.470> something<00:05:47.860> that<00:05:48.540> didn't

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
low surreal it's something that didn't

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.950 
low surreal it's something that didn't
know<00:05:49.750> until<00:05:50.110> you<00:05:50.500> know<00:05:50.530> someone<00:05:51.570> someone<00:05:52.570> told

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.270 
know until you know someone someone told
me<00:05:53.169> or<00:05:53.260> so<00:05:53.380> much<00:05:53.530> tweeted<00:05:53.770> at<00:05:53.890> me<00:05:53.919> I<00:05:54.040> can't

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
me or so much tweeted at me I can't

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.780 
me or so much tweeted at me I can't
remember<00:05:54.460> but<00:05:54.840> it's<00:05:56.250> it's<00:05:57.250> something<00:05:57.490> that

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
remember but it's it's something that

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.340 
remember but it's it's something that
you<00:05:58.030> know<00:05:58.120> it's<00:05:58.270> pretty<00:05:58.450> special<00:05:58.720> I<00:05:58.900> guess<00:05:58.960> but

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
you know it's pretty special I guess but

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.240 
you know it's pretty special I guess but
at<00:05:59.410> the<00:05:59.470> same<00:05:59.590> time<00:05:59.830> it's<00:06:00.300> something<00:06:01.300> all<00:06:02.250> you

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
at the same time it's something all you

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.310 
at the same time it's something all you
know<00:06:03.340> cherish<00:06:03.700> a<00:06:03.790> bit<00:06:03.910> more<00:06:04.150> when<00:06:04.390> down<00:06:05.169> the

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
know cherish a bit more when down the

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.560 
know cherish a bit more when down the
road<00:06:05.440> I<00:06:05.560> guess<00:06:05.740> and<00:06:05.979> right<00:06:06.550> now<00:06:06.729> it's<00:06:06.970> tough<00:06:07.390> to

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
road I guess and right now it's tough to

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.500 
road I guess and right now it's tough to
