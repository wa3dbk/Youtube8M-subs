00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
very difficult to precisely date down to

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.720 
very difficult to precisely date down to
the<00:00:21.930> month<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.380> day<00:00:22.529> when<00:00:23.130> these<00:00:23.279> things<00:00:23.519> are

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
the month and day when these things are

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.170 
the month and day when these things are
made<00:00:24.019> but<00:00:25.550> this<00:00:26.550> one's<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.880> little<00:00:27.029> different

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
made but this one's a little different

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.300 
made but this one's a little different
than<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> other<00:00:27.840> two<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.949> rectify

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
than the other two it is a to rectify

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.910 
than the other two it is a to rectify
damp<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.820> course<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.359> one<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> Katie<00:00:30.990> 66

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
damp of course this one is a Katie 66

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.580 
damp of course this one is a Katie 66
amp<00:00:32.130> as<00:00:32.309> well<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.820> find<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.170> one<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.559> a

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
amp as well I find that this one is a

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.250 
amp as well I find that this one is a
little<00:00:34.860> bit<00:00:35.340> gainer<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.149> probably<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
little bit gainer and probably just a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260 
little bit gainer and probably just a
little<00:00:37.500> bit<00:00:37.649> nastier<00:00:38.129> than<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> other<00:00:38.550> 2<00:00:38.760> JDM

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
little bit nastier than the other 2 JDM

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.069 
little bit nastier than the other 2 JDM
45<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:39.989> I've<00:00:40.170> tried<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.649> far<00:00:40.680> today<00:00:41.719> as<00:00:42.719> far<00:00:42.930> as

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
45 so I've tried so far today as far as

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:53.229 
45 so I've tried so far today as far as
it<00:00:43.260> cleaned<00:00:43.710> up

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.000 

we'll<00:00:54.239> break<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.540> a<00:00:54.780> little<00:00:55.050> bit<00:00:55.260> more<00:00:55.500> even

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
we'll break up a little bit more even

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.160 
we'll break up a little bit more even
with<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.250> guitar<00:00:56.579> back<00:00:56.820> down

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
with the guitar back down
