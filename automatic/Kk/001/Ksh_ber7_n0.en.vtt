00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 to leave your look more original and more 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.430
 modern 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.140
 What about betting on the overlap as 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.300
 mix different pieces of different 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.139
 styles and put this all in one 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.400
 look 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.400
 That's what we're going to roll about today. 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.250
 there are some tips that will help in 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.320
 time to overlap your parts for example 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.660
 starting with a lighter shirt 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.730
 under the silk shirt a shirt says 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.190
 There you put one on top of one 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.100
 wool blouse , and there it was that 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.620
 corey especially and can start with 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.420
 light and carry later for you 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.550
 Do not look so hot right now. 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.920
 a nice thing to say is that it is 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.260
 Overlay will help you to wear parts 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.629
 of other seasons of the year when the cold 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 to get so short in theory 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.710
 only use in the summer you can count on 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.809
 a thicker pantyhose and make a 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.329
 overlapping on my pants 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.820
 with a 634 you can leave appearing 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.369
 in the boot or even put on a sandal and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.869
 let her really show her look 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.400
 You know that little black dress that we 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.510
 It's basic that you do not know what else to do. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.700
 with him 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.860
 so we can put a more annoying one 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.330
 a beautiful shawl over and instead of 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.970
 leave the charles what you put a 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.009
 belt to give an insured face 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.200
 It's different causes and mystery that I 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.479
 I think it's one of the cool things about this 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.850
 position not only a belt as a collar 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.560
 also the way I'm using 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.930
 overlapping the shirt and gives it more air 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.140
 modern with a look and the cool is you 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.780
 Think about mixing styles and textures 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.670
 so I 'm here with a silk shirt 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.619
 that the transparency she has an air 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.570
 more romantic then I put on a sweatshirt 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.450
 the smell of a sweatshirt over it 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.189
 has this thing a little more the sport is 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.350
 mix one happened right all right that 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.689
 the boy with something military 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.579
 these unusual mixtures that will 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.810
 really make a look look more 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.000
 interesting 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.579
 There are also some key pieces that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.030
 They will help you when it comes to composing the vest. 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.890
 or heart but what had leather 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.320
 pantyhose if this all will get you 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.810
 Help play time to overlap 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.489
 your pieces show our 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.470
 I hope you liked it today. 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.750

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.610
