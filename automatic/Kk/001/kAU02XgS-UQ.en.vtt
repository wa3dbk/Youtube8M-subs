00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the fog will dissipate out now I just

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.710 
the fog will dissipate out now I just
want<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.220> point<00:01:26.430> out<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.909> fog<00:01:27.180> machine<00:01:27.360> gets

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
want to point out the fog machine gets

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.170 
want to point out the fog machine gets
very<00:01:27.960> hot<00:01:28.290> while<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.740> use<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.430> always<00:01:29.670> hold<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
very hot while in use so always hold the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.850 
very hot while in use so always hold the
fog<00:01:30.360> machine<00:01:30.570> by<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.020> handle<00:01:31.560> when<00:01:31.710> they're

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
fog machine by the handle when they're

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.310 
fog machine by the handle when they're
using<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.090> now<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.390> everything's<00:01:33.869> set<00:01:33.990> up

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
using it so now that everything's set up

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.990 
using it so now that everything's set up
we<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.619> plug<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> fog<00:01:35.430> machine<00:01:35.820> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
we can plug in the fog machine and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.670 
we can plug in the fog machine and
rather<00:01:36.270> warm<00:01:36.540> up<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:36.960> five<00:01:37.170> minutes

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
rather warm up for five minutes

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.590 
rather warm up for five minutes
now<00:01:38.280> whether<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.090> same<00:01:39.299> fog

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
now whether you have the same fog

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.300 
now whether you have the same fog
machine<00:01:40.020> or<00:01:40.140> not<00:01:40.290> always<00:01:40.920> follow<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
machine or not always follow the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.429 
machine or not always follow the
instructions<00:01:42.060> before<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.509> use<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.990> there

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
instructions before you use it it there

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.020 
instructions before you use it it there
may<00:01:43.649> be<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.860> different<00:01:44.250> way<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.399> put<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> fog

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
may be a different way to put the fog

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.179 
may be a different way to put the fog
solution<00:01:45.540> bin<00:01:45.750> or<00:01:46.259> there<00:01:46.470> may<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.799> different

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
solution bin or there may be a different

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.600 
solution bin or there may be a different
way<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> use<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:49.740> here's<00:01:50.040> what<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> fog

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
way to use it so here's what the fog

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.969 
way to use it so here's what the fog
looks<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.899> bad<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.619> there's<00:01:52.829> one

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
looks like not bad but there's one

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.100 
looks like not bad but there's one
problem<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.790> fog<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.450> use<00:01:54.899> this

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
problem with this fog I use this

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.230 
problem with this fog I use this
technique<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.770> previous<00:01:56.250> video<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.939> this

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
technique in a previous video and this

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.539 
technique in a previous video and this
is<00:01:57.360> what<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.659> looks<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:59.009> looks<00:01:59.280> more<00:01:59.490> like

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
is what it looks like it looks more like

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.480 
is what it looks like it looks more like
rain<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.360> fog<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.950> use<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> lot

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
rain but fog and you have to use a lot

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.760 
rain but fog and you have to use a lot
of<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.689> make<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> better<00:02:04.259> more<00:02:04.740> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
of it so to make a better more a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.770 
of it so to make a better more a
realistic<00:02:05.460> fog<00:02:05.700> you're<00:02:06.149> going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:06.719> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
realistic fog you're going to be in a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.320 
realistic fog you're going to be in a
damp<00:02:07.049> cloth<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.759> something<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.879> direct<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
damp cloth and something to direct the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.479 
damp cloth and something to direct the
fog<00:02:09.539> I'm<00:02:10.110> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.739> using<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.220> vacuum

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
fog I'm going to be using this vacuum

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.320 
fog I'm going to be using this vacuum
cleaner

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
cleaner

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.960 
cleaner
that's<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.810> do<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:14.430> here's<00:02:14.670> what<00:02:14.880> it

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
that's what to do so so here's what it

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.200 
that's what to do so so here's what it
looks<00:02:15.150> like<00:02:15.330> all<00:02:15.570> set<00:02:15.870> up<00:02:16.940> alrights<00:02:17.940> bit

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
looks like all set up alrights bit

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:25.060 
looks like all set up alrights bit
sketchy<00:02:18.510> but<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.290> works<00:02:19.580> let's<00:02:20.580> test<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.120> out

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.690 

looks<00:02:26.070> great

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
looks great

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.600 
looks great
the<00:02:27.660> reason<00:02:28.050> this<00:02:28.200> happens<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.770> because<00:02:28.920> warm

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
the reason this happens is because warm

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.990 
the reason this happens is because warm
air<00:02:29.940> rises<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.780> cool<00:02:31.320> air<00:02:31.560> dissipates<00:02:32.220> the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
air rises and cool air dissipates the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.600 
air rises and cool air dissipates the
cool<00:02:33.270> fog<00:02:33.600> dissipates<00:02:34.260> everywhere<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.100> this

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
cool fog dissipates everywhere and this

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.460 
cool fog dissipates everywhere and this
is<00:02:35.790> how<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.030> get<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.480> creepy<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.230> spooky

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
is how you get this creepy and spooky

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.670 
is how you get this creepy and spooky
effect<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.460> looks<00:02:39.210> great<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.440> will<00:02:40.560> look

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
effect it looks great and it will look

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.890 
effect it looks great and it will look
amazing<00:02:40.830> in<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.580> remake<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.030> ghost<00:02:42.510> train

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
amazing in a remake of ghost train
