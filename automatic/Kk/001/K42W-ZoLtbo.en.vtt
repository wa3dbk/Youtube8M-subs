00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 if it is a social need of 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.589
 teenagers already had songs composed 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.370
 songs with my brother and a friend 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.480
 we had a group at 17 called 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.550
 the butrones group was called a trio 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.939
 brunch an influence of nirvana the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.619
 chili peppers that's not something 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.500
 brothers cartoonists lives in Barcelona 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.580
 so that the aboytes also that is 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.710
 artist and good live 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:36.650
 the link if there is any musical record 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.579
 ay ay there are recordings but good not 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:44.059
 we recorded an album that was not official 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.519
 and there have homemade recordings and 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.190
 that trio is missing now people are 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.789
 knowing solo stage that told me 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.500
 you are a need that was of 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.909
 logical growth but I say is 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.979
 inevitable the questions by these two 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.079
 referring to what you have gone through and 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.850
 share also in this case the Indian 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.350
 solari but what of spinetta for example 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.050
 I particularly want to ask you about 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.550
 both 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.640
 because sometimes you have an image 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.510
 you saw and see it outside me how is a guy 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.390
 a genius as spinetta in the intimate is 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.580
 to give orders like coexistence one 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.570
 learn all the time in the case of 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.330
 Luis this is not like you will if you will only 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.280
 music and you are incorporating your 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.720
 music 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.050
 was not to give many indications to 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.940
 times if I can out there this some 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.850
 signs or things to follow but it was not a 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.290
 neither person who does this 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.090
 this one that I have the possibility of 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.530
 Record 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.869
 on different discs 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.330
 and good to also participate in the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.409
 rehearsals of the concerts and is 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.560
 terrific is an intense experience in 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.880
 the sense of commitment to music 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.039
 and with 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.810
 with what you have to say 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.850
 in the recording sessions in the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.740
 concerts in rehearsals is a 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.070
 constant learning to be by the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.070
 Indian 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.290
 and it's great I appreciate life to 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.630
 listen to some of your material to the lack 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.120
 that you come to present tonight 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.500
 who with the artist and in the example 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.870
 with the term that has city parana 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.000
 in the railway zone since years of 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.920
 21 a martÃ­n at 21 a baltasar comotto 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.920
 let's hear something like this 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:49.490
 I'm standing in the storm animals of 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:54.000
 fire that cities contain 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:03:00.060
 distort the best selling one offered a 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.680
 stars fall stones in a car and the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:09.300
 villa shows its fangs a tense 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:20.150
 calm is perceived we are victims of this 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:20.150
 great game years dreams several dreams 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.770
 dreams 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.420
 do not 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.910
 neither
