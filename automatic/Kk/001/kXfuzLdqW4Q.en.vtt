schedule I think of any of the teams

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.819 
schedule I think of any of the teams
this<00:04:14.550> week<00:04:14.610> because<00:04:15.000> they're<00:04:15.330> facing<00:04:15.829> gravity

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.330 
and Team Liquid you know to those top
teams<00:04:19.019> yeah<00:04:19.380> gate<00:04:19.739> though<00:04:19.890> he<00:04:20.010> was<00:04:20.160> originally

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
teams yeah gate though he was originally

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.340 
teams yeah gate though he was originally
a<00:04:20.549> mid<00:04:20.700> laner<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:21.209> he'll<00:04:21.390> just<00:04:21.419> have<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.720> slop

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
a mid laner so he'll just have to slop

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.750 
a mid laner so he'll just have to slop
back<00:04:22.530> into<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:22.830> position<00:04:23.040> we'll<00:04:23.460> see<00:04:23.640> how

opponents are doing Tyson teammate this
week<00:05:05.880> so<00:05:06.780> they're<00:05:06.960> feeling<00:05:07.260> very<00:05:07.440> confident

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
week so they're feeling very confident

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.340 
week so they're feeling very confident
moving<00:05:08.160> towards<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:09.419> one<00:05:09.960> of<00:05:10.050> those<00:05:10.140> buys

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
moving towards the one of those buys

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.110 
moving towards the one of those buys
that<00:05:10.590> you<00:05:10.710> talked<00:05:10.919> about<00:05:11.040> I<00:05:11.400> think<00:05:11.820> that<00:05:11.970> they

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
that you talked about I think that they

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.409 
that you talked about I think that they
may<00:05:12.330> have<00:05:12.479> the<00:05:12.630> easiest<00:05:13.020> road<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.680> get<00:05:14.040> to<00:05:14.419> at

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
may have the easiest road to get to at

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.170 
may have the easiest road to get to at
least<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:16.020> tiebreaker<00:05:16.979> position<00:05:17.669> for<00:05:18.060> the

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
least the tiebreaker position for the

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.600 
least the tiebreaker position for the
second<00:05:18.600> by<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:19.680> they'll<00:05:19.800> probably<00:05:20.040> face<00:05:20.340> team

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
second by and they'll probably face team

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.610 
second by and they'll probably face team
liquid<00:05:20.820> I<00:05:21.150> think<00:05:21.479> now<00:05:21.630> without<00:05:22.050> their<00:05:22.290> 11

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
liquid I think now without their 11

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.740 
liquid I think now without their 11
split<00:05:22.979> yeah<00:05:23.370> I<00:05:23.850> really<00:05:24.180> wanted<00:05:24.450> that<00:05:24.510> game

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
against teammate but it's a sigh of

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.590 
against teammate but it's a sigh of

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
relief because they have a very easy

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.850 
relief because they have a very easy
schedule<00:06:09.870> we've<00:06:10.169> been<00:06:10.260> saying<00:06:10.410> easy<00:06:10.590> schedule

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
schedule we've been saying easy schedule

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.680 
schedule we've been saying easy schedule
here<00:06:11.100> at<00:06:11.160> the<00:06:11.250> desk<00:06:11.400> a<00:06:11.490> lot<00:06:11.610> but<00:06:11.760> they<00:06:11.850> play<00:06:12.030> TDK

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
here at the desk a lot but they play TDK

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.570 
here at the desk a lot but they play TDK
and<00:06:12.930> they<00:06:13.290> play<00:06:13.470> tip<00:06:13.710> without<00:06:13.980> shall<00:06:14.220> we<00:06:14.340> shout

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
so gravity looks like they're gonna get

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.840 
so gravity looks like they're gonna get
locked<00:06:16.230> into<00:06:16.410> that<00:06:16.620> first<00:06:16.860> place<00:06:17.040> spot<00:06:17.310> almost
