00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 My name is Lucas, said Olsen. 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.879
 they are welcome 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.970
 we are inaugurating a new series of 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.280
 videos that talk about writers 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.019
 the series will call great writers and 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.179
 that I 'm going to talk about the lives of several 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.740
 giants of literature writers of 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.609
 nowadays the writer of yesteryear 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.609
 everything else 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.970
 So, folks today, I'm going to talk about the ex. 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.490
 Lord, for those who have never heard of this. 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.170
 writer can be very easy to remember if 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.250
 can you remember the great 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.790
 His classic love story of 1970 is that 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.520
 arrive was born in 1937 was professor 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.440
 university and gave the caller the 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.360
 princeton and countless others 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.610
 United States universities and he 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.090
 it was only to discover the genius of the 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.670
 32 years and with simplicity and without many 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.479
 pretensions or of a market 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.580
 bigger 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.470
 he wrote love story a story of 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.320
 love his literary agent even had a 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.160
 Little you are a cliche story. 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.150
 how did he speak but really succeeded and 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.640
 became a fever 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.590
 even here in Brazil with the ovi store 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.810
 He arrived as a millionaire. 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.649
 today I have this book love story today 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.810
 there and he is very good a simple work 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.000
 direct is the story of jaime cavalieri and 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.800
 look it catches room he's rich 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.110
 she covers the two study in the same 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.520
 university I think they are 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.039
 fall in love and have all those 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.319
 difficulties of social class and 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.210
 differences between them but the story 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.190
 very beautiful, I'm not going to say the ending 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.380
 because really at the end it changes everything 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.819
 the one that comes from talking as well as 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.860
 curiosity I do not even want to talk to that 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.420
 which also comes screenwriter and made up 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.030
 a script for yellow animation 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.850
 submarine wants an animation based on 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.069
 rites something like that in 1975 married 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.870
 with kevin james not much is known about 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.300
 she does not really have many things 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.700
 about r according to the internet people if you 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.620
 I still do not remember love story 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.819
 I think you really need to hear 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.859
 the soundtrack 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.079
 this song for as long as you do not 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:29.180
 You know this book and no movie, do you? 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.879
 15 for remember that this song I 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.209
 Then have a faith and came criticism 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.700
 by Alex and GalvÃ£o who was pretentious and 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.219
 that he had plagiarized more things 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.629
 often without foundation some 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:44.209
 even say that the new story was 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.579
 inspired by stories of his colleagues 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.180
 of the university room is that it blinded 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:52.400
 studied with tommy lee jones and al gore 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.349
 now is not and became vice 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.109
 president of the united states and tony 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.909
 george an actor that everyone knows about mib 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.159
 men in black and yes that their study 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:04.430
 with two famous and I have this book 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:07.219
 that love story and it's not that book with 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.650
 the cover where you have in the photo of the actors of the 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:12.109
 film that said that we say mind 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.090
 also did they catch a movie put 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.489
 on the cover of the book they sell you can 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.699
 I put the cover here with a movie like 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.079
 It's like this more or less and this one ends 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:23.780
 which I think the oldest measurement then 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.370
 I bought a sebum and I liked it a lot. 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.299
 even because I had already read 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.799
 an excel book that is just love that 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.290
 he published well afterwards with several 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.629
 other famous after a while she is 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.090
 blindly published the oil story 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.220
 the continuation of love story that sold 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.650
 Well, the movie was not so successful. 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.759
 so even because I can not stay 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.650
 because it would spoiler 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:47.540
 but I'll talk anyway it's as follows 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.250
 if you do not want to know the spoiler love 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.009
 story despite being one thing talked 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.250
 so I wanted to get in the lux kyle that is 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:57.019
 one thing that everybody knows I do not know 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.699
 spoiler so important unless 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.919
 that you want very much in this book, you 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:03.229
 see in the description that will have a match 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:06.379
 perfect feel here to get out of the spoiler 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:07.069
 such from the minute you click then 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.709
 I'll talk 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.689
 the end of new is not just fish and because 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.489
 many people have even said why it is 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:16.009
 demi dies in the end is a story 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.840
 simple direct and challenging and 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.759
 continuation is called work history 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.289
 because then he died that 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.539
 story continues the eye and he knows 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.180
 another woman and the story arises 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:28.580
 still very well on spoilers 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.100
 at the age of 42 after publishing more 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.310
 novels after love story story 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.360
 many others is that blind became ill and 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.720
 was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.910
 a disease against which he fought until 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.130
 72 years old when he died 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.530
 still pressed the university is 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.350
 second died in 2010 of an attack 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.270
 and he left two daughters already 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.460
 adult is the second left his legacy 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.830
 I consider no great writer 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.780
 at age 32 as a teacher in the 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.660
 university publish a book do 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.970
 success become millionaire then publish 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.670
 more books nor to thrill generations 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.400
 a classic that stays forever to this day 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.320
 It's not for everyone. 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.100
