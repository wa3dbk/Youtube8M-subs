00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.260
 after a long hesitation two weeks 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.030
 fa barack obama announced that 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.920
 united states will arm the 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.570
 Syrian rebels who are trying to 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.240
 overthrow the assad regime 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.460
 the motivation used by obama is not 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.230
 certainly a past novelty would have used 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.270
 gas against their own countrymen 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.920
 is this second obama represents the 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.840
 famous red line that was wrong 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.240
 passed and that has now triggered 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.680
 the need to intervene in the 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.140
 meanwhile his foreign minister 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.969
 carrey is working hard to get 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.620
 the maximum possible support from 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.320
 allied nations for an intervention 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.450
 military in Syria for its part the 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.040
 TV propaganda continues to search 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.410
 to convince the Americans of 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.489
 need to help the rebels 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.320
 showing them as a band of poor people 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.960
 badly armed who are desperate 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.470
 need help but new york and new 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.800
 nation 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.800
 the resort or mail web slice wine show 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.690
 while the famous pacifist protester 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.119
 of the seventies john kerry and the 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.250
 nobel prize for peace barack obama yes 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.200
 they try to find allies to invade 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.179
 but a small Syria exploded 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.979
 media bomb that threatens to put 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:14.350
 their troubles seriously 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.479
 military intervention project while 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.729
 all speak of the inhuman ferocity of the 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.740
 cruel Assad dictator turned up 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.049
 a video in which one of the rebel leaders 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.880
 a carlo car makes a gesture that is 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.069
 even managed to scandalize glenn 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.020
 beck one of the most extreme conservatives 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:31.020
 of the already extremely fox television 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.070
 in set 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:14.770
 dead living room or ground the dm of women 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.840
 at this point it becomes difficult for 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.700
 anyone claim that you go to Syria 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.890
 to enforce human rights of 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.690
 innocent citizens when to do so 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.030
 we should arm people with rights 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.980
 humans don't even know what they are 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.050
 despite this in his meeting with 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.120
 putin on the eve of the last g8 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.740
 British Prime Minister Cameron has 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.750
 continued to repeat the refrain 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.760
 of Western propaganda already 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.810
 used successfully against saddam 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.810
 hussein and against Gaddafi 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:37.930
 but this time putin had one ready 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:39.580
 the video unfortunately surprising answer 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.290
 ends here but from the expression of 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.239
 cameron clearly understands that not 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.700
 he expected such a position 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.019
 net by putin camerano indeed 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.489
 he immediately backed up 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.290
 as we read from the article of 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.540
 telegraph and said he didn't have it yet 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.040
 decided whether or not to follow the Americans 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.280
 in the decision to arm the rebels 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.329
 Syrians but putin was categorical 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.610
 stating that any request of 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.950
 use a no flyzone on the territory 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.720
 Syrian will be rejected by the Russian al 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.250
 UN security council 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.470
 the real red line therefore has it 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.060
 ragged putin non obama 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.769
 meanwhile the mayor of london boris 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.380
 johnson sided openly 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.360
 against the armament of the Syrian rebels 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.130
 angela merkel also warned 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.930
 the united states from arming these 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.820
 rebels saying that they would be created 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.520
 an extremely dangerous situation 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.490
 for all and the Italian government what 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.440
 says naturally we are too silent 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.600
 committed to pouring our donation 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.190
 annual to international bankers for 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.250
 can afford to have a voice in
