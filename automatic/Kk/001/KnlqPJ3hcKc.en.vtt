vapor form that never turns out that's

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.540 
vapor form that never turns out that's

this system is designed to be with no
cellulose<00:04:55.440> in<00:04:55.620> it<00:04:55.740> so<00:04:55.830> there's<00:04:55.980> nothing<00:04:56.280> that

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
cellulose in it so there's nothing that

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.970 
cellulose in it so there's nothing that
can<00:04:56.580> support<00:04:57.150> mold<00:04:57.419> growth<00:04:57.660> it<00:04:58.230> all<00:04:58.410> is<00:04:58.710> not

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
can support mold growth it all is not

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.010 
can support mold growth it all is not
affected<00:04:59.370> by<00:04:59.400> water<00:04:59.820> and<00:05:00.060> so<00:05:00.630> it<00:05:00.660> comes

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
affected by water and so it comes

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.920 
affected by water and so it comes
through<00:05:01.410> and<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:02.039> goes<00:05:02.669> into<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.090> goes<00:05:03.750> into

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
through and it goes into the goes into

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:04.580 
through and it goes into the goes into
the<00:05:04.050> air

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
the air

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.050 
the air
to<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.740> atmosphere<00:05:05.220> now<00:05:05.670> what's<00:05:05.880> he<00:05:06.030> doing

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
to the atmosphere now what's he doing

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.170 
to the atmosphere now what's he doing
here<00:05:06.570> he's<00:05:06.780> attaching<00:05:07.760> moldings<00:05:08.760> at<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:08.970> top

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
here he's attaching moldings at the top

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.270 
here he's attaching moldings at the top
and<00:05:09.450> what<00:05:09.540> Kevin's<00:05:09.870> done<00:05:10.020> here<00:05:10.230> is<00:05:10.380> before<00:05:10.830> we

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
and what Kevin's done here is before we

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.620 
and what Kevin's done here is before we
put<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:11.550> panel's<00:05:11.760> up<00:05:12.030> we<00:05:12.120> put<00:05:12.480> in<00:05:12.570> a

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
put the panel's up we put in a

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.020 
put the panel's up we put in a
structural<00:05:13.080> lineal<00:05:14.070> right<00:05:14.340> that<00:05:14.550> holds<00:05:14.940> the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
structural lineal right that holds the

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.820 
structural lineal right that holds the
panel<00:05:15.270> in<00:05:15.360> place<00:05:15.480> and<00:05:16.140> then<00:05:16.380> all<00:05:16.620> of<00:05:16.650> the

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
panel in place and then all of the

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.940 
panel in place and then all of the
panels<00:05:17.130> are<00:05:17.220> actually<00:05:17.460> held<00:05:17.640> in<00:05:17.760> place<00:05:17.850> by<00:05:17.970> a

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
panels are actually held in place by a

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.530 
panels are actually held in place by a
snap-together<00:05:19.950> system<00:05:20.520> which<00:05:20.940> is<00:05:21.090> battens

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
snap-together system which is battens

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.960 
snap-together system which is battens
and<00:05:21.810> trim<00:05:22.230> components<00:05:22.740> so<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.670> beauty<00:05:23.940> of

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
and trim components so the beauty of

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.580 
and trim components so the beauty of
this<00:05:24.120> is<00:05:24.300> that<00:05:24.330> you<00:05:24.510> never<00:05:24.720> lose<00:05:25.020> access<00:05:25.470> to

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
this is that you never lose access to

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.590 
this is that you never lose access to
your<00:05:25.680> foundation<00:05:26.190> mm-hmm<00:05:26.760> so<00:05:26.970> five<00:05:27.390> years

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
your foundation mm-hmm so five years

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.210 
your foundation mm-hmm so five years
from<00:05:27.690> now<00:05:27.780> two<00:05:27.900> years<00:05:28.110> from<00:05:28.320> now<00:05:28.590> you're

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
from now two years from now you're

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.440 
from now two years from now you're
wondering<00:05:29.610> if<00:05:29.730> there's<00:05:29.880> something<00:05:30.120> going<00:05:30.330> on

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
wondering if there's something going on

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.170 
wondering if there's something going on
or<00:05:30.780> you<00:05:31.350> want<00:05:31.530> to<00:05:31.590> run<00:05:31.710> a<00:05:31.740> wire<00:05:32.010> to<00:05:32.400> a<00:05:32.430> speaker

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
or you want to run a wire to a speaker

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.000 
or you want to run a wire to a speaker
so<00:05:33.450> you<00:05:33.480> can<00:05:33.570> always<00:05:33.810> remove<00:05:34.200> a<00:05:34.320> panel<00:05:34.560> and<00:05:34.920> get

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
so you can always remove a panel and get

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.430 
so you can always remove a panel and get
behind<00:05:35.220> it<00:05:35.550> easily<00:05:35.880> exactly<00:05:36.390> and<00:05:36.570> then<00:05:36.990> the

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
behind it easily exactly and then the

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.100 
behind it easily exactly and then the
finishing<00:05:38.040> touch<00:05:38.340> in<00:05:38.700> between<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.270> panels<00:05:39.810> is

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
finishing touch in between the panels is

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.990 
finishing touch in between the panels is
basically<00:05:40.440> a<00:05:40.560> batten<00:05:41.010> right<00:05:41.220> that's<00:05:41.580> correct

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
basically a batten right that's correct

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.490 
basically a batten right that's correct
in<00:05:42.330> fact<00:05:42.480> these<00:05:42.600> come<00:05:42.840> in<00:05:42.990> three<00:05:43.470> different

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
in fact these come in three different

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.920 
in fact these come in three different
form<00:05:44.460> three<00:05:44.940> different<00:05:45.180> formats<00:05:45.480> the<00:05:45.780> the

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
form three different formats the the

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.600 
form three different formats the the
fabric<00:05:46.140> what<00:05:46.380> you<00:05:46.500> see<00:05:46.650> here<00:05:46.860> you<00:05:47.370> can<00:05:47.430> also

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
fabric what you see here you can also

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.550 
fabric what you see here you can also
get<00:05:47.790> them<00:05:47.970> in<00:05:48.090> white<00:05:48.270> to<00:05:48.510> match<00:05:48.630> the<00:05:48.840> trim<00:05:48.960> we

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
get them in white to match the trim we

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.560 
get them in white to match the trim we
have<00:05:49.650> a<00:05:49.680> woodgrain<00:05:49.890> trim<00:05:50.190> as<00:05:50.400> well<00:05:50.430> okay<00:05:51.150> but

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
have a woodgrain trim as well okay but

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.330 
have a woodgrain trim as well okay but
essentially<00:05:52.230> the<00:05:52.350> it's<00:05:52.590> only<00:05:52.800> available<00:05:53.220> in

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
essentially the it's only available in

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.270 
essentially the it's only available in
this<00:05:53.460> kind<00:05:53.790> of<00:05:53.850> gray<00:05:54.180> color<00:05:54.450> right<00:05:54.720> now<00:05:54.900> right

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
this kind of gray color right now right

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.130 
this kind of gray color right now right
we've<00:05:56.280> this<00:05:56.850> is<00:05:56.910> a<00:05:57.060> polyolefin<00:05:57.330> and<00:05:57.840> the<00:05:57.900> color

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
we've this is a polyolefin and the color
