then I'll stop and it'll give a little
bit<00:03:20.060> it's<00:03:20.630> kind<00:03:21.080> of<00:03:21.170> annoying<00:03:21.800> really<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:22.820> so

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
bit it's kind of annoying really and so

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.840 
bit it's kind of annoying really and so
I<00:03:23.750> honestly<00:03:24.290> don't<00:03:24.590> attach<00:03:24.950> it<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.280> my<00:03:25.310> DSLR

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
I honestly don't attach it to my DSLR

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.479 
I honestly don't attach it to my DSLR
although<00:03:26.600> I<00:03:26.840> would<00:03:27.110> feel<00:03:27.320> comfortable<00:03:27.590> if<00:03:28.130> I

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
although I would feel comfortable if I

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.490 
although I would feel comfortable if I
really<00:03:28.730> cranked<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.390> on<00:03:29.540> there<00:03:29.840> that<00:03:30.260> it<00:03:30.380> would

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
really cranked it on there that it would

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.020 
really cranked it on there that it would
stay<00:03:30.709> on<00:03:30.739> there<00:03:31.100> however<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.610> don't<00:03:31.700> know<00:03:31.910> how

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
stay on there however I don't know how

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.150 
stay on there however I don't know how
long<00:03:32.209> those<00:03:32.330> threads<00:03:32.720> are<00:03:32.989> going<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.350> last<00:03:33.560> the

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
long those threads are going to last the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.180 
long those threads are going to last the
other<00:03:34.280> thing<00:03:34.580> is<00:03:34.820> that<00:03:35.440> this<00:03:36.440> knob<00:03:36.800> on<00:03:37.040> the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
other thing is that this knob on the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.550 
other thing is that this knob on the
side<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.670> tighten<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.269> adjustment<00:03:38.480> of<00:03:39.230> the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
side to tighten the adjustment of the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.490 
side to tighten the adjustment of the
angle<00:03:40.040> it's<00:03:40.610> also<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.209> little<00:03:41.450> bit<00:03:41.720> loose<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:42.200> a

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
angle it's also a little bit loose and a

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.680 
angle it's also a little bit loose and a
little<00:03:42.530> bit<00:03:42.970> flimsy<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.239> kind<00:03:44.450> of<00:03:44.540> get

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
little bit flimsy and you kind of get

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.050 
little bit flimsy and you kind of get
the<00:03:44.840> feeling<00:03:45.110> like<00:03:45.470> it's<00:03:46.190> going<00:03:46.519> to<00:03:46.610> just<00:03:46.820> kind

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
the feeling like it's going to just kind

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.180 
the feeling like it's going to just kind
of<00:03:47.150> fall<00:03:47.510> down<00:03:47.870> on<00:03:48.110> itself<00:03:48.530> every<00:03:48.830> once<00:03:49.010> in<00:03:49.100> a

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
of fall down on itself every once in a

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.699 
of fall down on itself every once in a
while<00:03:49.250> but<00:03:50.000> it<00:03:50.239> holds<00:03:50.480> up<00:03:50.750> just<00:03:51.050> fine<00:03:51.350> if<00:03:51.590> you

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
while but it holds up just fine if you

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.470 
while but it holds up just fine if you
tighten<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.130> on<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.550> you're<00:03:52.670> not<00:03:52.700> moving<00:03:53.090> with

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
tighten it on and you're not moving with

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.940 
tighten it on and you're not moving with
it<00:03:53.660> so<00:03:53.810> if<00:03:53.900> it's<00:03:53.989> on<00:03:54.050> a<00:03:54.110> light<00:03:54.350> stand<00:03:54.620> that's

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
it so if it's on a light stand that's

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.979 
it so if it's on a light stand that's
just<00:03:55.220> fine<00:03:55.459> I<00:03:55.730> don't<00:03:56.120> have<00:03:56.360> any<00:03:56.510> problem<00:03:56.870> with

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
just fine I don't have any problem with

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.509 
just fine I don't have any problem with
that<00:03:57.019> so<00:03:57.410> you<00:03:57.440> probably<00:03:57.650> want<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:57.920> see<00:03:58.070> what<00:03:58.400> it

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
that so you probably want to see what it

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.970 
that so you probably want to see what it
would<00:03:58.610> look<00:03:58.790> like<00:03:58.850> I<00:03:59.209> have<00:03:59.540> two<00:03:59.900> studio<00:04:00.709> lights

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
would look like I have two studio lights

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.009 
would look like I have two studio lights
going<00:04:01.370> here<00:04:01.700> and<00:04:01.820> those<00:04:02.209> are<00:04:02.360> also<00:04:02.510> balanced

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
going here and those are also balanced

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.090 
going here and those are also balanced
for<00:04:03.140> daylight<00:04:03.170> so<00:04:03.620> I'm<00:04:03.709> going<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.890> show<00:04:04.040> you

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
for daylight so I'm going to show you

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.250 
for daylight so I'm going to show you
what<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:04.700> would<00:04:04.880> look<00:04:05.030> like<00:04:05.090> if<00:04:05.480> just<00:04:05.690> this<00:04:05.870> one

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
what it would look like if just this one

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.170 
what it would look like if just this one
light<00:04:06.769> were<00:04:06.980> on<00:04:07.190> me<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.640> I'm<00:04:07.700> gonna<00:04:07.820> keep<00:04:08.060> it

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
light were on me and I'm gonna keep it

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.199 
light were on me and I'm gonna keep it
on<00:04:08.330> the<00:04:08.420> same<00:04:08.660> aperture<00:04:09.410> level<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.100> ISO<00:04:11.000> and

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
on the same aperture level and ISO and

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.660 
on the same aperture level and ISO and
everything<00:04:11.540> else<00:04:11.720> so<00:04:12.290> that<00:04:12.920> way<00:04:13.100> you<00:04:13.160> can<00:04:13.430> see

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
everything else so that way you can see

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.789 
everything else so that way you can see
what<00:04:14.120> just<00:04:14.570> this<00:04:14.750> light<00:04:14.959> would<00:04:15.140> look<00:04:15.320> like<00:04:15.530> at

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
what just this light would look like at

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.879 
what just this light would look like at
the<00:04:16.220> same<00:04:16.489> level<00:04:17.180> as<00:04:17.389> these<00:04:17.810> probably<00:04:18.739> around

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
the same level as these probably around

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.300 
the same level as these probably around
3<00:04:19.220> to<00:04:19.340> 400<00:04:19.910> watt<00:04:20.150> fluorescent

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
3 to 400 watt fluorescent

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.670 
3 to 400 watt fluorescent
studio<00:04:22.150> lights<00:04:22.420> will<00:04:22.600> give<00:04:22.750> me<00:04:22.930> so<00:04:23.290> here's<00:04:23.560> the

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
studio lights will give me so here's the

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.990 
studio lights will give me so here's the
light<00:04:23.830> with<00:04:24.040> no<00:04:24.190> other<00:04:24.340> lights<00:04:24.610> going<00:04:24.790> in<00:04:24.940> the

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
light with no other lights going in the

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.430 
light with no other lights going in the
room<00:04:25.180> it<00:04:25.360> is<00:04:25.390> completely<00:04:25.870> dark<00:04:26.050> in<00:04:26.200> here<00:04:26.290> I've

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
room it is completely dark in here I've

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.440 
room it is completely dark in here I've
just<00:04:26.590> got<00:04:26.740> this<00:04:26.890> one<00:04:27.100> light<00:04:27.340> going<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.910> you

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
just got this one light going and you

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.790 
just got this one light going and you
can<00:04:28.570> see<00:04:28.720> that<00:04:28.870> it's<00:04:28.960> very<00:04:29.140> bright<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.470> I<00:04:29.620> have

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
can see that it's very bright and I have

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.740 
can see that it's very bright and I have
it<00:04:29.890> in<00:04:29.980> frame<00:04:30.190> there<00:04:30.370> so<00:04:30.520> you<00:04:30.580> can<00:04:30.700> see<00:04:30.850> it<00:04:30.970> this

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
it in frame there so you can see it this

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.990 
it in frame there so you can see it this
is<00:04:31.930> at<00:04:32.050> its<00:04:32.230> highest<00:04:32.830> setting<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.580> one<00:04:33.760> thing

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
is at its highest setting the one thing

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.640 
is at its highest setting the one thing
that<00:04:34.420> you<00:04:34.630> do<00:04:34.720> have<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:34.930> worry<00:04:35.140> about<00:04:35.260> is<00:04:35.620> not

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
that you do have to worry about is not

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.490 
that you do have to worry about is not
to<00:04:36.460> blind<00:04:36.940> your<00:04:37.360> clients<00:04:37.840> or<00:04:37.930> your<00:04:37.960> subjects

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
to blind your clients or your subjects

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.050 
to blind your clients or your subjects
because<00:04:38.770> this<00:04:38.920> is<00:04:39.040> very<00:04:39.250> bright<00:04:39.550> coming<00:04:39.910> in<00:04:39.970> on

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
because this is very bright coming in on

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.490 
because this is very bright coming in on
my<00:04:40.150> face<00:04:40.360> however<00:04:40.960> it<00:04:41.080> does<00:04:41.200> have<00:04:41.350> that

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
my face however it does have that

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.350 
my face however it does have that
diffusion<00:04:41.800> on<00:04:42.010> there<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.820> creates<00:04:43.150> a

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
diffusion on there and it creates a

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.840 
diffusion on there and it creates a
little<00:04:43.690> bit<00:04:43.810> better<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.320> a<00:04:44.830> look<00:04:45.040> so<00:04:45.550> what's<00:04:45.730> my

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
little bit better of a look so what's my

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.120 
little bit better of a look so what's my
conclusion<00:04:46.390> my<00:04:46.750> conclusion<00:04:47.320> is<00:04:47.410> everybody

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
conclusion my conclusion is everybody

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.130 
conclusion my conclusion is everybody
needs<00:04:48.490> one<00:04:48.730> of<00:04:48.880> these<00:04:49.150> I<00:04:49.450> would<00:04:49.810> rate<00:04:49.990> this

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
needs one of these I would rate this

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.350
