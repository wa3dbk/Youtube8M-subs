a<00:01:27.770> lot<00:01:28.250> from<00:01:30.640> level<00:01:31.640> 99<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.240> of<00:01:32.360> course<00:01:32.600> the

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
a lot from level 99 and of course the

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.469 
a lot from level 99 and of course the
Gilgamesh<00:01:33.560> battle<00:01:34.130> I<00:01:34.790> bought<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.450> first

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
Gilgamesh battle I bought it the first

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.560 
Gilgamesh battle I bought it the first
time<00:01:35.960> they<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:37.550> know<00:01:37.670> they've<00:01:37.909> seen<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.479> then

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
time they you know they've seen and then

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.630 
time they you know they've seen and then
they<00:01:38.990> seen<00:01:39.260> it<00:01:39.440> stated<00:01:40.010> that<00:01:40.070> I've<00:01:40.220> used<00:01:40.369> mods

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
they seen it stated that I've used mods

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.469 
they seen it stated that I've used mods
and<00:01:41.920> pretty<00:01:42.920> much<00:01:43.100> made<00:01:43.369> a<00:01:43.400> big<00:01:43.640> deal<00:01:43.850> about<00:01:43.909> it

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
and pretty much made a big deal about it

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.780 
and pretty much made a big deal about it
it's<00:01:44.869> I<00:01:45.259> guess<00:01:45.680> it's<00:01:45.890> because<00:01:46.280> of<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.580> fact

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
it's I guess it's because of the fact

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.910 
it's I guess it's because of the fact
that<00:01:46.970> maybe<00:01:47.960> they<00:01:48.200> felt<00:01:48.440> like<00:01:48.560> they<00:01:48.740> got

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
that maybe they felt like they got

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.780 
that maybe they felt like they got
tricked<00:01:49.369> or<00:01:50.710> they<00:01:51.710> just<00:01:51.740> wasted<00:01:52.640> their<00:01:52.759> time

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
tricked or they just wasted their time

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.840 
tricked or they just wasted their time
watching<00:01:53.300> a<00:01:53.540> game<00:01:53.720> play<00:01:53.990> that<00:01:54.259> only<00:01:54.470> had<00:01:54.850> my

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
watching a game play that only had my

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
that was just pretty much an

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.650 
that was just pretty much an
experimental<00:02:03.649> battle<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.070> see<00:02:04.509> what<00:02:05.509> the

or
it's<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.200> beat<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.720> mean<00:03:12.720> think<00:03:13.020> about<00:03:13.080> it

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
it's the beat so I mean think about it

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.930 
it's the beat so I mean think about it
guys

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
guys

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.400 
guys
doesn't<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.000> sound<00:03:15.180> warm<00:03:15.570> an<00:03:15.690> experimental

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
doesn't it sound warm an experimental

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.630 
doesn't it sound warm an experimental
reason<00:03:16.710> I<00:03:17.100> mean<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:17.850> think<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.300> does<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.660> me

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
reason I mean I think it does to me

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.940 
reason I mean I think it does to me
because<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.850> didn't<00:03:21.090> even<00:03:21.210> use<00:03:21.270> any<00:03:21.950> device

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
because I didn't even use any device

because I didn't even use any device

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
much a top tire strategy in the entire

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.840
