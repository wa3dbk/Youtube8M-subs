yeah so when your duct tape spoken you

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.090 
yeah so when your duct tape spoken you
just<00:01:53.159> gotta<00:01:53.310> take<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.550> piece<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:55.100> and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
just gotta take a piece like this and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:05.719 
just gotta take a piece like this and
second<00:01:56.490> math<00:01:56.640> section<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:03.300> you<00:02:04.340> cuz<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.369> mean

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
second math section to you cuz I mean

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.589 
second math section to you cuz I mean
abductor<00:02:06.179> you<00:02:06.270> can't<00:02:06.569> fix<00:02:06.720> it<00:02:07.849> nothing<00:02:08.849> can<00:02:09.090> so

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
abductor you can't fix it nothing can so

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.479 
abductor you can't fix it nothing can so

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
I guess if it's wrapped by duct tape so

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.839 
I guess if it's wrapped by duct tape so
that's<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.819> everything<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.959> right<00:02:13.349> yeah
