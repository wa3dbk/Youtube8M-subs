00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:15.219
 we want here to the rider of the tri time or 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.219
 of perception 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.180
 and the last novelty 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.000
 we can not really speak lecointe 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.640
 adventurer and it's still a 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.310
 machine tourism and not follow people 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.890
 are they firm enough to hold 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.630
 the good by two speeds we have a good 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.920
 feeling the direction even though I 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.090
 noticed that at low speed 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.540
 she seems pretty heavy the machine is 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.540
 nerve 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.850
 races compared to the actual 1.2 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.850
 adventurer 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.210
 allows it to be agile and manageable 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.840
 there are numbers for the engine in 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.840
 the covers are 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.040
 what 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.930
 it's not with you 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.640
 though 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.640
 the machine remains weak 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.040
 it's easy to hands on you normand 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.040
 trÃ©lissac 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.549
 the way agent 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.950
 that's effective who gets the front or 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.710
 on the other hand, we hope to 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.890
 cut in worse 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.720
 we have 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.220
 after the TV 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.940
 but when the cross 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.940
 raised but good 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.700
 triton goes into gear and 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.600
 climbing engine for 2013 with his 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.909
 700th match 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.619
 a compact machine finally not too much 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.840
 impressive because taking over the basis of the 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.369
 400 us back out two years ago and 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.470
 as there is not even a mark for 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.420
 report his name and his cubic capacity he stands 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.190
 very discreet watch but in his den 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.700
 we find a powerful mono cylinder block 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.200
 of 686 cubic centimeters before 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.000
 to settle on board we linger 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.709
 easily on a host of details and 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.260
 of equipment that the newt 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.030
 it is the heating handles hitch 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.080
 is taking trailer walk in 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.640
 aluminum storage with usb socket 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.200
 petrol cap with sutra key without 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.640
 forget all the classic of a quad 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.070
 fighter at the level of the transmission 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.050
 with short box and long and walking 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.459
 back 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.830
 the front side with four lights 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.450
 lenticular reminiscent of the quads tgb and 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.440
 the rear is more original with 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.440
 beautiful led lights 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.209
 we note the generals carries package that 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.090
 also ensures the protection of 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.500
 bodywork we appreciate the bay 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.970
 instrumentation that does not fail 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.720
 to be complete and offer a good 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.670
 visibility 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.560
 the handlebar is protected by blocks 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.640
 steel square section that 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.440
 will withstand all possible shocks the 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.090
 transmission lever changes to hand 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.220
 left is the mode of transmission 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.260
 is done on the right handlebar so 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.630
 classic with push to go 4 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.269
 2 in 4 4 and rotation for blocking 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.980
 differential attention to the distracted ones because 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.320
 it's going to slow down and especially 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.420
 can start hold of the same for the 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.489
 parking brake located on the left hand and 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.260
 that we read easily 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.030
 the passenger was somewhat sacrificed 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.500
 silas it has an extension 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.360
 independent to offer and place 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.190
 goes down the steps raised feet are 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.079
 deported to the outside and imposes 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.799
 to open legs at nearly 180 degrees 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.609
 hard for adductors the boot 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.470
 but in the mood 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.060
 depending on whether the engine is bright but 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.920
 we feel 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.630
 immediately the force of the 4-stroke block 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.750
 in the hoarse sound and climbs 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.750
 in regime 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.819
 the power is there because we feel the 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.180
 triton bound and take off wheels 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.370
 before 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.870
 as soon as we open the gases in large numbers 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.909
 tracks and rolling with sectors 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.219
 stained look back face with efficiency 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.139
 rugged areas highlighting 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:01.200
 good suspensions and 4 wheels 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.200
 independent 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.709
 we are a little shaken but the trajectory 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.719
 is precise and controlled 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.489
 we are not far from the behavior 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:12.989
 of a sports quad while the newt 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.989
 still exceeds 300 kg 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.620
 the four disc brakes are there for 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.540
 stop the quad and be seduced 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.000
 by the pedal coupling which ensures a 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.620
 perfect distribution without blocking them 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.750
 athletes will find just a lack of 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.550
 biting 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.200
 under the tune of a super- equipped fighter 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.760
 hides finally a wriggling tripon 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.560
 which has nothing to envy to some 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.380
 athletes and offers the advantage of proposing 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.030
 different uses loopback 700 is so 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.390
 a success on this plane very well 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.440
 powered by this blog 700 injection 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.120
 we also appreciate the good 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.400
 integration of equipment and their 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.780
 number is not a maxi 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.880
 fighters as one might think 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.890
 but a super versatile that just has 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.550
 forgot to worry about the passenger and 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.550
 the consumption
