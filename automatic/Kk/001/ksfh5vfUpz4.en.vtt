00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
had a nice new coil on here and we

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.440 
had a nice new coil on here and we
monitored<00:00:42.809> using<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.500> original<00:00:44.450> lamination

up I wanted to show us to you points
that<00:01:12.900> went<00:01:13.290> into<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.650> are<00:01:14.840> ones<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.960> were

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
that went into this are ones that were

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.539 
that went into this are ones that were
chemically<00:01:17.189> cleaned<00:01:18.560> using<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.710> mixture<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.490> a

and<00:01:24.320> then<00:01:25.320> they<00:01:25.470> were<00:01:25.590> polished<00:01:26.119> and<00:01:27.409> rinsed

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
and then they were polished and rinsed

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.249 
and then they were polished and rinsed
and<00:01:29.210> worked<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.390> well<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.689> wanted<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.079> say

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
and worked really well I wanted to say

and worked really well I wanted to say
sparking<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.549> see<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.479> I'm

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
sparking this if you can see it and I'm

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.830 
sparking this if you can see it and I'm
just<00:01:33.630> turning<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.140> by<00:01:34.350> hand<00:01:34.759> it<00:01:35.759> goes<00:01:36.659> to

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
just turning this by hand it goes to

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.270 
just turning this by hand it goes to
show<00:01:37.079> if<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.259> get<00:01:37.740> really<00:01:37.950> used<00:01:38.070> together

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
show if you get really used together

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.149 
show if you get really used together
right<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.509> get<00:01:39.750> quite<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> heck<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.680> spark<00:01:41.100> to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
right you get quite a heck of a spark to

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.230 
right you get quite a heck of a spark to
have<00:01:41.369> an<00:01:41.460> old<00:01:41.610> point<00:01:42.890> magneto<00:01:43.890> system<00:01:44.430> that

okay<00:01:53.970> we<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:55.250> head<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.280> at<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.670> point

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
okay we get the head on at this point

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
okay we get the head on at this point
that<00:01:58.470> went<00:01:58.890> pretty<00:01:59.100> well

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
that went pretty well

that went pretty well
I<00:01:59.700> was<00:02:00.390> getting<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.700> as<00:02:02.700> far<00:02:02.970> as<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.180> head

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
I was getting that on as far as the head

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.660 
I was getting that on as far as the head
goes<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:05.009> gaskets<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.610> plays<00:02:06.110> torque<00:02:07.110> these

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
goes the gaskets in plays torque these

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
for the old McCulloch yellow so this

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.849 
for the old McCulloch yellow so this

we<00:04:08.860> modified<00:04:09.860> to<00:04:10.040> use<00:04:10.190> as<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.430> boost<00:04:10.700> port<00:04:11.030> feed

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
we modified to use as a boost port feed

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.830 
we modified to use as a boost port feed
so<00:04:12.740> it's<00:04:13.100> been<00:04:13.310> disabled<00:04:13.970> as<00:04:14.120> used<00:04:14.330> as<00:04:14.480> a<00:04:14.510> third

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
so it's been disabled as used as a third

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.050 
so it's been disabled as used as a third
point<00:04:15.080> so<00:04:15.530> we<00:04:16.190> don't<00:04:16.340> want<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.549> have<00:04:16.669> this<00:04:16.790> hole

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
point so we don't want to have this hole

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.080 
point so we don't want to have this hole
here<00:04:18.040> because<00:04:19.040> it<00:04:19.190> will<00:04:19.310> bypass<00:04:19.459> terrine

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
here because it will bypass terrine

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.000 
here because it will bypass terrine
valves<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:20.660> just<00:04:20.840> create<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:21.410> air<00:04:21.530> leak<00:04:21.769> in

valves and just create the air leak in
the<00:04:22.130> crankcase<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:23.660> you<00:04:24.260> can<00:04:24.440> see<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.830> doesn't

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
the crankcase so you can see it doesn't

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.310 
the crankcase so you can see it doesn't
seal<00:04:25.970> off<00:04:26.210> anymore<00:04:26.540> because<00:04:26.810> we<00:04:26.990> made<00:04:27.169> this

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
seal off anymore because we made this

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.570 
seal off anymore because we made this

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
cutout on the casting so I want to fill

cutout on the casting so I want to fill
this<00:04:31.610> in<00:04:32.000> I<00:04:32.300> guess<00:04:33.110> we<00:04:33.260> could<00:04:33.410> have<00:04:33.500> filled

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
this in I guess we could have filled

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.040 
this in I guess we could have filled
this<00:04:33.770> in<00:04:33.830> epoxy<00:04:34.340> you're<00:04:34.880> done<00:04:35.660> some<00:04:35.840> kind<00:04:35.990> of

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
this in epoxy you're done some kind of

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.700 
this in epoxy you're done some kind of
fabrication<00:04:36.590> work<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:37.130> it<00:04:37.280> but<00:04:38.440> one<00:04:39.440> thing<00:04:39.650> I

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
fabrication work to it but one thing I

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.990 
fabrication work to it but one thing I
wanted<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.100> do<00:04:40.160> is<00:04:40.250> get<00:04:40.400> a<00:04:40.430> little<00:04:40.520> more<00:04:40.700> read

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
wanted to do is get a little more read

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.420 
wanted to do is get a little more read
area<00:04:41.419> on<00:04:41.870> it<00:04:42.050> but<00:04:42.230> maintain<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.860> moat<00:04:43.040> the

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
area on it but maintain the moat the

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.580 
area on it but maintain the moat the
appearance<00:04:43.820> of<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.000> stock<00:04:44.300> motor<00:04:44.660> so<00:04:45.530> I

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
appearance of the stock motor so I

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.170 
appearance of the stock motor so I
wanted<00:04:45.890> to<00:04:45.950> use<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.160> stock<00:04:46.400> manifold<00:04:47.060> or

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
wanted to use the stock manifold or

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.310 
wanted to use the stock manifold or
something<00:04:47.480> look<00:04:47.720> like<00:04:47.750> it

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
something look like it

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.400 
something look like it
so<00:04:49.210> what<00:04:50.860> decide<00:04:51.860> was<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.340> do<00:04:52.490> a<00:04:52.600> make<00:04:53.600> a<00:04:53.870> replay

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
so what decide was to do a make a replay

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.960 
so what decide was to do a make a replay
that<00:04:54.620> doesn't<00:04:54.860> have<00:04:55.010> the<00:04:55.160> third<00:04:55.340> port<00:04:55.610> opening

used<00:05:05.960> a<00:05:06.080> reed<00:05:06.350> pedal<00:05:07.210> stumbly<00:05:08.240> from<00:05:08.660> a<00:05:08.810> MC<00:05:09.770> 49e

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
used a reed pedal stumbly from a MC 49e

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.600 
used a reed pedal stumbly from a MC 49e
now<00:05:11.210> that<00:05:11.450> engine<00:05:11.900> had<00:05:12.050> a<00:05:12.100> much<00:05:13.100> more<00:05:13.130> read

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
now that engine had a much more read

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.060 
now that engine had a much more read
area<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.320> you<00:05:15.320> can<00:05:15.440> see<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:15.710> difference

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
area and you can see the difference

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.420 
area and you can see the difference
there<00:05:16.250> in<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.370> opening<00:05:16.700> it's<00:05:16.850> about<00:05:17.290> 30%<00:05:18.290> more

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
there in the opening it's about 30% more

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.870 
there in the opening it's about 30% more
width<00:05:19.430> at<00:05:19.640> the<00:05:19.669> reed<00:05:19.940> tip<00:05:20.500> more<00:05:21.500> speed<00:05:21.800> area<00:05:22.100> so

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
width at the reed tip more speed area so

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.640 
width at the reed tip more speed area so
I<00:05:22.910> should<00:05:23.180> have<00:05:23.270> much<00:05:23.510> better<00:05:23.720> performance<00:05:24.140> so

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
I should have much better performance so

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.100 
I should have much better performance so
we<00:05:25.190> get<00:05:25.310> a<00:05:25.340> 49<00:05:26.950> Reed<00:05:27.950> pedal<00:05:28.400> and<00:05:28.970> Reed<00:05:29.660> guard<00:05:29.960> in

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
we get a 49 Reed pedal and Reed guard in

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.530 
we get a 49 Reed pedal and Reed guard in
here<00:05:30.320> and<00:05:31.300> it'll<00:05:32.300> bolt<00:05:32.540> up<00:05:32.750> just<00:05:33.680> like<00:05:33.890> that

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
here and it'll bolt up just like that

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.180 
here and it'll bolt up just like that
with<00:05:35.540> a<00:05:35.600> gasket<00:05:35.840> underneath<00:05:36.380> of<00:05:36.560> course<00:05:36.770> and

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
with a gasket underneath of course and

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.969 
with a gasket underneath of course and
we<00:05:37.460> had<00:05:37.550> a<00:05:37.580> custom<00:05:38.180> custom<00:05:38.510> caskets<00:05:38.630> and<00:05:39.140> then

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
we had a custom custom caskets and then

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.980 
we had a custom custom caskets and then
the<00:05:40.220> manifold<00:05:40.940> sits<00:05:41.180> on<00:05:41.300> top<00:05:41.479> of<00:05:41.690> that<00:05:41.780> with

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
the manifold sits on top of that with

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.500 
the manifold sits on top of that with
another<00:05:42.200> gasket<00:05:42.640> so<00:05:43.640> it's<00:05:43.940> fun<00:05:44.120> will<00:05:44.300> look

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
another gasket so it's fun will look

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.210 
another gasket so it's fun will look
like<00:05:44.660> that<00:05:44.900> just<00:05:45.140> like<00:05:45.289> a<00:05:45.350> nice<00:05:45.560> stock<00:05:45.890> motor

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
like that just like a nice stock motor

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.090 
like that just like a nice stock motor
but<00:05:47.050> okay<00:05:48.050> we've<00:05:48.229> finished<00:05:48.380> up<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:48.770> final

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
but okay we've finished up the final

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.749 
but okay we've finished up the final
