00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
there's a big dark door in here I want

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.820 
there's a big dark door in here I want
to<00:00:02.639> put<00:00:02.850> in<00:00:03.060> I<00:00:03.270> also<00:00:03.990> think<00:00:04.440> this<00:00:04.620> should<00:00:04.770> be

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
to put in I also think this should be

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.260 
to put in I also think this should be
darker<00:00:05.400> so<00:00:05.430> I'm<00:00:05.609> going<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.850> make<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.240> a

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
darker so I'm going to make that a

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.509 
darker so I'm going to make that a
little<00:00:06.480> bit<00:00:06.720> darker<00:00:07.230> so<00:00:07.919> we'll<00:00:08.099> come<00:00:08.250> in<00:00:08.370> there

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
little bit darker so we'll come in there

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:16.039 
little bit darker so we'll come in there
with<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:10.130> glaze<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.809> altar<00:00:12.809> marine<00:00:13.940> darker<00:00:15.049> to

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
with a glaze of altar marine darker to

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.179 
with a glaze of altar marine darker to
emphasize<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.369> shadow<00:00:17.910> shape<00:00:18.920> not<00:00:19.920> dark

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
emphasize this shadow shape not dark

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.390 
emphasize this shadow shape not dark
enough<00:00:20.310> yet<00:00:21.710> maybe<00:00:22.710> I'll<00:00:22.890> get<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.070> little<00:00:23.130> bit

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
enough yet maybe I'll get a little bit

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.970 
enough yet maybe I'll get a little bit
of<00:00:23.600> Prussian<00:00:24.600> into<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.050> as<00:00:25.260> well<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:29.869> then

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
of Prussian into that as well and then

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.709 
of Prussian into that as well and then
bang<00:00:31.980> out<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.399> brush<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.329> sort<00:00:33.600> of

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
bang out the brush and we can sort of

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.290 
bang out the brush and we can sort of
give<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.739> brush-off<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> speak<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.180> it

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
give it the brush-off so to speak so it

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.540 
give it the brush-off so to speak so it
doesn't<00:00:36.630> make<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> whole<00:00:37.050> new<00:00:37.290> shape<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:38.280> now

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
doesn't make a whole new shape it's now

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.779 
doesn't make a whole new shape it's now
emphasizing<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.540> point<00:00:40.320> right<00:00:40.559> there<00:00:40.620> no<00:00:41.840> I

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
emphasizing a point right there no I

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.330 
emphasizing a point right there no I
think<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.239> could<00:00:45.480> put<00:00:45.660> another<00:00:45.860> glaze<00:00:46.860> down

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
think I could put another glaze down

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.760 
think I could put another glaze down
over<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.030> whole<00:00:48.329> area<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:51.230> let's<00:00:52.230> clear<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
over this whole area so let's clear the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.240 
over this whole area so let's clear the
deck<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> palate<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> little<00:00:53.820> bit<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:55.890> then

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
deck on the palate a little bit and then

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.090 
deck on the palate a little bit and then
I'm<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.840> go<00:00:57.840> after<00:00:58.109> some<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
I'm going to go after some of the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.080 
I'm going to go after some of the

noodling I was going to put a glaze over

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.630 
noodling I was going to put a glaze over
part<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.790> over<00:01:18.090> here<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.659> let's<00:01:19.259> take<00:01:19.640> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
part of this over here so let's take the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.280 
part of this over here so let's take the
Rose<00:01:20.850> madder<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.310> cobalt<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:25.820> make<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
Rose madder and the cobalt and make a

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.069 
Rose madder and the cobalt and make a
glaze<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:30.680> violet<00:01:31.820> which<00:01:32.820> may<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.360> related<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
glaze of violet which may be related to

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.249 
glaze of violet which may be related to
what's<00:01:34.350> above<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.829> there<00:01:35.600> see<00:01:36.600> since<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.049> and

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
what's above it there see since this and

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.899 
what's above it there see since this and
this<00:01:37.350> are<00:01:37.530> almost<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> same<00:01:38.070> value<00:01:38.670> maybe

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
this are almost the same value maybe

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.899 
this are almost the same value maybe
this<00:01:39.150> should<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.329> made<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> darker<00:01:40.140> value

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
this should be made a darker value

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.340 
this should be made a darker value
anyway

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
kind of fun this stands out as being

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.830 
kind of fun this stands out as being
unnecessarily<00:02:16.200> bright<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:18.340> let's<00:02:18.670> just<00:02:18.940> tone

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
unnecessarily bright so let's just tone

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.590 
unnecessarily bright so let's just tone
that<00:02:20.170> down<00:02:20.200> with<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:22.920> pink<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:25.090> let's<00:02:25.360> let's

run<00:02:25.840> here<00:02:26.230> we<00:02:26.290> go<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:26.620> was<00:02:26.890> going<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.250> run<00:02:27.370> that

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
run here we go I was going to run that

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.920 
run here we go I was going to run that
glaze<00:02:27.760> over<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> whole<00:02:28.270> area<00:02:28.300> but<00:02:28.630> let's<00:02:28.780> just

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
glaze over the whole area but let's just

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.920 
glaze over the whole area but let's just
limit<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.770> to<00:02:29.830> that<00:02:30.100> one<00:02:30.280> area<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:30.880> as<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.840> know

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
limit it to that one area so as you know

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.960 
limit it to that one area so as you know
that's<00:02:32.410> an<00:02:32.590> awning<00:02:33.010> later<00:02:33.220> we'll<00:02:33.430> put<00:02:33.610> stripes

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
that's an awning later we'll put stripes

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.120 
that's an awning later we'll put stripes
