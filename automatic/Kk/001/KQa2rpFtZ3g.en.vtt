00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 the circle of trust on one 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.910
 page cheers for a strong match 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.379
 on the other side in the top game 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.440
 the first handball Bundesliga 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.929
 at the end of the thw keel with 29 32 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.179
 flensburg hunter survives and remains 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.830
 number one because the team of coaches 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.859
 alfred gies the berlin error 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.359
 mostly cold punished the have to 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.099
 one side always the right sound to 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.660
 right time we are done 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.150
 not really, they are hard to get 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.150
 yes, the same time with 536 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.950
 hard went here once again so what 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.710
 catch up 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.360
 we gave everything I have to 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.820
 say as much as we do 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.430
 reasonably good and not easy yet 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.840
 good mood in front of 10,000 spectators in 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.329
 the max-schmeling-hall and first 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.420
 big jubilee contract extension with 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.500
 the massa manager bob hanning up 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.020
 2018 is announced 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.390
 in the beginning phase of the game 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.129
 initially constantin igropulo double 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.230
 but with the foxes sneaking 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.989
 first lack of concentration 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.210
 that the sprenger meets here for 2 2 4 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.860
 for the reigning double winner with the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.479
 right stays off even after the action 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.550
 concentrated conquers the ball 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.710
 immediately back 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.510
 despite ever increasing keelers the 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.770
 Foxes initially stay within striking distance 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.300
 jesper nielsen with the four added 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.710
 in the team the berliner always takes over 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.690
 again the play designer the 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.650
 responsibility bartolomej jaszka with 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.420
 a nice goal for 6 to 9 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.220
 but the zebras stay in every phase 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.750
 the lot was masterfully left many 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.870
 kicker rises higher than the berliners 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.700
 cover in this scene at the 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.200
 Kiel band works very well while the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.000
 win the north German and over the 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.920
 Where do I go where I yes 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.030
 increase the kieler take off to twelve 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.030
 after 20 minutes 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.230
 in the middle of the night it goes despite this 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.820
 worth seeing of matthias 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.150
 Addison with a six-goal residue 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.920
 12 to 18 for the guests in the second 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.480
 pass the foxes four 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.750
 at the beginning on the additional sentences 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.210
 field player first with success but as 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.940
 keiels goalkeeper andreas palicka for 15 to 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.900
 24 matches the game almost seems 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.900
 to have run 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.849
 619 and one game was against keel 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.950
 is a soon to be that was that was already 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.310
 clear back but only to the end 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.310
 fought 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.879
 but he also knew a lot that me 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.370
 already that I am already time 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.409
 worked and not so much 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.409
 struggled and so much running work and being 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.329
 - at the end we were still missing relatively well 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.609
 because we already - was nine 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.590
 but the foxes fight again 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.810
 also thanks to the hits of Fabian 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.129
 the carefree one plays on and 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.519
 ultimately three times in the 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.959
 can enter scorer 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.120
 I think it's good that no 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.280
 thought just silences as he can 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.500
 and I guess this one is also on 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.269
 best the more offensive cover zefix in 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.889
 the closing minutes brings in profits 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.659
 but ultimately the mortgage is from 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:12.000
 sometimes new arrivals came to a standstill 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:15.269
 high the thw keel wins at the end completely 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.669
 deserves the point game delhi so 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.879
 Strong team with so much experience 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:22.949
 who despite the defeat against 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.659
 kiel a victory on wednesday to totally in 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.699
 hildesheim and next sunday 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.620
 home against melsungen and then it would be 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.889
 but a nice Christmas party for the 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.889
 foxes
