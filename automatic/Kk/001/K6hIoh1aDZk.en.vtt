00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.250
 the getafe walks firm in the pepe league 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.800
 the azulón team aspires this season to 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.420
 reach a European place the good 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.920
 performance of the team from the south of the 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.110
 Community of Madrid is due to many 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.410
 factors although one of the determinants 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.630
 is abdel barrada to find accommodation 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.849
 in elite football barred he had to 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.290
 leave your city Paris and the one that had 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.150
 been his training club up 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.710
 land in the coliseum alfonso pérez 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.710
 the paris saint germain go 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.240
 I entered the cathedral of Paris 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.780
 when I was 18 years old and I've done three 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.780
 Seasons 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.990
 everything has gone very well but in the end 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.530
 have changed from the coach with the first 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.880
 team and he did not want me and had to 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.880
 change club 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.980
 I do not remember, but it's the same 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.340
 what I cried at the end when when 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.460
 they told me they did not want me for the 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.640
 first I can cried 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.400
 but then they looked at everything and how 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.960
 we see everyone reacted here in getafe 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.750
 It's true that I'm happy with myself 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.460
 had to pack when the 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.740
 doors of professionalism were opened 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.990
 and started looking for equipment like almost 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.380
 always when the end ends up being 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.210
 happy 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.040
 chance played a decisive role 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.130
 so that bar to find your new 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.130
 destination 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.610
 I came here with a bit of luck 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.810
 because I met a boy here who has 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.939
 proposed call of 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.940
 to come pass a test with him with the 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.220
 subsidiary 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.000
 and I miss him and everything has gone well and 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.430
 end they have fallen ill a year 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.700
 and external with the subsidiary also everything is 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.610
 it has gone well and toni muñoz special 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.260
 towers that have signed on the proposed 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.260
 three years I think in the first team 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.830
 the getafe subsidiary was very 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.480
 soon small barred in his second 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.130
 season at club azulón the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.770
 Moroccan playmaker made the leap to 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.930
 first team debuted in August 2011 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.490
 against the Levante in the coliseum and it 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.890
 was definitely in the template 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.270
 professional thanks in large part to the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.380
 confidence that has always given him his 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.380
 trainer luis garcía plaza 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.010
 is someone very important in me in my 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.050
 career in my life 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.490
 with the 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.760
 I have grown a lot and have had a lot and 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.730
 is someone called who has given me 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.130
 a lot of confidence when starting to 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.590
 become the team and I have to give 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.000
 thank you 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.640
 abroad 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.930
 beyond the support of coach abdel 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.750
 Barrada found a fundamental support 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.970
 in a partner in Tunisian medhí lacen 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.600
 helped him land on the first team 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.600
 of getafe 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.060
 when you arrive in a country and not with that 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:41.690
 language is a bit difficult to know and when 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.850
 when 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.180
 when when you arrive with the first 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.180
 team 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:54.020
 I was in Spain for a year only then 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.950
 di maya has helped a lot and in the end 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.840
 everything has gone well 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.970
 Barradas always had a mirror in the 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.900
 to look and brightens the face 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.900
 talk about your soccer idol 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.959
 zinedine zidane no doubt 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.260
 for me it is the best in the world of 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.000
 history 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.459
 from small the figs 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.820
 I would like to one day see him here 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.820
 Madrid 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.460
 of all the matches he has played 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:37.080
 to date in the league acb remember 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.080
 with special love one of them 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.000
 against madrid here at home is true 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.479
 that Madrid will win is something special and 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.039
 also when you check if you were a 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.039
 assistance to a companion 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.230
 Being very comfortable is very special 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:02.500
 then it is something that 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:05.730
 and that he would stay for life in 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.730
 my head wants 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.700
 there is the father 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.689
 now that football smiles at you 

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:35.400
 made a dent in professionalism and 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:36.599
 that sounds to be part of clubs 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.819
 very high European level 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.469
 abdel barrada keeps remembering and giving 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.370
 thanks to those who have protected their 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:43.370
 career since small 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.630
 it's my 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.060
 my older brother 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.030
 he is my second father because he has 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.390
 carried in all the places when 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.390
 I was in Paris 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:08.360
 and when when I do something good in the 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:11.240
 field always think of him all that 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.249
 I've done so far it's thanks to him and 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.809
 I always tell him 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:17.299
 abdel barrada has a future 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:19.099
 bright and dreams in the short term with 

00:06:17.299 --> 00:06:21.369
 sign a historic season with the 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.369
 Getafe
