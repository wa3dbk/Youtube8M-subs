do just nice oil off the wheels before I

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.770 
do just nice oil off the wheels before I
do<00:02:36.319> anything

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
do anything

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.080 
do anything
it's<00:02:38.780> got<00:02:39.019> like<00:02:39.459> well<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.489> liked<00:02:40.700> about<00:02:40.790> the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
it's got like well I liked about the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.490 
it's got like well I liked about the
whole<00:02:41.269> overall<00:02:41.840> height<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.230> thing<00:02:42.440> I

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
whole overall height of the thing I

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.740 
whole overall height of the thing I
think<00:02:42.560> was<00:02:42.769> five<00:02:42.950> inches<00:02:43.160> tall<00:02:43.550> and<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:44.540> had

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
think was five inches tall and it had

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.809 
think was five inches tall and it had
two<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.080> a<00:02:45.110> half<00:02:45.290> inches<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.709> clearance<00:02:45.739> on<00:02:46.280> it

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
two and a half inches of clearance on it

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.820 
two and a half inches of clearance on it
so<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:47.720> kind<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:47.930> gives<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.380> little<00:02:48.530> bit<00:02:48.709> of

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
so it kind of gives it a little bit of

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.670 
so it kind of gives it a little bit of
best<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.160> both<00:02:49.310> worlds<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.170> tires<00:02:51.440> aren't

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
best of both worlds and the tires aren't

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.550 
best of both worlds and the tires aren't
those<00:02:51.799> regular<00:02:52.160> metal<00:02:52.310> creeper<00:02:52.880> tires

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
those regular metal creeper tires

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.940 
those regular metal creeper tires
they're<00:02:54.560> more<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.100> like<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.310> regular<00:02:56.060> caster<00:02:56.950> so

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
they're more of like a regular caster so

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.250 
they're more of like a regular caster so
they<00:02:58.310> won't<00:02:58.459> get<00:02:58.610> stuck<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.150> GM<00:02:59.840> up<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:00.170> not
