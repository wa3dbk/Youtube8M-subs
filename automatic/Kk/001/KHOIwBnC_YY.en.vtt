00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
going to do a couple of curls here I'm

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.149 
going to do a couple of curls here I'm
using<00:01:23.150> what's<00:01:23.509> called<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:23.840> Marcel<00:01:24.650> iron<00:01:24.920> it

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
using what's called a Marcel iron it

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.289 
using what's called a Marcel iron it
doesn't<00:01:25.850> have<00:01:25.970> a<00:01:26.799> spring<00:01:27.799> held<00:01:28.149> handle<00:01:29.149> you

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
doesn't have a spring held handle you

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.060 
doesn't have a spring held handle you
have<00:01:29.479> to<00:01:29.690> actually<00:01:30.049> hold<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.649> handle<00:01:30.950> with

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
have to actually hold the handle with

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.120 
have to actually hold the handle with
your<00:01:31.220> hand<00:01:31.430> but<00:01:31.549> it<00:01:31.670> has<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:34.450> rotating<00:01:36.130> handle

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
your hand but it has a a rotating handle

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.249 
your hand but it has a a rotating handle
and<00:01:37.549> it<00:01:38.000> kind<00:01:38.659> of<00:01:39.280> makes<00:01:40.280> for<00:01:40.460> faster<00:01:41.259> curling

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
and it kind of makes for faster curling

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.520 
and it kind of makes for faster curling
iron<00:01:43.539> usage<00:01:44.539> so<00:01:44.810> in<00:01:44.899> our<00:01:44.990> case<00:01:45.049> we're<00:01:45.380> just

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
iron usage so in our case we're just

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.080 
iron usage so in our case we're just
going<00:01:45.649> to<00:01:45.710> sort<00:01:45.950> of<00:01:46.069> finger<00:01:46.520> style<00:01:46.819> her<00:01:47.060> hair

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
and as you can see that's a knight

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:59.020 
and as you can see that's a knight
