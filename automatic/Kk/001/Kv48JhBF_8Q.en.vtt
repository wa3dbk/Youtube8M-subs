in<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.350> tutorial<00:00:01.589> I'm<00:00:02.190> going<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.490> show<00:00:02.669> you

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
in this tutorial I'm going to show you

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.059 
in this tutorial I'm going to show you
how<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.090> rotate<00:00:03.659> an<00:00:03.840> object<00:00:03.929> using<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.710> motion

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
how to rotate an object using a motion

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.780 
how to rotate an object using a motion
tween<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:06.319> have<00:00:07.319> two<00:00:07.500> layers<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.950> left<00:00:08.309> cog<00:00:08.519> layer

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
tween I have two layers a left cog layer

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.129 
tween I have two layers a left cog layer
and<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.420> right<00:00:09.690> cog<00:00:10.019> layer<00:00:10.290> if<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.400> click<00:00:11.639> on<00:00:11.670> to

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
and a right cog layer if I click on to

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.430 
and a right cog layer if I click on to
frame<00:00:13.139> one<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.250> left<00:00:14.519> cog<00:00:14.759> layer<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.440> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
frame one of the left cog layer on the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.740 
frame one of the left cog layer on the
right<00:00:16.619> hand<00:00:16.920> side<00:00:17.010> I've<00:00:17.580> already<00:00:18.029> imported<00:00:18.390> a

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
right hand side I've already imported a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.900 
right hand side I've already imported a
picture<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.320> wheel<00:00:19.529> cog<00:00:19.830> into<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.430> library

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
picture of a wheel cog into the library

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.390 
picture of a wheel cog into the library
so<00:00:21.750> I'm<00:00:21.810> going<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.080> select<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.949> drag<00:00:23.250> it

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
so I'm going to select that and drag it

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.050 
so I'm going to select that and drag it
onto<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.670> left-hand<00:00:24.060> side<00:00:25.550> and<00:00:26.550> then<00:00:26.730> going

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
onto the left-hand side and then going

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.570 
onto the left-hand side and then going
to<00:00:27.180> go<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.689> right<00:00:27.960> cog<00:00:28.230> layer<00:00:28.529> click<00:00:29.189> onto

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
to go to the right cog layer click onto

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.770 
to go to the right cog layer click onto
frame<00:00:29.820> 1<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:31.610> then<00:00:32.610> drag<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.059> drop<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.540> same

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
frame 1 and then drag and drop the same

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.420 
frame 1 and then drag and drop the same
image<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> right<00:00:35.309> hand<00:00:35.550> side<00:00:37.309> and<00:00:38.309> I'm

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
image but on the right hand side and I'm

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.889 
image but on the right hand side and I'm
going<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.700> just<00:00:38.910> try<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> move<00:00:39.480> them<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.750> bit

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
going to just try to move them a bit

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:52.060 
going to just try to move them a bit
closer<00:00:40.200> together

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.330 

now<00:00:52.700> I'm<00:00:52.760> going<00:00:52.940> to<00:00:53.000> go<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.180> frame<00:00:53.480> 40<00:00:54.230> on<00:00:54.500> the

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
now I'm going to go to frame 40 on the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.310 
now I'm going to go to frame 40 on the
left<00:00:55.580> Cobb<00:00:55.820> layer<00:00:56.320> press<00:00:57.320> f6<00:00:57.920> on<00:00:58.340> the<00:00:58.550> keyboard

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
left Cobb layer press f6 on the keyboard

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.690 
left Cobb layer press f6 on the keyboard
and<00:01:00.320> I'm<00:01:00.410> going<00:01:00.560> to<00:01:00.590> do<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.800> same<00:01:01.100> thing<00:01:01.460> for

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
and I'm going to do the same thing for

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.240 
and I'm going to do the same thing for
the<00:01:01.790> right<00:01:01.940> cog<00:01:02.240> layer<00:01:02.740> this<00:01:03.740> will<00:01:03.950> ensure

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
the right cog layer this will ensure

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.270 
the right cog layer this will ensure
that<00:01:04.400> both<00:01:04.550> images<00:01:05.120> can<00:01:05.330> be<00:01:05.360> seen<00:01:05.780> across<00:01:06.650> all

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
that both images can be seen across all

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.170 
that both images can be seen across all
of<00:01:07.580> these<00:01:07.730> frames<00:01:08.090> from<00:01:08.420> frame<00:01:08.660> 1<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:09.080> frame<00:01:09.170> 40

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
of these frames from frame 1 to frame 40

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.870 
of these frames from frame 1 to frame 40
now<00:01:11.180> we<00:01:11.240> need<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:12.050> insert<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:12.710> motion<00:01:13.340> tween<00:01:13.490> so

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
now we need to insert a motion tween so

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.270 
now we need to insert a motion tween so
go<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.510> the<00:01:14.960> bottom<00:01:15.260> of<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.590> screen<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.100> click

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
go to the bottom of the screen and click

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.550 
go to the bottom of the screen and click
on<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.610> small<00:01:16.880> triangle<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:17.750> show<00:01:18.410> you<00:01:18.470> the

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
on the small triangle to show you the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.270 
on the small triangle to show you the
properties<00:01:19.360> now<00:01:20.360> this<00:01:20.510> is<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.750> left<00:01:21.050> cog<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.220> I

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
properties now this is the left cog so I

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.350 
properties now this is the left cog so I
want<00:01:22.490> this<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.820> move<00:01:24.640> with<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.670> motion<00:01:26.150> tween

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
want this to move with a motion tween

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.870 
want this to move with a motion tween
and<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:27.229> want<00:01:27.410> it<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.650> move<00:01:27.860> clockwise<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:28.790> I'm

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
and I want it to move clockwise so I'm

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.150 
and I want it to move clockwise so I'm
going<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:29.119> leave<00:01:29.360> it<00:01:29.540> on<00:01:29.660> CW<00:01:30.590> where<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:30.979> says

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
going to leave it on CW where it says

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.050 
going to leave it on CW where it says
rotate<00:01:32.800> then<00:01:33.800> I'm<00:01:33.920> going<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.160> click<00:01:34.520> on<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.940> the

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
rotate then I'm going to click on to the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.760 
rotate then I'm going to click on to the
