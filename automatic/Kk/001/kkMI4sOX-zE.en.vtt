up<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.390> throttle<00:00:57.390> linkage<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:58.140> this

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
up to the throttle linkage on this

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.069 
up to the throttle linkage on this
carburetor<00:00:59.190> but<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.300> one's<00:01:00.480> been<00:01:00.660> modified

carburetor but this one's been modified
to<00:01:01.129> just<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.840> adjustable<00:01:03.840> throttle<00:01:04.290> here

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
to just have a adjustable throttle here

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.429 
to just have a adjustable throttle here
and<00:01:04.760> it<00:01:05.760> also<00:01:05.909> makes<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.299> easier<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.810> control

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
and it also makes it easier to control

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.609 
and it also makes it easier to control
it<00:01:07.680> if<00:01:08.100> you're<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:08.430> displaying<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:08.939> engine

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.320 

so<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.680> know<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.010> said<00:01:14.220> its<00:01:14.369> side<00:01:15.090> valve

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
so you know like I said its side valve
