00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.349
 due to the rapid development of digital 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.570
 music for me those bye 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.900
 and the laptop becomes an integral part 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.140
 and even the basis of the hi fi system however 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.570
 these devices are not without flaws 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.820
 low quality sound cards and g3 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.400
 adversely affect replicated

 sound quality cambridge company 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.120
 audio developed an azur 651 amplifier 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.460
 and the device is equipped with a yuzbi connector 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.710
 which allows you to directly connect 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.100
 computer or laptop with an amplifier and 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.980
 enjoy excellent sound however

 and is intended not only to work with 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.050
 until it becomes a great component for 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.690
 sit tuner player or vinyl

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.729
 music is absolutely fascinating 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.220
 cambridge audio states that 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.830
 these are not just empty advertising words for 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.119
 achieve this result in an amplifier 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.939
 were used only 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.640
 high quality components that 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.040
 really improve the sound quality in

 what is currently one of 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.880
