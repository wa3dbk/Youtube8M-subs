Photoshop<00:00:14.710> so<00:00:15.370> let's<00:00:15.610> get<00:00:15.820> started<00:00:16.209> let's

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
Photoshop so let's get started let's

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.380 
Photoshop so let's get started let's
create<00:00:17.140> a<00:00:17.320> new<00:00:17.740> document<00:00:17.950> with<00:00:18.880> your<00:00:19.029> favorite

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
create a new document with your favorite

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.190 
create a new document with your favorite
size<00:00:19.660> because<00:00:20.170> size<00:00:20.500> doesn't<00:00:20.830> matter<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:22.810> this

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
size because size doesn't matter on this

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.190 
size because size doesn't matter on this
tip<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:24.009> strip<00:00:24.279> so<00:00:25.270> I<00:00:25.300> have<00:00:25.450> created<00:00:25.840> a<00:00:25.899> new

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
tip the strip so I have created a new

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.249 
tip the strip so I have created a new
document<00:00:26.399> then<00:00:27.399> go<00:00:27.730> to<00:00:27.790> window<00:00:28.270> timeline<00:00:28.930> to

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
document then go to window timeline to

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.729 
document then go to window timeline to
enable<00:00:29.649> that<00:00:29.680> timeline<00:00:30.460> panel<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:32.590> create

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
enable that timeline panel to create

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.650 
enable that timeline panel to create
frames<00:00:33.250> for<00:00:33.610> animation<00:00:34.210> so<00:00:35.079> now<00:00:35.290> we<00:00:35.350> have<00:00:35.860> that

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
frames for animation so now we have that

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.040 
frames for animation so now we have that
document<00:00:37.660> background<00:00:38.140> layer<00:00:38.560> and<00:00:39.090> a-15<00:00:40.090> that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
document background layer and a-15 that

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.520 
document background layer and a-15 that
one<00:00:41.260> frame<00:00:41.580> so<00:00:42.580> now<00:00:42.880> I'm<00:00:43.180> going<00:00:43.540> to<00:00:43.690> create<00:00:44.290> a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
one frame so now I'm going to create a

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.680 
one frame so now I'm going to create a
text<00:00:45.010> fade<00:00:45.370> in<00:00:45.520> and<00:00:45.640> fade<00:00:45.730> animation<00:00:46.120> because

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
text fade in and fade animation because

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.040 
text fade in and fade animation because
you<00:00:47.140> can<00:00:47.290> also<00:00:47.500> use<00:00:47.890> this<00:00:48.070> technique<00:00:48.370> to

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
you can also use this technique to

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.790 
you can also use this technique to
images<00:00:50.050> as<00:00:50.230> well<00:00:50.620> so<00:00:51.400> now<00:00:51.610> I'm<00:00:51.820> going<00:00:52.090> to<00:00:52.210> type

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
images as well so now I'm going to type

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.850 
images as well so now I'm going to type
text<00:00:55.500> at<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.550> next<00:00:57.790> sample<00:00:58.410> then<00:00:59.410> as<00:00:59.620> you<00:00:59.739> can

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
text at the next sample then as you can

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.670 
text at the next sample then as you can
see<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.880> text<00:01:01.210> layer<00:01:01.390> is<00:01:01.690> enabled<00:01:02.470> on<00:01:02.620> the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
see the text layer is enabled on the

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.249 
see the text layer is enabled on the
first<00:01:03.100> frame<00:01:03.370> so<00:01:04.180> I<00:01:04.449> don't<00:01:04.689> want<00:01:04.899> that<00:01:05.079> because

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
first frame so I don't want that because

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.980 
first frame so I don't want that because
I<00:01:05.560> need<00:01:05.619> to<00:01:05.740> create<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.189> fade<00:01:06.549> in<00:01:06.790> effect<00:01:07.030> so<00:01:07.960> I

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
I need to create a fade in effect so I

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.990 
I need to create a fade in effect so I
hide<00:01:08.860> that<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:10.659> click<00:01:10.960> new<00:01:11.290> then<00:01:11.530> and<00:01:12.490> hide

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
hide that then click new then and hide

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.870 
hide that then click new then and hide
it<00:01:13.240> so<00:01:13.930> on<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.380> first<00:01:14.530> frame<00:01:14.860> there<00:01:15.460> is<00:01:15.580> no

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
it so on the first frame there is no

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.390 
it so on the first frame there is no
text<00:01:16.210> layer<00:01:16.390> second<00:01:17.350> layer<00:01:17.440> there<00:01:17.860> is<00:01:18.070> text

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
text layer second layer there is text

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.899 
text layer second layer there is text
layer<00:01:18.610> but<00:01:19.540> now<00:01:20.170> this<00:01:20.530> don't<00:01:21.070> look<00:01:21.310> like<00:01:21.370> a

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
layer but now this don't look like a

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.330 
layer but now this don't look like a
fade<00:01:22.420> in<00:01:22.810> we<00:01:23.140> need<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.350> create<00:01:23.620> a<00:01:23.860> smooth

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
fade in we need to create a smooth

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.080 
fade in we need to create a smooth
fading<00:01:25.000> like<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:26.159> one<00:01:27.159> first<00:01:27.520> frame<00:01:27.820> the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
fading like a one first frame the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.660 
fading like a one first frame the
opposite<00:01:28.690> is<00:01:28.930> zero<00:01:29.170> on<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.799> last<00:01:30.220> frame<00:01:30.490> the

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
opposite is zero on the last frame the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.430 
opposite is zero on the last frame the
opposite<00:01:31.090> is<00:01:31.330> horrible<00:01:31.900> stage<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.460> there's<00:01:33.820> a

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
opposite is horrible stage so there's a

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.550 
opposite is horrible stage so there's a
icon<00:01:35.440> here<00:01:36.190> that<00:01:36.549> is<00:01:36.820> motion<00:01:37.360> to<00:01:37.570> click<00:01:38.380> on

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
icon here that is motion to click on

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.859

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
two in with previous frame frames you

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.980 
two in with previous frame frames you
add<00:01:47.830> five<00:01:48.159> parameters<00:01:48.760> all<00:01:49.360> select<00:01:49.810> your

you can see in the time of a frame by

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.589 
you can see in the time of a frame by
selecting<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.679> whole<00:02:08.920> clip<00:02:09.280> then<00:02:10.060> click<00:02:10.569> here

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
again here as you can see they're

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.850 
again here as you can see they're
sprayed<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.820> we<00:02:18.780> need<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.020> create<00:02:19.320> fade

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
sprayed in and we need to create fade

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.570 
sprayed in and we need to create fade
out<00:02:20.130> so<00:02:20.940> create<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.480> new<00:02:21.510> frame<00:02:22.440> then<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.280> that

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
out so create a new frame then on that

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.700 
out so create a new frame then on that
frame<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.420> don't<00:02:24.720> need<00:02:24.960> this<00:02:25.200> text<00:02:25.560> layer

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710
