going to be using a q-tip stick which I
have<00:00:20.100> formed<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.910> little<00:00:21.840> incision<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
q-tip and then we're just going to start

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.170 
q-tip and then we're just going to start
rolling<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:59.340> once<00:00:59.550> we've<00:00:59.699> rolled<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:13.140 
little bit then we're going to start
adding<00:01:02.550> glue

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.410 

and<00:01:13.240> then<00:01:14.200> just<00:01:14.770> continue<00:01:15.010> rolling<00:01:15.940> it<00:01:16.060> until

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.070 

ones<00:01:56.310> at<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> end<00:01:56.670> we're<00:01:57.300> going<00:01:57.510> to<00:01:57.630> add<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> bit

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
ones at the end we're going to add a bit

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:13.160 
ones at the end we're going to add a bit
more<00:01:58.350> glue

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.380 

let<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.980> dry<00:02:14.220> for<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.550> little<00:02:14.700> bit<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:17.390> then

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
let it dry for a little bit and then

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.040 
let it dry for a little bit and then
just<00:02:18.900> gently<00:02:19.380> take<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.220> off

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
just gently take it off

thank you tip and there we go now we

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.650 
thank you tip and there we go now we
have<00:02:27.930> another<00:02:28.410> little<00:02:29.330> what<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.360> call<00:02:30.450> a

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
have another little what I call a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.910 
have another little what I call a
rectangle<00:02:31.350> bead<00:02:35.870> this<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:37.080> going<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.500> be<00:02:37.650> our

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
rectangle bead this is going to be our

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.910 
rectangle bead this is going to be our
next<00:02:38.190> bead<00:02:38.840> really<00:02:39.840> thin<00:02:40.080> on<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.230> outside<00:02:40.680> and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
next bead really thin on the outside and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.080 
next bead really thin on the outside and
gets<00:02:41.640> thicker<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.780> middle<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.850> for<00:02:44.850> that

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
gets thicker in the middle and for that

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.350 
gets thicker in the middle and for that
we're<00:02:45.959> going<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.500> have<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.800> skinny<00:02:47.550> triangle

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
we're going to have a skinny triangle

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.290 
we're going to have a skinny triangle
piece<00:02:48.600> as<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:50.010> can<00:02:50.190> see<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:51.750> starts<00:02:52.200> thick<00:02:52.680> and

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
piece as you can see it starts thick and

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.530 
piece as you can see it starts thick and
just<00:02:54.300> goes<00:02:54.480> down<00:02:54.720> until<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.230> ends<00:02:55.530> at<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.709> point

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
just goes down until it ends at a point

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.670 
just goes down until it ends at a point
so<00:02:57.540> with<00:02:57.690> this<00:02:57.810> we're<00:02:58.020> going<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.260> start<00:02:58.410> with

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
so with this we're going to start with

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:06.400 
so with this we're going to start with
the<00:02:58.800> thick<00:02:59.040> end<00:03:02.270> put<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.450> through<00:03:04.550> or<00:03:05.550> q-tip

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
the thick end put it through or q-tip

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:24.220 
the thick end put it through or q-tip
start<00:03:07.410> rolling<00:03:07.770> it<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:11.959> then<00:03:12.959> add<00:03:13.230> glue

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:55.690 

and<00:03:25.129> then<00:03:25.580> just<00:03:25.819> continue<00:03:26.030> rolling<00:03:26.959> it

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:04.210 

then<00:03:56.330> let<00:03:56.569> it<00:03:56.750> dry<00:03:57.080> for<00:03:57.110> a<00:03:57.530> little<00:03:57.650> bit<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:03.230> now

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
then let it dry for a little bit and now

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.199 
then let it dry for a little bit and now
we<00:04:04.250> have<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:06.290> overbeat<00:04:06.950> these<00:04:07.580> two<00:04:07.849> are<00:04:08.060> my

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
we have to overbeat these two are my

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.670 
we have to overbeat these two are my
favorite<00:04:08.720> types<00:04:09.410> of<00:04:09.650> beads<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:10.099> make<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:11.680> the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
favorite types of beads to make so the

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.910 
favorite types of beads to make so the
last<00:04:12.920> step<00:04:13.340> that<00:04:13.370> I<00:04:14.060> would<00:04:14.420> do<00:04:14.660> is<00:04:14.959> to<00:04:15.620> apply

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
last step that I would do is to apply

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.150 
last step that I would do is to apply
Mod<00:04:16.370> Podge<00:04:16.700> all<00:04:17.150> around<00:04:18.109> each<00:04:18.500> beat<00:04:18.889> and<00:04:18.919> let

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
Mod Podge all around each beat and let

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.659 
Mod Podge all around each beat and let
it<00:04:19.459> dry<00:04:19.700> what<00:04:20.419> that<00:04:20.600> is<00:04:20.720> going<00:04:21.019> to<00:04:21.109> do<00:04:21.290> is<00:04:21.669> just

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
it dry what that is going to do is just

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.830 
it dry what that is going to do is just
add<00:04:22.880> a<00:04:23.270> clear<00:04:23.720> shiny<00:04:24.680> coat<00:04:25.460> around<00:04:25.760> each<00:04:26.360> bead

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
add a clear shiny coat around each bead
