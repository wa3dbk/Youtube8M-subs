to<00:00:08.970> show<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.300> little<00:00:09.480> bit<00:00:09.630> about<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:10.019> what's<00:00:10.650> in

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
to show a little bit about it what's in

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.189 
to show a little bit about it what's in
it<00:00:12.290> right<00:00:13.290> here<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:13.650> got<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.889> 16-millimeter

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
it right here we got the 16-millimeter

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.210 
it right here we got the 16-millimeter

there<00:00:20.460> s5<00:00:22.490> it's<00:00:23.490> pretty<00:00:23.730> decent<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.240> cannot

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
there s5 it's pretty decent you cannot

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.599 
there s5 it's pretty decent you cannot
do<00:00:24.720> tool<00:00:24.960> servos<00:00:25.500> though<00:00:25.740> there's<00:00:26.160> no<00:00:26.369> room

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
do tool servos though there's no room

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.900 
do tool servos though there's no room
for<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.029> but<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.439> turns<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:30.480> dial<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.910> got

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
for it but it turns on the dial so got

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.660 
for it but it turns on the dial so got
your<00:00:33.090> receiver<00:00:33.989> covered<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.860> box<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.520> not

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
your receiver covered in box it's not

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.590 
your receiver covered in box it's not
waterproof<00:00:36.030> but<00:00:37.820> it's<00:00:38.820> quite<00:00:39.180> hard<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.480> get

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
waterproof but it's quite hard to get

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.880 
waterproof but it's quite hard to get
water<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.020> there<00:00:41.090> you<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.329> got<00:00:42.600> your<00:00:42.930> torque

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
water in there you have got your torque

mama monster motor from castle except

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.779 
mama monster motor from castle except
they<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.710> put<00:00:55.710> different<00:00:56.039> heat<00:00:56.160> sinks<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
they just put different heat sinks on it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.420 
they just put different heat sinks on it
yeah<00:00:56.969> as<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.210> pre<00:00:57.390> mounted<00:00:57.780> he<00:00:58.109> sink<00:00:58.469> with<00:00:59.280> it

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
yeah as a pre mounted he sink with it

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.380 
yeah as a pre mounted he sink with it
too<00:00:59.640> which<00:00:59.879> actually<00:01:00.090> helps<00:01:00.390> draw<00:01:00.690> some<00:01:00.899> heat

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
too which actually helps draw some heat

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.000 
too which actually helps draw some heat
here's<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.570> blur<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:06.439> this<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.710> actually

I<00:02:11.340> flipped<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.850> on<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.060> first<00:02:12.330> day<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.540> had<00:02:12.959> it

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
I flipped it on the first day I had it

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.100 
I flipped it on the first day I had it
and<00:02:13.319> snapped<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.890> fin<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.310> rear<00:02:14.489> so

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110
