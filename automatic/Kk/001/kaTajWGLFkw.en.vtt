00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hi grego talent for france 4 e mail 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.689
 welcome for a new session 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.460
 drive 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.839
 as always this is the course version 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.799
 of my training if you want the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.900
 full version 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.370
 just click on the link in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.080
 the description I already did my 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.080
 warming up wrapped elastic owens 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.640
 we will start directly with the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.600
 gymnastics resumes the exercise of 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.689
 previous sessions 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.369
 the statement of suspended legs what 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.559
 I discovered is that to avoid the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.149
 swinging he simply needed 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.950
 force yourself to better control the descent 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.719
 legs to isolate work from 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.460
 abdominals and flexor disturbs 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:50.280
 for today's game play against 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:52.410
 three sets of 12 repetition the session 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.300
 today is quite full-bodied 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.219
 having to make a repetition name by 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.329
 exercise we can pass with his 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.520
 as long as we have not done the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.989
 number of repetitions requested one can 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.879
 cut out its number of 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.650
 repetitions as we want we can 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.129
 to take relax caused according to 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.080
 his level 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.409
 we start with 100 swing alternating to 16 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.409
 kilos 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.600
 so I change my arms every time 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.799
 if I can do the senses without stopping 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.329
 it's so much better if I need to do 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.680
 breaks 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:25.549
 I'm doing the second exercise poles 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.549
 without this match 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.720

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.310
 pulling movement 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.640

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.009

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.980
