00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.500
 hi my name is one partner and i 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.139
 I want to tell why manufacturing 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.080
 wood furniture to order 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:16.320
 It takes a lot of time, but in 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.869
 first making furniture to order it 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.039
 craft rather subtle craft 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.189
 which means 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.480
 Do not stand in a hurry to get 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.359
 interesting good quality 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.320
 result and in terms of design and in terms of 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.320
 technical performance 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.730
 It requires a sufficiently qualified and 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:38.470
 slow work 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.360
 if we talk about who makes this 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.909
 the work that is it is an ordinary master 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.159
 the highest qualifications are considered 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:50.280
 Cabinetmaker like them before 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:53.080
 called and let's say in order 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.670
 sufficiently educated and advanced 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.130
 in terms of thinking master 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.060
 reach the level of the master higher 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.430
 qualifications 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.430
 at first his moment of work is permissible 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.010
 carpentry workshop 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.450
 It takes about a year 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:13.470
 probably in the most extreme developed cases 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.090
 yes and often it's usually two years and 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.010
 even in this state of affairs when 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.640
 master becomes quite experienced 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:25.120
 skillfully his work requires sufficient 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.190
 attention and lack of haste therefore 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.500
 usually when it is furniture 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.140
 done slowly enough to 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.430
 to get exactly the quality is good and 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.170
 in terms of design in terms of crafts 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.229
 why let's just furniture to order 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.260
 can do a little longer and how to do 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.540
 so that's what happens here if 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.740
 you can sometimes compare wood furniture 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.240
 get fast enough only 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.720
 option a to speed up 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.110
 process and it tends to unify 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.220
 some processes and make process 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.520
 furniture production 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.060
 something like canvas is usually in 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.429
 those places where the furniture industry 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.720
 well developed it is acceptable to all 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.270
 famous italy yes then there 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.210
 offers the consumer enough 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.610
 a large number of design options 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.560
 tree selection and so on but usually 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.960
 factories are all built for this type 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.660
 that furniture is produced according to exactly 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.290
 the pipeline all technologies have already worked 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.420
 tested and furniture as a rule 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.610
 is made to the warehouse sometimes not 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.770
 painted upon receipt of order 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.760
 only the color of the furniture is chosen but let's say 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:44.160
 there is one of five options 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.320
 stained and then dried out and 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.340
 sent to the consumer process 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.100
 going fast 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.590
 all technology worked niki machines 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.270
 no need to reconfigure if the furniture 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.090
 made to order completely 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.470
 constructively for specific dimensions 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.110
 rooms and so on and so on then 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.810
 here the master who perform similar 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.209
 orders are faced with such things 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.760
 even if he had any similar 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.550
 things even worked out some 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.070
 module 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.980
 I do such that even some changes 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.440
 linear dimensions in width 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.989
 it became something else may affect 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.239
 quality of design or quality of resume 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.760
 crafts 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.230
 often 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.400
 modifying design issues precisely by 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.170
 course of order fulfillment work 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.380
 some little things are faced with some 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.780
 difficulties and bring the product to mind on 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.290
 actually furniture made to order from wood 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.780
 you can even say so the design on 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.450
 the moment when the design project is agreed 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.360
 with a customer not a designer, he basically 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.670
 doesn't end designer distribute 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.250
 custom design of this product 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.620
 it is distributed to the workshop where 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.840
 there is a refinement let's say the details and 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.060
 this is basically a normal phenomenon and 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.930
 to make it more clear 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:14.040
 I can give an example let's say the 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.959
 less known today 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.739
 so how many documentaries on 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.389
 about this shot and quite a lot 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.260
 information can be found because 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.669
 produced by car everybody knows that 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.070
 let's say when the car is a new model 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:33.030
 she comes out quite raw 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.780
 the next series is being finalized 2 3 4 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.030
 series 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.860
 same car brand let's say there 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.190
 in a year in two in three she 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:45.270
 much this work no much better well 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.610
 it is also an example of craft and how these or 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.020
 other problems are solved by artisans 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.100
 who works with metal 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.380
 in essence we remove all the same, that is 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.910
 for individual orders actually 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.470
 work has to be done much 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:04.169
 more creative leisurely piece 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.620
 detailed that is why furniture from 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.350
 wood 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.870
 it is on order will always require 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.539
 much more time than acceptable 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.270
 if there is any ready design you can 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.100
 point with a finger I want this closet 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.080
 nothing needs to be changed 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.300
 paint it green it will 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.039
 fairly fast synology then works on 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.060
 some factory that produces 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:29.100
 finished furniture on the conveyor if 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.500
 give more such examples let's say in 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.500
 including here I mentioned waist yes that 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.330
 one more comparison is acceptable 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.570
 well, usually furniture for residential 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.340
 spaces there match tables and cabinets 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.250
 means 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:46.520
 what kind of consoles so on they're like 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.320
 the rule is often finished you can 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.930
 to acquire 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.389
 kitchens kitchen for someone space this 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.270
 more always furniture to order 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:58.220
 so let's say if you ask 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.590
 to walk even here in the furniture salon 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.360
 let's say in Moscow to them quite a lot 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.449
 who offers italian kitchen 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.220
 custom headsets usually get 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.040
 kitchen set to order 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.160
 naturally even from Italy closer than 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:16.430
 after six months it's hard enough 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.350
 would even say good kitchen 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.360
 Soils basically get faster than 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.940
 after six months almost at all 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.800
 Now it is impossible that there is again more 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.110
 once again confirms that even with you 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.240
 such infrastructure and culture 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.789
 production as in italy yes there who 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.130
 hundreds of years already produces this furniture yes 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:34.729
 such terms are basically normal 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.240
 phenomena 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:41.720
 Here basically I think by and large 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.580
 the main aspects revealed why 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.789
 wood furniture to order 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:50.009
 require quite a long time if 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:52.189
 Any questions for let's write 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.780
 comments I will answer with pleasure 

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:57.740
 subscribe to the video channel read from them 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.740
 designer thanks
