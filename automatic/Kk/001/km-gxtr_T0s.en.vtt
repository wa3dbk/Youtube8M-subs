00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
drilled a small hole in my spring and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.099 
drilled a small hole in my spring and
been<00:00:23.910> hammered<00:00:24.210> over<00:00:24.449> there<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.750> end<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.019> it

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
got it in there and now my contact screw

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.089 
got it in there and now my contact screw
has<00:00:27.660> something<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.080> hit<00:00:28.380> other<00:00:28.710> than<00:00:28.949> the

you<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.560> um<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.670> had<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.000> machine

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
you can um if you had this machine

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.020 
you can um if you had this machine
bagged<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:44.009> want<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.310> start<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.700> no<00:01:44.880> it's

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
bagged and you want to start it no it's

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.819 
bagged and you want to start it no it's
not<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.240> self-starting<00:01:45.810> machine<00:01:46.170> but<00:01:46.500> all<00:01:46.680> you

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829

the needle bar well I say that I get

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.520 
the needle bar well I say that I get
this<00:01:54.180> gonna<00:01:54.390> make<00:01:54.509> me<00:01:54.630> out<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.960> liar<00:01:55.200> oh

there it goes you may have to touch
something<00:01:57.659> here<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.950> would<00:01:59.040> restart<00:01:59.579> but

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
something here and it would restart but

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.219 
something here and it would restart but
you<00:02:00.180> know<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.479> machine's<00:02:00.869> more<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.170> a

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
you know this machine's more of a

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.590 
you know this machine's more of a
collector<00:02:01.680> piece<00:02:01.890> than<00:02:02.070> anything

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
collector piece than anything

and<00:02:02.960> unfortunately<00:02:03.470> as<00:02:03.650> long<00:02:03.830> as<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:04.070> use<00:02:04.280> this

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
and unfortunately as long as I use this

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.460 
and unfortunately as long as I use this
point<00:02:04.760> stop<00:02:05.090> cognition<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.990> way<00:02:06.080> these<00:02:06.229> old

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
point stop cognition the way these old

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.160 
point stop cognition the way these old
antique<00:02:06.650> engines<00:02:07.100> had<00:02:07.539> they're<00:02:08.539> always<00:02:08.780> going

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
antique engines had they're always going

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.600 
antique engines had they're always going
to<00:02:09.259> be<00:02:09.410> one<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.649> you're<00:02:09.800> gonna<00:02:09.890> Excel<00:02:10.280> start

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
to be one that you're gonna Excel start

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.670 
to be one that you're gonna Excel start
now<00:02:10.910> sometimes<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.660> turn<00:02:11.810> this<00:02:12.050> off<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:12.560> on

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
now sometimes you turn this off and on

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.980 
now sometimes you turn this off and on
and<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.520> makes<00:02:13.790> self<00:02:14.060> start<00:02:14.390> but<00:02:14.690> nine<00:02:14.959> times

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
and it makes self start but nine times

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.640 
and it makes self start but nine times
out<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.500> ten<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:16.070> have<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.280> stick<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.290> say<00:02:18.500> it

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
out of ten I have a stick and I say it

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.620 
out of ten I have a stick and I say it
didn't<00:02:18.890> self<00:02:19.130> start<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:20.209> you<00:02:20.300> know<00:02:20.420> that's

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
didn't self start so you know that's

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.110 
didn't self start so you know that's
that's<00:02:20.959> something<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:21.440> get<00:02:21.590> into<00:02:21.980> but<00:02:22.700> you

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
that's something you get into but you

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.840 
that's something you get into but you
could<00:02:23.360> reach<00:02:23.600> through<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.959> bag<00:02:24.140> like<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.470> say

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
could reach through the bag like I say

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.760 
could reach through the bag like I say
and<00:02:25.850> I'm<00:02:26.060> just<00:02:27.020> give<00:02:27.230> your<00:02:27.410> needle<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:27.709> little

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
and I'm just give your needle a little

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.860 
and I'm just give your needle a little
bump<00:02:28.130> like<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:29.209> could<00:02:29.330> always<00:02:29.540> reach

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
bump like so you could always reach

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.020 
bump like so you could always reach
through<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.170> bag<00:02:30.380> touch<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.220> needle<00:02:31.400> and

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
through the bag touch the needle and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.000 
through the bag touch the needle and
have<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.080> going<00:02:33.260> again

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
have it going again

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.729 
have it going again
now<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:34.670> can<00:02:34.910> also<00:02:35.090> adjust<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.230> points<00:02:36.590> on

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
now you can also adjust the points on

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.770 
now you can also adjust the points on
this<00:02:36.920> just<00:02:37.250> like<00:02:37.430> all<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.910> them<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.600> makes

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
this just like all of them and it makes

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.449 
this just like all of them and it makes
a<00:02:38.930> big<00:02:39.110> difference<00:02:39.500> on<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.800> performance<00:02:40.340> I

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
a big difference on the performance I

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.240 
a big difference on the performance I
can<00:02:40.489> turn<00:02:40.820> it<00:02:40.970> back<00:02:41.000> some<00:02:41.660> here<00:02:42.070> you<00:02:43.070> hear

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
can turn it back some here you hear

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.760 
can turn it back some here you hear
picking<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.730> up<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.940> little<00:02:44.150> in<00:02:44.900> these<00:02:45.140> contact

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770

picking it up a little in these contact
points<00:02:45.890> you<00:02:46.280> know<00:02:46.370> they<00:02:46.550> were<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:47.060> got<00:02:47.239> that

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
points you know they were you got that

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.360

this is the faster action oh I have got
my<00:03:12.110> points<00:03:12.590> out<00:03:12.739> of<00:03:12.860> adjustment<00:03:14.049> there<00:03:15.049> we<00:03:15.230> go

there<00:03:26.960> we<00:03:27.110> go<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.830> that's<00:03:27.980> about<00:03:28.190> maximum

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
there we go and that's about maximum

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.820 
there we go and that's about maximum
performance<00:03:29.030> out<00:03:29.600> of<00:03:29.630> it<00:03:29.810> now<00:03:29.960> you<00:03:30.020> can<00:03:30.290> um<00:03:30.440> you

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
performance out of it now you can um you

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.300 
performance out of it now you can um you
can<00:03:31.820> see<00:03:31.970> right<00:03:32.120> here<00:03:32.270> this<00:03:32.420> guy<00:03:33.040> quite<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.070> bit

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
can see right here this guy quite a bit

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.270 
can see right here this guy quite a bit
of<00:03:34.460> power<00:03:34.640> it<00:03:35.450> doesn't<00:03:35.780> know<00:03:35.870> it's<00:03:36.770> not<00:03:36.980> weak

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
of power it doesn't know it's not weak

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.400 
of power it doesn't know it's not weak
it<00:03:38.090> has<00:03:38.300> plenty<00:03:38.510> of<00:03:38.720> power<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.290> could

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
it has plenty of power and it could

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.170 
it has plenty of power and it could
tattoo<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:40.070> it's<00:03:40.190> moving<00:03:40.640> in<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.760> pretty<00:03:40.940> good

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
tattoo and it's moving in a pretty good

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.910 
tattoo and it's moving in a pretty good
speed<00:03:42.400> yeah<00:03:43.630> it<00:03:44.630> would<00:03:44.810> be<00:03:44.960> usable<00:03:45.350> I'd<00:03:45.710> say

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
speed yeah it would be usable I'd say

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.500 
speed yeah it would be usable I'd say
it's<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.220> fastest<00:03:46.760> one<00:03:46.910> of<00:03:47.000> these<00:03:47.150> motors

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
it's the fastest one of these motors

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.910 
it's the fastest one of these motors
that<00:03:47.660> I've<00:03:47.750> had<00:03:47.930> run<00:03:48.170> yet<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.530> think<00:03:48.800> it's

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
that I've had run yet and I think it's

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.560 
that I've had run yet and I think it's
due<00:03:49.070> to<00:03:49.220> all<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.490> ball<00:03:49.670> bearings<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.270> put<00:03:50.450> in

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
due to all the ball bearings I put in

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.150 
due to all the ball bearings I put in
this<00:03:50.690> is<00:03:50.870> I<00:03:50.960> spent<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.290> good<00:03:51.470> amount<00:03:51.680> of<00:03:52.010> money

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
this is I spent a good amount of money

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.440 
this is I spent a good amount of money
on<00:03:52.400> disc<00:03:52.640> bearings<00:03:53.590> but<00:03:54.590> I<00:03:55.210> think<00:03:56.210> it's<00:03:56.360> about

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
on disc bearings but I think it's about

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.030 
on disc bearings but I think it's about
all<00:03:56.660> I<00:03:56.690> can<00:03:56.930> really<00:03:57.050> say<00:03:57.140> about<00:03:57.350> it's<00:03:57.860> got<00:03:57.980> a

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
all I can really say about it's got a

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.920 
all I can really say about it's got a
capacitor<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.700> try<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.120> save<00:03:59.300> on<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.540> points

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
capacitor to try and save on the points

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.950 
capacitor to try and save on the points
some<00:04:00.670> nice<00:04:01.670> little<00:04:01.940> steel<00:04:02.240> frame

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
some nice little steel frame

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.440 
some nice little steel frame
brass<00:04:03.620> outer<00:04:04.100> wheel<00:04:04.460> on<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.760> flywheel<00:04:05.000> here

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
brass outer wheel on the flywheel here

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.870 
brass outer wheel on the flywheel here
I've<00:04:05.660> got<00:04:05.870> them<00:04:06.080> still<00:04:06.470> in<00:04:06.770> her<00:04:06.890> brass<00:04:07.250> time<00:04:07.610> on

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
I've got them still in her brass time on

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.490 
I've got them still in her brass time on
it

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
it

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.540 
it
took<00:04:09.500> me<00:04:09.650> all<00:04:09.680> day<00:04:09.800> just<00:04:10.070> to<00:04:10.250> build<00:04:10.460> this

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
took me all day just to build this

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.430 
took me all day just to build this
flywheel<00:04:10.880> and<00:04:11.390> get<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.630> balanced<00:04:12.080> right<00:04:12.230> it's

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
flywheel and get it balanced right it's

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.200 
flywheel and get it balanced right it's
so<00:04:12.590> hard<00:04:12.830> to<00:04:12.920> balance<00:04:13.160> these<00:04:13.520> engines<00:04:13.970> but<00:04:14.120> you

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
so hard to balance these engines but you

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.790 
so hard to balance these engines but you
notice<00:04:14.540> this<00:04:14.660> when<00:04:14.810> they<00:04:14.990> run<00:04:15.170> smooth<00:04:15.530> when

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
notice this when they run smooth when

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.020 
notice this when they run smooth when
they're<00:04:15.920> running<00:04:16.040> smooth<00:04:16.459> they're<00:04:16.670> balanced

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
they're running smooth they're balanced

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.940 
they're running smooth they're balanced
pretty<00:04:17.270> good<00:04:17.540> and<00:04:18.020> that's<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.470> really<00:04:18.680> hard

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
pretty good and that's a really hard

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.440 
pretty good and that's a really hard
part<00:04:19.250> when<00:04:19.489> you're<00:04:19.640> working<00:04:19.940> with<00:04:20.060> my<00:04:20.180> stuff

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
part when you're working with my stuff

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.020 
part when you're working with my stuff
this<00:04:20.900> size<00:04:24.130> it's<00:04:25.130> all<00:04:25.310> I<00:04:25.370> can<00:04:25.490> only<00:04:25.640> think<00:04:25.850> to

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
this size it's all I can only think to

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.150 
this size it's all I can only think to
say<00:04:26.210> about<00:04:26.480> it<00:04:26.660> I<00:04:26.810> hope<00:04:26.960> y'all<00:04:27.230> enjoyed<00:04:27.590> it<00:04:27.830> and

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
say about it I hope y'all enjoyed it and

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.880 
say about it I hope y'all enjoyed it and
let's<00:04:31.160> see<00:04:31.310> what<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:31.490> build<00:04:31.700> next
