 Hello by it is the border of players 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:14.740
 Today, I use the ice coffee beans that I roasted for summer ice coffee 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:20.300
 I will introduce how to make 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:27.679
 Extraction method of iced coffee is the same as hot coffee 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:33.489
 The difference is that the rapid cooling is at the needle-v 60 ice coffee maker 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.489
 Let's brew about 4 cups of iced coffee using 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:42.140
 The first part 60 ice coffee maker required for extraction 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:46.220

 filter 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.680
 Measuring spoon 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.680
 Prepare the pot 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.269
 Put an ice strainer in a glass pot and put in an exchange 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.170
 Place the water separator dripper 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:10.960

 How to put in is the same as an ordinary hand drip 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.850
 We pour hot water from this lottery to make it quiet 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:35.520
 The temperature of the hot water is 95 to 98 degrees 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:37.829
 If you moisten the whole powder evenly to bring out the delicious ingredients, it takes about 20 to 30 seconds 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.860
 Steam 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:48.010
 Steamed up 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:49.909

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.130
 I won't call 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.130
 It is an image of creating a coffee wall 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:02.440
 Before the amount of hot water contained in this way is less than one third 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.320
 I will pour the next day 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:14.280
 Repeat this three to four times 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:18.720
 From 4 and a half minutes only delicious ingredient Upon completion of the extraction in about 5 minutes will be emphasized 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:22.440
 Even if there are still hot water When you extract the amount of scheduled dripper 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:29.640
 Remove the dripper and water separator 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:31.870
 Take an extracted coffee 34 times up and down ice strainer to equalize the concentration 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:39.330

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.120
 A goal pack is also recommended if you put it more easily 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:21.569
 If it keeps 8 hours with a refrigerator as it is, it is finished 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.569
