00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:05.460
 was theorized by the caipira war that the works of small bodies the remains of the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.830
 planet formation 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.329
 remain in a belt at the end of the solar system 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:14.559
 the team soon discovered the first of these kaiper belt objects and provided 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.310
 so I think 27 more 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.450
 dm until we discovered these things it was thought that pluto is on the limit 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.640
 of the solar system there was nothing beyond it. 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.659
 then we discover these objects from the character belt 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.289
 hardly knew most of the objects that the flames are on call are the most 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.289
 distant objects of the known solar system 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.539
 the discovery of profit 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.600
 raised a new issue 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.220
 What is Pluto? 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.220
 a small planet or a large falling object 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.910
 for him a very interesting object he has many fellow members of the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.910
 belt of caicÃ³ and he is the king of the belt 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.920
 the image is the king of the small celestial objects for astronomical union 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.880
 International 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.050
 when her discovery diminished she sought to martify for confirmation 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.920
 if it took pluton discovered today it would also look for March 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.170
 we have not everything from the inside and returned on the outside track 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.399
 the offside team having half the length of the event 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.700
 pluto is not just much smaller than any other planet 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.150
 is the only one that has this strange elliptical orbit 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.600
 he even crosses the path of neptune 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.479
 but then I discovered what many of the loaded objects share the same 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.040
 strange orbit of pluto 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.970
 we know that there are many other objects like pluto around the sun 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.280
 it is imperative with half the duration that it made everything in between 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.670
 position 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.350
 made it clear that one should look at Bhutan as the citizen's wallet king 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.660
 and therefore bernado consider it as fist on the planet 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.670
 in fact of being told that pluto has seasons 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.100
 which has an atmosphere that comes and goes with the seasons I have a surface 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.409
 complicated 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:20.499
 the world pr 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.839
 all these things are associated with a planet and you would not 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:28.079
 little surprised by this but an asteroid does not have these properties 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.599
 asteroid a piece of rock and does not compare bear little resemblance to 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.479
 Pluto may exist things we do not see wrong but everything is not one of them 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.189
 altogether they frankly do not care what we call 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.159
 for me it does not really matter this is a planet or not I think so 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.079
 behind are mouth I think so 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.299
 the International Nomenclature Committee of the Astronomical Union thinks that yes 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.309
 the nasa thinks that yes it is good enough for me but product theme and 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:02.620
 planet or not it is this body ignatik bike at the end of our system 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:06.919
 that has recorded events since long before the formation of the 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.559
 now the law only national and international union said the authority to 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:18.699
 rename s status 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.179
 and they will not change their mind
