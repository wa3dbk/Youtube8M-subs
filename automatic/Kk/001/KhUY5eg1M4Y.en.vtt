so<00:01:35.390> I<00:01:35.420> think<00:01:35.719> mentally<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:36.740> emotionally<00:01:37.090> and

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
so I think mentally and emotionally and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.730 
so I think mentally and emotionally and
spiritually<00:01:38.299> definitely<00:01:39.200> need<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.469> prepare

for it as there's a huge competition and
say<00:01:42.619> I<00:01:43.549> think<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:44.630> we<00:01:44.780> just<00:01:45.039> we're<00:01:46.039> just
