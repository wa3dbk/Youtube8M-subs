00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
opinion Master Roshi is one of the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.970 
opinion Master Roshi is one of the
funniest<00:03:30.870> characters<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.650> series<00:03:31.950> is

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
funniest characters and the series is

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.039 
funniest characters and the series is
between<00:03:32.400> him<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:32.730> young<00:03:33.359> Goku<00:03:33.840> they<00:03:33.989> were

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
between him and young Goku they were

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.530 
between him and young Goku they were
hilarious<00:03:34.920> but<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.459> think<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.150> would<00:03:36.239> be<00:03:36.329> great

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
hilarious but I think it would be great

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.210 
hilarious but I think it would be great
to<00:03:36.569> either<00:03:36.810> see<00:03:37.109> a<00:03:37.139> backstory<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.859> him<00:03:38.100> when

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
to either see a backstory of him when

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.830 
to either see a backstory of him when
he's<00:03:38.340> young<00:03:38.579> or<00:03:38.819> maybe<00:03:39.060> one<00:03:39.329> when<00:03:39.540> he's<00:03:39.630> old

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
he's young or maybe one when he's old

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.180 
he's young or maybe one when he's old
that's<00:03:40.049> fine<00:03:40.260> too<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.500> wouldn't<00:03:40.859> mind<00:03:41.010> either
