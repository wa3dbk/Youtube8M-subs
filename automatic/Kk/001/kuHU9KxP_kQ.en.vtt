good<00:01:40.119> for<00:01:40.300> my<00:01:40.450> team<00:01:40.690> because<00:01:41.200> they<00:01:41.560> are<00:01:41.649> fast

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920

good for my team because they are fast
they<00:01:42.190> are<00:01:42.250> not<00:01:42.430> super<00:01:42.700> technical<00:01:43.240> in<00:01:43.420> the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
they are not super technical in the

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.870 
they are not super technical in the
moment<00:01:43.930> because<00:01:43.960> it's<00:01:44.490> also<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.850> first

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
moment because it's also the first

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.050 
moment because it's also the first
indoor<00:01:46.720> season<00:01:46.899> for<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.320> horses<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.670> they<00:01:48.700> are

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
indoor season for the horses so they are

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.330 
indoor season for the horses so they are
not<00:01:49.300> super<00:01:49.600> technical<00:01:50.110> in<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.530> obstacles<00:01:51.130> but

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
not super technical in the obstacles but

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.639 
not super technical in the obstacles but
i<00:01:51.610> think<00:01:52.090> this<00:01:52.420> course<00:01:52.750> should<00:01:53.290> be<00:01:53.320> good<00:01:53.590> for

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
i think this course should be good for

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.700 
i think this course should be good for
