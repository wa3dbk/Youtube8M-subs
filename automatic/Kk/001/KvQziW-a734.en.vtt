bike the bike took a nasty tumble on the
right<00:00:12.590> which<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:14.690> thought<00:00:15.690> may<00:00:16.139> have<00:00:17.630> had

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
right which I thought may have had

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.620 
right which I thought may have had
something<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.140> do<00:00:19.350> with<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.680> starter<00:00:20.630> the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
something to do with this starter the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.200 
something to do with this starter the
starter<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.050> these<00:00:22.460> what<00:00:23.460> I've<00:00:23.550> found<00:00:23.730> out<00:00:24.000> is

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
starter on these what I've found out is

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.330 
starter on these what I've found out is
they're<00:00:24.600> not<00:00:24.840> like<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> conventional<00:00:25.590> starter

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
they're not like a conventional starter

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.970 
they're not like a conventional starter
like<00:00:27.090> on<00:00:27.300> my<00:00:27.480> Repsol<00:00:28.010> these<00:00:29.010> have<00:00:30.980> what's

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
like on my Repsol these have what's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.150 
like on my Repsol these have what's
called<00:00:32.360> an<00:00:33.530> alternator<00:00:35.210> energized<00:00:37.160> reverse

in<00:00:52.050> order<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.500> do<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:55.289> battery<00:00:55.590> has<00:00:55.739> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
in order to do that the battery has to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.970 
in order to do that the battery has to
have<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> lot<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.430> juice<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
have a lot of juice in it just with the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.779 
have a lot of juice in it just with the
spark<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.180> kick<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.420> over<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
spark you can you can kick it over and

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.490 
spark you can you can kick it over and
the<00:01:02.789> battery<00:01:03.629> will<00:01:03.719> come<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.049> life

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the battery will come to life

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.740 
the battery will come to life
but<00:01:04.860> amperage<00:01:05.460> as<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.850> understand<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.540> I'm<00:01:06.600> not

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
but amperage as I understand and I'm not

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.109 
but amperage as I understand and I'm not
an<00:01:06.900> expert<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.409> I'm<00:01:07.860> not<00:01:08.189> sure<00:01:08.250> amperage

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
an expert on this I'm not sure amperage

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.080 
an expert on this I'm not sure amperage
is<00:01:09.150> how<00:01:09.420> much<00:01:09.600> balls<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.710> got<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.159> battery

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
is how much balls you got in the battery

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.030 
is how much balls you got in the battery
and<00:01:12.210> that's<00:01:12.570> what<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.960> takes<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.380> energize<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
and that's what it takes to energize the

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.830 
and that's what it takes to energize the
the<00:01:17.040> alternator<00:01:18.950> starter<00:01:20.659> underneath<00:01:21.659> this

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
the alternator starter underneath this

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.890 
the alternator starter underneath this
radiator<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.670> I'm<00:01:23.850> checking<00:01:24.119> switches<00:01:24.689> right

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
radiator so I'm checking switches right

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.340 
radiator so I'm checking switches right
now<00:01:25.080> I'm<00:01:25.470> also<00:01:25.740> checking<00:01:27.110> fuses

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
now I'm also checking fuses

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.179 
now I'm also checking fuses
I<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:29.280> no<00:01:29.430> diagrams<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:32.009> thing

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
I have no diagrams on this the one thing

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.810 
I have no diagrams on this the one thing
I<00:01:32.280> haven't<00:01:32.490> found<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:35.250> solenoid

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
I haven't found is the the solenoid

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.740 
I haven't found is the the solenoid
that's<00:01:36.090> supposed<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.390> here

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
that's supposed to be here

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.550 
that's supposed to be here
I<00:01:37.189> don't<00:01:38.189> see<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.579> anywhere<00:01:38.990> but<00:01:39.990> my<00:01:40.170> next<00:01:40.350> step

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
I don't see it anywhere but my next step

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.560 
I don't see it anywhere but my next step
is<00:01:40.799> going<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.490> take<00:01:41.700> off<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:44.240> seat<00:01:45.240> and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
is going to be to take off the seat and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.249 
is going to be to take off the seat and
I'll<00:01:46.170> take<00:01:46.350> off<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.740> bottom<00:01:47.189> here<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.259> we'll

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
I'll take off the bottom here and we'll

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.050 
I'll take off the bottom here and we'll
see<00:01:49.920> if<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.220> get<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> look<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.729> little<00:01:50.850> bit

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
see if we can get a look a little bit

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.429 
see if we can get a look a little bit
closer<00:01:51.299> look<00:01:51.540> at<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.750> engine<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.229> I'll

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
closer look at the engine and I'll

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.670 
closer look at the engine and I'll
follow<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.310> wiring<00:01:53.520> down<00:01:54.229> like<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.320> said<00:01:55.530> I'm

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
follow the wiring down like I said I'm

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.850 
follow the wiring down like I said I'm
gonna<00:01:56.280> try<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.909> take<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.649> that's<00:01:58.649> kind

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
gonna try and take this but that's kind

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.520 
gonna try and take this but that's kind
of<00:01:58.890> cool<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.340> don't<00:01:59.610> know<00:01:59.759> what<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.149> but

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
of cool I don't know what that is but

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.870 
of cool I don't know what that is but
what<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.619> that

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.380 

it's<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:07.420> door<00:02:08.420> alarm<00:02:08.720> or<00:02:08.959> something<00:02:09.880> yeah<00:02:10.880> I'll

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
it's a door alarm or something yeah I'll

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.290 
it's a door alarm or something yeah I'll
leave<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:11.600> right<00:02:11.870> there<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:13.180> don't<00:02:14.180> think

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
leave that right there I don't think

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.270 
leave that right there I don't think
they<00:02:14.480> came<00:02:14.660> with<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.870> bike<00:02:15.020> so<00:02:15.950> that's<00:02:16.130> what

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
they came with the bike so that's what

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.930 
they came with the bike so that's what
we're<00:02:16.400> out<00:02:16.490> right<00:02:16.819> now<00:02:16.970> I'll<00:02:17.260> restart<00:02:18.260> when<00:02:18.530> we

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
we're out right now I'll restart when we

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.220 
we're out right now I'll restart when we
get<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.120> body<00:02:20.720> lacrosse<00:02:22.720> body<00:02:23.720> work<00:02:23.959> has<00:02:24.080> been

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
get the body lacrosse body work has been

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.850 
get the body lacrosse body work has been
taken<00:02:24.560> off<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:25.209> ruckus<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.959> front<00:02:27.530> body

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
taken off the ruckus and the front body

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.170 
taken off the ruckus and the front body
work<00:02:28.130> up<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.209> here<00:02:29.450> it's<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.810> little<00:02:30.140> bit<00:02:30.320> of<00:02:30.500> a

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
work up in here it's a little bit of a

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.660 
work up in here it's a little bit of a
tricky<00:02:32.180> get<00:02:32.390> back<00:02:32.569> on<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:32.930> off<00:02:33.050> it's<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:34.610> if

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
tricky get back on and off it's so if

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.010 
tricky get back on and off it's so if
you<00:02:34.850> take<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.300> off<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.510> gotta<00:02:35.690> be<00:02:35.810> careful

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
you take it off you gotta be careful

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.960 
you take it off you gotta be careful
what<00:02:36.890> I'm<00:02:37.040> looking<00:02:37.370> for<00:02:37.640> is<00:02:37.790> any<00:02:37.940> signs<00:02:38.360> of

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
what I'm looking for is any signs of

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.460 
what I'm looking for is any signs of
leakage<00:02:40.970> spills<00:02:41.570> or<00:02:42.580> anything<00:02:43.580> that<00:02:44.470> could

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
leakage spills or anything that could

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.920 
leakage spills or anything that could
tell<00:02:45.769> me<00:02:46.989> what<00:02:47.989> might<00:02:48.260> be<00:02:48.440> wrong<00:02:48.739> with<00:02:49.930> the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
tell me what might be wrong with the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.650 
tell me what might be wrong with the
little<00:02:51.850> there's<00:02:52.850> your<00:02:53.030> there's<00:02:53.300> your<00:02:53.480> fuel

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
little there's your there's your fuel

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.660 
little there's your there's your fuel
pump<00:02:53.840> or<00:02:54.080> your<00:02:54.440> there's<00:02:55.130> your<00:02:55.280> fuel<00:02:55.519> filter

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
pump or your there's your fuel filter

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.360 
pump or your there's your fuel filter
right<00:02:56.030> there<00:02:56.269> okay<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.440> your<00:02:57.590> fuel<00:02:57.890> pump<00:02:58.100> is

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
right there okay and your fuel pump is

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.650 
right there okay and your fuel pump is
right<00:02:58.700> there<00:02:59.800> so<00:03:00.800> just<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:01.640> you<00:03:01.790> know<00:03:01.850> that's<00:03:02.510> a

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
right there so just so you know that's a

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.620 
right there so just so you know that's a
little<00:03:02.840> gas<00:03:03.130> but<00:03:04.130> I'm<00:03:04.880> checking<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.360> wiring

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.289 

all<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.840> way<00:03:08.959> down<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.470> do<00:03:09.560> not<00:03:09.890> see<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:13.299> solenoid

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
all the way down I do not see a solenoid

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.660 
all the way down I do not see a solenoid
anywhere<00:03:15.019> maybe<00:03:15.920> I'm<00:03:16.790> I'm<00:03:18.250> not<00:03:19.250> sure<00:03:19.459> yet

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
anywhere maybe I'm I'm not sure yet

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.250 
anywhere maybe I'm I'm not sure yet
anyway<00:03:20.239> I'm<00:03:20.360> gonna<00:03:20.480> check<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.810> battery<00:03:21.110> if

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
anyway I'm gonna check the battery if

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.780 
anyway I'm gonna check the battery if
the<00:03:21.350> battery<00:03:21.709> does<00:03:21.860> not<00:03:21.890> have<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.340> amperage

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
the battery does not have the amperage

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.810 
the battery does not have the amperage
or<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.860> muscle<00:03:24.860> in<00:03:25.070> it<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:26.450> kick<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:27.820> to

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
or the muscle in it to kick the to

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.400 
or the muscle in it to kick the to
energize<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.540> starter<00:03:30.970> down<00:03:31.970> here<00:03:32.360> then<00:03:33.110> that

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
energize the starter down here then that

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.520 
energize the starter down here then that
may<00:03:33.590> be<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.980> problem<00:03:34.989> but<00:03:35.989> it<00:03:36.110> also<00:03:36.260> could<00:03:36.500> be

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
may be the problem but it also could be

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.840 
may be the problem but it also could be
a<00:03:36.620> couple<00:03:36.890> other<00:03:36.980> things<00:03:37.070> so<00:03:37.820> as<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.959> right<00:03:38.989> now

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
a couple other things so as of right now

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.280 
a couple other things so as of right now
with<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:40.970> bodywork<00:03:41.390> off<00:03:41.570> I<00:03:41.750> don't<00:03:41.870> see

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
with the bodywork off I don't see

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.800 
with the bodywork off I don't see
anything<00:03:42.850> that<00:03:43.850> really<00:03:44.150> stands<00:03:44.510> out<00:03:46.360> so<00:03:47.360> I'll

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
anything that really stands out so I'll

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.520 
anything that really stands out so I'll
do<00:03:48.019> some<00:03:48.200> tests<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:48.620> see<00:03:48.769> wood<00:03:48.920> until<00:03:49.370> we<00:03:49.489> do

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
do some tests and see wood until we do

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.900 
do some tests and see wood until we do
now<00:03:51.530> we<00:03:51.590> have<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:51.769> switch<00:03:52.040> torn<00:03:52.400> part<00:03:52.670> right

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
now we have a switch torn part right

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.350 
now we have a switch torn part right
here<00:03:53.680> witness<00:03:54.680> took<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.459> tumble<00:03:55.730> it<00:03:56.060> could<00:03:56.269> have

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
here witness took a tumble it could have

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.039 
here witness took a tumble it could have
hurt<00:03:56.600> the<00:03:56.780> switch<00:03:57.079> now<00:03:57.410> what<00:03:58.310> I'm<00:03:58.400> gonna<00:03:58.549> do

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
hurt the switch now what I'm gonna do

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.900 
hurt the switch now what I'm gonna do
when<00:04:00.049> I<00:04:00.079> usually<00:04:00.470> check<00:04:01.130> on<00:04:01.340> these<00:04:01.549> things<00:04:01.730> as

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
when I usually check on these things as

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.360 
when I usually check on these things as
isolate<00:04:02.630> one<00:04:03.500> thing<00:04:03.709> from<00:04:03.859> another<00:04:03.980> I'll

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
isolate one thing from another I'll

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.759 
isolate one thing from another I'll
isolate<00:04:04.640> the<00:04:05.060> battery<00:04:05.420> or<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:06.200> switch<00:04:06.560> I'm

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
isolate the battery or the switch I'm

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.430 
isolate the battery or the switch I'm
sorry<00:04:07.010> I<00:04:07.220> laid<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.269> switch<00:04:08.570> and<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:09.049> wiring

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
sorry I laid the switch and the wiring

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.210 
sorry I laid the switch and the wiring
to<00:04:09.470> look<00:04:09.709> for<00:04:09.890> anything

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
to look for anything

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.479 
to look for anything
I<00:04:10.400> will<00:04:11.180> also<00:04:11.540> isolate<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:12.260> battery<00:04:12.650> as<00:04:12.890> you

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
I will also isolate the battery as you

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.030 
I will also isolate the battery as you
can<00:04:13.670> see<00:04:13.849> here<00:04:14.180> these<00:04:14.660> contacts<00:04:15.349> are

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
can see here these contacts are

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
the things I go through what I have

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.930 
the things I go through what I have
noticed<00:04:32.600> I<00:04:32.840> have<00:04:33.260> not<00:04:33.440> noticed<00:04:33.920> any<00:04:34.310> acid

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
noticed I have not noticed any acid

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.320 
noticed I have not noticed any acid
leaking<00:04:35.180> or<00:04:37.600> anything<00:04:38.600> like<00:04:38.990> that<00:04:40.060> but<00:04:41.060> here's

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
leaking or anything like that but here's

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.890 
leaking or anything like that but here's
something<00:04:43.480> someone<00:04:44.480> has<00:04:45.170> been<00:04:45.380> playing<00:04:45.620> with

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
something someone has been playing with

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
something someone has been playing with
the<00:04:50.620> starter<00:04:51.620> wires<00:04:51.830> here

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
the starter wires here

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.190 
the starter wires here
they're<00:04:54.920> afraid<00:04:55.160> for<00:04:55.490> some<00:04:55.700> reason<00:04:56.090> I<00:04:56.240> don't

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
they're afraid for some reason I don't

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.690 
they're afraid for some reason I don't
know<00:04:57.380> why<00:04:57.440> but<00:04:58.160> I<00:04:58.450> just<00:04:59.450> noticed<00:04:59.750> that<00:04:59.840> so<00:05:00.700> they

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
know why but I just noticed that so they

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.680 
know why but I just noticed that so they
shouldn't<00:05:01.940> be<00:05:02.090> like<00:05:02.360> that<00:05:02.390> at<00:05:02.870> all

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
shouldn't be like that at all

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
shouldn't be like that at all
matter<00:05:05.690> of<00:05:05.810> fact<00:05:07.780> so<00:05:08.780> I'll<00:05:09.170> take<00:05:09.410> a<00:05:09.440> look<00:05:09.650> at

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
matter of fact so I'll take a look at

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.180 
matter of fact so I'll take a look at
that<00:05:09.830> maybe<00:05:10.070> that<00:05:10.280> is<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.520> starter<00:05:10.850> wire<00:05:12.190> hmm

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
that maybe that is the starter wire hmm

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.930 
that maybe that is the starter wire hmm
that's<00:05:13.370> interesting

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
that's interesting

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.460 
that's interesting
okay<00:05:14.800> I've<00:05:15.800> taken<00:05:16.040> the<00:05:16.190> switch<00:05:16.400> apart<00:05:16.820> and

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
okay I've taken the switch apart and

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.600 
okay I've taken the switch apart and
have<00:05:18.470> a<00:05:18.500> look<00:05:18.740> at<00:05:18.890> it<00:05:19.010> cause<00:05:19.130> it's<00:05:19.280> kind<00:05:19.490> of<00:05:19.520> a

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
have a look at it cause it's kind of a

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.420 
have a look at it cause it's kind of a
mystery<00:05:20.060> I've<00:05:20.480> also<00:05:20.870> hooked<00:05:21.110> up<00:05:21.290> my<00:05:21.500> 450

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
mystery I've also hooked up my 450

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.040 
mystery I've also hooked up my 450
battery<00:05:22.790> which<00:05:22.970> is<00:05:23.150> brand<00:05:23.510> new<00:05:23.920> to<00:05:24.920> the<00:05:25.070> bike

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
battery which is brand new to the bike

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.010 
battery which is brand new to the bike
see<00:05:27.050> if<00:05:27.170> it's<00:05:27.290> the<00:05:27.380> battery<00:05:28.120> and<00:05:29.120> it<00:05:29.600> still<00:05:29.900> got

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
see if it's the battery and it still got

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.950 
see if it's the battery and it still got
the<00:05:30.170> same<00:05:30.410> problem<00:05:33.700> so

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.300 

I've<00:05:37.740> taken<00:05:38.040> your<00:05:38.850> old<00:05:39.030> battery<00:05:39.300> here<00:05:39.900> and

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
I've taken your old battery here and

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.409 
I've taken your old battery here and
I'll<00:05:41.310> try<00:05:41.610> to<00:05:41.669> charge<00:05:42.090> it<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:44.000> it's<00:05:45.000> showing<00:05:45.240> a

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
I'll try to charge it and it's showing a

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.520 
I'll try to charge it and it's showing a
zero<00:05:46.050> charge<00:05:46.139> on<00:05:46.560> it<00:05:47.780> so<00:05:48.780> what<00:05:48.960> I<00:05:49.020> did<00:05:49.229> was<00:05:49.380> I

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
zero charge on it so what I did was I

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.010 
zero charge on it so what I did was I
took<00:05:50.310> the<00:05:50.520> pounds<00:05:51.300> off<00:05:51.419> and<00:05:51.690> put<00:05:51.810> some<00:05:51.840> more

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
took the pounds off and put some more

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.800 
took the pounds off and put some more
water<00:05:52.320> and<00:05:52.590> a<00:05:52.740> little<00:05:52.919> bit<00:05:53.009> of<00:05:53.100> water<00:05:53.750> and<00:05:54.750> now

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
water and a little bit of water and now

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.350 
water and a little bit of water and now
I'm<00:05:54.990> trying<00:05:55.259> to<00:05:55.289> recondition<00:05:56.250> it<00:05:59.090> it<00:06:00.090> looks

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
I'm trying to recondition it it looks

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.330 
I'm trying to recondition it it looks
like<00:06:00.449> to<00:06:00.870> me<00:06:01.020> is<00:06:01.050> whoever<00:06:01.560> put<00:06:01.830> this<00:06:01.919> battery

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
like to me is whoever put this battery

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.870 
like to me is whoever put this battery
in<00:06:02.550> do<00:06:02.729> not<00:06:02.880> put<00:06:03.120> any<00:06:03.270> battery<00:06:03.600> acid<00:06:03.750> in<00:06:04.110> it

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
in do not put any battery acid in it

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.500 
in do not put any battery acid in it
which<00:06:05.880> could<00:06:06.270> happen<00:06:06.750> because<00:06:08.300> there's<00:06:09.300> a<00:06:09.360> lot

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
which could happen because there's a lot

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.150 
which could happen because there's a lot
of<00:06:09.600> dumb<00:06:09.780> people<00:06:10.139> that<00:06:10.229> put<00:06:10.770> these<00:06:10.919> bikes

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
of dumb people that put these bikes

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.340 
of dumb people that put these bikes
together<00:06:14.150> so<00:06:15.150> we're<00:06:15.389> I'm<00:06:15.660> gonna<00:06:15.810> let<00:06:16.229> that

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
together so we're I'm gonna let that

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.790 
together so we're I'm gonna let that
charge<00:06:16.680> or<00:06:16.800> don't<00:06:17.039> see<00:06:17.190> what<00:06:17.310> we<00:06:17.370> can<00:06:17.490> do<00:06:17.610> this

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
charge or don't see what we can do this

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.070 
charge or don't see what we can do this
that's<00:06:19.800> where<00:06:19.979> we're<00:06:20.100> at<00:06:20.130> so<00:06:20.370> far<00:06:20.870> the<00:06:21.870> one

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
that's where we're at so far the one

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.129 
that's where we're at so far the one
thing<00:06:22.260> I<00:06:22.350> don't<00:06:22.410> see<00:06:23.780> I'll<00:06:24.780> show<00:06:24.930> you<00:06:25.020> where

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
thing I don't see I'll show you where

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.800 
thing I don't see I'll show you where
your<00:06:25.289> your<00:06:25.860> spark<00:06:26.160> plug<00:06:26.400> is<00:06:27.240> right<00:06:27.570> down<00:06:27.780> here

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
your your spark plug is right down here

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.180 
your your spark plug is right down here
but<00:06:28.199> you're<00:06:28.320> gonna<00:06:28.380> have<00:06:28.620> to<00:06:28.710> take<00:06:28.919> all<00:06:29.070> the

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
but you're gonna have to take all the

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.430 
but you're gonna have to take all the
guts<00:06:29.370> off<00:06:29.610> to<00:06:29.760> get<00:06:29.849> to<00:06:29.910> it

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
guts off to get to it

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.560 
guts off to get to it
the<00:06:31.440> olive<00:06:32.250> floorboards<00:06:32.820> to<00:06:33.150> put<00:06:33.300> on<00:06:33.389> a<00:06:33.419> new

the olive floorboards to put on a new
spark<00:06:33.870> plug<00:06:34.080> and<00:06:35.630> I<00:06:36.630> don't<00:06:36.690> see<00:06:37.050> any<00:06:37.259> other

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:37.699 
spark plug and I don't see any other

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.150 
spark plug and I don't see any other
problem<00:06:38.699> with<00:06:38.789> wiring<00:06:39.470> except<00:06:40.470> my<00:06:40.560> schematics

show a solenoid that's supposed to spark

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:53.260 
show a solenoid that's supposed to spark
this<00:06:44.130> um<00:06:46.280> this<00:06:49.699> alternator<00:06:50.699> generator<00:06:51.000> off

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
this um this alternator generator off

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.000 
this um this alternator generator off
and<00:06:54.270> it's<00:06:54.659> supposed<00:06:55.050> to<00:06:55.139> be<00:06:55.320> somewhere<00:06:55.770> in

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
and it's supposed to be somewhere in

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.460 
and it's supposed to be somewhere in
here<00:06:56.310> and<00:06:56.430> I<00:06:56.520> don't<00:06:56.729> see<00:06:57.000> one<00:06:57.210> I'll<00:06:57.930> check<00:06:58.320> my

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470 
here and I don't see one I'll check my

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.230 
here and I don't see one I'll check my
schematics<00:06:59.099> again<00:06:59.310> maybe<00:06:59.520> it's<00:06:59.729> different<00:07:00.120> on

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
schematics again maybe it's different on

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.969 
schematics again maybe it's different on
this<00:07:00.419> year<00:07:00.870> bike<00:07:01.139> but<00:07:01.500> most<00:07:01.710> of<00:07:01.800> them<00:07:01.919> are

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:01.979 
this year bike but most of them are

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:06.950 
this year bike but most of them are
exactly<00:07:02.099> the<00:07:02.550> same<00:07:03.050> except<00:07:04.050> for<00:07:04.080> color<00:07:05.870> so<00:07:06.870> I'm

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
exactly the same except for color so I'm

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.960 
exactly the same except for color so I'm
gonna<00:07:07.110> let<00:07:07.260> that<00:07:07.289> charge<00:07:08.280> up<00:07:08.520> and<00:07:08.699> we'll<00:07:08.820> take

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:08.970 
gonna let that charge up and we'll take

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.599 
gonna let that charge up and we'll take
a<00:07:09.060> look<00:07:09.150> at<00:07:09.270> it<00:07:09.360> in<00:07:09.419> the<00:07:09.479> morning
