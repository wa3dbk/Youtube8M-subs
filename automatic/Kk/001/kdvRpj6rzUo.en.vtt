just as such there's also the right
click<00:02:34.130> method<00:02:34.310> which<00:02:34.670> then<00:02:34.910> opens<00:02:35.390> up<00:02:35.510> this

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
click method which then opens up this

click method which then opens up this
box<00:02:36.260> here<00:02:36.650> which<00:02:36.710> you<00:02:37.280> can<00:02:37.490> then<00:02:37.520> move<00:02:38.210> an

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
box here which you can then move an

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.590 
box here which you can then move an
object<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:40.540> if<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.780> actually<00:02:41.960> know<00:02:42.380> what<00:02:43.600> how

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
object and if you actually know what how

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.560 
object and if you actually know what how
you<00:02:44.660> want<00:02:45.020> your<00:02:45.080> object<00:02:45.440> position<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:47.150> rotate

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
you want your object position the rotate

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.660 
you want your object position the rotate
button<00:02:47.600> has<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.380> same<00:02:48.680> thing<00:02:48.950> as<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.520> right

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
button has the same thing as the right

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.110 
button has the same thing as the right
click<00:02:49.850> as<00:02:50.000> well<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:51.530> also<00:02:51.710> can<00:02:52.310> be<00:02:52.610> rotated

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
click as well it also can be rotated

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.520 
click as well it also can be rotated
using<00:02:54.310> basically<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.610> anchors<00:02:56.290> they're<00:02:57.290> part

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
using basically the anchors they're part

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.370 
using basically the anchors they're part
of<00:02:57.560> me<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.800> compass

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
of me the compass

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.580 
of me the compass
and<00:02:59.610> you<00:03:00.610> have<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.760> scale<00:03:01.030> now<00:03:01.480> scale<00:03:01.960> there<00:03:02.320> are

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
and you have a scale now scale there are

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.300 
and you have a scale now scale there are
actually<00:03:03.190> three<00:03:03.580> different<00:03:03.610> versions<00:03:05.310> this

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
actually three different versions this

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.580 
actually three different versions this
one<00:03:06.550> is<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:07.030> selected<00:03:07.420> on<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:07.780> for<00:03:08.020> scale<00:03:08.350> and

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
one is the selected on you for scale and

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.480 
one is the selected on you for scale and
what<00:03:08.740> it<00:03:08.860> does<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:10.060> will<00:03:10.150> scale<00:03:11.490> uniformly

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
what it does is it will scale uniformly

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.040 
what it does is it will scale uniformly
if<00:03:12.700> you<00:03:12.820> use<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:12.970> center<00:03:13.450> but<00:03:13.630> if<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.840> use<00:03:13.870> the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
if you use the center but if you use the

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.830 
if you use the center but if you use the
middle<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.880> will<00:03:16.180> scale<00:03:16.720> differently<00:03:17.760> than

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
middle it will scale differently than

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.320 
middle it will scale differently than
your<00:03:19.840> regular<00:03:19.990> scale<00:03:20.560> function

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
sort of no notice here but I'm using

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.820 
sort of no notice here but I'm using
these<00:03:27.710> different<00:03:28.640> angles<00:03:29.390> here<00:03:29.660> it's<00:03:30.380> scales

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
these different angles here it's scales

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.530 
these different angles here it's scales
differently<00:03:31.340> but<00:03:31.460> if<00:03:31.580> i<00:03:31.670> use<00:03:31.820> all<00:03:31.970> four<00:03:32.300> they

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
differently but if i use all four they

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.559 
differently but if i use all four they
all<00:03:32.660> scale<00:03:33.050> in<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.260> same<00:03:33.470> direction

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
selecting squash what that does is it

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.640 
selecting squash what that does is it
allows<00:03:42.719> you<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:44.030> squash<00:03:45.030> an<00:03:45.299> object<00:03:45.780> almost

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.819 

use<00:03:49.650> this<00:03:49.889> for<00:03:50.810> round<00:03:51.810> objects<00:03:52.349> objects<00:03:52.709> if

use this for round objects objects if

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.849 
use this for round objects objects if
you're<00:03:52.950> trying<00:03:53.099> to<00:03:53.249> squash<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:54.090> suppose<00:03:54.859> the

you're trying to squash I suppose the

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.080 
you're trying to squash I suppose the
more<00:03:56.129> commonly<00:03:56.519> when<00:03:56.670> you<00:03:56.730> want<00:03:56.849> to<00:03:56.939> use<00:03:57.060> a

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
more commonly when you want to use a

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
selecting uniform scale just because

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.240 
selecting uniform scale just because
it's<00:04:00.409> more<00:04:01.670> it's<00:04:02.670> better<00:04:02.939> in<00:04:03.150> my<00:04:03.329> opinion<00:04:04.250> but

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
it's more it's better in my opinion but

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.449 
it's more it's better in my opinion but
I<00:04:05.310> mean<00:04:05.639> send<00:04:06.239> people<00:04:06.389> use<00:04:06.750> different<00:04:07.560> ones<00:04:07.919> to

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
I mean send people use different ones to

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
different views here obviously the pic

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.960

for my own reasons it's to me kind of an
Amish<00:05:17.120> thing<00:05:17.360> to<00:05:17.450> do<00:05:19.000> mere<00:05:20.000> button<00:05:20.300> allows<00:05:20.720> you

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
Amish thing to do mere button allows you

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.230 
Amish thing to do mere button allows you
to<00:05:20.990> near<00:05:21.170> an<00:05:21.290> object<00:05:21.680> we<00:05:22.100> have<00:05:22.250> to<00:05:22.340> select<00:05:22.700> copy

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
to near an object we have to select copy

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.380 
to near an object we have to select copy
and<00:05:23.860> obviously<00:05:24.860> you'll<00:05:25.160> see<00:05:25.370> a<00:05:25.610> copy<00:05:26.030> of<00:05:26.180> it

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
and obviously you'll see a copy of it

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.130 
and obviously you'll see a copy of it
and<00:05:26.570> also<00:05:26.780> offset<00:05:27.230> it<00:05:27.710> if<00:05:27.860> you'd<00:05:28.460> like<00:05:29.140> you
