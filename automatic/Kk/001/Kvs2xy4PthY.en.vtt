matter from the animals and from the

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.810 
matter from the animals and from the
food<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:26.869> forms<00:01:27.380> this<00:01:27.619> really<00:01:28.549> black<00:01:29.500> sticky

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
food it forms this really black sticky

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.480 
food it forms this really black sticky
unsightly<00:01:31.820> stinky<00:01:32.659> queue<00:01:33.140> so<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.070> next<00:01:34.250> step

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
unsightly stinky queue so the next step

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.529 
unsightly stinky queue so the next step
we're<00:01:34.640> going<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:34.789> do<00:01:35.030> is<00:01:35.240> we're<00:01:35.390> actually

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
going to open up the water flow through

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.910 
going to open up the water flow through
here<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:41.030> try<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:41.689> push<00:01:42.109> as<00:01:42.320> much<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:42.829> this

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
here and try and push as much of this

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.039 
here and try and push as much of this
stuff<00:01:43.219> out<00:01:43.460> of<00:01:43.520> this<00:01:43.820> pipe<00:01:44.090> as<00:01:44.329> we<00:01:44.479> can<00:01:44.780> all

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.200 
stuff out of this pipe as we can all
this<00:01:45.259> water<00:01:45.560> I'll<00:01:45.829> actually<00:01:46.070> just<00:01:46.310> drain<00:01:46.939> out

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
this water I'll actually just drain out

into<00:04:10.060> this<00:04:10.180> Basin<00:04:10.660> here<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.280> we<00:04:12.280> let<00:04:12.459> it

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
into this Basin here and we let it

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.759 
into this Basin here and we let it
settle<00:04:12.850> out<00:04:13.060> gravity<00:04:13.690> will<00:04:13.870> allow<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.260> the

we will never get all of that stuff out

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.710 
we will never get all of that stuff out
of<00:04:43.950> the<00:04:44.100> sand<00:04:44.370> over<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:45.030> over<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.360> course<00:04:45.570> of

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
of the sand over and over the course of

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.440 
of the sand over and over the course of
you<00:04:45.840> know<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:45.960> year<00:04:46.230> two<00:04:46.470> years<00:04:46.740> three<00:04:46.830> years

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
you know a year two years three years

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.280 
you know a year two years three years
you<00:04:48.450> actually<00:04:48.570> started<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.050> get<00:04:49.110> what's

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
you actually started to get what's

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.110 
you actually started to get what's
called<00:04:49.440> a<00:04:49.500> biofilm<00:04:49.740> building<00:04:50.700> up<00:04:50.820> on<00:04:51.000> the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
called a biofilm building up on the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.940 
called a biofilm building up on the
outside<00:04:51.600> of<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.810> sand<00:04:52.080> so<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.680> sand

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
outside of the sand so the sand

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.410 
outside of the sand so the sand
basically<00:04:53.220> will<00:04:53.580> start<00:04:53.790> to<00:04:53.850> get<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.000> slime

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
basically will start to get a slime

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.450 
basically will start to get a slime
building<00:04:54.930> over<00:04:55.200> it<00:04:55.290> once<00:04:55.830> that<00:04:56.040> starts<00:04:56.370> to

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
building over it once that starts to

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.250 
building over it once that starts to
take<00:04:56.610> place<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:57.270> sand<00:04:57.510> filler<00:04:57.750> doesn't<00:04:58.140> work

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
take place the sand filler doesn't work

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.440 
take place the sand filler doesn't work
as<00:04:58.410> efficiently<00:04:58.890> as<00:04:59.010> it<00:04:59.160> should<00:04:59.430> so<00:04:59.700> what<00:05:00.300> we

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
as efficiently as it should so what we

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.180 
as efficiently as it should so what we
need<00:05:00.600> to<00:05:00.630> do<00:05:00.840> is<00:05:01.260> bring<00:05:01.590> in<00:05:01.740> an<00:05:01.830> outside

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
need to do is bring in an outside
