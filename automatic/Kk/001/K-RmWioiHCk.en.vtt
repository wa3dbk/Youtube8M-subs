00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.609
 challenging game hero 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.920
 There was an opinion about the invoker as it is possible 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.840
 learn to play only a month or even 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.700
 years of hard training but in my opinion 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.670
 guide you learn to play for him 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.670

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.119

 from seeing that I almost paid for 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.600
 it's your life 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.180
 invoker essentially unique 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.220
 character and all this thanks to their 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.830
 scion skills we have kvass wax and 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.530
 export ul ul Invoker vaseline 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.020
 one of the most terrifying passive skills 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.739
 all games she lubricates our attacks 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.450
 petroleum jelly 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.060
 allowing them to penetrate deeper into the body 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.030
 our enemies and inflict destructive 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.790
 hurricane on the first level I recommend 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.830
 take a brew with the help of the class you can 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.620
 not only quench thirst after heavy 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.959
 combat but also add a unique effect to your 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.750
 attacks which while slow down 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.330
 opponent at the second level take wax 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.700
 wax is very good if it is against you 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.340
 any fan of croaking because 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.150
 them you can slap company three three four 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.550
 five and even six seconds many lovers 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.920
 open this invoker on the third level 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.200
 but they didn't play the first dota and not 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.600
 know that you first need 3 times in a row 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.060
 take the escort then we will be much 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.310
 it's easier not only to kill little creeps 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.730
 but also show who is the main folder on 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.730
 the lines 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.970
 now move on to the main purchase so 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.720
 as invoker after research ulta and 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.220
 begins to put horrific tons of damage 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.099
 no attack items 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.099
 I usually collect the invoker tank or 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:24.920
 invoker trick and today i will show you 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.230
 invoker stunner and to muddy the tricks 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.200
 first we need to face dagi 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.450
 with him you can instantly move into 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.090
 space causing the enemy attacks 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.010
 scare after you have compiled blink 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.170
 dagger collect after force 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.129
 a staff of strength allows a trick almost 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.900
 invoker only 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.230
 but also use for your tricks 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.629
 allies or enemies but it is still 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.239
 not all stick of strength gives us so much 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.540
 raspberries what a unique class effect 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.819
 can be left on until the end of the battle 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.970
 here is an example of perfect tricks 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.400

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.400
