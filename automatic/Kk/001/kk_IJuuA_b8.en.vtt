to<00:01:28.709> know<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:30.330> rocks<00:01:30.569> in<00:01:31.410> Xiamen<00:01:32.039> forests

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
to know that the rocks in Xiamen forests

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.969 
to know that the rocks in Xiamen forests
were<00:01:32.670> too<00:01:32.880> old<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.990> contain<00:01:34.319> fossils<00:01:34.830> they

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
were too old to contain fossils they

were too old to contain fossils they
were<00:01:35.039> Precambrian<00:01:35.819> so<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.479> went<00:01:36.720> down<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.080> had

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
were Precambrian so I went down and had

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.370 
were Precambrian so I went down and had
a<00:01:37.259> look<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.660> it<00:01:39.660> certainly<00:01:40.170> was<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.830> very<00:01:41.250> clear

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
a look and it certainly was a very clear

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.999 
a look and it certainly was a very clear
fossil<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.709> a<00:01:43.740> later<00:01:44.399> visit<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.170> made<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> rubbing

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
fossil on a later visit I made a rubbing

fossil on a later visit I made a rubbing
of<00:01:47.039> the<00:01:47.390> fossil<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.630> put<00:01:48.929> a<00:01:48.959> piece<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.440> paper

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
of the fossil I put a piece of paper

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:54.020 
of the fossil I put a piece of paper
over<00:01:50.069> it<00:01:50.429> and<00:01:50.780> rubbed<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:52.020> wax<00:01:52.289> crayon<00:01:53.190> on<00:01:53.459> top

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
where the fossil occurred and we showed

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.980 
where the fossil occurred and we showed
him<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.150> fossil<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.760> he<00:02:39.760> very<00:02:40.030> famously<00:02:40.630> said

him the fossil and he very famously said

him the fossil and he very famously said
my<00:02:41.350> god<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:42.070> is<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.820> result<00:02:43.480> of<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:43.720> was<00:02:43.990> that

that<00:04:31.180> it<00:04:31.300> was<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.840> fossil<00:04:32.229> she<00:04:32.440> had<00:04:32.530> seen<00:04:32.860> but

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
that it was the fossil she had seen but

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.709 
that it was the fossil she had seen but
she'd<00:04:34.300> spoken<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:35.200> her<00:04:35.530> school<00:04:35.890> teach

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:36.719 
she'd spoken to her school teach

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:40.580 
she'd spoken to her school teach
who<00:04:37.110> didn't<00:04:37.559> believe<00:04:38.129> her<00:04:38.520> because<00:04:39.590> everyone

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
who didn't believe her because everyone

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.999 
who didn't believe her because everyone
knew<00:04:40.949> that<00:04:41.909> the<00:04:42.090> rocks<00:04:42.300> in<00:04:42.539> Charnwood<00:04:42.960> forest

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
knew that the rocks in Charnwood forest

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:49.489 
knew that the rocks in Charnwood forest
were<00:04:44.009> too<00:04:44.849> old<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:46.620> contain<00:04:47.039> fossils<00:04:47.759> and<00:04:48.499> so

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:49.499 
were too old to contain fossils and so

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:52.489 
were too old to contain fossils and so
for<00:04:50.389> nearly<00:04:51.389> 50<00:04:51.809> years

00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:52.499 
for nearly 50 years

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:55.100 
for nearly 50 years
she<00:04:53.490> hadn't<00:04:53.789> realized<00:04:54.180> that<00:04:54.419> she<00:04:54.599> really<00:04:54.900> did

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
she hadn't realized that she really did

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.570 
she hadn't realized that she really did
see<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:55.919> fossil<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:57.439> I'm<00:04:58.439> very<00:04:58.770> pleased<00:04:59.129> that

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
see the fossil and I'm very pleased that

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.760 
see the fossil and I'm very pleased that
