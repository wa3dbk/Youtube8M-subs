 consider the house of whom si ji so 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.460
 let's look at it from the inside first 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.040

 there is a window in front and behind 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.120
 behind at all 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.120
 cannot be seen as well 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.079
 so here too the window also has three windows 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.079
 there is nothing 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.400
 I'm here 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.310
 pictures do not just now see 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.720
 so here we go 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.720
 let's see what's behind the garage 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.610
 a small plus three times as a garden 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.720
 also penny box 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.720
 well let's go inside 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.330
 let's see what is there 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.020
 inside as we see again the very thing 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.960
 window and two doors like we just 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.530
 seen inside there is no well, that is, you can 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.370
 say the door is nowhere to everyones 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.270
 photos 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:06.940
 well it is generally nearby is on 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:11.500
 know this forest is most likely a hand 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:15.610
 and here we see the CJ itself it is near 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.550
 hospitals have not mistaken this picture with 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.880
 beta versions and 3 even say it 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.770
 sija young with his mom but that's all 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.569
 lie and the game console has a TV 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:33.049
 also good seats 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.209
 here we see the car from the game gta 4 also 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:39.349
 all sorts of nra 69 which often 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.870
 repeated in the game motorcycle from the game gta 4 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.329
 most likely it was just a sketch 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.530
 then we have entered the game here we will see 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:52.450
 saving also after passing the game 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.450
 you will be available here as a weapon 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.280
 even we see rockstar drinks 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.900
 is a prototype 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.560
 I remember nothing but what shells are and 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.770
 of course what is it 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.860
 juice pops probably already long ago 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.959
 overdue banks lie here 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.780
 microwave dish of Vladimir in 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.450
 In general, everything is like people 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.370
 microwave 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.030
 let's go up to the second floor and 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.030
 let's see what is there 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.530
 what we see here is a camera and 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.220
 spray can well if not mistaken spray 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.980
 immediately available immediately about it too 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.490
 also the window that we saw the picture 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.850
 something and of course this code is about it 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:47.360
 There are many interesting myths but this is a cat 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.030
 one of the game developers in the same 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.140
 there they wrote a bedside table for some reason 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.980
 there are also no magazines and here we are 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.980
 see just 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:06.700
 terrain in the game gta san andreas this 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:10.360
 las vegas being in the game this is you venturus 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.980
 even as CJ on a stroller and of course 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.320
 everything else 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:21.750
 what is the door here door the door is closed 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.750
 let's go in here this is a wardrobe 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.270
 how our radio plays have also all 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.840
 Finnish board which shows 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:36.610
 snapshot from gta wai city 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:38.830
 well here shelves what else 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.560
 or closed and of course my favorite 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.240
 mirror 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.740
 if I'm not mistaken, then it can shoot 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.780
 from bazooka 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.780
 I don't remember the base exactly as a cat 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.969
 so we will not check 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.579
 you all people know that just 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:02.889
 rocket launcher somewhere flies incomprehensible where 

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:06.550
 and at 102 views 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.970
 I'm talking about anti ghosts 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.970
 what else 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.880
 the flower is here again the door 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.870
 which again leads nowhere like you 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.680
 remember the background she had a cup 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.150
 still this house is a prototype but 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.620
 really have the house probably already seen 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:33.699
 all kinds of memes from the internet home mega and 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:38.750
 other but it's all a lie of course 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:41.470
 is not this a reality of course 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.090
 there is such a house in los angeles too 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:49.070
 there is no correct captain on mine 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:50.210
 wrong well so here it is here it is 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.009
 map 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:57.350

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:59.960
