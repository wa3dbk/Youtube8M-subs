hello welcome to our new support video

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.210 
hello welcome to our new support video
today<00:00:04.140> we're<00:00:04.350> going<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.560> be<00:00:04.650> showing<00:00:04.920> you<00:00:05.160> how

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
today we're going to be showing you how

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.179 
today we're going to be showing you how
to<00:00:05.400> fill<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.600> prime<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.020> continuous<00:00:07.770> ink<00:00:07.980> system

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
to fill a prime a continuous ink system

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.589 
to fill a prime a continuous ink system
for<00:00:08.790> brother<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:09.929> one<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.620> LC<00:00:11.280> 980<00:00:11.880> or

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
for brother so this one is the LC 980 or

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.000 
for brother so this one is the LC 980 or
the<00:00:13.110> LC<00:00:13.610> 1100<00:00:14.610> or<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.809> video<00:00:16.109> also<00:00:16.379> covers

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the LC 1100 or so this video also covers

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.550 
the LC 1100 or so this video also covers
the<00:00:17.039> LC<00:00:17.850> 9<00:00:18.150> 8<00:00:18.539> 5<00:00:19.160> and<00:00:20.160> also<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:21.029> an<00:00:21.240> LC<00:00:21.630> 1240

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
the LC 9 8 5 and also this is an LC 1240

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.790 
the LC 9 8 5 and also this is an LC 1240
cartridge<00:00:23.189> or<00:00:23.760> healthy<00:00:24.269> 1280<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.289> although

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
cartridge or healthy 1280 so although

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.310 
cartridge or healthy 1280 so although
the<00:00:26.070> cartridges<00:00:26.670> are<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:27.060> bit<00:00:27.449> different<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the cartridges are a bit different the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.380 
the cartridges are a bit different the
principle<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.070> what<00:00:29.609> I'm<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> do<00:00:30.150> is

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
principle of what I'm going to do is

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.900 
principle of what I'm going to do is
exactly<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.140> same<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.340> cut<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> video

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
exactly the same so to cut the video

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.479 
exactly the same so to cut the video
time<00:00:33.300> down<00:00:33.600> I've<00:00:33.870> already<00:00:34.230> filled<00:00:34.530> three<00:00:35.280> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
time down I've already filled three of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.340 
time down I've already filled three of
the<00:00:35.670> reservoirs<00:00:36.239> I've<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.690> left<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.079> one

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
the reservoirs I've just left this one

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.860 
the reservoirs I've just left this one
till<00:00:37.620> last<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.370> show<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.629> what<00:00:39.780> you

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
till last just to show you so what you

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.600 
till last just to show you so what you
need<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.170> do<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.800> start<00:00:41.070> with<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.399> need<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
need to do is to start with you need to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.850 
need to do is to start with you need to
remove<00:00:42.120> both<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.110> plugs<00:00:43.500> from<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
remove both the plugs from the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.090 
remove both the plugs from the
continuous<00:00:44.550> ink<00:00:44.879> system<00:00:45.500> and<00:00:46.500> then<00:00:46.680> with<00:00:46.860> your

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
continuous ink system and then with your

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.840 
continuous ink system and then with your
ink<00:00:47.370> if<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.450> our<00:00:48.660> ink<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.500> remove<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.670> cap

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
ink if it's our ink just remove the cap

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.630 
ink if it's our ink just remove the cap
off<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.300> top<00:00:51.739> what<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.829> need<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.460> these

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
off the top what you need to do is these

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.670 
off the top what you need to do is these
are<00:00:53.820> all<00:00:53.910> foil<00:00:54.300> seal<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.989> maintain<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
are all foil seal to maintain the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.709 
are all foil seal to maintain the
freshness<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.879> need<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.210> get<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:57.600> you're

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
freshness so you need to get if you're

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.869 
freshness so you need to get if you're
going<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.899> pour<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.500> me<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.579> need<00:00:59.760> to

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
going to pour it in like me you need to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.639 
going to pour it in like me you need to
get<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> nice<00:01:00.270> clean<00:01:00.570> cut<00:01:00.899> edge<00:01:01.109> around<00:01:01.320> this

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
get a nice clean cut edge around this

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.039 
get a nice clean cut edge around this
around<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> side<00:01:02.399> or<00:01:02.969> alternatively<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.750> can

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
around the side or alternatively you can

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.740 
around the side or alternatively you can
use<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.500> syringe<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:06.030> do<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.479> way<00:01:06.689> so

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
use the syringe and do it that way so

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.800 
use the syringe and do it that way so
I'm<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> get<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:08.479> clean<00:01:09.479> cut<00:01:09.510> edge<00:01:11.810> there

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
I'm going to get a clean cut edge there

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.690 
I'm going to get a clean cut edge there
we<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:13.470> I'm<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.010> simply<00:01:14.220> pour

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
we are and then I'm going to simply pour

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.490 
we are and then I'm going to simply pour
it<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.720> haven't<00:01:15.930> got<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> steady

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
it in so if you haven't got a steady

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.100 
it in so if you haven't got a steady
hand<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.950> recommend<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.729> use<00:01:18.110> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
hand we recommend that you use the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.820 
hand we recommend that you use the
syringe<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.280> provide<00:01:20.729> with<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.000> kit<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
syringe that we provide with the kit to

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.190 
syringe that we provide with the kit to
fill<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.009> system<00:01:23.540> so<00:01:24.540> I'm<00:01:24.630> going<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> put<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
fill the system so I'm going to put the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.340 
fill the system so I'm going to put the
whole<00:01:25.430> 100<00:01:26.430> mil<00:01:26.869> straight<00:01:27.869> into<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
whole 100 mil straight into the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.570 
whole 100 mil straight into the
reservoir

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.980 

there<00:01:36.580> we<00:01:36.670> are<00:01:36.700> so<00:01:37.060> I've<00:01:37.300> put<00:01:37.510> that<00:01:37.690> hundred

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
there we are so I've put that hundred

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.900 
there we are so I've put that hundred
million<00:01:38.290> so<00:01:38.440> you<00:01:38.530> can<00:01:38.680> see<00:01:38.860> at<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.040> moment<00:01:39.070> the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
million so you can see at the moment the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.180 
million so you can see at the moment the
incline<00:01:40.360> for<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.870> yellow<00:01:41.200> is<00:01:41.500> completely

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
incline for the yellow is completely

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.250 
incline for the yellow is completely
empty<00:01:42.370> all<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.820> way<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.210> reservoir<00:01:43.750> so

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
empty all the way to the reservoir so

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.290 
empty all the way to the reservoir so
what<00:01:44.380> we<00:01:44.530> need<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.740> do<00:01:45.040> is<00:01:45.190> we<00:01:45.430> need<00:01:45.610> to<00:01:45.820> fill<00:01:46.180> it

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
what we need to do is we need to fill it

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.270 
what we need to do is we need to fill it
in<00:01:46.390> Primus<00:01:46.900> and<00:01:47.080> we<00:01:47.140> need<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.470> fill<00:01:48.070> this

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
in Primus and we need to fill this

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.600 
in Primus and we need to fill this
cartridge<00:01:48.760> with<00:01:49.090> ink<00:01:49.390> so<00:01:49.690> if<00:01:50.140> we<00:01:50.350> ever<00:01:50.470> send<00:01:50.830> an

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
cartridge with ink so if we ever send an

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.900 
cartridge with ink so if we ever send an
empty<00:01:52.030> continuous<00:01:52.720> ink<00:01:52.990> system<00:01:53.580> we<00:01:54.580> normally

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
empty continuous ink system we normally

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.630 
empty continuous ink system we normally
say<00:01:55.119> like<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.450> special<00:01:55.960> adapter<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:57.460> adapter

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
say like a special adapter the adapter

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.390 
say like a special adapter the adapter
it'll<00:01:58.630> be<00:01:58.720> a<00:01:58.750> small<00:01:59.050> white<00:01:59.860> plastic<00:02:00.369> piece

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
it'll be a small white plastic piece

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.609 
it'll be a small white plastic piece
like<00:02:00.880> this<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:02.200> then<00:02:02.350> we<00:02:02.470> do<00:02:02.590> syringe<00:02:04.619> now

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
like this and then we do syringe now

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:06.780 
like this and then we do syringe now
what<00:02:05.800> we're<00:02:05.950> going<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.130> do<00:02:06.280> is<00:02:06.430> we're<00:02:06.610> going<00:02:06.640> to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.050 
what we're going to do is we're going to
put<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:08.229> adapter<00:02:08.470> into<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.070> ink<00:02:09.250> outlet<00:02:09.759> port

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
put the adapter into the ink outlet port

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.449 
put the adapter into the ink outlet port
of<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.360> cartridge<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:11.020> at<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.230> moment

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
of the cartridge so at the moment

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.070 
of the cartridge so at the moment
there's<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:12.550> piece<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.790> plastic<00:02:13.360> on<00:02:13.570> here<00:02:13.900> which

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
there's a piece of plastic on here which

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.500 
there's a piece of plastic on here which
hasn't<00:02:14.350> been<00:02:14.560> perforated<00:02:15.489> so<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:16.180> hasn't<00:02:16.330> been

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
hasn't been perforated so it hasn't been

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.449 
hasn't been perforated so it hasn't been
perforated<00:02:17.320> because<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.680> hasn't<00:02:17.860> been<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.370> the

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
perforated because it hasn't been in the

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.460 
perforated because it hasn't been in the
printer<00:02:18.880> yeah<00:02:19.000> normally<00:02:19.780> when<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.050> goes<00:02:20.230> into

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
printer yeah normally when it goes into

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.560 
printer yeah normally when it goes into
the<00:02:20.680> printer<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.610> plastic<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.300> just

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
the printer that plastic is just

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.600 
the printer that plastic is just
perforate<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.170> anyway<00:02:23.739> so<00:02:24.220> what<00:02:24.340> we're<00:02:24.489> going

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
perforate it anyway so what we're going

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.590 
perforate it anyway so what we're going
to<00:02:24.700> do<00:02:24.880> is<00:02:25.060> we're<00:02:25.209> going<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.420> stab<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.780> in<00:02:27.600> push

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
to do is we're going to stab it in push

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.690 
to do is we're going to stab it in push
it<00:02:28.750> down<00:02:28.959> there<00:02:29.470> are<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.130> inside<00:02:30.580> the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
it down there are so inside the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.840 
it down there are so inside the
cartridge<00:02:31.270> is<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.450> small<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.040> small<00:02:33.459> spring

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
cartridge is a small is a small spring

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.210 
cartridge is a small is a small spring
valve<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.570> ink<00:02:35.020> won't<00:02:35.260> start<00:02:35.680> flowing<00:02:36.100> until

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
valve so ink won't start flowing until

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.010 
valve so ink won't start flowing until
that<00:02:36.640> valve<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.150> pressed<00:02:37.540> so<00:02:37.630> what<00:02:37.870> we're

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
that valve is pressed so what we're

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.930 
that valve is pressed so what we're
going<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.290> do<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:38.680> we're<00:02:39.130> going<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.340> press<00:02:39.549> down

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
going to do is we're going to press down

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.160 
going to do is we're going to press down
on<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.780> syringe<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.920> open<00:02:42.280> up<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.519> valve

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
on the syringe to open up the valve

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.190 
on the syringe to open up the valve
let's<00:02:44.170> just<00:02:44.380> move<00:02:44.620> this<00:02:44.830> ink<00:02:45.100> line<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.989> then

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
let's just move this ink line and then

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.020 
let's just move this ink line and then
we're<00:02:47.470> going<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.650> draw<00:02:47.950> back<00:02:48.250> on<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.700> syringe

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
we're going to draw back on the syringe

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.289 
we're going to draw back on the syringe
in<00:02:49.209> your<00:02:49.239> C<00:02:50.160> being<00:02:51.160> shooting<00:02:51.760> down<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.120> line

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
in your C being shooting down the line

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.990 
in your C being shooting down the line
and<00:02:52.570> it's<00:02:52.720> going<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.930> start<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.530> fill<00:02:54.000> the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
and it's going to start to fill the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.449 
and it's going to start to fill the
cartridge<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:56.500> sometimes<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.100> have<00:02:57.280> to

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
cartridge so sometimes you have to

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.150 
cartridge so sometimes you have to
repeat<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:58.000> maybe<00:02:58.299> two<00:02:58.660> or<00:02:58.780> three<00:02:58.810> times<00:02:59.160> and

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
repeat this maybe two or three times and

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.289 
repeat this maybe two or three times and
what<00:03:00.370> you're<00:03:00.489> looking<00:03:00.760> for<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.060> you're<00:03:01.180> gonna

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
what you're looking for is you're gonna

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.240 
what you're looking for is you're gonna
keep<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.780> pressure<00:03:02.049> on<00:03:02.230> until<00:03:02.860> it's<00:03:03.070> no

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
keep the pressure on until it's no

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.800 
keep the pressure on until it's no
longer<00:03:03.450> rising

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
longer rising

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.530 
longer rising
so<00:03:05.320> once<00:03:05.530> ink<00:03:06.070> levels<00:03:06.489> stop<00:03:06.790> rising<00:03:07.060> you're

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
so once ink levels stop rising you're

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.350 
so once ink levels stop rising you're
going<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.750> take<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.110> syringe<00:03:08.470> out<00:03:09.209> expel<00:03:10.209> the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
going to take the syringe out expel the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.979 
going to take the syringe out expel the
air<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:11.700> then<00:03:12.700> put<00:03:13.239> it<00:03:13.329> back<00:03:13.360> in<00:03:13.690> again<00:03:13.810> and

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
air and then put it back in again and

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.800 
air and then put it back in again and
just<00:03:14.260> repeat<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.829> process<00:03:14.860> so<00:03:15.570> it's<00:03:16.570> still

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
just repeat the process so it's still

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.199 
just repeat the process so it's still
rising<00:03:17.019> but<00:03:17.380> it's<00:03:17.799> gone<00:03:18.070> very<00:03:18.370> slow<00:03:18.670> now<00:03:18.940> so

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
rising but it's gone very slow now so

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.610 
rising but it's gone very slow now so
we've<00:03:19.360> lost<00:03:19.540> pressure<00:03:19.900> so<00:03:20.140> I'm<00:03:20.230> going<00:03:20.350> to<00:03:20.410> take

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
we've lost pressure so I'm going to take

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.100 
we've lost pressure so I'm going to take
it<00:03:20.769> out<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.910> then<00:03:22.060> I'm<00:03:22.209> just<00:03:22.239> going<00:03:22.570> to<00:03:22.630> expel

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
it out and then I'm just going to expel

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.580 
it out and then I'm just going to expel
the<00:03:23.320> air<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:24.690> then<00:03:25.690> pop<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.079> back<00:03:26.110> in<00:03:26.470> again

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
the air and then pop it back in again

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.920 
the air and then pop it back in again
and<00:03:27.010> then<00:03:27.340> I'm<00:03:27.489> going<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:27.700> repeat<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.180> process

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.300 

so<00:03:31.930> what<00:03:32.079> you<00:03:32.170> need<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.500> do<00:03:32.650> is<00:03:32.769> you<00:03:32.890> just<00:03:33.070> need

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
so what you need to do is you just need

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.130 
so what you need to do is you just need
to<00:03:33.430> keep<00:03:33.640> doing<00:03:34.030> it<00:03:34.150> until<00:03:34.209> you<00:03:34.480> get<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.750> small

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
to keep doing it until you get a small

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.759 
to keep doing it until you get a small
amount<00:03:35.620> of<00:03:35.860> ink<00:03:36.070> in<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.660> syringe<00:03:38.019> once<00:03:38.590> you've

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
amount of ink in the syringe once you've

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.039 
amount of ink in the syringe once you've
got<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:38.980> small<00:03:39.310> amount<00:03:39.640> of<00:03:39.790> ink<00:03:40.000> in<00:03:40.209> there<00:03:40.480> and

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
got a small amount of ink in there and

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.150 
got a small amount of ink in there and
you<00:03:41.440> know<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.829> system<00:03:42.310> is<00:03:42.579> fully<00:03:42.910> primed<00:03:44.160> then

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
you know the system is fully primed then

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.949 
you know the system is fully primed then
we<00:03:45.250> also<00:03:45.370> need<00:03:45.700> to<00:03:45.940> start<00:03:46.239> to<00:03:46.390> come<00:03:46.599> into<00:03:46.750> the

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
we also need to start to come into the

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.930 
we also need to start to come into the
syringe<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:47.470> I'm<00:03:47.590> going<00:03:47.770> to<00:03:47.860> take<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.220> out

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
syringe so I'm going to take that out

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.570 
syringe so I'm going to take that out
and<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:50.020> can<00:03:50.230> see<00:03:50.410> now<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.950> cartridges

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
and you can see now that the cartridges

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.970 
and you can see now that the cartridges
is<00:03:52.120> fully<00:03:52.510> primed<00:03:52.870> that's<00:03:53.140> ready<00:03:53.440> to<00:03:53.680> install

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
is fully primed that's ready to install
