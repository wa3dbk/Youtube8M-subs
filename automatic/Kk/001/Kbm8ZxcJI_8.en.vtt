00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.340
 it is so full of neck with the hans kraay junior after the race mom 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.089
 lammi luten other than a little visit 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.230
 yes of course i will honestly say 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.410
 that sounds really crazy i had only 30 to 35 minutes from henry to live 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.410
 had nothing to get I mean 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.210
 has silvolde 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.359
 played very well b 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.199
 Silvolde played very well c Silvolde played very well 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.780
 years it is a disgrace if you give four people a rest to anal something more 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.280
 yesterday have had to go very deep against argon fantastic match 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.840
 played and still won the number three in the top class 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.470
 sixteen hundred people crazy 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.960
 then four people get a chance 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.740
 and they show absolutely nothing at all that the other seven is somewhat 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.620
 being tired and less motivated I know you say so 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.340
 these people go three under percent so we will also ease under 20 percent 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.310
 they are all trainers things and they are making trouble they have it 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.110
 incredibly earned silvolde so I say boys and boys players 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.950
 not becoming a champion here again, I know that for sure 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.950
 certainly if it may be tomorrow and 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.260
 here was deservedly won 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.450
 also i know if i watch the games a bit then i see one after 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.730
 fifteen minutes again lienend to the weekend for a bit of luck on equal level 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.820
 come 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.450
 I also see that after fifteen minutes of silence, the record is slightly in the south and 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.840
 then you actually expect from a top class that ten than the point 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.049
 Yes the actual hands also shows that from the competition in the event 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.680
 8 we taught you that he actually spent a few years with Jan and three years in jail 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.370
 this week 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.090
 just really good and that's why we make a one with the header then 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.520
 We just had ten minutes when I and I go here right away 3 and 4 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.930
 had won then it might sound very crazy now to say but 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.430
 should have had a penalty kick 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.989
 and english talking train is always but this was really a penalty 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.749
 and then it is all very different but that punishment shock or not and then you must 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:19.460
 still be a big boy and be big boys and then you still have to 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.950
 turn things around and attack over the side but if we make our plans 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.240
 people went to pull in, but they really like the points that those 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.049
 strong defenders of silvolde 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.670
 in the back there was no back cover which is normally always well taken care of a duel 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:33.999
 the other in the back cover 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:37.999
 normally we don't skip the number 10 with an indication on 6 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:41.680
 June stopped sides and all that slightly different than in the competition 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.439
 and 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:48.809
 yes it is up to us but it is also silvolde and I have therefore 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:52.689
 I congratulate all the churches together and enjoy it 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.980
 the parquet as thanks for your time gladly done
