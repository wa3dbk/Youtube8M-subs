00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.960
 originally in the tone of B flat in 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:23.520
 a funk accordion so it 's in 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.020

 on this issue 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.030
 but 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.030
 to lose money 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:58.090
 well then now we go with the part then 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.960
 slowly the slow part so that for 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:07.060

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.780
 123 here the third row using the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.780
 the other fingers 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.730
 if you're 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.730
 what 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.240
 we use is everything not 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.240
 i 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.560

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.560
 finger 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.460

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.900
 the three fingers 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:03.660
 because here at the beginning it carries a trill that 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.800
 are these two fingers here on the button 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.160

 and another part of here since we are here 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.310
 it's up here a bounce 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.140
 here in this button 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.269
 it is here 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.550
 good 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.540
 to where same 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.540
 up here 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.849
 I eat well 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.310
 m 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.740
 with its through 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.860
 then we go here 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.360
 fast these 3 buttons 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.150
 baby 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.439
 and again 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.720
 and then upside down or down 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.320
 this is payment 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.560
 and then the bounce 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:38.290
 again here we will work 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.500
 and it goes again 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.500
 here 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.330
 to Dad 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.930

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:11.650
 well there they are again from the 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:16.980
 principle will go a little bit a bit 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.980
 more slower no cam says 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.410

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.550

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:40.300
 for me 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:54.010
