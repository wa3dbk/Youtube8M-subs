00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
it really is a good way to demonstrate

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.469

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
together to create these colors so if

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.499 
together to create these colors so if
you<00:02:00.659> look<00:02:00.840> really<00:02:01.200> closely<00:02:02.030> you'll<00:02:03.030> see<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
you look really closely you'll see that

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.709

each of the individual fibers in the and

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.080 
each of the individual fibers in the and
the<00:02:06.930> cord<00:02:07.259> are<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.979> different<00:02:08.250> color<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.970> we

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
the cord are a different color so we

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.650 
the cord are a different color so we

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.110 
quick look at the label on the cordial
yarn<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.069> first<00:02:50.310> thing<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.670> may<00:02:50.849> notice

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120

is that the cordial yarn is 100%

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.690 
is that the cordial yarn is 100%
polyester<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.769> like<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.370> mentioned

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
polyester and so that like I mentioned

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.430

neat thing about the cordial yarn is

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.009 
neat thing about the cordial yarn is
that<00:03:19.769> it<00:03:19.889> is<00:03:20.010> machine<00:03:20.519> washable<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.359> you<00:03:21.840> can

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
actually tumble dry on low so it's a

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.629 
actually tumble dry on low so it's a
pretty<00:03:25.049> good<00:03:25.260> perk<00:03:25.500> if<00:03:25.709> you're<00:03:25.859> making<00:03:26.370> an

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
pretty good perk if you're making an

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.339 
pretty good perk if you're making an
item<00:03:26.940> that's<00:03:27.209> going<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.599> get<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.750> lot<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:27.959> use

there's<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.859> probably<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.609> pretty<00:03:29.819> good<00:03:30.060> chance

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
there's a probably a pretty good chance

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.330 
there's a probably a pretty good chance
that<00:03:31.079> it's<00:03:31.379> going<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.590> get<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.769> little<00:03:31.950> dirty

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340

that's fifty seven meters a net weight
of<00:04:43.570> 100<00:04:44.230> grams<00:04:44.500> and<00:04:44.920> so<00:04:45.640> you'll<00:04:45.760> want<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.000> take

shorter amount or a smaller amount that

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.540 
shorter amount or a smaller amount that
you<00:04:55.480> would<00:04:55.630> normally<00:04:55.870> get<00:04:56.350> when<00:04:56.950> purchasing<00:04:57.430> a

you would normally get when purchasing a

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.100 
you would normally get when purchasing a
skein<00:04:57.820> and<00:04:57.970> that's<00:04:58.090> mainly<00:04:58.480> just<00:04:58.810> because

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
skein and that's mainly just because

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.440 
skein and that's mainly just because
this<00:04:59.230> is<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.470> specialty<00:04:59.980> yarn<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.850> it's<00:05:01.000> also<00:05:01.210> a

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
this is a specialty yarn and it's also a

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.900 
this is a specialty yarn and it's also a
bulky<00:05:02.050> weight<00:05:02.080> so<00:05:02.530> you<00:05:02.590> do<00:05:02.800> get<00:05:03.070> a<00:05:03.280> smaller

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
bulky weight so you do get a smaller

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:12.420 
bulky weight so you do get a smaller
quantity<00:05:04.270> per<00:05:05.080> skein<00:05:10.440> so<00:05:11.440> prior<00:05:11.770> to<00:05:12.100> filming

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
time and I felt like this polyester and

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.460 
time and I felt like this polyester and
this<00:06:08.740> thick<00:06:09.310> corded<00:06:10.120> yarn<00:06:10.570> was<00:06:11.140> going<00:06:11.290> to<00:06:11.350> be

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
this thick corded yarn was going to be

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.650 
this thick corded yarn was going to be
the<00:06:11.590> same<00:06:11.830> way<00:06:12.100> and<00:06:12.430> honestly<00:06:13.390> I<00:06:13.419> thought<00:06:13.600> it

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
the same way and honestly I thought it

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.990 
the same way and honestly I thought it
was<00:06:13.810> going<00:06:13.960> to<00:06:13.990> be<00:06:14.140> a<00:06:14.169> lot<00:06:14.470> worse<00:06:14.790> but<00:06:15.790> what<00:06:15.970> I

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
was going to be a lot worse but what I

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.600 
was going to be a lot worse but what I
found<00:06:16.300> is<00:06:16.510> that<00:06:16.570> it's<00:06:17.080> really<00:06:17.500> easy<00:06:17.530> to<00:06:18.430> work

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
found is that it's really easy to work

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.130 
found is that it's really easy to work
with<00:06:18.669> it's<00:06:19.180> surprisingly<00:06:20.020> easy<00:06:21.180> to<00:06:22.180> to<00:06:22.840> bend

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140 
with it's surprisingly easy to to bend

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.380 
with it's surprisingly easy to to bend
and<00:06:23.530> it<00:06:24.370> really<00:06:24.700> doesn't<00:06:24.940> have<00:06:25.210> any

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
and it really doesn't have any

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.159 
and it really doesn't have any
resistance<00:06:25.780> so<00:06:26.260> if<00:06:26.710> we<00:06:27.070> could<00:06:27.280> get<00:06:27.460> a<00:06:28.169> very

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
resistance so if we could get a very

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:34.230 
resistance so if we could get a very
clear<00:06:29.590> shot<00:06:29.980> of<00:06:31.320> the<00:06:32.320> yarn<00:06:32.710> you<00:06:32.950> can<00:06:33.850> see<00:06:34.060> that

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
clear shot of the yarn you can see that

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.110 
clear shot of the yarn you can see that
it's<00:06:34.360> actually<00:06:34.870> not<00:06:35.110> a<00:06:35.410> full<00:06:36.100> circle<00:06:36.940> it's

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
it's actually not a full circle it's

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.750 
it's actually not a full circle it's
it's<00:06:37.479> a<00:06:37.600> little<00:06:37.870> on<00:06:38.020> the<00:06:38.169> flat<00:06:38.410> side<00:06:38.710> and<00:06:38.979> for

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
it's a little on the flat side and for

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.830 
it's a little on the flat side and for
whatever<00:06:39.910> reason<00:06:40.390> that<00:06:40.419> may

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
whatever reason that may

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.870 
whatever reason that may
sit<00:06:41.080> much<00:06:41.500> easier<00:06:42.100> to<00:06:42.699> work<00:06:42.880> with<00:06:44.639> so<00:06:45.639> as<00:06:45.760> you

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
sit much easier to work with so as you

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.140 
sit much easier to work with so as you
can<00:06:46.030> see<00:06:46.090> here<00:06:46.720> this<00:06:47.169> sprout<00:06:47.560> colorway<00:06:48.190> really

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
can see here this sprout colorway really

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.990 
can see here this sprout colorway really
makes<00:06:49.690> a<00:06:49.960> fool<00:06:50.949> this<00:06:51.460> is<00:06:51.520> going<00:06:51.760> to<00:06:51.820> be<00:06:51.910> the

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
makes a fool this is going to be the

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.300 
makes a fool this is going to be the
handle<00:06:52.210> for<00:06:52.720> the<00:06:52.810> market<00:06:53.110> bag<00:06:53.290> so<00:06:53.620> when<00:06:54.160> it's
