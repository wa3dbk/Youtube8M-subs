photographers<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.910> think<00:02:10.240> that<00:02:10.590> our<00:02:11.590> own

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
photographers I think that our own

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.890 
photographers I think that our own
personal<00:02:12.370> growth<00:02:12.730> is<00:02:12.940> just<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.270> important<00:02:13.660> as

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
personal growth is just so important as

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.199

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
into this thing called the recession and

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.199 
into this thing called the recession and
a<00:02:23.920> lot<00:02:24.070> of<00:02:24.100> photographers<00:02:24.310> seem<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.090> be

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
a lot of photographers seem to be

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.490 
a lot of photographers seem to be
struggling<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.959> they<00:02:26.050> have<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.200> lot<00:02:26.470> of

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
struggling and they have a lot of

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.680 
struggling and they have a lot of
questions<00:02:27.040> concerning<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.030> recession<00:02:28.570> and

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
questions concerning the recession and

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.570 
questions concerning the recession and
how<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.870> get<00:02:29.080> out<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.890> what<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.430> do

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
how to get out of it and what to do

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.229 
how to get out of it and what to do
during<00:02:30.820> it<00:02:31.500> would<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.650> have<00:02:32.860> some<00:02:33.160> wisdom<00:02:33.610> for

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
during it would you have some wisdom for

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.960 
during it would you have some wisdom for
photographers<00:02:34.930> right<00:02:35.230> now<00:02:35.520> on<00:02:36.520> what<00:02:36.820> they

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
photographers right now on what they

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.840 
photographers right now on what they
should<00:02:37.180> be<00:02:37.299> doing<00:02:37.330> during<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.110> recession<00:02:38.850> and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
should be doing during the recession and

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
should be doing during the recession and
how<00:02:40.720> might<00:02:41.019> that<00:02:41.049> apply<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.560> your<00:02:41.799> course<00:02:42.870> well

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
how might that apply to your course well

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.430 
how might that apply to your course well
I<00:02:44.470> kind<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.220> believe<00:02:45.549> that<00:02:45.959> during<00:02:46.959> times

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
I kind of believe that during times

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.979 
I kind of believe that during times
during<00:02:47.830> hard<00:02:48.160> economic<00:02:48.250> times<00:02:48.730> or<00:02:49.510> what<00:02:49.840> we

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
during hard economic times or what we

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.750 
during hard economic times or what we
believe<00:02:50.350> may<00:02:50.709> be<00:02:50.739> in<00:02:50.950> our<00:02:51.070> minds<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.489> be<00:02:51.580> hard

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
believe may be in our minds to be hard

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.930 
believe may be in our minds to be hard
up<00:02:51.880> another<00:02:52.120> time

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
up another time

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.970 
up another time
during<00:02:53.630> those<00:02:53.750> times<00:02:54.020> I<00:02:54.230> think<00:02:54.290> families

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
during those times I think families

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.210 
during those times I think families
really<00:02:55.160> pull<00:02:55.460> together<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:56.530> people<00:02:57.530> make

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
really pull together and people make

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.340 
really pull together and people make
their<00:02:58.400> purchasing<00:02:59.060> decisions<00:02:59.600> around<00:03:00.050> what's

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
their purchasing decisions around what's

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.100 
their purchasing decisions around what's
of<00:03:00.650> importance<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.190> their<00:03:01.340> families<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.600> so

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
of importance to their families and so

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.200 
of importance to their families and so
that's<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.920> way<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.070> talk<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.430> my<00:03:04.490> clients<00:03:04.940> and

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
that's the way I talk to my clients and

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.620 
that's the way I talk to my clients and
I<00:03:05.570> think<00:03:06.260> from<00:03:06.740> building<00:03:07.610> relationships<00:03:08.240> to

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
I think from building relationships to

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.890 
I think from building relationships to
building<00:03:09.350> value<00:03:09.740> in<00:03:10.250> our<00:03:10.340> product<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.030> value

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
building value in our product and value

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.970 
building value in our product and value
in<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.620> experience<00:03:13.840> there's<00:03:14.840> kind<00:03:15.560> of<00:03:15.620> those

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
in the experience there's kind of those

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.340 
in the experience there's kind of those
economic<00:03:16.730> decisions<00:03:17.150> either<00:03:17.330> go<00:03:17.690> away<00:03:17.990> or

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
economic decisions either go away or

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.490 
economic decisions either go away or
people<00:03:19.130> plan<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.270> invest<00:03:20.750> for<00:03:21.110> those<00:03:21.230> things

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
people plan to invest for those things

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.850 
people plan to invest for those things
and<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:22.370> hope<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.980> really<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.840> guess<00:03:26.840> give<00:03:27.680> that

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
and I hope to really I guess give that

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.140 
and I hope to really I guess give that
same<00:03:28.070> sort<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.340> feeling<00:03:28.640> to<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.820> people<00:03:29.060> in
