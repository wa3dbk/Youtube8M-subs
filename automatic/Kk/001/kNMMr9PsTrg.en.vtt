bag<00:04:30.790> if<00:04:31.030> you<00:04:31.150> only<00:04:31.330> had<00:04:31.540> a<00:04:31.570> few<00:04:31.950> but<00:04:32.950> I<00:04:33.160> was

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
bag if you only had a few but I was

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.310 
bag if you only had a few but I was
doing<00:04:33.610> a<00:04:33.669> huge<00:04:33.940> shiitake<00:04:34.510> inoculation<00:04:35.020> this

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
doing a huge shiitake inoculation this

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.250 
doing a huge shiitake inoculation this
spring<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:35.860> so<00:04:36.040> I<00:04:36.510> just<00:04:37.510> ordered<00:04:37.840> an<00:04:37.960> extra

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
spring and so I just ordered an extra

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.830 
spring and so I just ordered an extra
bag<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:38.650> this<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.889> have<00:04:39.090> this<00:04:40.090> growing<00:04:40.389> at<00:04:40.630> home

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
bag of this I have this growing at home

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.500 
bag of this I have this growing at home
real<00:04:41.139> nicely<00:04:41.790> but<00:04:42.790> I<00:04:42.850> figured<00:04:43.270> having<00:04:44.080> another

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
real nicely but I figured having another

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.020 
real nicely but I figured having another
fresh<00:04:46.510> set<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:46.900> my<00:04:47.139> silly<00:04:47.440> old<00:04:47.650> lenses<00:04:48.070> on<00:04:48.400> a

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
fresh set of my silly old lenses on a

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.120 
fresh set of my silly old lenses on a
different<00:04:49.810> property<00:04:50.230> is<00:04:50.440> a<00:04:50.470> good<00:04:50.710> way<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:50.889> go

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
different property is a good way to go

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.879 
different property is a good way to go
just<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.460> be<00:04:51.610> safe<00:04:51.970> than<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.360> sound<00:04:52.630> that<00:04:52.889> mr.

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
just to be safe than the sound that mr.

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.290 
just to be safe than the sound that mr.
fari<00:04:54.160> in<00:04:54.280> case<00:04:54.430> something<00:04:54.699> happens<00:04:54.970> at<00:04:55.090> home

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
fari in case something happens at home

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.180 
fari in case something happens at home
that<00:04:55.750> keeps<00:04:56.020> doing<00:04:56.320> really<00:04:56.470> well<00:04:56.680> elsewhere

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
that keeps doing really well elsewhere

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.270 
that keeps doing really well elsewhere
so<00:04:58.199> that's<00:04:59.199> how<00:04:59.320> you<00:04:59.380> can<00:04:59.530> do<00:04:59.680> stuff<00:04:59.889> re<00:05:00.130> at

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
so that's how you can do stuff re at

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.610 
so that's how you can do stuff re at
home<00:05:00.400> is<00:05:00.520> really<00:05:00.730> challenging<00:05:01.350> if<00:05:02.350> you<00:05:02.500> have

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
home is really challenging if you have

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.900 
home is really challenging if you have
to<00:05:02.770> rip<00:05:02.949> cardboard<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:04.480> put<00:05:04.690> it<00:05:04.810> in<00:05:04.930> a<00:05:04.990> thing

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
to rip cardboard and put it in a thing

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.950 
to rip cardboard and put it in a thing
that's<00:05:06.910> all<00:05:07.060> there<00:05:07.210> is<00:05:07.270> to<00:05:07.419> it<00:05:07.510> and<00:05:07.540> hope<00:05:07.750> you

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
that's all there is to it and hope you

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.350 
that's all there is to it and hope you
enjoy<00:05:08.560> it<00:05:08.770> this<00:05:09.250> might<00:05:09.460> generate<00:05:10.030> a<00:05:10.090> few

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
enjoy it this might generate a few

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.210 
enjoy it this might generate a few
hundred<00:05:10.660> pounds<00:05:10.840> of<00:05:11.110> stuff<00:05:11.320> re<00:05:11.530> over<00:05:11.949> the<00:05:12.040> next

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
hundred pounds of stuff re over the next

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.860 
hundred pounds of stuff re over the next
few<00:05:12.430> years<00:05:12.490> of<00:05:13.230> actual<00:05:14.230> mushrooms<00:05:15.449> so<00:05:16.449> it's

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
few years of actual mushrooms so it's

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.680 
few years of actual mushrooms so it's
well<00:05:17.080> worth<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.320> effort<00:05:17.500> I<00:05:18.480> wouldn't<00:05:19.480> do<00:05:19.540> this

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
well worth the effort I wouldn't do this

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.430 
well worth the effort I wouldn't do this
if<00:05:19.870> this<00:05:19.990> was<00:05:20.050> styrofoam<00:05:20.830> but<00:05:21.760> I<00:05:22.060> think<00:05:22.990> since

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
if this was styrofoam but I think since

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.850 
if this was styrofoam but I think since
it's<00:05:23.620> just<00:05:24.630> corn<00:05:25.630> put<00:05:26.020> it<00:05:26.110> in<00:05:26.230> my<00:05:26.320> mouth<00:05:26.470> and<00:05:26.740> it

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
it's just corn put it in my mouth and it

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.950 
it's just corn put it in my mouth and it
melted<00:05:27.250> and<00:05:27.340> tasted<00:05:27.730> like<00:05:27.880> bad<00:05:28.090> popcorn<00:05:28.720> so<00:05:28.900> I

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
melted and tasted like bad popcorn so I

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.500 
melted and tasted like bad popcorn so I
think<00:05:29.020> it<00:05:29.260> should<00:05:29.500> if<00:05:30.400> I<00:05:30.639> could<00:05:30.910> technically

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
think it should if I could technically

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.210 
think it should if I could technically
eat<00:05:31.780> it<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:32.020> stefarr<00:05:32.440> you<00:05:32.560> definitely<00:05:33.010> can

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
eat it the stefarr you definitely can

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.510 
eat it the stefarr you definitely can
forget<00:05:33.970> to<00:05:34.150> write<00:05:34.300> oh<00:05:34.630> yeah<00:05:35.199> and<00:05:36.130> there's<00:05:36.370> some

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
forget to write oh yeah and there's some

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.850 
forget to write oh yeah and there's some
cooked<00:05:36.760> rice<00:05:37.000> I<00:05:38.010> feel<00:05:39.010> like<00:05:39.190> I'm<00:05:40.090> giving

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
cooked rice I feel like I'm giving

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.260 
cooked rice I feel like I'm giving
periodically<00:05:41.860> giving<00:05:42.280> it<00:05:42.400> some<00:05:42.610> nutritious

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
periodically giving it some nutritious

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.780 
periodically giving it some nutritious
like<00:05:43.510> mineral<00:05:43.780> dense<00:05:44.260> stuff<00:05:44.560> it's<00:05:45.430> probably

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
like mineral dense stuff it's probably

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.200 
like mineral dense stuff it's probably
nice<00:05:45.970> for<00:05:46.270> it<00:05:46.330> I<00:05:46.389> know<00:05:46.419> there's<00:05:46.720> other<00:05:48.210> various

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
nice for it I know there's other various

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.909 
nice for it I know there's other various
mushrooms<00:05:49.690> that<00:05:49.900> are<00:05:49.960> grown<00:05:50.199> with<00:05:50.410> rice<00:05:50.650> I

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
mushrooms that are grown with rice I

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.010 
mushrooms that are grown with rice I
figured<00:05:51.280> this<00:05:51.400> will<00:05:51.580> grow<00:05:51.729> with<00:05:51.880> it<00:05:52.030> too<00:05:52.210> but

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
figured this will grow with it too but

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.930 
figured this will grow with it too but
really<00:05:53.199> it's<00:05:53.530> an<00:05:53.650> incredibly<00:05:54.280> forgiving

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
really it's an incredibly forgiving

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.540 
really it's an incredibly forgiving
incredibly<00:05:55.840> aggressive

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
incredibly aggressive

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.939 
incredibly aggressive
powerful<00:05:58.270> set<00:05:58.539> probic<00:05:58.990> mushrooms<00:05:59.500> so<00:05:59.770> it's<00:05:59.889> a

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
powerful set probic mushrooms so it's a

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.760 
powerful set probic mushrooms so it's a
great<00:06:00.400> digester<00:06:01.030> of<00:06:01.150> woody<00:06:01.360> debris<00:06:01.569> and<00:06:02.560> it

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
great digester of woody debris and it

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.770 
great digester of woody debris and it
supports<00:06:03.190> plants<00:06:03.580> really<00:06:03.819> nicely<00:06:04.000> so<00:06:04.210> you

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
supports plants really nicely so you

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.240 
supports plants really nicely so you
should<00:06:05.259> grow<00:06:05.440> them<00:06:05.729> thanks<00:06:06.729> for<00:06:06.879> watching
