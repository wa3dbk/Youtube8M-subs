00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.250
 hello dear friends 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.170
 did you miss the guts of blood 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.300
 pushing through the throat of all enemies 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.310
 kind of cold weapons by itself yes oh 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.080
 This is not something that can be bored so long 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.710
 unless perhaps only to dream 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.869
 are obtained 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.460
 and while the world groans under oppression despondency 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.900
 monotony of bullshit country 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.119
 which is in our habitat area 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.289
 just flooded everything around from what 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.149
 sometimes it is not clear whether 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.890
 Domestic gamer distinguish slag from 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.290
 good at the same time playing in a kind of triple and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.930
 the class of the game is still extremely blind 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.670
 hope only for the coming year 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.840
 2013 with which promises to the world 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.090
 a whole pack appear 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.070
 games if incomplete sense then at 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.760
 least those who do not make cry 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.950
 at their sight 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.570
 and fall asleep while playing one of them 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.570
 will kingdom under fire 2 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.690
 as we promise the game will be completely 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.510
 match your name only 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.640
 no kingdom from a bunch 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.680
 kingdom a bunch of kingdoms which 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.420
 players will create hands 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.640
 huge world issued by developers 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.470
 will be full of locks grabbing which we 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.660
 we will collect our empire bit by bit 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.770
 but this path will be extreme bloody and 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.020
 far from simple 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.820
 Before you can create entirely your nation 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.890
 players will first have to collect 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.630
 clan then after a series of victories and 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.250
 grabs already base your whole 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.080
 the country that will rule on 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.060
 the territory of some original 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.070
 one continent and then immediately 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.619
 will open another this here is one of the desires 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.170
 developers do not stop the war at all 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.149
 never that on the one hand well and 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.220
 the other can be quite solid 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.259
 minus everything that the world represents 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.660
 a map of the heroes of the sword and 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.399
 magic or rather of mount and blade by 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.350
 we travel in the form of a horse 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.330
 which paves the way for the specified 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.039
 we point but when we come already 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.170
 to something we already open 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.360
 customary spaces of battle fields of castles 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.979
 cities and other things that are in the game minus 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.380
 same here that developers can 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.209
 draw Nemer continents but here 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.370
 these zones in which we will fall 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.380
 may be in the future so 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.950
 look alike what will start from them 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.480
 feel sick 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.340
 but let's hope that the game will 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.380
 have some randomize 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.299
 although in any case the first is unlikely 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.340
 someone turns on something like that 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.739
 attention because after we 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.900
 somewhere we will come most often in that place 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.120
 because the reception will begin massive 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.350
 carnage involving not only players with 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.350
 involving their armies 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.780
 kindermann Dafa barely a player is no longer 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.400
 a loner each of us without a doubt 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.739
 will remain as before the hero of which 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.810
 we will continue to create ourselves but 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.359
 we will be heroes of leaders who 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.519
 wild i will lead my army fail 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.530
 army consisting of different types of troops 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.109
 starting with the usual infantry and ending 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.299
 cavalry artillery or by some 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.950
 magic units while in 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.420
 the game will be present already familiar 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.950
 many strategies indicator 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.079
 efficiency fighter 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.819
 that is, now that the cavalry without 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.159
 the slightest effort will sweep away the archers but 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.109
 three sheets to the break of the lancers as well as the 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.189
 we don't have a dump here just an attempt 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.409
 cross Lemma 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.480
 action and rts together we can do it ourselves 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.519
 manage the units entrusted to us 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.169
 put them on profitable positions do 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.019
 they go round there in every way 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.650
 maneuver around the battlefield of 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.010
 the above will be necessary 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.590
 taken into account especially in Poyekt 20 20 then 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.450
 there are up to 20 for 20 people each with their own 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.250
 the army promises so much at first in 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.530
 which can also be dragons 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.900
 hefty mammoths and more familiar 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.639
 siege defense mechanisms imagined 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.379
 imagine the scale yes and sad 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.150
 a little bit than me this will not work 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.590
 as it is not paradoxical but kingdom 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.040
 under fire 2 will even go on 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.290
 video cards with 256 meters of video memory and 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.180
 corresponding to the rest of the content but 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.489
 by itself most beautiful she will 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.199
 look at good powerful machines there 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.500
 even with massive hacks everything goes 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:11.049
 smoothly smooth and beautiful everything is beautiful to 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.669
 the word is an elf dark elf representative 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.370
 one of the classes available in the game 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.620
 which until three is called sang sword 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.239
 the story of the ice mage and assassin fighter 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.310
 wrapped in light armor 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.740
 this is gunslinger stern warrior 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.870
 using one-handed sometimes two-handed 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.310
 swords with firearms walks he 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.229
 while in the plate pure armor is not 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.060
 the hardest that allows you to be 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.760
 very mobile in battle by the word and 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.169
 uses magic and this is berserk 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.389
 unique in him is that his 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.400
 Armor is growing directly from it also uses 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.169
 he is at the same time a huge two-handed swords and 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.990
 a special glove that allows 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.449
 to call upon the powers of hell, these are those who 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.590
 while those who are in the future will be available 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.659
 created by your hands 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.789
 and later the distribution of appearance will be 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:54.219
 even more, but all that I have just said 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.510
 more relevant to pvp where meaning in 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.449
 tom to capture 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.370
 kill and 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.680
 where is the main 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.689
 opponents will be players this is not 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.340
 all that is in the game except this one 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:06.110
 there is also a global evil 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.939
 which players must fight stomping 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.279
 along the storyline though here with one 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:12.889
 parties can be upset by the fact that everything is extremely 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:14.419
 linear and such a journey holding dungeon 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.069
 including with the possibility 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.930
 travel in debt in groups with 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:20.059
 passing destruction of different dark 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.740
 beasts destruction by their strongholds to all 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:24.080
 By the way, in general, initially 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.819
 is a way to introduce a player to 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.770
 combat system of the game but on the other hand 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.599
 possible and so terrible to kill 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.960
 hordes of mobs in strictly defined 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.610
 zones 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.319
 and not rush to them through the thousands 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.629
 kilometers of desert expanses 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:37.310
 as for the combat system itself 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.349
 as I think you already understood it is divided 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.449
 into two components the first is what it is about 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.430
 we have said army management and 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.620
 the second is the personal management of the heroes 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.599
 battle system from his face non- bidding then you 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.749
 and built in such a way that in battle 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.830
 the player must combine active skills 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:53.749
 located on the usual socket move 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.759
 bars and combo bundle for getting 

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:58.189
 different bonuses or holding especially 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:59.389
 strong attacks while still afraid of the army 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:01.669
 need to pump separately 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.199
 that is, the trees are different pumping well 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.899
 besides this, of course, there are 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.580
 standard attributes any and mrp g2 

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:09.589
 let's say among which there are 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.719
 crafting ingredients respectively 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:14.360
 craft and because of him everything else in 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:16.490
 including armor there armor weapons and 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.889
 jars with efficiency, we used it all 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.379
 the above will exist together 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.249
 mad warrior rushing forward with his 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:24.680
 army to meet 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:26.689
 a foreign army of the same bloodthirsty 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.729
 adversary in a world that is torn 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:31.249
 torn apart and maybe just 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:32.199
 killed by an unknown other 

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:35.149
 dark forces 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:37.639
 mouth somehow so dear friends and maybe 

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:39.529
 this is the future mom of the industry 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:41.959
 that is, it is possible after kingdom under 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:44.330
 fire many will decide to take a chance and cross 

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:45.889
 many genres in one game which 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.629
 will not be created in order in it 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.879
 pink dresses were measured there and 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:50.320
 Panic Riding Decorations Fighting 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:52.330
 behind 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.370
 and blood virtual fields and maybe u 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.080
 someone will turn out even better for all 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.390
 said kingdom under fire 2 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.490
 can quickly get bored well let's say 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.710
 that all locations are castles where we will 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.510
 will fight the same or say 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.000
 because all enemies are right on one face 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.950
 or suppose because violent bloody 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.170
 unintelligible mess with accommodation 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.950
 memorized computer almost skills just 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:17.260
 get bored well or let's say because 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.670
 We wanted so far everything else in general 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.310
 for the success of the game probably will 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.110
 enough to somehow find that line between 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.730
 chaotic landfill and impressive war 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.620
 how did you find the developers of total war 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.450
 word judging by the roller game can 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.220
 work almost like a commodity because 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.990
 when we switch to management 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.820
 our hero did not introduce the army 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.920
 fight it here again can too 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.180
 prove to be another huge plus i 

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.310
 I mean the possibility of dramatically 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.820
 change so skat game by pressing one 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.380
 buttons 

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.180
 Well that was all very well 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.340
 would be useful also in the sense that is 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.550
 it is clear that we are fighting for supremacy over 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.620
 whole continents well what is it specifically 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:54.690
 tell about it the next time 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.690
 on this for now everything and everything everything
