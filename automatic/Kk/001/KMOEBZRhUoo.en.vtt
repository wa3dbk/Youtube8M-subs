I<00:03:25.349> see<00:03:25.949> the<00:03:26.099> 3d<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.549> it<00:03:26.879> the<00:03:27.269> overworld

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
I see the 3d of it the overworld

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.050 
I see the 3d of it the overworld
especially<00:03:28.440> like<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.769> did<00:03:29.069> not<00:03:29.310> like<00:03:29.669> it<00:03:29.699> like

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
especially like I did not like it like

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.360 
especially like I did not like it like
when<00:03:30.239> I<00:03:30.269> see<00:03:30.569> it<00:03:30.780> looked<00:03:30.989> kind<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.349> pixel<00:03:31.919> I

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
when I see it looked kind of pixel I

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.129 
when I see it looked kind of pixel I
don't<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:32.910> don't<00:03:32.970> know<00:03:33.299> really<00:03:33.660> what<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.900> say

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
don't I don't know really what to say

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.949 
don't I don't know really what to say
but<00:03:34.199> like<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.650> liked<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.310> better<00:03:35.340> on<00:03:35.940> XD<00:03:36.870> and

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
but like I liked it better on XD and

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.420 
but like I liked it better on XD and
colosseum<00:03:37.049> like<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.650> looks<00:03:37.859> better<00:03:38.069> and

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
colosseum like it looks better and

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.000 
colosseum like it looks better and
that's<00:03:39.269> really<00:03:39.840> old<00:03:39.989> technology<00:03:40.859> the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
that's really old technology the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.069 
that's really old technology the
gamecube<00:03:41.549> like<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.150> understand<00:03:42.660> like<00:03:42.810> it's<00:03:43.019> a

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
gamecube like I understand like it's a

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.990 
gamecube like I understand like it's a
console<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:43.739> let's<00:03:43.859> compare<00:03:44.250> like<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.609> d/s

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
console but let's compare like the d/s

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.879 
console but let's compare like the d/s
to<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.359> n64<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:46.079> mean<00:03:46.319> that's<00:03:46.410> kind<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.799> the

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
to the n64 I mean that's kind of the

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.949 
to the n64 I mean that's kind of the
same<00:03:47.040> with<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.400> with<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.760> gamecube<00:03:48.750> in<00:03:48.870> the

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
same with the with the gamecube in the

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.580 
same with the with the gamecube in the
three<00:03:49.139> years<00:03:49.379> like<00:03:50.069> you<00:03:50.549> see<00:03:50.819> sumar<00:03:51.720> 64<00:03:52.260> and

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
three years like you see sumar 64 and

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.199 
three years like you see sumar 64 and
then<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:53.129> see<00:03:53.310> sumar<00:03:53.669> 64<00:03:54.060> DS<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.780> ds1<00:03:55.530> is

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
then you see sumar 64 DS and the ds1 is

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.420 
then you see sumar 64 DS and the ds1 is
10,000<00:03:57.209> times<00:03:57.480> better<00:03:57.629> looking<00:03:58.409> and<00:03:58.680> even<00:03:59.370> a

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
10,000 times better looking and even a

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.539 
10,000 times better looking and even a
better<00:03:59.579> game<00:03:59.909> like<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:00.449> I<00:04:00.480> don't<00:04:00.840> know<00:04:00.989> and

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
better game like so I don't know and

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.789 
better game like so I don't know and
this<00:04:02.549> is<00:04:02.669> just<00:04:02.819> one<00:04:02.940> gen<00:04:03.449> further<00:04:04.019> so<00:04:04.530> I<00:04:04.560> don't

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
this is just one gen further so I don't

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.599 
this is just one gen further so I don't
know<00:04:04.889> why<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:06.209> 3d<00:04:07.199> in<00:04:07.500> this<00:04:07.799> pokemon<00:04:08.340> x/y

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
know why the 3d in this pokemon x/y

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.759 
know why the 3d in this pokemon x/y
thing<00:04:08.970> doesn't<00:04:09.269> look<00:04:09.359> as<00:04:09.510> good<00:04:09.599> as<00:04:09.769> the

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
thing doesn't look as good as the

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.240 
thing doesn't look as good as the
gamecube<00:04:11.250> does<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.729> that's<00:04:12.479> like<00:04:12.720> 13<00:04:13.440> 12<00:04:13.799> 13

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
gamecube does and that's like 13 12 13

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.550 
gamecube does and that's like 13 12 13
year<00:04:14.519> old<00:04:14.639> technology<00:04:15.329> the<00:04:15.569> Gamecube<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.139> don't

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
year old technology the Gamecube I don't

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.689 
year old technology the Gamecube I don't
even<00:04:16.650> remember<00:04:16.859> when<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.340> was<00:04:17.370> made<00:04:17.579> I<00:04:17.609> think

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
even remember when it was made I think

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.850 
even remember when it was made I think
was<00:04:19.729> 2001-2002<00:04:20.989> with<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.139> being<00:04:22.289> said<00:04:22.349> I'm

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
was 2001-2002 with that being said I'm

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.990 
was 2001-2002 with that being said I'm
kind<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.610> disappointed<00:04:24.000> with<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:24.539> however<00:04:26.000> I

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
kind of disappointed with that however I

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.800 
kind of disappointed with that however I
will<00:04:27.240> say<00:04:27.360> that

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
will say that

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.310 
will say that
is<00:04:27.900> so<00:04:28.169> early<00:04:28.680> within<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.510> within<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.720> making

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
is so early within the within the making

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.990 
is so early within the within the making
of<00:04:31.470> this<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:32.010> we<00:04:32.190> just<00:04:32.460> figured<00:04:32.730> this<00:04:32.850> out

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
of this and we just figured this out

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.020 
of this and we just figured this out
that<00:04:33.330> that<00:04:34.110> it<00:04:34.410> could<00:04:34.740> just<00:04:34.889> look<00:04:35.460> much<00:04:35.790> better

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
that that it could just look much better

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.360 
that that it could just look much better
than<00:04:36.389> what<00:04:36.990> they<00:04:37.320> showed<00:04:37.680> in<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.919> trailer<00:04:38.220> I

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
than what they showed in the trailer I

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.220 
than what they showed in the trailer I
will<00:04:38.880> say<00:04:39.120> though<00:04:39.330> with<00:04:39.660> black<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.080> white

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
will say though with black and white

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.540 
will say though with black and white
when<00:04:40.440> we<00:04:40.560> first<00:04:40.770> saw<00:04:40.889> black<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:41.250> white<00:04:41.370> I

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
when we first saw black and white I

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.680 
when we first saw black and white I
thought<00:04:41.820> it<00:04:41.940> was<00:04:42.000> going<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.180> be<00:04:42.270> sketchy<00:04:42.540> as

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
thought it was going to be sketchy as

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.040 
thought it was going to be sketchy as
fuck<00:04:43.790> when<00:04:44.790> I<00:04:44.820> first<00:04:45.090> saw<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.330> but<00:04:45.630> then<00:04:45.870> once

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
fuck when I first saw it but then once

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.480 
fuck when I first saw it but then once
the<00:04:46.169> actual<00:04:46.440> game<00:04:46.470> came<00:04:46.770> out<00:04:46.889> it<00:04:47.100> looked<00:04:47.310> much

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
the actual game came out it looked much

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.120 
the actual game came out it looked much
better<00:04:47.730> so<00:04:48.090> I<00:04:48.120> will<00:04:48.419> you<00:04:49.110> know<00:04:49.139> I'll<00:04:49.470> hold<00:04:49.889> it

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
to them you know on that but as far as

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.010 
to them you know on that but as far as

trailer goes much simple as a very
simple<00:04:58.380> trailer<00:04:58.770> like<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.160> don't<00:04:59.220> know<00:04:59.810> there's
