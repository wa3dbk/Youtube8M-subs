00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
for creating tension between chords I

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.829 
for creating tension between chords I
use<00:00:11.980> it<00:00:12.190> quite<00:00:12.339> often<00:00:12.669> when<00:00:13.089> I<00:00:13.120> am<00:00:13.209> soloing

C sharp diminished scale and I'm going

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.489 
C sharp diminished scale and I'm going
to<00:00:47.499> begin<00:00:47.679> on<00:00:48.159> C<00:00:48.670> with<00:00:49.539> my<00:00:49.690> third<00:00:49.870> finger<00:00:49.899> on

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.240 

okay<00:01:35.479> so<00:01:35.540> this<00:01:36.290> is<00:01:36.500> how<00:01:36.650> I'm<00:01:36.740> going<00:01:36.950> to<00:01:37.040> apply

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
okay so this is how I'm going to apply

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.469 
okay so this is how I'm going to apply
it<00:01:37.370> so<00:01:38.030> I'm<00:01:38.120> playing<00:01:38.390> G<00:01:38.720> jazz<00:01:39.229> blues<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:40.479> of

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
it so I'm playing G jazz blues and of

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.420 
it so I'm playing G jazz blues and of
course<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:41.900> first<00:01:42.140> chord<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:42.740> G<00:01:42.920> jazz<00:01:43.130> plays

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
course the first chord and G jazz plays

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.480 
course the first chord and G jazz plays
his<00:01:43.960> g7<00:01:46.869> then<00:01:47.869> I<00:01:47.930> go<00:01:48.080> to<00:01:48.110> c7<00:01:48.830> which<00:01:48.950> is<00:01:49.070> my<00:01:49.220> 4

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
his g7 then I go to c7 which is my 4

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.430 
his g7 then I go to c7 which is my 4
chord<00:01:50.770> then<00:01:51.770> I'm<00:01:51.920> back<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.130> G<00:01:52.520> for<00:01:53.150> 2<00:01:53.300> measures

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.740 

now<00:01:57.440> right<00:01:57.710> here<00:01:58.070> I've<00:01:58.520> got<00:01:58.580> c7<00:01:59.540> v<00:02:01.360> measure<00:02:02.360> and

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
now right here I've got c7 v measure and

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.680 
now right here I've got c7 v measure and
I<00:02:02.840> said<00:02:03.170> in<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.500> 6<00:02:03.770> measure<00:02:04.390> typically<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:05.509> here

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
I said in a 6 measure typically you here

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.419 
I said in a 6 measure typically you here
this<00:02:05.840> C<00:02:06.080> sharp<00:02:06.110> diminished<00:02:06.560> sound<00:02:09.429> which

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
this C sharp diminished sound which

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.590 
this C sharp diminished sound which
takes<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:10.880> back<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.120> G<00:02:13.180> so<00:02:14.180> what<00:02:14.330> I'm<00:02:14.420> going<00:02:14.570> to

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
takes you back to G so what I'm going to

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.060 
takes you back to G so what I'm going to
do<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:14.870> when<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.020> get<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:15.470> C<00:02:15.739> sharp

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
do is when I get to that C sharp

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:24.400 
do is when I get to that C sharp
diminished<00:02:16.220> chord<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:23.690> scale<00:02:24.019> fits

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
diminished chord so that scale fits

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.590 
diminished chord so that scale fits
perfectly<00:02:25.040> over<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:25.790> C<00:02:26.150> sharp<00:02:26.450> diminished

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
perfectly over that C sharp diminished

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.140 
perfectly over that C sharp diminished
chord<00:02:27.080> so<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.769> gives<00:02:27.950> me<00:02:28.100> nice<00:02:28.310> tension<00:02:28.700> and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
chord so it gives me nice tension and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.300 
chord so it gives me nice tension and
what<00:02:29.780> I'll<00:02:29.900> do<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.140> after<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.620> play<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:30.920> scale

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
what I'll do is after I play the scale

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:40.900 
what I'll do is after I play the scale
I'll<00:02:31.959> resolve<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.620> G<00:02:38.170> here's<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.320> B<00:02:39.670> which<00:02:40.670> is

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
I'll resolve it to G here's a B which is

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.440 
I'll resolve it to G here's a B which is
the<00:02:41.090> third<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:41.750> G<00:02:41.930> chord<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.120> would<00:02:47.239> sound

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
the third of a G chord so it would sound

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:57.400 
the third of a G chord so it would sound
like<00:02:47.600> this<00:02:51.250> C<00:02:52.989> G

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:06.400 

see<00:02:59.020> diminished<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:05.840> gives<00:03:06.020> me<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.170> little

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
see diminished so it gives me a little

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.910 
see diminished so it gives me a little
tension<00:03:06.650> between<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.910> four<00:03:08.150> chord<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.920> the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
tension between the four chord and the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.420 
tension between the four chord and the
one<00:03:10.160> chord<00:03:11.350> now<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:12.410> don't<00:03:12.740> have<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:13.010> play<00:03:13.250> it

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
one chord now you don't have to play it

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.340 
one chord now you don't have to play it
you<00:03:13.670> know<00:03:14.180> in<00:03:14.330> its<00:03:14.480> entirety<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:15.110> can

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
you know in its entirety you can

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.980 
you know in its entirety you can
certainly<00:03:15.680> cut<00:03:16.010> some<00:03:16.250> of<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.490> off<00:03:16.810> you<00:03:17.810> could

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
certainly cut some of it off you could

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:27.040 
certainly cut some of it off you could
