00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
but I have to say that the overall

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.300

victory<00:06:17.449> run<00:06:17.720> is<00:06:17.930> not<00:06:18.080> an<00:06:18.259> easy<00:06:18.530> game<00:06:18.650> it<00:06:19.039> takes

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
victory run is not an easy game it takes

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.360 
victory run is not an easy game it takes
a<00:06:19.370> ton<00:06:19.669> of<00:06:19.699> practice<00:06:20.800> between<00:06:21.800> that<00:06:22.009> and<00:06:22.039> the

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
a ton of practice between that and the

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.219 
a ton of practice between that and the
fact<00:06:22.520> that<00:06:22.699> does<00:06:22.879> not<00:06:23.030> have<00:06:23.330> much<00:06:23.599> beyond<00:06:23.990> its

fact that does not have much beyond its

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:26.350 
fact that does not have much beyond its
eight<00:06:24.409> stages<00:06:24.860> a<00:06:25.250> lot<00:06:25.639> of<00:06:25.789> people<00:06:26.090> really

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
eight stages a lot of people really

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.990 
eight stages a lot of people really
don't<00:06:26.479> care<00:06:26.900> for<00:06:27.169> it<00:06:27.520> myself

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
don't care for it myself

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.180 
don't care for it myself
I<00:06:29.090> kind<00:06:29.509> of<00:06:29.629> enjoy<00:06:29.900> the<00:06:29.930> game<00:06:30.500> but<00:06:30.620> its<00:06:30.770> overall

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
I kind of enjoy the game but its overall

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.700 
I kind of enjoy the game but its overall
frustration<00:06:32.090> factor<00:06:32.360> makes<00:06:32.840> it<00:06:33.020> difficult<00:06:33.259> to

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
frustration factor makes it difficult to

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.439 
frustration factor makes it difficult to
recommend<00:06:36.039> so<00:06:37.039> three<00:06:37.520> turbo<00:06:37.879> chips<00:06:38.120> out<00:06:38.270> of

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:38.449 
recommend so three turbo chips out of

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:40.570 
recommend so three turbo chips out of
five<00:06:38.659> for<00:06:38.990> me<00:06:39.110> if<00:06:39.560> this<00:06:39.889> seems<00:06:40.159> like<00:06:40.250> something

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
five for me if this seems like something

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.140 
five for me if this seems like something
you<00:06:40.909> might<00:06:41.090> enjoy<00:06:41.259> give<00:06:42.259> it<00:06:42.380> a<00:06:42.440> shot

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
you might enjoy give it a shot

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.719 
you might enjoy give it a shot
at<00:06:44.150> the<00:06:44.419> very<00:06:44.750> least<00:06:45.050> you'll<00:06:45.770> probably<00:06:46.220> do

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
at the very least you'll probably do

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:57.780 
at the very least you'll probably do
better<00:06:46.970> than<00:06:47.419> the<00:06:47.569> demo

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790
