not that's what it looked like in the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.490 
not that's what it looked like in the
beginning<00:03:11.460> it<00:03:11.580> was<00:03:11.670> one<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.880> those<00:03:12.260> box<00:03:13.260> store

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
beginning it was one of those box store

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.590 
beginning it was one of those box store
choppers<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.600> I<00:03:15.600> cut<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:15.960> up<00:03:16.110> into<00:03:16.260> pieces<00:03:16.440> and

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
choppers and I cut it up into pieces and

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.920 
choppers and I cut it up into pieces and
then<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.690> get<00:03:18.870> on<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.990> good<00:03:19.200> old<00:03:19.350> computer<00:03:19.800> and

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
then I get on a good old computer and

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.240 
then I get on a good old computer and
draw<00:03:21.930> myself<00:03:22.140> up<00:03:22.470> what<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:22.709> think<00:03:22.980> it's<00:03:23.130> gonna

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
draw myself up what I think it's gonna

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.270 
draw myself up what I think it's gonna
what<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:23.880> think<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.209> frame<00:03:24.420> should<00:03:24.630> look<00:03:24.810> like

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
what I think the frame should look like

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.480 
what I think the frame should look like
then<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.430> start<00:03:26.670> cutting<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.120> welding<00:03:27.209> and

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
then I start cutting and welding and

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.750 
then I start cutting and welding and
that's<00:03:29.490> where<00:03:30.000> we<00:03:30.150> got<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:31.340> think<00:03:32.340> about<00:03:32.430> last

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
that's where we got to think about last

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.090 
that's where we got to think about last
time<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:33.060> did<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.660> video<00:03:33.900> that's<00:03:34.800> what<00:03:35.010> it

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
time I did the video that's what it

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.710 
time I did the video that's what it
looked<00:03:35.250> like<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.700> probably<00:03:36.330> don't<00:03:36.480> even<00:03:36.630> have

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
looked like I probably don't even have

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.120 
looked like I probably don't even have
to<00:03:36.870> cut<00:03:37.020> in<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.200> video<00:03:37.410> here<00:03:37.650> I'll<00:03:37.800> just<00:03:37.950> leave

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
to cut in the video here I'll just leave

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.100 
to cut in the video here I'll just leave
it<00:03:38.160> as<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.459> is<00:03:38.540> that's<00:03:39.540> where<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:39.930> got<00:03:40.050> to

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
it as it is that's where it got to

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.380 
it as it is that's where it got to
before<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.650> got<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.400> powder<00:03:41.730> coating

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
before I got to the powder coating

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.080 
before I got to the powder coating
like<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.500> said<00:03:43.680> before<00:03:43.800> if<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:44.760> want<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:44.970> get

tough as nails finish get it powder

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.050 
tough as nails finish get it powder
coated<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:49.200> here<00:03:49.650> we<00:03:49.739> go<00:03:49.860> drum<00:03:50.160> roll<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:50.970> what

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.750 
that's really cool ape hangers with a
little<00:05:21.230> they<00:05:22.230> call<00:05:22.380> lube<00:05:22.590> to<00:05:22.740> ride<00:05:22.920> emblems<00:05:23.580> on

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
little they call lube to ride emblems on

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.090 
little they call lube to ride emblems on
them<00:05:24.950> they<00:05:25.950> had<00:05:26.130> just<00:05:26.430> a<00:05:26.610> rectangular

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
them they had just a rectangular

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.020 
them they had just a rectangular
reflector<00:05:29.100> on<00:05:29.220> the<00:05:29.340> back<00:05:29.490> of<00:05:29.700> this<00:05:29.820> and<00:05:30.000> I

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
reflector on the back of this and I

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.280 
reflector on the back of this and I
didn't<00:05:30.210> really<00:05:30.450> want<00:05:30.630> to<00:05:30.720> have<00:05:30.810> something<00:05:31.050> not

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
didn't really want to have something not

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.780 
didn't really want to have something not
cheesy-looking<00:05:31.680> but<00:05:32.100> I<00:05:32.130> noticed<00:05:32.490> that<00:05:32.580> it<00:05:32.670> had

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
cheesy-looking but I noticed that it had

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.880 
cheesy-looking but I noticed that it had
a<00:05:32.820> cross<00:05:33.060> pattern<00:05:33.330> in<00:05:33.630> it<00:05:33.690> so<00:05:34.470> I<00:05:34.500> just<00:05:34.680> took<00:05:34.830> a

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
a cross pattern in it so I just took a

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.640 
a cross pattern in it so I just took a
hacksaw<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.400> it<00:05:35.730> and<00:05:36.630> cut<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:36.930> pattern<00:05:37.380> out<00:05:37.500> of

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
hacksaw to it and cut the pattern out of

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.250 
hacksaw to it and cut the pattern out of
a<00:05:37.710> little<00:05:37.920> back<00:05:38.340> taillight<00:05:38.880> so<00:05:39.570> now<00:05:40.020> we<00:05:40.080> have<00:05:40.230> a

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
a little back taillight so now we have a

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.900 
a little back taillight so now we have a
little<00:05:40.440> cross<00:05:41.250> reflector<00:05:41.850> rather<00:05:42.330> than<00:05:42.600> the

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
little cross reflector rather than the

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.700 
little cross reflector rather than the
rectangular<00:05:44.910> thing<00:05:44.970> that<00:05:45.240> was<00:05:45.330> on<00:05:45.480> there<00:05:45.710> so

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
rectangular thing that was on there so

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.290 
rectangular thing that was on there so
little<00:05:47.010> things<00:05:47.250> like<00:05:47.370> that<00:05:47.490> if<00:05:47.850> you<00:05:47.970> just<00:05:48.120> come

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
little things like that if you just come

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.210 
little things like that if you just come
up<00:05:48.330> with<00:05:48.450> these<00:05:48.630> little<00:05:48.690> ideas<00:05:49.260> you<00:05:49.920> can<00:05:50.070> make

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
up with these little ideas you can make

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.650 
up with these little ideas you can make
kind<00:05:50.400> of<00:05:50.490> cool<00:05:50.640> stuff<00:05:50.820> without<00:05:51.090> having<00:05:51.210> both

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
kind of cool stuff without having both

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.690 
kind of cool stuff without having both
buy<00:05:51.930> a<00:05:51.960> bunch<00:05:52.230> of<00:05:52.320> stuff<00:05:52.530> so<00:05:53.840> that<00:05:54.840> is<00:05:55.170> radical

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
buy a bunch of stuff so that is radical

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.530 
buy a bunch of stuff so that is radical
