00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.620
 still 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.140
 34 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.590
 colors 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.820
 what starts 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.820
 china second speed 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.300
 he 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.329
 we start to cut more fucking we 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.329
 look 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.750
 then 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.780
 two-dimensional 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.780
 and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.850
 that you are not me 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.850
 more then those 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.659
 about 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.380
 Yes 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.380
 has gone 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.659
 still 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.110
 okay now let's go fit well and 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.110
 the store 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.280
 filmed 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.510
 so kind 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.990
 release from captures in dynamics 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.120
 in the first stage, we allow 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.870
 capture 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:59.930
 learn to memorize at the mental level 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:03.830
 the physiology of the direction of our movement 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.890
 the enemy further the enemy does 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.790
 capture we take away that part of the body which 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.060
 wants to grab 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.250
 from the same speed as his opponent 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.420
 begins to reach for the retracted part 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.269
 body and losing balance our task 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.330
 learn to hit 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.550
 enemy movement speed and 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.100
 embed into the capture plane this 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.710
 gives an advantage to the fact that consciousness 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.230
 the enemy does not have time to respond to 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:37.100
 reciprocal impact and he fails 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.000
 first at the physiological level then 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.400
 At once 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.770
 on the psychological and energetic we 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:50.600
 we create a construction and then this 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:54.040
 gun design important points when 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.220
 release from seizures is an adjustment 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.420
 copy attached 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:03.730
 sticking vision loading control 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.610
 finding a common pace with the opponent and 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.010
 rhythm 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:14.350
 first you need to catch the movement of the enemy 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:17.290
 and then change for example we are moving 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.510
 the same direction in which occurs 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:23.640
 capture 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.640
 then crouches unexpectedly
