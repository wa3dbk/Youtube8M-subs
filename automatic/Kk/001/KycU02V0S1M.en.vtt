00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.730
 While I'm talking hard I can't say what I'm getting into 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.600

 And a movie that explains how to do that 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:10.800
 It's about organizing here if you can understand it 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.870
 I think there is a format for the speech created you of hand 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.900
 Kohoku is written in various ways 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:21.660

 It's such that the sight speak to float to the eye 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.300
 than 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.240
 It might be easy-to-understand way to say the increase is such a child 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:03.650
