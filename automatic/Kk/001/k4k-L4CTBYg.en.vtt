00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
so is the show it works for the type of

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.110 
so is the show it works for the type of
humor<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:31.859> they're<00:00:32.130> going<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.790> its

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
humor that they're going for its

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.490 
humor that they're going for its
definitely<00:00:33.570> trying<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> go<00:00:34.020> with<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.290> more

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
definitely trying to go with the more

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.590 
definitely trying to go with the more
old<00:00:34.710> school<00:00:34.860> idea<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> cartoon<00:00:36.360> is

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
old school idea of what a cartoon is

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.080 
old school idea of what a cartoon is
where<00:00:36.840> things<00:00:37.590> don't<00:00:37.890> always<00:00:37.980> make<00:00:38.430> sense<00:00:38.760> and

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
where things don't always make sense and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.549 
where things don't always make sense and
you're<00:00:39.180> not<00:00:39.300> supposed<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.750> insert<00:00:40.050> logic

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
you're not supposed to insert logic

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.410 
you're not supposed to insert logic
because<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.860> runs<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.250> its<00:00:41.370> own<00:00:41.460> cartoon<00:00:41.940> logic

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
because it runs on its own cartoon logic

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.330 
because it runs on its own cartoon logic
honestly<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> show<00:00:43.620> reminds<00:00:43.950> me<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> bit<00:00:44.190> of

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
honestly the show reminds me a bit of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.279 
honestly the show reminds me a bit of
the<00:00:44.430> Powerpuff<00:00:44.940> Girls<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:46.020> about

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
the Powerpuff Girls and that it's about

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.100 
the Powerpuff Girls and that it's about
superheroes<00:00:47.190> who<00:00:47.430> save<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.210> world<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.750> also

derp around a lot and the folks is a lot

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.139 
derp around a lot and the folks is a lot
more<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.469> comedy<00:00:53.039> than<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.550> action

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
more on comedy than it is on action

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.790 
more on comedy than it is on action
although<00:00:54.300> there<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.809> definitely<00:00:55.530> still

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
although there is definitely still

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.619 
although there is definitely still
action<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:57.030> I'm<00:00:57.090> not<00:00:57.239> saying<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
action there now I'm not saying the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.479 
action there now I'm not saying the
shows<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:57.960> good<00:00:58.109> as<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> Powerpuff<00:00:58.710> Girls<00:00:58.739> far

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
shows as good as the Powerpuff Girls far

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.000 
shows as good as the Powerpuff Girls far
from<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.539> what<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> am<00:01:01.079> saying<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.649> it

from it but what I am saying is that it

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.609 
from it but what I am saying is that it
is<00:01:02.129> very<00:01:02.460> similar<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:04.019> its<00:01:04.170> premise

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
is very similar to that in its premise

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.160 
is very similar to that in its premise
and<00:01:04.830> its<00:01:05.430> way<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:06.000> about<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.630> superhero

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
