00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
on the edge here I used all of the vine

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.670 
on the edge here I used all of the vine
and<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.600> leaves<00:01:39.780> its<00:01:39.990> olivine<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:40.500> well

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
and then suede over that and that's how

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.710 
and then suede over that and that's how
I<00:01:42.840> got<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.229> really<00:01:43.680> pretty<00:01:43.979> gold<00:01:44.460> trim<00:01:45.420> I

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
I got this really pretty gold trim I

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.840 
I got this really pretty gold trim I
didn't<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.619> trim<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.280> yet<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.700> it's

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
didn't do a trim on this one yet so it's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.330 
didn't do a trim on this one yet so it's
not<00:01:48.000> done<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.479> once<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.740> done<00:01:49.770> it'll

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
not done but once this is done it'll

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.030 
not done but once this is done it'll
look<00:01:50.610> much<00:01:51.479> better<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.020> much<00:01:52.079> more<00:01:52.439> dark<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
look much better and much more dark and

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.999 
look much better and much more dark and
detailed<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.290> right<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:55.590> looks<00:01:55.890> like

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
detailed and right here looks like

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.319 
detailed and right here looks like
that's<00:01:56.219> white<00:01:56.579> inside<00:01:56.939> there<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.240> it's

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
that's white inside there but it's

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.899 
that's white inside there but it's
actually<00:01:57.509> purple<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.409> don't<00:01:58.619> know<00:01:58.680> why<00:01:58.909> the
