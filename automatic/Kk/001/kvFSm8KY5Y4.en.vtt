00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 I hope the sandro is already negotiated 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.870
 obtained because the next we will go up 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.960
 even higher 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.300
 and this bike is made by the portal uol com 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.830
 will buy foreign currency both dry 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.940
 one point missing a day or two is 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.859
 ideal is that a form and a team 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.199
 with butter 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:30.420
 I will cut the Spanish rating close to 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.340
 basis of form and does not have to be 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.079
 can form up to 100 with 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.629
 hands and we're going almost every time we 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.760
 draw only see the wonderful world that 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:54.149
 Let's do this is how we're going to do a 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:55.140
 vanilla cream take the seeds of 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.710
 vanilla 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.710
 it's okay 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:08.340
 the car light is cream 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.010
 we do our wonderful 30 years to 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.750
 slightly grow haiti notes to 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.689
 romania in sao paulo the lord roma 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.750
 meanwhile a home you will do three 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.750
 games 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.509
 whites from the yolks 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.450
 I do not know how to be careful not to have to 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.579
 vine yolk fall into the whites or water 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.900
 not being cared for and then put together 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:40.590
 two sets in teams with gems to collect 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:46.380
 120 grams of sugar plus or minus 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:50.390
 gems make the cream five years ago by 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.390
 part of the one waiting for the 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.110
 let's keep going twins 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:03.750
 because of course of course that we need to keep 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.750
 very little sugar entered 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.050
 now I will join the popular saying of cream 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.800
 We're going to get used to the 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:19.840
 temperature is on sign in 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.129
 with patience in the easy moments of 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.170
 do 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.750
 however the principle that we also 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.390
 falling is to separate the process is something 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.239
 happens is that the eggs with which the Indians 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:36.819
 it 's not nice 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:40.810
 Now I'm going to put it back in the pot and 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.120
 let's slowly make up the sauce 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.340
 thicken 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.069
 now at this very important stage not 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.420
 let my way of seeing the movement added 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.819
 of iron 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.700
 young people will be with the 20 and it is not 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.329
 as in honeycomb does not need too much 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.069
 I really do not like it, it will not end with z. 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.269
 it is important to impose also providing 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.700
 60 degrees 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:12.840
 if you start the recipe already enderson 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.840
 he will put it to the climax 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:35.370
 and I'll take the oven to 160 degrees sure 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:37.560
 45 minutes more we will finish our 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.360
 raspberry surprise 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.310
 after it was not about half an hour and 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.680
 40 minutes per shot in the oven and let 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.780
 concentrate for about 15 minutes to 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.270
 to win and we will go to the part of the 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.250
 have the raspberries not to think too 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.200
 we need fresh raspberries at all 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.570
 because we find practices we know that 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.250
 they are not really cheap they also have 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.610
 what fran frosty bags 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.490
 the gas already headlines with there and the sweet 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.030
 raspberry said the pudding was 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.030
 included 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.940
 I will join two faces by sponsoring the 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:14.730
 Currency spread very close to the base will 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:26.130
 make the part of the flights join the 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:31.320
 raspberries with renner stores and 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:33.090
 glossy make sure the dessert 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:43.980
 who is a facebook partner will this be 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:49.650
 mine and I'm going to end up missing now 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:52.560
 Let's do as there is left to mark. 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.990
 I'll put them in the cup and maybe 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:02.070
 hand 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:04.940
 I suggest and we will gradually join the 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.940
 remaining sugar 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.790
 so you inlaid you with 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.590
 This sugar glitter is ready 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.910
 I'll put one know that the problems 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.910
 can do like the pope 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.040
 now with the oven at 200 degrees 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.810
 Let's put about 10 minutes going 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:06:12.960
 be enough time to get a shower 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:06:17.530
 of Turin a boiling final result 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.430
 I want to see that we went and this dessert 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.430
 I do not know what to do.
