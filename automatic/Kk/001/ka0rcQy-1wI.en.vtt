wire<00:02:08.590> which<00:02:08.860> flashes<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.459> high<00:02:09.640> beam<00:02:09.879> lights

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
wire which flashes the high beam lights

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.750 
wire which flashes the high beam lights
on<00:02:10.479> this<00:02:11.140> bike<00:02:11.379> this<00:02:11.799> is<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.099> left<00:02:12.310> high<00:02:12.489> beam

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
on this bike this is the left high beam

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.449 
on this bike this is the left high beam
light<00:02:12.970> this<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.019> ground<00:02:14.319> and<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:15.160> is<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
light this is the ground and this is the

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.460 
light this is the ground and this is the
heart<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.390> what<00:02:16.510> we're<00:02:16.629> going<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.840> do<00:02:17.019> is<00:02:17.170> just

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
heart so what we're going to do is just

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.550 
heart so what we're going to do is just
simply<00:02:17.620> slide<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.459> connector<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:20.170> we<00:02:20.319> put

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
simply slide on the connector and we put

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.300 
simply slide on the connector and we put
the<00:02:20.650> yellow<00:02:20.860> wire<00:02:21.360> into<00:02:22.360> here<00:02:22.599> like<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.310> and

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
the yellow wire into here like that and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.949 
the yellow wire into here like that and
then<00:02:24.459> what<00:02:24.640> we're<00:02:24.790> going<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.940> do<00:02:25.180> is<00:02:25.690> just

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
then what we're going to do is just

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.039 
then what we're going to do is just
squeeze<00:02:26.200> down<00:02:26.560> hard<00:02:27.510> with<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> pair<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:28.870> pliers

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
squeeze down hard with a pair of pliers

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:35.960 
squeeze down hard with a pair of pliers
and<00:02:32.849> we<00:02:33.849> just<00:02:34.060> fold<00:02:34.299> a<00:02:34.420> little<00:02:34.540> clasp<00:02:34.930> over<00:02:35.440> and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
and we just fold a little clasp over and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.539 
and we just fold a little clasp over and
you're<00:02:36.970> done<00:02:37.680> I've<00:02:38.680> made<00:02:38.950> up<00:02:39.099> this<00:02:39.250> little

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
you're done I've made up this little

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.759 
you're done I've made up this little
ground<00:02:39.819> wire<00:02:40.150> for<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.660> horn<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.500> we're<00:02:41.650> going

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
ground wire for the horn so we're going

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.270 
ground wire for the horn so we're going
to<00:02:41.829> attach<00:02:42.129> that<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.610> negative<00:02:44.280> the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
to attach that to the negative the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.160 
to attach that to the negative the
orange<00:02:45.610> wire<00:02:45.790> goes<00:02:46.090> on<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.510> positive<00:02:49.170> then

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
orange wire goes on to the positive then

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.830 
orange wire goes on to the positive then
the<00:02:50.349> horn<00:02:50.590> can<00:02:50.860> be<00:02:50.980> lowered<00:02:51.280> into<00:02:51.430> place<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
the horn can be lowered into place the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.930 
the horn can be lowered into place the
