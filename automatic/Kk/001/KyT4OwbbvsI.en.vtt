00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.909

 boy's dream yes of course that is in it 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.820
 guys there are different thinkers around you here 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.710
 yes you just never look back 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.570
 Get goosebumps and never mind you 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.070
 before that it should not play 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.660
 how important are those competitions for 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.309
 been you in the promises with young find 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.910
 excelsior there came to prosperity 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.830
 play 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.360
 yes I was reset by the trainer 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.210
 to 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.670
 young feyenoord yes then you need a button 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.220
 to switch into a normal hard work and 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.840
 everything do to on the basis of 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.120
 excelsior and to come at that time 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.340
 And yes if you do so well with that 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.260
 that it will fall on this 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.700
 shine so naturally because you pecked 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.890
 regularly your goal 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.570
 yes, almost every game against 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.010
 but scoring along and yes for that b 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.200
 rush hour too 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.400
 and then the right one runs well in you 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.970
 your skin are then it's all 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.970
 easier 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.220
 being 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.049
 what is the potential of mitchell to peace 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.340
 at least we think at Feyenoord and 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.050
 not only the management but especially also 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.450
 the technical staff is very widely supported 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.759
 and scs is this gain for next 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.100
 year that there is an enormous amount of potential 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.530
 well-known natural doctor and az period 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.500
 there, too, it often scored as if 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.850
 striker and then he switches 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.560
 made to excelsior has it bad 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.119
 well done in preparation and start 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.009
 the competition also needs a little afterwards 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.600
 got a tip but that makes sense 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.040
 for a young boy who has never been up 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.110
 played the highest level 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.090
 due to all kinds of circumstances here 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.860
 Then have a starting spot over again 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.380
 not so he is not always playing 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.940
 excelsior far in the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.830
 If we have played a promise then we will see every one 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.880
 Monday playing of course makes it there 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.970
 just out of my head 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.070
 piece or 15 goals in 11 12 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.840
 Matches also has a nose 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.340
 for the purpose 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.530
 she easily scores me in too 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.450
 see the youth at az and in the 2nd team 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.650
 even there at that age then 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.450
 we think well who has 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.670
 Absolute potential that we really want 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.930
 like in our first selection and 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.069
 then we look at how many steps that 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.269
 he is still going to make but there we have 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.079
 very confident 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.550
 i am young eager like me and me 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.290
 would certainly do anything about it 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.290
 conditions for this team
