00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.949
 everyone knows that researcher he misses today I am very happy 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.750
 a console 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.750
 so it's an ancient piece 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:13.019
 console 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.460
 released only in Japan's special-looking 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.080
 so I'm bent to start 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.449
 3 shots 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.960
 the ps3 logo 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.960
 with the setting up 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.550
 plexiglass 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.720
 then 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.980
 dissociate 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.980
 the ignition button 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.600
 photo ouf the nose 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.100
 how then then 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.110
 to close his spring 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.730
 block 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.230
 which replaces so 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.140
 what because of the small point 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.140
 if sir 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.800
 then could we have 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.800
 very clear signal always on my bottom row 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.730
 you conceal me 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.180
 on the left the red 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.070
 As a reminder 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.620
 yes this painful 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.880
 it's a trick the proposition so 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.210
 on the left he is on his way for pedestrians 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.210
 and right in blue 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:12.249
 following the second reactor 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.309
 two sleeves that excludes aspen 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:22.839
 ap 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.379
 since 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.379
 but all the same 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.989
 there the same thing for August 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.829
 both at the same time 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:46.649
 it is done 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.649
 a little shy 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.859
 so for now we move on 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.779
 logo ps3 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:03.779
 a blog 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:13.979
 red 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:21.609
 both colors 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.609
 a God 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:37.619
 then we could just conclude that all the standards 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.849
 it's a little hollow yes the blue 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.819
 so let's go this time in red 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.459
 so we can do the combinations that we want 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.349
 then we were able 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.139
 last Saturday an investigator 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.039
 which allow to make a test nyon 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.090
 tel the owners of the console 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.639
 a piece of furniture in auvergne 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.639
 it reflects any case this match 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.800
 you can see other readers 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.000
 they are hidden when you could not 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 we consume a lot 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.699
 So here are the wines 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.699
 go to my flash site search madine points 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:15.159
 or so on ps3 embarrassment point fr you can find my achievements 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:17.949
 and if you want 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.830
 a console 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.539
 truculent send me 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.660
 a good request for fines from him 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.990
 I am not known for 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.629
 the state 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:29.789
 here is not there 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.770
 and although friends and then picks up voices on youtube and the other sites 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.340
