00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.570
 the macbook air and strong winds to 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.040
 popularity was this beautiful kitty first 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.510
 reserved for creative people with a 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.430
 slightly too thick wallet 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.690
 do that on the mass this compact 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.859
 laptop we have 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.990
 has multiple ring first of all 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.910
 Of course the beautiful design but 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.490
 especially the ridiculously long battery life 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.240
 and do not leave the latter with this 2013 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.759
 edition 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.019
 something improved can only be done 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.480
 but top belong 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.369
 not necessary if the battery life is possible 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.200
 I ask here of a resounding yes' 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.960
 because it really is 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.809
 unbelievably achieved that 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.309
 so much battery capacity in such a small 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.840
 devices 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.250
 according to apple itself we have to do that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.960
 the few new technology is there is one 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.250
 new processor indian even more economical 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.840
 than before 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.760
 is that a video card you use 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.469
 of the main memory and there it is 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.780
 number of gadgets applied 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.359
 making it all last longer 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.190
 apple claims eleven out of twelve hours snap 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.929
 not tested in succession but me 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.850
 You can tell he is going to be ridiculous 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.530
 long if you just spend a day in one 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.920
 coffee does not let you do fast 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.720
 to hang 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.670
 q just nice tap is real 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.380
 unbelievable alone that already makes apple 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.460
 still an actually unparalleled 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.079
 notice I find it quite remarkable 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.659
 that other manufacturer doesn't 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.549
 get together but not everything is already 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.590
 Sunday with this there especially the screen 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.439
 I find it a bit disappointing and has 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.909
 a resolution of 1440 by 900 and that is 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.110
 not nearly as sharp as you are 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.310
 to a 13 inch 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.619
 for comparison there have started 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.060
 topsmartphones have a full hd screen and 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.590
 that it started a lot smaller than one 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.600
 macbook air 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.210
 At the same time this is the viewing angle should be 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.850
 bad and yes if you put the brightness on 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.680
 you can put the maximum and the sun fine 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.420
 sometimes want to read 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.090
 This specific macbook air contains one 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.680
 one come three gigahertz core i5 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.299
 haswell processor and the hessel 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.420
 processors is a new generation 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.260
 Intel's processor is the new version 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.420
 after serving ivy bridge 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.540
 their macbook air sat and include 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.430
 much more energy efficient and therefore also 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.380
 battery saving but the result one 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.420
 sum that this macbook air not at all 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.250
 so hot is was agree graphic 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.970
 applications and running then it still falls 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.500
 best with it 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.970
 how hot it gets I think it's really one 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.530
 huge improvement 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.990
 at the same time you need this macbook air 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.280
 2013 not really use for very heavy 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.690
 graphic applications 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.610
 are you going to mount full hd or something 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.390
 like that yes then i go for one 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.980
 bit 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.870
 This is more really a work devices 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.550
 on the road you are your businessman or one 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.410
 commuter then a macbook air is really one 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.570
 ideal solution to do everything with 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.590
 for the road also a the area of 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.090
 equipment 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.270
 I could have done better 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.130
 because only has a usb twice 3 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.420
 panel port and admittedly a gun de 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.800
 lots of connection 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.930
 I find it a bit scanty together 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.850
 fortunately he still has an SD card 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.820
 connection you can quickly get your ticket 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.770
 our test model has 128 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.120
 gigabyte of ssd space and as own 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.190
 way than enough for the home garden and 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.200
 kitchen use but almost about guy 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.670
 download movies and music then you can 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.600
 you soon come the knot then was a 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.150
 extra hard drive 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.340
 this is not a superfluous luxury 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.350
 new macbook air 2013 with a 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.550
 new wi-fi standard that needs some 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.250
 explanation but it actually comes to it 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.930
 That the WiFi ac standard is the news 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.269
 Then it is the area of â€‹â€‹the wireless 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.160
 networking means you much more 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.910
 reach you and things even faster 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.430
 can download 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.300
 well there practice does not quite notice 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.010
 a lot of 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.690
 but almost a paint download and do 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.769
 not via cable but via one 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.120
 wireless network 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.070
 then you can sometimes notice a difference 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.260
 important nuance is that you 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.820
 also a wifi router with ac standig 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.980
 must have this new macbook air 2013 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.680
 runs on the latest version of macos x 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.450
 mountain lion 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.159
 recognizable operating system with 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.359
 funny thing 'the integration with 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.890
 social media 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.629
 get how one and mention or one 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.640
 we receive facebook messages via 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.739
 a special notifications boat to see so 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.480
 nicely done than the tricky point and that 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.989
 is the price because the cheapest version 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.489
 of the 13-inch macbook air is 11 129 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.620
 euro that is of course not cheap 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.329
 but at the same time it is this one 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.159
 device and an extremely long battery life 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.719
 And because of that came really good proposals 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.799
 that when you travel as a businessman 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.870
 or commuter 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.209
 that this is your outcome he is wonderful 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.220
 blowjobs he is wonderfully portable 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.470
 is also a great battery life 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.060
 super fast and that's why he has 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.209
 also just three and a half star and one 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.209
 bargain
