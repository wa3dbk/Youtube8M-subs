oxygenic<00:00:02.520> photosynthesis<00:00:03.449> depends<00:00:04.140> on<00:00:04.259> what

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
oxygenic photosynthesis depends on what

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.050 
oxygenic photosynthesis depends on what
we<00:00:04.620> call<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:05.040> non<00:00:05.430> cyclic

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
we call a non cyclic

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.240 
we call a non cyclic
photophosphorylation<00:00:06.649> scheme<00:00:07.649> sometimes

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
photophosphorylation scheme sometimes

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.150 
photophosphorylation scheme sometimes
called<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.700> z<00:00:08.970> scheme<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:10.260> in<00:00:10.410> its<00:00:10.800> really

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
called a z scheme and in its really

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.820 
called a z scheme and in its really
looks<00:00:11.880> very<00:00:12.179> complex<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.019> we're<00:00:13.440> gonna<00:00:13.530> try

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
looks very complex and we're gonna try

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.880 
looks very complex and we're gonna try
to<00:00:13.860> break<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.280> down<00:00:14.549> for<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:15.470> the<00:00:16.470> main<00:00:16.650> thing

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
to break it down for you the main thing

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.519 
to break it down for you the main thing
you<00:00:16.920> need<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.279> concentrate<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:19.350> there

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
you need to concentrate on that there

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.230 
you need to concentrate on that there
are<00:00:19.650> two<00:00:19.949> different<00:00:20.760> photo<00:00:21.060> systems<00:00:23.240> and

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
are two different photo systems and

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.330 
are two different photo systems and
there's<00:00:24.420> photosystem<00:00:25.080> one<00:00:25.350> shown<00:00:25.740> here<00:00:26.039> and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
there's photosystem one shown here and

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.540 
there's photosystem one shown here and
photosystem<00:00:27.150> two<00:00:27.390> shown<00:00:27.900> here<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.680> we're

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
photosystem two shown here and we're

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.400 
photosystem two shown here and we're
going<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.820> start<00:00:30.150> off<00:00:30.300> with<00:00:30.539> photosystem<00:00:31.230> two

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
going to start off with photosystem two

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.209 
going to start off with photosystem two
because<00:00:32.329> this<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.660> pathway<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.530> electrons

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
because this is the pathway of electrons

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.470 
because this is the pathway of electrons
through<00:00:36.680> these<00:00:37.680> photo<00:00:38.010> systems<00:00:40.340> so<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:42.270> said

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
through these photo systems so as I said

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.990 
through these photo systems so as I said
before<00:00:42.660> each<00:00:43.110> photosystem<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.190> surrounded<00:00:44.820> by

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
before each photosystem is surrounded by

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360 
before each photosystem is surrounded by
these<00:00:45.059> light<00:00:45.600> harvesting<00:00:45.899> complexes<00:00:46.370> that

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
these light harvesting complexes that

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.880 
these light harvesting complexes that
are<00:00:47.430> funneling<00:00:47.969> light<00:00:48.239> energy<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:49.770> we

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
are funneling light energy so if we

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.970 
are funneling light energy so if we
begin<00:00:50.100> by<00:00:50.370> looking<00:00:50.579> at<00:00:50.820> photosystem<00:00:51.570> 2<00:00:51.980> when

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
begin by looking at photosystem 2 when

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.060 
begin by looking at photosystem 2 when
it<00:00:53.719> it's<00:00:54.719> chlorophyll<00:00:55.379> becomes<00:00:55.739> oxidized<00:00:56.420> and

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
it it's chlorophyll becomes oxidized and

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.729 
it it's chlorophyll becomes oxidized and
loses<00:00:59.070> its<00:00:59.250> electrons<00:01:01.609> then<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:04.260> marvelous

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
loses its electrons then the marvelous

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.340 
loses its electrons then the marvelous
thing<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.250> cyanobacteria<00:01:06.200> invented<00:01:07.200> is

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
thing that cyanobacteria invented is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.240 
thing that cyanobacteria invented is
that<00:01:07.619> oxidized<00:01:08.540> photosystem<00:01:09.540> 2<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.140> able<00:01:11.130> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that oxidized photosystem 2 is able to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.450 
that oxidized photosystem 2 is able to
immediately<00:01:11.640> regain<00:01:12.630> electrons<00:01:13.350> by<00:01:14.070> ripping

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
immediately regain electrons by ripping

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.170 
immediately regain electrons by ripping
apart<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:15.150> water<00:01:15.390> molecule<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:17.030> in<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
apart a water molecule and in the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.210 
apart a water molecule and in the
process<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:19.430> generates<00:01:20.430> oxygen<00:01:21.210> gas<00:01:21.479> and

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
process it generates oxygen gas and

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.060 
process it generates oxygen gas and
protons<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.810> this<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.020> occurring<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
protons and this is occurring in the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.039 
protons and this is occurring in the
lumen<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.150> thylakoid

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
lumen of the thylakoid

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.039 
lumen of the thylakoid
so<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.369> releasing<00:01:29.790> protons<00:01:30.479> by<00:01:30.720> ripping

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
so it's releasing protons by ripping

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.890 
so it's releasing protons by ripping
apart<00:01:31.259> water<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.009> releasing<00:01:32.549> oxygen<00:01:32.759> gas<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
apart water and releasing oxygen gas the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.340 
apart water and releasing oxygen gas the
oxygen<00:01:34.350> gas<00:01:34.579> escapes<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.880> atmosphere<00:01:36.509> but

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
oxygen gas escapes to the atmosphere but

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.410 
oxygen gas escapes to the atmosphere but
the<00:01:37.409> protons<00:01:37.950> stay<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.670> thylakoid<00:01:38.850> lumen

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the protons stay in the thylakoid lumen

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.639 
the protons stay in the thylakoid lumen
and<00:01:40.670> as<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.060> see<00:01:42.119> as<00:01:43.079> more<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.619> more

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and as you can see as more and more

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.859 
and as you can see as more and more
water<00:01:44.009> molecules<00:01:44.250> are<00:01:44.790> ripped<00:01:45.390> apart

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
water molecules are ripped apart

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.289 
water molecules are ripped apart
we<00:01:46.350> will<00:01:46.530> accumulate<00:01:47.009> more<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.549> more<00:01:47.670> protons

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
we will accumulate more and more protons

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.149 
we will accumulate more and more protons
in<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> thylakoid<00:01:48.810> lumen<00:01:49.200> which<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.950> an

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
in the thylakoid lumen which is an

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.690 
in the thylakoid lumen which is an
important<00:01:51.090> consideration<00:01:52.310> now<00:01:53.310> what<00:01:53.610> about

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
important consideration now what about

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.749 
important consideration now what about
the<00:01:53.939> electrons<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.570> photosystem<00:01:55.320> 2<00:01:55.530> gave<00:01:55.770> up

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.630 

those<00:01:59.759> electrons<00:02:00.000> from<00:02:00.630> photosystem<00:02:01.140> 2<00:02:01.649> go

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
those electrons from photosystem 2 go

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.089 
those electrons from photosystem 2 go
down<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.149> series<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.719> electron<00:02:05.090> carriers<00:02:06.090> and

down a series of electron carriers and

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.560 
down a series of electron carriers and
we<00:02:08.099> will

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
we will

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.090 
we will
consider<00:02:10.570> this<00:02:10.810> assembly<00:02:11.590> being<00:02:11.860> the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
consider this assembly being the

so<00:02:50.710> the<00:02:50.890> electron<00:02:51.340> transport<00:02:51.760> chain<00:02:52.000> in

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
so the electron transport chain in

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.340 
so the electron transport chain in
photosynthetic<00:02:53.260> membranes<00:02:54.120> pumps<00:02:55.120> protons

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
photosynthetic membranes pumps protons

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.490 
photosynthetic membranes pumps protons
across<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.740> membrane<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.580> generate<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.660> proton

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
across the membrane to generate a proton

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.890 
across the membrane to generate a proton
gradient<00:02:59.530> or<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.580> help<00:03:00.820> generate<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.480> proton

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
gradient or to help generate the proton

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.230 
gradient or to help generate the proton
gradient<00:03:02.350> across<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.710> membrane<00:03:02.890> just<00:03:03.490> like

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
gradient across the membrane just like

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.630 
gradient across the membrane just like
the<00:03:04.900> electron<00:03:05.290> transport<00:03:05.680> chain<00:03:05.920> does<00:03:06.370> in

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
the electron transport chain does in

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.410 
the electron transport chain does in
mitochondria<00:03:08.640> so<00:03:09.640> if<00:03:09.820> we<00:03:09.940> follow<00:03:10.210> the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
mitochondria so if we follow the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.180 
mitochondria so if we follow the
electrons<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:11.080> go<00:03:11.230> down<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.770> electron

photosystem<00:03:14.950> one<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:16.060> while<00:03:16.360> photosystem<00:03:17.110> 2

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350

at<00:06:22.580> photosystem<00:06:23.270> one<00:06:25.360> again<00:06:26.360> like<00:06:26.720> boost<00:06:27.500> them

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
at photosystem one again like boost them

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.909 
at photosystem one again like boost them
to<00:06:27.980> an<00:06:28.190> even<00:06:28.580> higher<00:06:28.610> energy<00:06:29.390> level<00:06:29.720> which<00:06:30.650> is
