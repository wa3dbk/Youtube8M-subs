really<00:04:55.360> don't<00:04:55.570> lie<00:04:55.690> they<00:04:55.840> will<00:04:55.960> work<00:04:56.110> out<00:04:56.260> but

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
really don't lie they will work out but

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.110 
really don't lie they will work out but
a<00:04:56.470> bullet<00:04:56.740> but<00:04:56.860> good<00:04:57.040> well<00:04:57.220> I<00:04:57.520> think<00:04:57.700> it<00:04:57.910> worked

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
a bullet but good well I think it worked

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.430 
a bullet but good well I think it worked
pretty<00:04:58.210> well<00:04:58.480> because<00:04:58.720> he<00:04:58.960> can<00:04:59.080> play<00:04:59.170> point

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
pretty well because he can play point

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.860 
pretty well because he can play point
and<00:04:59.710> then<00:04:59.890> let<00:05:00.190> Rose<00:05:00.760> roam<00:05:01.180> around<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.720> then

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
and then let Rose roam around and then

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.450 
and then let Rose roam around and then
rose<00:05:02.140> and<00:05:02.350> play<00:05:02.470> point<00:05:02.680> let<00:05:02.920> him<00:05:03.160> roam<00:05:03.340> around

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
rose and play point let him roam around

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.340 
rose and play point let him roam around
and<00:05:03.820> then<00:05:04.150> you<00:05:04.180> got<00:05:04.420> somebody<00:05:04.660> that's<00:05:04.870> a

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350
