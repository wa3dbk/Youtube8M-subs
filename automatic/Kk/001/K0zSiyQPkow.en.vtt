00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 and 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.460
 very hard to all kids is 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.200
 welcome to a new video and today I come 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.790
 to resume the series of moss that I had 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.860
 minecraft if you remember long ago 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.960
 I reviewed the news that 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.000
 brings version 1.7 points of minecraft 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.500
 and Diaz was going to bring new videos 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.270
 motorcycles but the problem is that both the 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.490
 organization 1.7 points 2 as the 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.560
 version 1.7 point 4 have not been taking out 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.970
 no way so I'm going to center 1.6 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.670
 point 4 which is what they have gone 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.620
 taking out better 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.059
 do this not to put the molds 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.260
 minecraft I'm going to leave this file the 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.219
 description that will be needed and what 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.039
 what you have to do first is 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.930
 run the minecraft ballet run 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.070
 that will leave the launcher this to say that 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.929
 these tutorials are for version 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.879
 premium I'm not going to do any 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.409
 no tutorial for the pirates version 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.420
 because I know how it works every time 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.000
 a pirate and nothing and I do not know how the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.180
 modes although in theory they are installed equally 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.829
 if you have pectorals 1.7 point 4 what 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.420
 you have to do is go to version 1.6 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.609
 point 4 and for this you are going to give here 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.960
 to the button that puts new profile now that 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.319
 he gives them a name, I'm going to put him 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.990
 example a 1.6 m point 4 

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:14.409
 then you give the version and landscape in 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.520
 the 1.6 point 4 and you give 6 profile 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.990
 ok then you'll have it here two 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.869
 profiles the series that is 1 point 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.289
 7.4 and what will be this from m 1 points 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.850
 6.4 that as you can see is version 1.4 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.200
 you give to play because you have to execute it 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.090
 at least once for them to download 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.289
 this version and because to be in 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.030
 minecraft force that is going to be 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.979
 totally necessary to put 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.500
 any way you are going to need to have 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.390
 this version is installed and have it 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.370
 executed at least once 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.000
 now you run us and super fast 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.650
 perfect game and in the following 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.450
 you have to do is right click on the 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.619
 file this is the ideal description of 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.630
 extract here for that you have to 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.250
 install winrar but let's go for 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.380
 sitting down you all have work winrar 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.880
 ok and now inside this folder that 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.950
 it has been created that is what three come 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.130
 files there are two files one is the 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.360
 force list and another is the steve aim 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.800
 ok the first thing we have to do is 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.440
 install the force so you only have to 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.300
 double click and give it here where 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.830
 can be click on accept this is going 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.530
 to put some files down 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.450
 it will take much more about 23 minutes in 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.580
 your connection and it will install the 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.410
 ford's and will create a new profile that 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.060
 it is for this forum will be needed 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.800
 totally for modes like I've already 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.989
 said is without this you can not put any 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.519
 mode and in fact the -define there are some 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.930
 muscles you are going to ask and others that are not 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.180
 I recommend that you put it because 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.680
 optimizes the performance of the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.810
 game is worth they say that it has already 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.090
 installed we install again to run 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.290
 minecraft and now we will come out here that 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.459
 we have 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.650
 so another profile is worth m 14 and then 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.150
 we have this force that surely we 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.159
 going to order online without that I will achieve 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.739
 and once blocked, they do not put anything on us 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.209
 that exposes age time play minecraft 2006 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.799
 Four fort and the version of force that 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.060
 we give nothing to play because we have to 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.950
 execute it also once before 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.510
 put the mods and here where the 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.220
 part much easier than the last 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.890
 tutorial I did because the last day 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.599
 what I did to put the loft and find was 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.579
 quite more complicated than now and it was 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.109
 much easier you see here not because the 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.370
 part of ways does not say the mossos that 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.530
 are loaded or the three that come with 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.680
 the force and nothing we return to the squeeze game 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.480
 and what we have to do is copy the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.859
 activate i'm directly to the folder that 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.260
 we have been created of mods within 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.639
 minecraft for this you have it very easy 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
 just give the button 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.090
 windows and air at the same time the button 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.769
 stories that is to the left of the 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.720
 parts are good together decade between 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.609
 control and current was where windows 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.790
 war and you will leave this write that 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.409
 put there 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.959
 the percentage of pepe to two percentages 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.489
 and to accept is going to send them this 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.019
 folder I advise you that the following 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.310
 if you notice that he puts me here roaming in 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.590
 the favorites and it's because I took this 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.670
 of roaming and what moved here and then 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.200
 two I say it because every time 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.640
 clearly a mod are going to have to come 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.650
 here and it's going to be a move if you do not 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.450
 you do here you're going to have a folder that 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.470
 you pointed minecraft you enter and you will see that 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.769
 you have the folder of the caller 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.379
 mods 2 to 500 or we have to copy the oti 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.019
 fine and it would be done now 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.700
 we would go back into minecraft and 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.989
 we would come out with the tea totally 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.790
 installed formerly the method is 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.400
 totally different had to be put here 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.359
 in the profile some rare decks codes and 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.700
 That goes 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.829
 when it says the last video I made 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.120
 about this if it is absolutely necessary 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.829
 but now that you put the folder 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.470
 already works and also very much very much 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.639
 much faster and cleaner and as 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.919
 you see now surely put us here 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.470
 you see the three monte force engines and 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.389
 apart or tiffany installed for her with 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.220
 this would have the main almost 2 tiffany 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.560
 how good is he going to show us how it works 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.820
 because it already puts there that works and with 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.530
 latifah you can have all the 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.720
 video options that motivate you in that 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.110
 they are mogollÃ³n I always advise what 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.860
 always put 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.230
 normal rendering and this in uve 5 that 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.580
 what it does is it limits you to 30 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.280
 this way because a lot of people lent him 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.780
 of fps and that what it does is to throw a lot 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.330
 more of the computer are not logical that you 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.840
 put or limit it to 60 or created 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.070
 limits to 30 or if you have an ordered a 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.680
 little bit better we can with uve without 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.270
 is to limit to 30 60 but in a way that does not 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.530
 you get streaks on the screen when you turn 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.450
 so nothing that's what I 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.700
 I advise you already put your language and 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.230
 and you guys should work like that 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.910
 that I do not expect anything that has served much 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.100
 a lot of help if you liked the lion 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.630
 lai that is more with a bunch of folders 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.370
 and files and see you in the next 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.230
 video share it so that more people 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.530
 know how this tutorial is done and until 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.530
 other
