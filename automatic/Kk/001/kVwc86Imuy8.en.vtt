the Eclipse system
well<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:19.590> surveyed<00:00:20.130> our<00:00:20.310> customers<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.360> where

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
well we surveyed our customers is where

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
we started and we found that about 60%

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.730 
we started and we found that about 60%
of<00:00:25.439> them<00:00:25.740> wanted<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.520> touchless<00:00:26.850> wash<00:00:27.530> we<00:00:28.530> had<00:00:28.710> a

of them wanted a touchless wash we had a

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.160 
of them wanted a touchless wash we had a
lot<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.190> people<00:00:29.580> trying<00:00:29.940> to<00:00:30.180> encourage<00:00:30.750> us<00:00:30.960> and

lot of people trying to encourage us and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.560 
lot of people trying to encourage us and
convinced<00:00:31.680> us<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.099> put<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> tunnel<00:00:32.910> conveyor

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
convinced us to put a tunnel conveyor

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.520 
convinced us to put a tunnel conveyor
system<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:35.400> our<00:00:36.059> guests<00:00:36.449> told<00:00:36.870> us<00:00:37.110> that

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
system in but our guests told us that

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.920 
system in but our guests told us that
that's<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.280> not<00:00:38.460> what<00:00:38.670> they<00:00:38.850> wanted<00:00:39.239> we're

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
that's just not what they wanted we're

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.049 
that's just not what they wanted we're
in<00:00:40.080> an<00:00:40.230> area<00:00:40.650> with<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.949> lot<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.489> high-end<00:00:41.699> cars

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
in an area with a lot of high-end cars

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.560 
in an area with a lot of high-end cars
and<00:00:42.870> touchless<00:00:43.650> was<00:00:43.890> really<00:00:44.250> important<00:00:44.909> but

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
and touchless was really important but

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.860 
and touchless was really important but
we<00:00:45.720> also<00:00:45.870> needed<00:00:46.290> to<00:00:46.470> add<00:00:46.909> more<00:00:47.909> capacity<00:00:48.150> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
we also needed to add more capacity and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
we also needed to add more capacity and
the<00:00:49.620> Eclipse<00:00:50.100> was<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> perfect<00:00:50.940> solution<00:00:51.890> how

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the Eclipse was the perfect solution how

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.680 
the Eclipse was the perfect solution how
many<00:00:53.100> cars<00:00:53.400> are<00:00:53.580> you<00:00:53.699> currently<00:00:53.940> washing<00:00:54.540> with

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
many cars are you currently washing with

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.270 
many cars are you currently washing with
the<00:00:54.780> Eclipse<00:00:55.140> compared<00:00:55.830> to<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.070> previous

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the Eclipse compared to your previous

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.540 
the Eclipse compared to your previous
system<00:00:56.909> well<00:00:57.659> we're<00:00:57.900> able<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.320> do<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.370> to

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
system well we're able to do now up to

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.780 
system well we're able to do now up to
over<00:00:59.610> 200<00:01:00.510> cars<00:01:00.839> a<00:01:00.989> day<00:01:01.460> which<00:01:02.460> more<00:01:02.760> than

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
over 200 cars a day which more than

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.110 
over 200 cars a day which more than
doubled<00:01:03.479> our<00:01:03.659> past<00:01:04.530> capacity<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.610> that's

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
doubled our past capacity and that's

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.050 
doubled our past capacity and that's
because<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> double<00:01:07.320> base<00:01:07.560> system<00:01:08.220> we're

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
because of the double base system we're

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.690 
because of the double base system we're
able<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.420> dry<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> car<00:01:10.290> while<00:01:11.280> we're<00:01:11.490> also

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.779 
able to dry a car while we're also
washing<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.600> car<00:01:12.870> and<00:01:13.140> our<00:01:13.860> customers<00:01:14.549> have

dollars<00:02:43.209> would<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.390> recommend<00:02:44.750> an<00:02:45.140> eclipse

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
dollars would you recommend an eclipse

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.979 
dollars would you recommend an eclipse
system<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.190> a<00:02:46.220> current<00:02:46.670> carwash<00:02:47.090> owner<00:02:47.360> or<00:02:47.629> new

system to a current carwash owner or new
investor<00:02:48.500> well<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.519> number<00:02:49.879> one<00:02:49.910> reason<00:02:50.569> I

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
investor well the number one reason I

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.990 
investor well the number one reason I
would<00:02:50.840> recommend<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.920> it's<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.549> touchless

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
would recommend it is it's a touchless

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.410 
would recommend it is it's a touchless
system<00:02:53.930> that<00:02:54.590> can<00:02:54.860> provide<00:02:55.420> throughput

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
system that can provide throughput

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.839 
system that can provide throughput
that's<00:02:57.110> more<00:02:57.380> comparable<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.310> tunnel

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
that's more comparable to a tunnel

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.240 
that's more comparable to a tunnel
I<00:02:59.349> believe<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:01.730> touchless<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.780> preferred<00:03:03.380> by

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
I believe that touchless is preferred by

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.210 
I believe that touchless is preferred by
the<00:03:04.310> majority<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.120> people<00:03:05.269> that<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.980> are<00:03:07.099> in

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
the majority of people that that are in

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.520 
the majority of people that that are in
the<00:03:07.310> marketplace<00:03:07.790> it's<00:03:08.540> certainly<00:03:09.079> true<00:03:09.410> for

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
the marketplace it's certainly true for

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.490 
the marketplace it's certainly true for
us<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.700> know<00:03:10.819> I<00:03:10.849> can't<00:03:11.239> speak<00:03:11.660> for<00:03:12.140> every

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
us you know I can't speak for every

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.150 
us you know I can't speak for every
market<00:03:13.069> but<00:03:13.730> number<00:03:14.420> one<00:03:14.860> touchless<00:03:15.860> is<00:03:16.040> the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
market but number one touchless is the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.210 
market but number one touchless is the
way<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.370> go<00:03:16.670> in<00:03:16.910> my<00:03:17.329> opinion<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.410> if<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.040> have

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
way to go in my opinion and if you have

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.930 
way to go in my opinion and if you have
a<00:03:19.250> high<00:03:19.519> traffic<00:03:19.970> site<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:21.290> Eclipse<00:03:21.860> is<00:03:22.250> the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
a high traffic site the Eclipse is the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.470 
a high traffic site the Eclipse is the
way<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.180> get<00:03:23.510> volume<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.980> still<00:03:25.970> keep<00:03:26.269> that

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
way to get volume and still keep that

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.809 
way to get volume and still keep that
touchless<00:03:27.109> feature<00:03:27.470> that's<00:03:27.950> so<00:03:28.160> important

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
touchless feature that's so important

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.989 
touchless feature that's so important
and<00:03:28.910> set<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:29.630> apart
