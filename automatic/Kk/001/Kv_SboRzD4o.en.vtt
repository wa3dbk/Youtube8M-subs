disease hey folks I wanted to take a
minute<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.630> explain<00:00:09.990> mono<00:00:10.440> and

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
minute to explain mono and

polyunsaturated fats and what I think

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.089 
polyunsaturated fats and what I think
you<00:00:12.420> should<00:00:12.570> know<00:00:12.690> about<00:00:12.900> them<00:00:13.080> they're<00:00:13.980> one

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
you should know about them they're one

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.890 
you should know about them they're one
of<00:00:14.190> three<00:00:14.340> major<00:00:14.670> types<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.179> dietary<00:00:15.509> fat<00:00:15.690> that

more<00:00:46.860> time<00:00:46.920> talking<00:00:47.460> about<00:00:47.489> them<00:00:47.730> because

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
more time talking about them because

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.430 
more time talking about them because
they<00:00:48.450> don't<00:00:48.570> define<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.140> distinction
