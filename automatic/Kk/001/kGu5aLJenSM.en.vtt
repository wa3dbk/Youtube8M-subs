00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Tell me, what are you talking about? 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.580
 know a new release of the canon one 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.770
 camera that generated controversy ones loved 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.469
 others hated and then what is the real 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.980
 Are you going to tell me now how about xc? 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.980
 10 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.340
 here is the new beauty of the canon this 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.080
 camera that is ready for you to record and 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.880
 because I said controversy because those who 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.410
 they just said what it is 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.090
 something totally ready for you 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.949
 simply charge the battery and 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.060
 aggravating and others have said that it is very 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.140
 face 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.550
 What I can say is that my 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.380
 experience with her here is one thing 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.329
 cool I think for the level of 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.430
 market for product placement 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.230
 that it is intended is a solution 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.160
 interesting because because it comes with 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.879
 a lens 240 here yields well 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.469
 cool 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.719
 sure and she's 28 at the beginning and 56 at the end 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.730
 A little dark is true but it's a 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.530
 lens also with very large renders 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.940
 In addition, it has very 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.920
 interesting comes with a viewfinder 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.480
 so that helps a lot for those 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.969
 recordings that you have to do in 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.860
 outdoor environment outdoor environments 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.320
 you can not see the contrast 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.850
 it works great and it's 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.200
 a camera just smart for you 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.869
 do this stereo mic here in 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.549
 Up the beach that moves thank you. 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.400
 in the wizard she comes with this 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.040
 knowledge since you can change the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.890
 position of your chanter range 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.210
 modules of the automatic mode manual is 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.470
 a camera that works very well in 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.090
 various positions 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.770
 and we went here in a little room that is 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.659
 a long art for us to test use 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.090
 cane and it proved well 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.189
 interesting it comes with from audi q5 is a 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.869
 new processor of the canon and she has a 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.520
 much like smile with the 5 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.159
 March 3 that we think is the best 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.710
 What do you have from Canon's DSLR cameras? 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.590
 then it reaches the maximum iso of 20,000 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.049
 then we got a lot of grain but it 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.850
 to use up to 8 thousand 10 thousand suddenly she 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.390
 works well on the recording mode 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.340
 she proposes to write in 4k on cards and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.439
 plague and we asked him what 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.439
 engineer, he told us that the file 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.479
 recorded at 305 megabits per second is 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.110
 three times more than panasonic up to 4 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.090
 vine 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.500
 so it really works is an art 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.979
 much denser file much more 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.430
 complete it records in 24 or 30 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.799
 4k mode and also 60 frames 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.329
 1.080 that it also supports recording a 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.510
 feature that I found interesting is that 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.700
 it writes to 4k in cefast card but 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.219
 also writes a proxy to the 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.810
 same time in Hindu to slot then you 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.370
 already if you want to have an experience 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.980
 more fluent on the island you can already 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.959
 dictate the proxy is with the file that 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.359
 had your sd card 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.310
 it comes with an internal nd filter that is 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.709
 that he cuts three stops 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.810
 I think this helps a lot and by 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.989
 be a camera that costs $ 2500 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.900
 but it comes with 64 gb cefet card 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.120
 which costs 300 and the cost reader + 16 + 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.799
 or - it 's a camera that ends up coming out 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.970
 $ 2,500 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.579
 I still find it a bit expensive in the market. 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.919
 but if you are a fan of the 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.269
 it's a much more consistent 4k file 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.549
 consistent than it already four per 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.480
 example is an interesting departure I 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.099
 would give a rating 688 to this camera and 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.599
 because of the cost because otherwise 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.069
 would be a very interesting break for 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.230
 people make a cover of this gives nothing 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.549
 for example but in case we are using 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.859
 a lx in because of the cost 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.340
 simply because it's a very camera 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.340
 cool 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.490
 ae
