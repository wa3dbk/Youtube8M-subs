00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.970
 4 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:18.050
 the service people what is going on this year shops 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.599
 and there are again news of the 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.180
 electronic sports world patents that the 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.250
 in 2015 a pure call of duty tournament 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.590
 The whole thing will start like here 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.269
 will be able to see from the second to the third 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.910
 May be the second third 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.090
 be a weekend and it will be and that 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.589
 is that really great class 12,000 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.420
 be a spectator on the spot 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:41.150
 So you have to imagine the teams 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.070
 since they are virtually easy to 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.979
 put a mainstage and sit in front of him 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.479
 just 12 to 13,000 spectators that is 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.589
 really crass when you look at that 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:50.930
 imagine if you sit up there and 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.210
 plays a call of so many people 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.369
 Duty match will be eight teams 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.059
 Come on the tournament from all over 

00:00:55.369 --> 00:01:00.890
 world without what also correct gas are 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.659
 50,000 dollar price bridge this 8 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.640
 that is in my opinion for as well 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.049
 the teams are doing a lot right first of all 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.760
 if you look down here 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.010
 the prize money is distributed 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.810
 the first one gets 20,000 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.119
 dollar the second gets $ 10,000 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.920
 the third and fourth gets 6000 and 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.170
 the last four are still getting 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.689
 2000 dollars so speaks goes to that 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.149
 tournament then you will lose the last 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.439
 all games still in 2000 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.270
 dollar profit 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.130
 it is in my opinion right 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.899
 really cool one has very rare 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.310
 and yes, how can you at the tournament 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.020
 Of course it is relative 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.799
 difficult for such a tournament invited 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.869
 to become 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.689
 There are several offliner solar 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.920
 events where you look for the esc 2015 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.560
