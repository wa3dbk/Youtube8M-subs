 this sniper and what I tell you 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.960
 always whenever four dead with 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.730
 a sniper game I tell you is 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.780
 that in the following games we already know 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.059
 he lost the essence of carrying the 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.980
 sniper is always saying what 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.079

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.750

 distance I put a sniper but 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:51.410
 yes to kill 21 better because here 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.960
 I'm going to get better at the sniper 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.310
 because I find it useful or if it is not 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.960
 for a shock and if I could not kill 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.830
 someone long distance and here then 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.830

 tomato man be good uncle poor tree 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.060
 well here you can distinguish the one you have in 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.500
 the back extends the rocket like 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.500
 of good man s 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.260
 but nobody 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.100
 it's here you shoot man 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.030
 man 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.810
 Over there 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.810
 nobody over there 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.170
 the windows or nobody always just put 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.170
 people the windows 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.620
 we are here at the beginning always 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.500
 groping 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.750
 added 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.320
 above 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.320
 I'm going to play 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.470
 do not 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.220
 not good if it's good 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.090
 the existence 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.090
 I do not think he's going 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.439
 my mother, yes, they were changing 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:16.719
 to see colleagues no one who is 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.120
 plugged in from here in a few feet is not 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.750
 do not 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.750
 good 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.490
 until I see 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.750
 and there you were, I wanted to catch you 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.070
 I wanted to catch 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.070
 and in the background 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.540
 behind the tree raise the tree I will 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.540
 load the tree 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.240
 good good good good good because it's 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.240
 that trees exist here as not 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.060
 too 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.500
 for a whole time forest but why 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.500
 because they can leave trees 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.849
 it's a standing guy 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.610
 bother her 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.019
 because empty media does not appear 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.019
 and they kill him to see where he is 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:33.970
 good 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.310
 and explosion there is in all the medium of light 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.080
 forest that had and is expanding 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.390
 then the car is what happens 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.620
 to see if I'm going to start 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.620
 and also to see it 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.090
 touched one would persist and be more red 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.300
 that a cherry tomato you'll see 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.830
 why in this game if when you 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.830
 they shoot snows or they leave 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.780
 once nobody 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.850
 good 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.850
 good do not die man 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.190
 to triple with the knife 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.660
 mother of mine two accents in the house 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:29.830
 and no drop in the head 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.830
 from the editor to see where they are 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.660
 good 3 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.289
 well well well well managed of the 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.800
 window 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:45.659
 well I believe that extreme cruelty 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.180
 for all enemies to all members 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.289
 of a team to put me to dispose not 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.330

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.960
