actually explore this too much let me go
exploring<00:03:51.540> just<00:03:51.750> for<00:03:51.960> a<00:03:51.990> few<00:03:52.290> minutes<00:03:52.650> here

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
exploring just for a few minutes here

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.590 
exploring just for a few minutes here
maybe<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.460> minute<00:03:53.760> or<00:03:53.850> so<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.030> didn't<00:03:54.360> look<00:03:54.450> in

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
exploring up to you we'll just do a

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.910 
exploring up to you we'll just do a
little<00:03:57.930> bit<00:03:58.110> here<00:03:58.260> as<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:58.500> can<00:03:58.560> see<00:03:58.800> it's

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
little bit here as you can see it's

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.250 
little bit here as you can see it's
close<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.550> a<00:03:59.580> diamond<00:04:00.270> level<00:04:00.630> so<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.870> will<00:04:01.050> be

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
close to a diamond level so you will be

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.840 
close to a diamond level so you will be
finding<00:04:01.680> diamonds<00:04:01.890> around<00:04:02.190> here<00:04:02.490> as<00:04:02.550> well<00:04:02.730> if

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
finding diamonds around here as well if

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.760 
finding diamonds around here as well if
I<00:04:02.970> just<00:04:03.000> go<00:04:03.300> down<00:04:03.480> here<00:04:03.750> for<00:04:03.990> a<00:04:04.020> quick<00:04:04.260> second

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
I just go down here for a quick second

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.630 
I just go down here for a quick second
maybe<00:04:05.280> we<00:04:05.520> could<00:04:05.700> find<00:04:06.000> some<00:04:06.300> any<00:04:07.050> coming<00:04:07.440> in

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
maybe we could find some any coming in

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.640 
maybe we could find some any coming in
right<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:09.030> got<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.180> cave<00:04:09.450> over<00:04:09.600> here<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:10.050> don't

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
right you got a cave over here I don't

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.260 
right you got a cave over here I don't
want<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:10.950> get<00:04:11.070> too<00:04:11.250> off-track<00:04:11.700> but<00:04:11.880> I<00:04:11.910> believe

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
want to get too off-track but I believe

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.790 
want to get too off-track but I believe
there<00:04:12.570> could<00:04:12.720> be<00:04:12.780> some<00:04:13.110> diamonds<00:04:13.500> right<00:04:13.650> over

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
there could be some diamonds right over

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.590 
there could be some diamonds right over
here<00:04:13.950> not<00:04:14.490> we<00:04:14.640> come<00:04:14.820> right<00:04:15.030> back<00:04:15.240> into<00:04:15.450> the

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
here not we come right back into the

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.030 
here not we come right back into the
stronghold<00:04:16.170> here<00:04:16.350> so<00:04:16.560> let's<00:04:16.710> just<00:04:16.799> keep

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
stronghold here so let's just keep

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.950 
stronghold here so let's just keep
looking<00:04:17.100> around<00:04:17.460> but<00:04:18.120> honestly<00:04:18.450> this<00:04:18.660> seed<00:04:18.930> is

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:18.960 
looking around but honestly this seed is

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.870 
looking around but honestly this seed is
the<00:04:19.170> best<00:04:19.590> seed<00:04:19.830> I<00:04:19.979> have<00:04:20.100> ever<00:04:20.310> seen

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
the best seed I have ever seen

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.940 
the best seed I have ever seen
with<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.270> simple<00:04:21.570> name<00:04:21.840> like<00:04:22.109> book<00:04:22.380> it's<00:04:22.650> hard

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
with a simple name like book it's hard

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.560 
with a simple name like book it's hard
to<00:04:23.130> forget<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:23.790> if<00:04:24.180> you're

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
to forget so if you're

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.090 
to forget so if you're
want<00:04:24.690> to<00:04:24.750> play<00:04:24.930> on<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.200> seat<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.470> would<00:04:25.740> highly

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
want to play on the seat I would highly

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.920 
want to play on the seat I would highly
recommend<00:04:26.580> it<00:04:26.730> because<00:04:27.120> there<00:04:27.420> is<00:04:27.510> so<00:04:27.750> much

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
recommend it because there is so much

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.050 
recommend it because there is so much
for<00:04:28.200> you<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.380> do<00:04:28.530> right<00:04:28.800> off<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.490> start<00:04:29.700> of<00:04:29.880> the
