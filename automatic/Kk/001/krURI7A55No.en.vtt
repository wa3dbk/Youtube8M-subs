SLI<00:00:12.900> bridge<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.830> wanted<00:00:14.430> to<00:00:14.490> show<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.700> what<00:00:14.879> it

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
SLI bridge I wanted to show you what it

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.779 
SLI bridge I wanted to show you what it
looks<00:00:15.180> like<00:00:15.500> it's<00:00:16.500> an<00:00:16.590> LED<00:00:16.890> bridge<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:17.670> it

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
looks like it's an LED bridge so it

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.430 
looks like it's an LED bridge so it
actually<00:00:17.940> lights<00:00:18.300> up<00:00:18.539> kind<00:00:18.780> of<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.930> much<00:00:19.199> better

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
actually lights up kind of a much better

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.800 
actually lights up kind of a much better
looking<00:00:19.680> than<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.890> actual<00:00:20.390> regular<00:00:21.390> one<00:00:21.539> side

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
looking than the actual regular one side

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.700

it oh you know how you can buy it some
of<00:00:38.640> them<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.059> some<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> bridges<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:40.110> when

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
of them the some of the bridges are when

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.959 
of them the some of the bridges are when
the<00:00:40.590> cards<00:00:40.860> are<00:00:40.949> really<00:00:41.039> close<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.789> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the cards are really close this is the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.970 
the cards are really close this is the
space<00:00:42.239> one<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.530> get<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> three-way

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
space one so you can get a three-way

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.490 
space one so you can get a three-way
bridge<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.760> etc<00:00:45.090> etc<00:00:45.359> but<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.230> wanted<00:00:46.410> to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
don't think there's much to it get it in

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.330 
don't think there's much to it get it in
okay<00:01:15.230> it's<00:01:16.230> kind<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.440> dark<00:01:16.620> but<00:01:16.980> obviously

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
okay it's kind of dark but obviously

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
it's gonna illuminate and there's the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.600 
it's gonna illuminate and there's the
back<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.550> plastic<00:01:21.560> sheathing

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
back of it and it's plastic sheathing

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.710
