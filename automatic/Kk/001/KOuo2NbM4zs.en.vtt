00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.580
 Hi everybody! 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.640
 I'm Shirley from Shirley's Wardrobe. 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.740
 Keep watching as I catch up with you about my favorite items from the River Island party collection. 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.840
 I will show you some outfits 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.880
 and also some matching makeup styling. 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.980
 I like to come to River Island 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.540
 and especially during the festive season, 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.840
 because I know I can find a complete outfit that is within my budget. 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.540
 The prices are great. 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.560
 The outfits look so luxurious. 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.020
 I know I'm going to find a nice outfit. 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.340
 I love that this dress is so feminine. 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.060
 It's very sexy, 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.280
 but it has a nice peplum detail at the hips. 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.560
 It is a striking color. 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.060
 And if you really want to impress, 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.160
 then this is the perfect dress to choose. 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.640
 I have kept the accessories very luxurious 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.020
 with this gold chain. 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.120
 The gold fits perfectly with the beautiful details on the clutch 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.060
 and with the beautiful shoes that I am wearing now. 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.300
 For this outfit I kept the makeup very simple. 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.300
 I have chosen a beautiful nude lip 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.480
 and for the eyes I used natural colors, 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.760
 but made the whole more dramatic with eyeliner 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.500
 and a smokey eye. 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.880
 For my second outfit 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.400
 I chose this beautiful dress. 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.140
 It is made of sequins 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.360
 and River Island is known for their amazing clothes full of sequins. 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.800
 Another thing that I love about this dress 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.020
 is the detail on the back. 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.660
 The dress has a beautiful, deeply cut back 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.800
 which is very elegant. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.000
 I combined the dress with a pair of beautiful minimalistic heels, 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.240
 because the legs are bare. 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.960
 I think they complement the outfit very well. 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.420
 For this makeup look 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.480
 I played a bit with color 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.360
 on my lips and my nails. 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.840
 I have chosen a very striking red color 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.540
 and I think it perfectly complements the monochrome colors of the outfit. 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.940
 As for my hair 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.940
 I kept it beautiful and elegant 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.960
 with a middle partition 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.260
 and some loose tufts on the front 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.640
 and the rest I have secured at the back. 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.320
 For outfit number 3 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.120
 I chose the classic Little Black Dress. 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.800
 What I love about this dress, 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.020
 is that it has nice lace details on the hem. 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.600
 And to add a little more character to the outfit 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.280
 I chose these super fluffy orange heels, 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.880
 which I am really in love with! 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.820
 To make everything fit together, 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.020
 I have chosen an orange lipstick. 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.820
 And my hair and my earrings 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.820
 reminiscent of the 1920s, 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.780
 which I find very cool. 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.380
 I think that style is very nice for a Christmas party. 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.520
