00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
believe destiny could beat it and the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.649 
believe destiny could beat it and the
only<00:01:50.579> reason<00:01:50.670> whether<00:01:51.030> saying<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.570> is

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
only reason whether saying that is

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.810 
only reason whether saying that is
because<00:01:51.720> destiny<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.590> seen<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> long-term

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
because destiny is seen as a long-term

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.020 
because destiny is seen as a long-term
game<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:55.020> developers<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.820> destiny<00:01:56.820> are

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
game and the developers of destiny are

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.850 
game and the developers of destiny are
saying<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.750> will<00:01:57.840> last<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.320> up<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.590> 10

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
saying that it will last for up to 10

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.139 
saying that it will last for up to 10
years<00:01:59.100> with<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.460> content<00:01:59.880> they're<00:01:59.969> going<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
years with the content they're going to

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.160 
years with the content they're going to
bring<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.689> it's<00:02:00.780> gonna<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:01.020> an<00:02:01.079> ongoing

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
bring out to it it's gonna be an ongoing

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.399 
bring out to it it's gonna be an ongoing
game<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.729> think<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.600> think<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.140> could

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
game and I think that I think I could

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.260 
game and I think that I think I could
believe<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.829> if<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:05.399> made<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.759> going<00:02:06.119> I

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
believe that if they made it on going I

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.150 
believe that if they made it on going I
reckon<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.719> would<00:02:06.810> definitely<00:02:07.079> break<00:02:07.920> some

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
reckon it would definitely break some

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.309 
reckon it would definitely break some
records<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.759> most<00:02:08.970> games<00:02:09.360> sold<00:02:09.690> however

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
records on the most games sold however

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.470 
records on the most games sold however
within<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.649> first<00:02:10.830> few<00:02:11.009> hours<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.520> think<00:02:11.940> GTA<00:02:12.270> 5

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
within the first few hours I think GTA 5

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.730 
within the first few hours I think GTA 5
will<00:02:12.720> still<00:02:12.959> keep<00:02:13.170> their<00:02:13.379> record

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
will still keep their record

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.530 
will still keep their record
there<00:02:14.010> but<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.520> could<00:02:14.700> see<00:02:14.850> destiny<00:02:15.120> going<00:02:15.420> on

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
there but I could see destiny going on

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.420 
there but I could see destiny going on
for<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.690> long<00:02:15.810> time<00:02:16.080> as<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.590> unique<00:02:17.160> game

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430

and the only reason why that is

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.050 
and the only reason why that is
happening<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.190> will<00:03:05.340> see<00:03:05.550> this<00:03:05.700> around

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
happening and you will see this around

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.670 
happening and you will see this around
the<00:03:06.180> country<00:03:06.630> it's<00:03:07.140> because<00:03:07.410> they<00:03:07.590> are

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
the country it's because they are

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.890 
the country it's because they are
preparing<00:03:08.130> for<00:03:08.790> next<00:03:08.820> gen<00:03:09.300> by<00:03:09.540> lowering<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
prices they'll probably lower the costs

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.790

as<00:03:19.530> much<00:03:20.220> as<00:03:20.460> they<00:03:20.670> would<00:03:20.790> hope<00:03:21.030> for<00:03:21.060> as<00:03:21.510> they

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
as much as they would hope for as they

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.510 
as much as they would hope for as they
of<00:03:22.110> course<00:03:22.200> they<00:03:22.650> lowered<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.070> prices<00:03:23.340> for

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
of course they lowered the prices for

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.220 
of course they lowered the prices for
the<00:03:23.730> game<00:03:24.000> they<00:03:24.360> also<00:03:24.480> usually<00:03:24.720> lower<00:03:25.080> the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
the game they also usually lower the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.810 
the game they also usually lower the
prices<00:03:25.440> for<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.800> game<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.280> show<00:03:26.520> that<00:03:26.700> they

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
prices for the game to show that they

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.250 
prices for the game to show that they
have<00:03:27.030> another<00:03:27.300> game<00:03:27.510> coming<00:03:27.870> out<00:03:27.960> which<00:03:28.230> is

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
have another game coming out which is

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.570 
have another game coming out which is
most<00:03:28.560> likely<00:03:28.740> going<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:28.950> be<00:03:29.010> better<00:03:29.190> than<00:03:29.340> it

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
most likely going to be better than it

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.980 
most likely going to be better than it
and<00:03:29.730> obviously<00:03:30.330> it's<00:03:30.600> not<00:03:30.750> going<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.930> be

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990
