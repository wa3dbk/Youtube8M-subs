00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.700
 behind the drip row after surgery storm in 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.660
 the wilderness this weapon has acquired the world 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.240
 fame and it is not surprising because that 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.060
 war was the first war live 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.450
 star anti-aircraft missile complex with 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.800
 300 came later on numerous 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.970
 exhibitions 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.309
 buyers are experts 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.910
 were amazed at the possibilities 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.109
 Russian weapons since n pre with 300 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.259
 are direct competitors in the market 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.259
 armament 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:31.909
 development fundamentally new 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.140
 anti-aircraft missile systems in the USSR and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.880
 USA 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.560
 started almost simultaneously 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.540
 same sixties of the last century 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.970
 in our country such a complex would be with 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.990
 300 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.730
 received indexes in which meant one of 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.560
 Kabula 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.540
 new system was intended to 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.720
 replacements for rollback circle 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.960
 an American appeared in a cooperative which 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.820
 came search replaced charging a in the south 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.050
 in the press service of the city hall 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.720
 in the early eighties both 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.610
 systems were adopted 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.050
 despite the similarity of the difference complexes 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.260
 between them were quite significant 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.290
 they concluded first of all you their 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.290
 purpose 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.750
 about the purpose of the system 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.960
 was different 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.370
 and should not 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.810
 patriot 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.540
 intended to deal with the car 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.149
 aerodynamic means 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.760
 means and 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.450
 cruise missiles the system address 300vm 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.050
 exuded to fight lead troops 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.340
 ballistic missiles 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.410
 tactical and operational 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.190
 tactical purpose 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.450
 and this essentially determined the fish 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.860
 dialogue and building intends to have 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.530
 technical execution of all these 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.690
 funds 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.899
 so with 300 g 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.239
 is located on the tracked base of the tank 

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:52.460
 t 80 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.440
 i.e. can move 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.869
 almost any terrain with very 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.620
 decent speed 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.590
 time needed for deployment 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.220
 agree here is five minutes 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.240
 In this OS, the system is imported 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.560
 consists of several trailers 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.720
 which are mounted on the wheelbase 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.020
 deployment time and at least half an hour that 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.340
 significantly reduces the vitality itself 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.179
 systems 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:16.809
 but this is not the only 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.809
 advantage with 300 in iran 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.699
 the difference is 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:26.319
 between the patriot system and three hundred more of them 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.699
 by participation 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:29.259
 rocket control 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.539
 in this direction the rocket system with 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:33.739
 patriots classic teams 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.249
 non classical method 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:37.749
 commands are transferred to earth system if 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.459
 today does not require victims escort 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.119
 rocket system from 300 to iran built on 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:45.319
 rocket control principles on board 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.969
 missiles on the rocket onboard the teacher himself 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.049
 produces missile control teams 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.049
 controlled according to r 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.049
 to this teacher 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.669
 vertical bid 1 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:59.709
 places risky has the ability 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.779
 bombard targets flying from any 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:02.689
 directions 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.149
 without turning the launchers 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:08.299
 poet reuters start sloping 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.299
 hence entering intense maneuvers 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.319
 deploy launcher 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.899
 or pre-arrange it like this 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:18.289
 to try to cover up all the dangerous 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:19.229
 directions 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.389
 this greatly reduces the firing 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.389
 complex features 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.319
 according to the unanimous opinion of experts and 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.329
 not only russian our system 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.729
 almost all indicators 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.199
 exceeds transatlantic 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.959
 according to experts, the American is behind 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.669
 us in this area for at least five years 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.769
 can we keep this gap 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:42.629
 will seem
