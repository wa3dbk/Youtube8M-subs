00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
in the Star Wars saga not just because

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.020 
in the Star Wars saga not just because
he<00:02:35.320> is<00:02:35.500> powerful<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.340> know<00:02:36.400> with<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.670> force

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
he is powerful you know with the force

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.190 
he is powerful you know with the force
but<00:02:37.270> because<00:02:37.600> he<00:02:37.870> rejects<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.560> dark<00:02:38.830> side<00:02:39.100> and

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
but because he rejects the dark side and

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.270 
but because he rejects the dark side and
rejects<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.320> several<00:02:41.709> times<00:02:41.739> nonetheless

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280

and<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.980> me<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:46.470> idea<00:02:47.470> personally<00:02:48.370> but<00:02:48.910> with

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
and to me the idea personally but with

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.090 
and to me the idea personally but with
the<00:02:49.540> relationship<00:02:49.660> between<00:02:50.200> Anakin<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:50.920> Luke

the relationship between Anakin and Luke
is<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:52.120> Anakin<00:02:52.780> succumbed<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.590> dark

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
is that Anakin succumbed to the dark

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.070 
is that Anakin succumbed to the dark
side<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.190> force<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.790> Luke<00:02:55.480> didn't<00:02:55.930> in

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080
