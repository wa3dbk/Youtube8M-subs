it's<00:01:16.350> pretty<00:01:16.530> easy<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.980> track<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.340> all<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.580> I

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
it's pretty easy to track it all and I

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.040 
it's pretty easy to track it all and I
write<00:01:17.790> everything<00:01:18.060> down<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.330> my<00:01:18.510> workout<00:01:18.840> log

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
so that's just another place to keep

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
for most college students I would assume

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.030

between classes I came back for an hour

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.550 
between classes I came back for an hour
just<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.330> this<00:01:36.480> done<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:37.230> then<00:01:37.350> I'm<00:01:37.440> off

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
just to get this done and then I'm off

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.260 
just to get this done and then I'm off

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
to another class in an advising

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300 
to another class in an advising
appointment<00:01:39.360> which<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:39.990> no<00:01:40.170> fun<00:01:40.200> at<00:01:40.740> all<00:01:40.980> and

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
appointment which is no fun at all and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.310 
appointment which is no fun at all and
this<00:01:41.670> machine<00:01:41.880> right<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.630> didn't<00:01:43.050> like<00:01:43.080> it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
this machine right here I didn't like it

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.170 
this machine right here I didn't like it
the<00:01:43.410> first<00:01:43.620> time<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:44.190> I<00:01:44.220> did<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.490> honestly<00:01:45.000> I

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the first time that I did it honestly I

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.450 
the first time that I did it honestly I
tried<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.690> out<00:01:45.780> again<00:01:46.080> and<00:01:46.260> I<00:01:46.860> found<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.280> when

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
tried it out again and I found that when

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.400 
tried it out again and I found that when
you<00:01:47.580> make<00:01:47.730> weird<00:01:48.000> faces<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.660> increases<00:01:49.380> your

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
you make weird faces it increases your

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.490 
you make weird faces it increases your
gains<00:01:49.770> by<00:01:50.610> about<00:01:51.360> two<00:01:51.780> hundred<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.200> fifty

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
gains by about two hundred and fifty

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.050 
gains by about two hundred and fifty
percent<00:01:52.650> so<00:01:53.280> that's<00:01:53.370> why<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.550> make<00:01:53.760> all<00:01:53.880> these

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
percent so that's why I make all these

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.400 
percent so that's why I make all these
weird<00:01:54.240> faces<00:01:54.570> when<00:01:54.690> I'm<00:01:54.780> working<00:01:55.020> out<00:01:55.110> it's

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
weird faces when I'm working out it's

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.690 
weird faces when I'm working out it's
weird<00:01:55.590> because<00:01:55.740> when<00:01:55.980> you're<00:01:56.100> working<00:01:56.130> out

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
weird because when you're working out

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.830 
weird because when you're working out
you<00:01:56.820> don't<00:01:56.910> really<00:01:57.120> notice<00:01:57.300> that<00:01:57.660> you're

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
you don't really notice that you're

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.210 
you don't really notice that you're
making<00:01:58.110> weird<00:01:58.290> faces<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.710> then<00:01:58.800> when<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.920> sit

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
making weird faces and then when I sit

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.240 
making weird faces and then when I sit
here<00:01:59.370> and<00:01:59.550> watch<00:01:59.730> this<00:02:00.060> look<00:02:01.050> at<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.380> I'm

after that we did a few sets of
shoulders<00:02:34.000> this<00:02:34.660> exercise<00:02:35.260> right<00:02:35.500> here<00:02:35.710> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
shoulders this exercise right here the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.850 
shoulders this exercise right here the
standing<00:02:36.430> dumbbell<00:02:36.940> overhead<00:02:37.570> press<00:02:37.990> it

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
standing dumbbell overhead press it

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.100 
standing dumbbell overhead press it
doesn't<00:02:39.460> seem<00:02:39.700> like<00:02:39.940> it's<00:02:40.270> that<00:02:40.420> intense<00:02:40.840> but

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
doesn't seem like it's that intense but

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.260 
doesn't seem like it's that intense but
when<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.350> start<00:02:41.590> doing<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.430> really<00:02:42.790> works

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
when you start doing it it really works

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.390 
when you start doing it it really works
the<00:02:43.510> shoulders<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:44.200> can<00:02:44.650> do<00:02:44.740> overhead<00:02:45.160> press

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
the shoulders I can do overhead press

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.430 
the shoulders I can do overhead press
and<00:02:45.730> probably<00:02:46.300> do<00:02:46.450> like<00:02:47.110> 165<00:02:48.100> for<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:49.150> 5x5<00:02:50.050> but

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
and probably do like 165 for a 5x5 but

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.260 
and probably do like 165 for a 5x5 but
doing<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.800> with<00:02:50.860> dumbbells<00:02:51.550> is<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.850> huge

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
doing it with dumbbells is a huge

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.120 
doing it with dumbbells is a huge
difference<00:02:52.720> I<00:02:52.840> worked<00:02:53.050> up<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.320> 50s<00:02:53.830> and

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
difference I worked up to 50s and

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.770 
difference I worked up to 50s and
obviously<00:02:54.700> my<00:02:54.880> shoulders<00:02:55.270> were<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.450> little<00:02:55.660> bit

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
obviously my shoulders were a little bit

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.080 
obviously my shoulders were a little bit
tired<00:02:55.960> from<00:02:56.160> doing<00:02:57.160> all<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.490> pressing<00:02:57.820> before

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
tired from doing all the pressing before

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.910 
tired from doing all the pressing before
that's<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.390> idea<00:02:58.720> chest<00:02:59.260> first<00:02:59.440> lit<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.710> little

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
that's the idea chest first lit a little

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.770 
that's the idea chest first lit a little
bit<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.100> shoulders<00:03:00.400> anyway<00:03:01.060> with<00:03:01.210> those<00:03:01.390> fifty

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
bit of shoulders anyway with those fifty

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.240 
bit of shoulders anyway with those fifty
pound<00:03:01.960> dumbbells<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.380> only<00:03:02.500> got<00:03:02.710> that<00:03:02.920> for

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
pound dumbbells I only got that for

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.670 
pound dumbbells I only got that for
eight<00:03:03.610> reps<00:03:04.150> which<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.600> pretty<00:03:04.990> weak<00:03:05.260> compared

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
eight reps which is pretty weak compared

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.800 
eight reps which is pretty weak compared
to<00:03:05.770> what<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.400> can<00:03:06.610> do<00:03:06.700> with<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:06.910> barbell<00:03:07.300> and

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
to what I can do with the barbell and

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.050 
to what I can do with the barbell and
then<00:03:07.960> to<00:03:08.050> finish<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.440> off<00:03:08.560> we<00:03:08.860> did<00:03:09.280> three<00:03:09.790> sets

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
then to finish it off we did three sets

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.930 
then to finish it off we did three sets
of<00:03:10.270> these<00:03:10.480> decline<00:03:11.050> skull<00:03:11.740> crushers<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.430> great

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
of these decline skull crushers a great

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.880 
of these decline skull crushers a great
exercise<00:03:13.360> I'm<00:03:13.960> sure<00:03:14.170> most<00:03:14.320> people<00:03:14.650> have<00:03:14.740> done

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
exercise I'm sure most people have done

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.770 
exercise I'm sure most people have done
regular<00:03:15.550> skull<00:03:15.790> crushers<00:03:16.150> on<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.330> flat<00:03:16.570> bench

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
regular skull crushers on a flat bench

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.240 
regular skull crushers on a flat bench
but<00:03:17.020> when<00:03:17.140> you<00:03:17.230> do<00:03:17.320> them<00:03:17.440> on<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.560> decline<00:03:17.980> I<00:03:18.010> feel

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
but when you do them on a decline I feel

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.950 
but when you do them on a decline I feel
like<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.430> get<00:03:18.550> a<00:03:18.580> much<00:03:18.820> better<00:03:19.060> stretch<00:03:19.660> at

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
like you get a much better stretch at

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.570 
like you get a much better stretch at
the<00:03:20.050> bottom<00:03:20.350> of<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.590> movement<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.400> better

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
the bottom of the movement and a better

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.790 
the bottom of the movement and a better
contraction<00:03:22.330> at<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.630> top<00:03:22.810> may<00:03:23.410> just<00:03:23.590> be<00:03:23.680> me

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
contraction at the top may just be me

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.320 
contraction at the top may just be me
but<00:03:23.950> try<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.220> out<00:03:24.340> if<00:03:24.550> you've<00:03:24.790> done<00:03:25.060> skull

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
but try it out if you've done skull

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.180 
but try it out if you've done skull
crushers<00:03:25.660> before<00:03:25.960> I<00:03:25.990> really<00:03:26.740> recommend<00:03:27.130> that

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
crushers before I really recommend that

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.070 
crushers before I really recommend that
one<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.400> lot<00:03:27.610> in<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:28.000> final<00:03:28.330> three<00:03:28.600> sets<00:03:28.870> of<00:03:28.990> the

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
one a lot in the final three sets of the

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.020 
one a lot in the final three sets of the
workout<00:03:29.380> which<00:03:29.500> is<00:03:29.680> some<00:03:29.860> dumbbell<00:03:30.250> overhead

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
workout which is some dumbbell overhead

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.080 
workout which is some dumbbell overhead
extensions<00:03:31.900> for<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.620> triceps<00:03:33.040> pretty<00:03:33.910> much

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
extensions for the triceps pretty much

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.400 
extensions for the triceps pretty much
the<00:03:34.270> workout<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.660> three<00:03:34.840> sets<00:03:35.050> of<00:03:35.200> everything

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
the workout of three sets of everything

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.810
