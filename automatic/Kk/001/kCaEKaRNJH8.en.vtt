down to those guys that are brought in

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.130 
down to those guys that are brought in

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
games and it didn't go our way so you

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.140 
games and it didn't go our way so you

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
know it's one of those things we can't

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.120 
know it's one of those things we can't
beat<00:06:23.330> ourselves<00:06:23.420> up<00:06:23.720> we<00:06:23.900> got<00:06:24.020> a<00:06:24.050> game<00:06:24.230> Tony<00:06:24.470> why

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
beat ourselves up we got a game Tony why

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.800 
beat ourselves up we got a game Tony why
did<00:06:25.280> nothing<00:06:25.400> him<00:06:25.670> do<00:06:25.790> well<00:06:26.060> to<00:06:26.270> shut<00:06:26.630> us<00:06:26.780> down

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
did nothing him do well to shut us down

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.110 
did nothing him do well to shut us down
and<00:06:27.110> prevent<00:06:27.440> those<00:06:27.560> guys<00:06:27.830> executing<00:06:28.550> one

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
and prevent those guys executing one

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.370 
and prevent those guys executing one
thing<00:06:29.240> is<00:06:29.360> pushing<00:06:29.510> the<00:06:29.690> third<00:06:29.930> period<00:06:30.170> I

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
thing is pushing the third period I

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.290 
thing is pushing the third period I
think<00:06:30.590> they<00:06:30.710> forced<00:06:31.100> us<00:06:31.190> to<00:06:31.370> the<00:06:31.490> outside<00:06:31.640> and

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
think they forced us to the outside and

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.060 
think they forced us to the outside and
we<00:06:32.930> stayed<00:06:33.200> to<00:06:33.350> the<00:06:33.470> outside<00:06:33.770> rather<00:06:33.950> than

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
we stayed to the outside rather than

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.060 
we stayed to the outside rather than
battling<00:06:34.550> through<00:06:34.730> engendered<00:06:35.120> in<00:06:35.500> and<00:06:36.500> they

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
battling through engendered in and they

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.010 
battling through engendered in and they
encouraged<00:06:37.850> us<00:06:38.030> to<00:06:38.210> get<00:06:38.360> away<00:06:38.450> from<00:06:38.570> our<00:06:38.840> team

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
encouraged us to get away from our team

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.780 
encouraged us to get away from our team
play<00:06:39.230> which<00:06:39.410> we<00:06:39.560> did<00:06:39.740> we<00:06:39.920> went<00:06:40.130> to<00:06:40.250> individual

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
play which we did we went to individual

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.370 
play which we did we went to individual
trying<00:06:41.330> to<00:06:41.390> skate<00:06:41.600> through<00:06:41.630> guys<00:06:42.050> with<00:06:42.290> the

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
trying to skate through guys with the

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.840 
trying to skate through guys with the
puck<00:06:42.560> rather<00:06:42.860> than<00:06:43.130> shipping<00:06:43.520> it<00:06:43.640> and<00:06:43.730> moving

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850 
puck rather than shipping it and moving

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.660 
puck rather than shipping it and moving
it<00:06:44.000> wide<00:06:44.180> that<00:06:44.810> those<00:06:45.680> kind<00:06:45.920> of<00:06:45.950> things<00:06:46.190> and<00:06:46.430> I

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.670 
it wide that those kind of things and I

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.340 
it wide that those kind of things and I
don't<00:06:47.120> think<00:06:47.300> they<00:06:47.450> were<00:06:47.510> great<00:06:48.080> or

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
don't think they were great or

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.510 
don't think they were great or
outstanding<00:06:50.050> but<00:06:51.050> they<00:06:51.230> they<00:06:51.440> they<00:06:51.950> you<00:06:52.400> know

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
outstanding but they they they you know

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.550 
outstanding but they they they you know
they<00:06:52.760> played<00:06:53.090> their<00:06:53.360> game<00:06:53.630> and<00:06:54.170> we<00:06:54.290> played

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
they played their game and we played

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.710 
they played their game and we played
right<00:06:54.770> into<00:06:54.830> it<00:06:55.250> in<00:06:55.700> areas<00:06:56.270> that's<00:06:56.450> for<00:06:56.600> sure

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 
right into it in areas that's for sure

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.630 
right into it in areas that's for sure
there's<00:06:57.530> a<00:06:57.590> big<00:06:57.710> moment<00:06:58.040> that<00:06:58.220> key<00:06:58.460> moment

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640 
there's a big moment that key moment

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.190 
there's a big moment that key moment
just<00:06:58.940> before<00:06:59.060> the<00:06:59.330> second<00:06:59.660> goal<00:06:59.810> where<00:07:00.020> we

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.200 
just before the second goal where we

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.480 
just before the second goal where we
thought<00:07:00.380> we'd<00:07:00.560> got<00:07:00.710> a<00:07:00.740> power<00:07:00.980> play<00:07:01.190> we<00:07:01.310> ended

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
thought we'd got a power play we ended

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.430 
thought we'd got a power play we ended
up<00:07:01.550> sitting<00:07:01.730> in<00:07:01.970> the<00:07:02.300> in<00:07:02.660> the<00:07:02.750> penalty<00:07:02.990> box<00:07:03.230> at

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 
up sitting in the in the penalty box at

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.660 
up sitting in the in the penalty box at
the<00:07:03.500> for<00:07:03.680> any<00:07:03.800> penalty<00:07:04.190> and<00:07:04.340> then<00:07:04.430> they<00:07:04.520> went

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.670 
the for any penalty and then they went

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.150 
the for any penalty and then they went
and<00:07:04.850> scored<00:07:05.090> on<00:07:05.360> the<00:07:05.480> on<00:07:06.020> the<00:07:06.290> delay<00:07:06.590> well<00:07:06.980> my

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 
and scored on the on the delay well my

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.940 
and scored on the on the delay well my
initial<00:07:07.460> reaction<00:07:08.180> to<00:07:08.210> that<00:07:08.450> is<00:07:08.510> I<00:07:08.990> thought<00:07:09.800> we

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:09.950 
initial reaction to that is I thought we

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.830 
initial reaction to that is I thought we
were<00:07:10.040> gonna<00:07:10.190> get<00:07:10.370> a<00:07:10.430> penalty<00:07:10.850> shot<00:07:11.120> or<00:07:11.390> power

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
were gonna get a penalty shot or power

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.440 
were gonna get a penalty shot or power
play<00:07:12.140> and<00:07:12.350> we<00:07:13.220> ended<00:07:13.430> up<00:07:13.610> going<00:07:13.880> down<00:07:14.030> with<00:07:14.420> a

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:14.450 
play and we ended up going down with a

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.360 
play and we ended up going down with a
puck<00:07:14.720> in<00:07:14.870> the<00:07:14.960> back<00:07:15.110> of<00:07:15.290> our<00:07:15.380> net<00:07:15.590> and<00:07:15.800> then

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.370 
puck in the back of our net and then

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.010 
puck in the back of our net and then
another<00:07:16.610> two<00:07:16.910> minutes<00:07:17.180> to<00:07:17.300> kill<00:07:17.510> on<00:07:17.810> the

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
another two minutes to kill on the

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.040 
another two minutes to kill on the
penalty<00:07:18.290> kill<00:07:18.620> so<00:07:18.950> big<00:07:19.400> things<00:07:19.670> like<00:07:19.850> that<00:07:20.090> can

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.050 
penalty kill so big things like that can

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.220 
penalty kill so big things like that can
can<00:07:21.380> turn<00:07:21.620> a<00:07:21.650> hockey<00:07:21.920> game
