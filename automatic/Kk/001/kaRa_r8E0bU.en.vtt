00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.540
 installation of oil caps 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:13.759
 here are the guides 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.830
 here's a tank cap I purposely broke 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.830
 to show that he's put on 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:26.900
 directing like this and the Turks 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:31.199
 this should not happen here 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.890
 1 new cap here by my hand 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:41.180
 we can put the guides on the bottom now 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.180
 all this will happen in the head 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:51.890
 very uncomfortable deep deep landing 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.890
 guides almost nothing is visible 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.030
 take the valve 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.750
 oil does not need a valve 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:16.460
 insert the valve guide and 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:26.100
 special plastic guide 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.649
 which is necessary in order to 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.829
 do not damage cap 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:37.100
 we put it on the valve all she holds 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:42.240
 valve valve costs operative not necessary 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.549
 take the cap must lubricate 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.009
 butter him 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.939
 brush should be such that not 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.939
 leaves warsu 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:02:05.549
 well oiled by hand dressing 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:08.269
 its on the valve take a guide with 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.819
 by which we will make the cap 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:17.420
 for each cap and to the point 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:21.329
 its directing even under the condition that 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.400
 one and the same head caps can 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.819
 vary by manufacturer and outdoor 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.760
 boarding diameter can be different 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.209
 so that this 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:39.019
 that all was ok need to 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:39.019
 the cap sat tightly fitting 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.830
 Here we set the guide 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:04.580
 hammer can be determined by the sound 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:14.570
 when the cap forces our landing 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:19.280
 here you see the place there because 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:24.230
 what to see there and make sure that he 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:28.010
 sat on the place is not possible 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.769
 take a caliper i know on which 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:37.519
 the height you have at least should sit 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:40.820
 cap on the guide as we look 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:44.360
 that's 16 millimeters from 16 millimeters this 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:47.290
 his landing all he sits still can 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.410
 make sure to take a knitting needle 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.530
 such a strontium and check that is 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:59.269
 the gap between the cap guide then 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:02.120
 eat in your hands it will look like this 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:05.630
 let's say he is sitting and spoke but 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:12.519
 we feel that there is no gap 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:12.519
 there is absolutely nowhere to put him from there is not a bird 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.650
 tweezers remove plastic 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:35.550
 all and now we look now I took out 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:39.990
 the valve but it does not need to sit down here 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.890
 Now here shine shoot here very 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.610
 neatly above 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:48.990
 to and panda camp to be seen 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:52.290
 landings here he is gone here is a cap sitting 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:59.060
 tight nowhere he is not going anywhere 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:59.060
 not when so here
