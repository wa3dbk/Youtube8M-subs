00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:10.220
 I'm the andrÃ© males and today 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:15.580
 we have ten random curiosities 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.580
 about the avengers 2 the era of the tron 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:37.239
 Avengers 2 had an initial budget 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.559
 of US $ 250 million to the state 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.739
 in its history 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:46.360
 I set it on jb you called me 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.269
 the second official trailer of the movie 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.730
 revealed a minimal change but very 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.620
 important in captain america costume 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.790
 the symbol of the avengers on your shoulder 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.620
 left 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:02.199
 the champimÃ³vel to put a business like 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.390
 another is almost three meters high 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.390
 james spader had to use 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.009
 almost two meters tall like these 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.930
 this was done so that the actors who 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.729
 made scenes with him had a point of 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.800
 reference of one of the eyes of another 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.619
 really would be elizabeth johnson 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.910
 said that it was difficult since spader 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.670
 that is really interpreting or 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.530
 character and so instinctively she 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.720
 I would look at him instead of looking 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.970
 the balls that represents the eyes to 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.490
 great fun for everyone whenever 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:38.020
 happened to be yelling at elizabeth 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:40.820
 look at his balls strange lisi 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.760
 man of iron and dorr will have a great 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.960
 fight in the movie but I can not tell the 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.490
 reason not to give because it was clear 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.090
 there are also rumors of a possible 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.160
 romance between Hulk and Black Widow and 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.930
 which natasha romanoff to be the only 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.930
 capable of containing the wrath of the hulk 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.640
 talking on the hulk he had the mustache well 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.590
 coming in your wardrobe knit pants 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.110
 he will no longer be seen in the situation 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.940
 embarrassing to be in the middle of 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.340
 torn clothes when it turns into 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.010
 hulk because the pants made of 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.580
 high-tech microfiber stretching 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.580
 with him 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.010
 an interesting change was also made 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.930
 made in captain america's shield 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.090
 he now has the ability to return 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.920
 to be called similar to the costumes of the 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.900
 iron man instead of the two handles 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.180
 back the shield now has an element 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.430
 the captain's canopy 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.560
 only in his armor huck buster was 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.600
 developed by tony stark bruce banner 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.150
 after having studied the physical actions 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.860
 huck their strength levels they had 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.810
 the goal of finding a way to 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.209
 contain it and minimize damage 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.269
 by their fury hits a satellite 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.160
 is always surrounding b then tony stark 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.360
 may always have armor to 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.410
 stop the hulk 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.410
 at least theoretically 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.310
 how scarlett johansson was pregnant 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.500
 during filming 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.940
 his scenes had to be advanced 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.730
 so that the belly of the actress does not 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.270
 compromise the character's costume 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.610
 will pick up and to help hide the 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.290
 scarlett johansson's pregnancy is three 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.269
 stunts were hired 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.239
 this caused much confusion among 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.300
 other actors since according to them all 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.310
 the stuntmen and they looked a lot like johansson 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.590
 30 even said that he had a subject with 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:56.350
 a stunt man only noticed later that it was not 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.350
 called joan looked to be champion 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.250
 the palermo we arrived at the end of another 10 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.319
