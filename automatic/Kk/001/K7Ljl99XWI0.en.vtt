came out in 2009 then progress in the
2010<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.219> might<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.640> wrong<00:00:41.760> about<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.210> go

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
2010 I might be wrong about that you go

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.369 
2010 I might be wrong about that you go
ahead<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.450> correct<00:00:42.629> I'm<00:00:42.870> pretty<00:00:43.110> sure<00:00:43.200> that's

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
ahead and correct I'm pretty sure that's

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.680 
ahead and correct I'm pretty sure that's
correct<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:44.399> during<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.030> game's<00:00:45.239> prime<00:00:45.510> we

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
correct but during this game's prime we

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.000 
correct but during this game's prime we
actually<00:00:45.960> play<00:00:46.350> game<00:00:46.559> battles<00:00:46.800> we<00:00:46.890> play

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
actually play game battles we play

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.650 
actually play game battles we play
competitively<00:00:47.460> things<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.510> is

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
competitively things like that this is

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.540 
competitively things like that this is
my<00:00:48.780> gun<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> choice<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.680> m16<00:00:50.129> with<00:00:50.160> holographic

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
sight you know for really big maps like

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.959 
sight you know for really big maps like
derail<00:00:52.920> wasteland<00:00:53.399> things<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
derail wasteland things like that and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.060 
derail wasteland things like that and
then<00:00:54.090> any<00:00:54.750> sort<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.260> closer<00:00:55.500> range<00:00:55.800> style

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
then any sort of a closer range style

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.290 
then any sort of a closer range style
combat<00:00:56.430> map<00:00:56.579> I'd<00:00:56.730> use<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.030> thing<00:00:57.180> this

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
combat map I'd use this thing this

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.340 
combat map I'd use this thing this
thing's<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.600> submachine<00:00:58.079> gun<00:00:58.199> in

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
thing's like a submachine gun in

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.020 
thing's like a submachine gun in
essaouira<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:58.980> thing's<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.190> powerhouse

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
essaouira but this thing's a powerhouse

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
essaouira but this thing's a powerhouse
I<00:01:00.510> guess<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.260> kind<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.500> goes<00:01:01.620> without<00:01:01.710> saying<00:01:02.070> is

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
I guess I kind of goes without saying is

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.529 
I guess I kind of goes without saying is

three<00:01:16.799> nukes<00:01:17.310> were<00:01:17.460> hard<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.820> get<00:01:18.000> remember<00:01:18.360> he

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
three nukes were hard to get remember he

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.359 
three nukes were hard to get remember he
was<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.780> damn<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.259> damn<00:01:19.409> nuke<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.920> keep<00:01:20.250> in

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
was like I damn that damn nuke I keep in

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.179 
was like I damn that damn nuke I keep in
so<00:01:20.549> close<00:01:20.820> by<00:01:21.030> keeping<00:01:21.299> shut<00:01:21.509> down<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
so close by keeping shut down that the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.740 
so close by keeping shut down that the
point<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> nuke<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> fact<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.479> you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
point of the nuke is the fact that you

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.120 
point of the nuke is the fact that you
know<00:01:24.840> you're<00:01:25.170> killstreaks<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> nuke

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
because of how the game was set up and

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.280 
because of how the game was set up and
just<00:03:09.310> how<00:03:09.460> perfect<00:03:10.090> everything<00:03:10.540> was<00:03:10.870> they

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
just how perfect everything was they

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.390 
just how perfect everything was they
brought<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.650> they<00:03:11.800> implement<00:03:12.130> this<00:03:12.220> whole

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
brought that they implement this whole

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.460 
brought that they implement this whole
