00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.190
 hello and welcome to this video tutorial client is on point at first 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.159
 place we will load the bill that you have available on our website 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:19.899
 and that will help us to attend this tutorial we have created a light 

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:24.239
 rent we are going to apply a soy effect on their antennas and we will make these 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:25.939
 be flexible 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.300
 the character has an effect applied if you have to go for the flicker effect and 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.500
 we also have two groups of vertices with the appropriate prisoners to be 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.670
 manipulated by a small skeleton 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.719
 that only has bones 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.180
 one for the neck and one for the head 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.770
 it is important to always bear in mind that the head bone also controls 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.770
 the movement of the antennas 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.380
 we have not prepared an animation that will allow us to appreciate the effect of 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.040
 flexibility of the antennas 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:09.720
 once we've already applied in the tracks lewis run 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.490
 borja after this institution let's give some life these antennas 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.490
 first of all we put ourselves in the center court 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.170
 The next thing we have to do is create a group of vertices to indicate 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.280
 to sell that part of the bug is flexible 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.610
 we create a group by pressing the plus sign 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.610
 and this group we are going to call flex efe 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.610
 we enter the vision mode 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.670
 we select all the vertices 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.979
 and we put higüey to one and press the hasan button 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.630
 lender will interpret as flexible the parts of the meshes painted in 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.549
 color blue 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.589
 and as rigid those parts that are in color 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.409
 before we start painting we should make sure to have selected in the 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.110
 box pour groups 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.570
 the group of flex efe 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.899
 if we look at the video we see that at the moment to sell all the mesh is 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.410
 rigid 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.690
 so we'll explain the antennas gradually 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.760
 to give them flexibility to the antennas because to paint in blue we will put the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.620
 value return steel and the premiere to one and we will begin to paint 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.960
 to create the gradual effect we increase the value of weil 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.550
 as we descend the antennas and approach to the head 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:38.559
 We are careful not to paint another color on the head so as not to add 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.559

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.749

 here we already have the antennas painted pib lender interprets this ramp 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:52.569

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.729
 bourgi let's be that everything is correct 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.500
 we are in another gesture

 iñaki in camera view 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:06.730
 we go to the panel of dynamics and click on cloud fabrics 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.859
 in the three sets we select 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.699
 we activate fini 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.009
 and from the vertex groups we choose flex efe 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.360
 we lower the mass of the material to a small value like for example to zero comma 0 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.039
 20 before seeing our affection we go to the modifiers panel 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.919
 here we see that they are on motorcycles modifiers instinct sub 17 sub 6

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:38.210
 for the effect to work we must climb clouds to the first place of the cpi 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.629
 clicking on the up arrow 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:42.720
 we clicked read on the pta and the inc 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.720
 we want the sector already worked 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.580
 to adjust the antenna movement of our preferences 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.639
 we just have to play with the values ​​of the previous 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.849
 the possibilities are endless and the result 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.849
 it's quite effective
