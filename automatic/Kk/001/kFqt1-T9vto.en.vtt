00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
playing it very often at all if the ball

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.359 
playing it very often at all if the ball
is<00:00:17.340> up<00:00:17.730> high<00:00:18.090> enough<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.990> smash<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:20.010> means

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
is up high enough to smash that means

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.700 
is up high enough to smash that means
you've<00:00:20.580> also<00:00:20.789> got<00:00:21.210> enough<00:00:21.510> time<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.470> turn

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
you've also got enough time to turn

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.660 
you've also got enough time to turn
around<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.430> play<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.300> forehand<00:00:25.140> smash<00:00:25.460> so<00:00:26.460> why

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
around and play a forehand smash so why

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.339 
around and play a forehand smash so why
don't<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:26.939> recommend<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.630> backhand<00:00:28.050> smash

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
don't we recommend the backhand smash

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.189 
don't we recommend the backhand smash
one<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> main<00:00:29.279> reasons<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.939> because<00:00:30.199> on

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
one of the main reasons is because on

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.830 
one of the main reasons is because on
the<00:00:31.500> forehand<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.730> lift<00:00:33.180> your<00:00:33.420> back<00:00:33.540> up

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
the forehand you can lift your back up

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.950 
the forehand you can lift your back up
nice<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.380> high<00:00:34.649> or<00:00:35.219> low<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.820> adjust<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
nice and high or low and adjust to the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.709 
nice and high or low and adjust to the
height<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.980> ball<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:39.059> backhand<00:00:39.480> if

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
height of the ball on the backhand if

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.790 
height of the ball on the backhand if
you're<00:00:39.840> doing<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.230> you're<00:00:40.469> going<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.680> be

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
you're doing that you're going to be

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.520 
you're doing that you're going to be
coming<00:00:41.280> across<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:42.329> face<00:00:42.629> with<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.200> with

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
coming across your face with you with

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.470 
coming across your face with you with
your<00:00:43.710> arm<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.250> makes<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.180> little<00:00:45.329> bit

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
your arm and makes it a little bit

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.990 
your arm and makes it a little bit
harder<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:45.989> adjust<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> height<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
harder to adjust the height for the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.400 
harder to adjust the height for the
smash<00:00:48.800> you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:49.950> also<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.300> bigger<00:00:51.719> swing

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
smash you can also get a bigger swing

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.740 
smash you can also get a bigger swing
through<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.399> your<00:00:53.550> forehand<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.539> can

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
through with your forehand so you can

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.279 
through with your forehand so you can
use<00:00:54.989> your<00:00:55.199> rotation<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> body<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.289> your

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
use your rotation of the body and your

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.119 
use your rotation of the body and your
arm<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.710> come<00:00:58.980> through<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.969> bigger<00:01:00.320> arc<00:01:01.320> in

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
arm to come through in a bigger arc in

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.910 
arm to come through in a bigger arc in
circle<00:01:02.640> than<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.470> backhand

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
circle than you can with the backhand

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.880 
circle than you can with the backhand
smash<00:01:05.390> having<00:01:06.390> said<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.830> occasionally<00:01:07.830> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
smash having said that occasionally you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.789 
smash having said that occasionally you
might<00:01:08.220> get<00:01:08.520> caught<00:01:08.820> out<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.320> not<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:10.500> able<00:01:10.619> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
might get caught out and not be able to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.190 
might get caught out and not be able to
get<00:01:10.950> around<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.400> time<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:13.170> that

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
get around in time and so for that

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.609 
get around in time and so for that
purpose<00:01:13.560> we'll<00:01:14.280> show<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.689> technique<00:01:15.990> for

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
purpose we'll show you the technique for

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.490 
purpose we'll show you the technique for
the<00:01:16.710> backhand<00:01:17.189> smash<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.970> back-end<00:01:18.540> smash<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
the backhand smash a back-end smash is a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.800 
the backhand smash a back-end smash is a
shot<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.280> play<00:01:20.520> against<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.330> ball<00:01:21.570> that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
shot that you play against a ball that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.219 
shot that you play against a ball that
comes<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.500> really<00:01:23.490> high<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.600> if<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> balls

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
comes to you really high so if the balls

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.370 
comes to you really high so if the balls
up<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.920> high<00:01:26.130> then<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.900> play<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
up that high then you can play a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.569 
up that high then you can play a
backhand<00:01:28.979> smash<00:01:29.659> if<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.079> ball<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.439> lower<00:01:31.920> then
