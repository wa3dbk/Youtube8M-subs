a<00:00:26.220> couple<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.910> then<00:00:27.150> after<00:00:28.020> that<00:00:28.140> what<00:00:28.440> you

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
a couple and then after that what you

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.029 
a couple and then after that what you
gonna<00:00:28.560> do

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
gonna do

gonna do
I<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.400> didn't<00:00:29.760> want<00:00:29.940> to<00:00:30.060> load<00:00:30.180> up<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> freezer

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
I I didn't want to load up the freezer

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.349 
I I didn't want to load up the freezer
because<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.320> lamb<00:00:31.560> coming<00:00:32.039> so<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.000> decided

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:33.359 
because I have lamb coming so I decided

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.410 
because I have lamb coming so I decided
I<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.020> it'll<00:00:34.320> keep<00:00:34.590> longer<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:36.030> I'll<00:00:36.149> see

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
I can it it'll keep longer and I'll see

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.119 
I can it it'll keep longer and I'll see
it<00:00:36.539> more<00:00:36.719> visibly<00:00:39.350> it'll<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.859> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
it more visibly it'll be in the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.489 
it more visibly it'll be in the
forefront<00:00:41.550> more<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.569> than<00:00:42.839> in<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.109> freezer

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:43.499 
forefront more so than in the freezer

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:45.379 
forefront more so than in the freezer
that<00:00:44.129> gets<00:00:44.339> lost<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.850> freezer<00:00:45.089> I<00:00:45.210> don't

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:45.389 
that gets lost in the freezer I don't

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:50.389 
that gets lost in the freezer I don't
know<00:00:45.479> about<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.289> know<00:00:46.889> I<00:00:49.129> lose<00:00:50.129> things

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
know about you but I know I lose things

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.500 
know about you but I know I lose things
in<00:00:50.699> there<00:00:51.120> somehow<00:00:51.870> someway<00:00:52.710> they<00:00:53.370> end<00:00:54.359> up

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
in there somehow someway they end up

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.199 
in there somehow someway they end up
hiding<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.620> I'm<00:00:55.679> gonna<00:00:55.799> put<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:57.709> fill<00:00:58.709> it<00:00:58.859> to

00:00:59.199 --> 00:00:59.209 
hiding so I'm gonna put that fill it to

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:03.259 
hiding so I'm gonna put that fill it to
right<00:01:00.209> to<00:01:00.389> the<00:01:00.510> bottom<00:01:00.749> rim<00:01:01.679> here<00:01:02.579> let's<00:01:03.119> make

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
right to the bottom rim here let's make

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.000 
right to the bottom rim here let's make
sure<00:01:03.479> you<00:01:03.629> didn't<00:01:03.839> see<00:01:03.959> them<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.769> see

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
sure you didn't see them can you see

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.969 
sure you didn't see them can you see
that<00:01:05.450> right<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.780> bottom<00:01:07.170> line<00:01:07.440> so<00:01:07.710> one

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that right to that bottom line so one

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:18.440 
that right to that bottom line so one
inch<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.400> head<00:01:08.610> space<00:01:10.430> and<00:01:14.600> no<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:15.810> here

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.960 

because<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.710> me<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:22.939> can<00:01:23.939> it

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
because this is me so you have to can it

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.480 
because this is me so you have to can it
at<00:01:24.299> my<00:01:24.630> altitude<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.560> 15<00:01:26.040> pounds<00:01:26.460> of

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
at my altitude it's 15 pounds of

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.090 
at my altitude it's 15 pounds of
pressure<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.180> these<00:01:27.750> are<00:01:27.960> pints<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.649> it'll<00:01:28.979> be

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
pressure and these are pints so it'll be

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.990 
pressure and these are pints so it'll be
for<00:01:29.520> 75<00:01:30.390> minutes<00:01:31.340> I've<00:01:32.340> got<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.610> make<00:01:32.700> sure<00:01:32.759> you

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
for 75 minutes I've got to make sure you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.660 
for 75 minutes I've got to make sure you
get<00:01:33.119> all<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.540> air<00:01:33.689> bubbles<00:01:33.720> out<00:01:34.200> air<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.369> not<00:01:35.640> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
get all the air bubbles out air is not a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.120 
get all the air bubbles out air is not a
good<00:01:36.119> thing

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
good thing

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.760 
good thing
you<00:01:38.130> know<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.430> what<00:01:38.729> starts<00:01:39.149> breaking

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
you know it's what starts breaking

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.820 
you know it's what starts breaking
products<00:01:40.770> down<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.220> air<00:01:41.580> so<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:43.229> air<00:01:43.409> that's

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
products down is air so the air that's

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.130 
products down is air so the air that's
it<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.820> know<00:01:44.939> it's<00:01:45.090> sucked<00:01:45.479> out<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.840> there

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
it you know it's sucked out of there

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.499 
it you know it's sucked out of there
pressure<00:01:46.770> builds<00:01:47.220> up<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.549> pushes<00:01:48.030> all<00:01:48.330> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
pressure builds up and pushes all the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.139 
pressure builds up and pushes all the
air<00:01:48.689> out<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.049> there<00:01:49.320> that's<00:01:50.159> kind<00:01:50.429> of<00:01:50.550> a<00:01:50.610> cool

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
air out of there that's kind of a cool

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.399 
air out of there that's kind of a cool
thing<00:01:51.479> as<00:01:51.869> far<00:01:52.080> as<00:01:52.229> pressure<00:01:52.500> canning<00:01:52.979> goes<00:01:54.409> so

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
thing as far as pressure canning goes so

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.109 
thing as far as pressure canning goes so
I'm<00:01:55.470> gonna<00:01:55.560> finish<00:01:55.830> getting<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.340> water<00:01:56.819> in

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
I'm gonna finish getting the water in

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.139 
I'm gonna finish getting the water in
here<00:01:57.600> some<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.140> these<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.520> cut<00:01:59.520> off<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.640> ends

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
here some of these I cut off the ends

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.539 
here some of these I cut off the ends
and<00:02:00.240> put<00:02:00.479> them<00:02:00.569> in<00:02:00.659> there<00:02:00.899> like<00:02:01.429> so<00:02:02.429> we<00:02:02.520> can

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
and put them in there like so we can

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.969 
and put them in there like so we can
grill<00:02:02.909> them<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.509> some<00:02:04.080> of<00:02:04.200> them<00:02:04.350> I've<00:02:04.619> got
