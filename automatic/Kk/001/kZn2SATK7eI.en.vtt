00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.440
 hello here is christian me again 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.160
 I want you today a train company 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.840
 imagine 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.840
 I played it only once before 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.730
 I have chords just now 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.920
 chosen everyone knows g major 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.940
 e minor 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.420
 A minor 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.660
 and d major 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.190
 But it is also about the right hand and 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.789
 this scheme leaves the right hand 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.179
 to apply myself on every chord so me 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:54.190
 explain narrow rainer thumbs and 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.350
 ring fingers start together 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.340
 they hit the outer two sides 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.500
 on 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.260
 then you need 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.850
 we show movies on the third page 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.860
 and the middle finger on the second 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:12.310
 page 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.310
 that was the first half again 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.940
 now comes the thumb again 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.180
 this time individually ring finger 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.680
 and at the conclusion again the 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.870
 index finger on the third page 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.870
 that was already on game again says 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.280
 I noticed the first stop 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.280
 always takes longer than the rest of me 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.030
 So count that always 1 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.670
 2 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.190
 3 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.670
 me 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.670
 on 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.000
 23 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.030
 here 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.400
 that's actually how it is 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.750
 I played this now 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.820
 can you already for e minor 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:13.060
 use as usual 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.560
 gripped tones on the fifth and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.140
 fourth page we put here even 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.400
 I must not use that also did 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.180
 not necessarily i could grab those 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.920
 also leave out 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.920
 it was already complete 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.920
 now i just have to watch it when i get it 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.930
 transferred to other akw if the 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.530
 fundamental tone of the accord on another 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.930
 side is for example a minor den 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.720
 Ground tone on the fifth page on the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.760
 a-side then you have my thumb the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.190
 change sides then the thumb jumps 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.040
 from the sixth page to the fifth page 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.390
 the other fingers stay close to hers 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.390
 that will not change anymore 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.740
 So it would be for a minor or cd 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.740
 works the same way 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.410
 third variant we need is for 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.790
 the chords with four pages where the 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.240
 also on the fourth page 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.720
 lies that is eg the D major strikes the 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.920
 thumb 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.920
 the fourth side by 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.219
 the other fingers do it all the time 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.219
 the same thing with every chord 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.209
 so again related 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.490
 have fun experimenting with it
