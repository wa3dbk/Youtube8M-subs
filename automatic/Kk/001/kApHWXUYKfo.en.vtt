00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.549
 Welcome, everyone, welcome beauty games. 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.570
 I talk to you and hanoff the staff 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.369
 I'll show you, talk a little 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.500
 more about updating the map of 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.330
 bfi movies is that the night games posted a 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.220
 official video about the changes 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.750
 I found it very cool'll show here 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.460
 Who has not seen it yet but in case you want 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.769
 see officer he 's down there and then 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.810
 to comment a little bit more about it 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.520
 Ok, I'll leave it to you now. 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.520
 in a little while I'll be right back 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.149
 Good folks, you just saw me there. 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.800
 so I had seen it there too 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.019
 I think you all agree with me. 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.049
 that I offer you a map of the Serbs 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.150
 which had a sensational change the map 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.819
 It was very beautiful, it was too late. 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.319
 everything is very well worked and what? 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.090
 answer and make some comparatives 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.980
 for you are having some doubts 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.780
 who still has doubts about this 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.250
 change as they themselves spoke to 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.530
 people are going to be in a few months 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.840
 still they are not with a project 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.730
 You 're ready to work on it. 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.799
 so hopefully it will be too late 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.660
 some time when available on bbb 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.530
 I'll show you a job in there. 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.720
 the map 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.700
 But let's start by talking about the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.950
 comparative soon condotta that I think 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.590
 that many people must have imagined 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.180
 europe counting total but now I go with 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.190
 faith that comparative to you who do 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.660
 right side, it is clear that the 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.970
 games and they will have a certain 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.940
 similarity in the quality of the 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.160
 map and such but it actually turns on the flash 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.690
 It has nothing to do with dota, thank you. 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.190
 I also had this impression it was expensive 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.190
 crazy pretty like dota 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.810
 then the training dota film the map draw 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.940
 the chips for you and I just 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.220
 realizing that has not much to see what 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.410
 they have the same quality direction 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.090
 visual quality graphics but they have 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.250
 ideas completely different from then 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.530
 I think they look alike in that term 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.819
 quality but the structuring of the map 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.010
 and presentation of it is totally 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.599
 different now I'll talk to you 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.190
 a little bit to do the comparatives of 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.639
 some things that I found relevant 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.530
 speak 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.269
 beginning with the map the law that had the 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.099
 nets that has already changed is also 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.889
 now a crystal even wanted a source 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.690
 secret underground with great 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.579
 Towers have also been changed now 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.220
 are more of the visual aspect of a 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.959
 tower even you can see in movies 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.310
 inserts cnc and such 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.780
 the training also had changes in the 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.030
 stones in the grass what is so cool 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.980
 was very well compensated with much 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.200
 well textured because in the 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.329
 development process then it may still be 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.130
 get better that there is already another great 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.780
 change that you saw that what I 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.359
 I think it's worth talking about is the 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.310
 appearance Jungle jango monsters 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.859
 when you approach the in the field of 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.930
 jungle the monster has an animation and leave 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.340
 somewhere arises somewhere is very 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.790
 inclusive time 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.940
 the dragon's change was that he found more 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.100
 sensational 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.199
 although it has had a certain delay to 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.110
 You reach out and start hitting the dragon. 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:25.030
 maybe they can come out as a type 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.979
 of mechanism is but finally this 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.260
 very cool animation very show 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.330
 quite liked're taking advantage of that is 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.130
 also speaking the pit the area where the 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.169
 monsters are located in hangu city 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.090
 for example the dragon has a dungeon 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.010
 zine standard deviation also has a local 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.900
 in which he is in there was restricted 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.240
 those places that appear with the same 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.430
 diameter with the same radius or 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.660
 same size a very frequent doubt 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.090
 of people watching a trailer 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.919
 Fucked up and going to change the map 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.360
 mental relief how the flash will work 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.010
 the champion's dinner 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.169
 the champion's leap how are you going to change 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.240
 what will happen now of games posted 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.979
 including a fact of some questions 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.900
 often say that the land is 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.600
 basically the same changes were made 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.970
 implemented in the 1920's only in the 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.650
 visual and not in gameplay or 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.360
 You will continue to skip all the 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.430
 walls that you already jumped you will 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.500
 continue to use flash in places that 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.500
 You already used it will not have any 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.960
 change in the game's gameplay 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.000
 fact league and yes only of its 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.700
 appearance of your look we should here 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.680
 everyone agree that it was the tic 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.720
 Utah was very beautiful the fields of 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.099
 outside the map also has another 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.110
 themed 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.840
 It's more that shrub that was dark 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.090
 it is local as if it were an abyss 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.240
 that here comes terrain growing in the middle 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.639
 from the secret place and seal seeing was very 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.370
 cool to call the arena now that would be 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.260
 the films 20 was very well designed 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.300
 very well crafted times to change 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.039
 in that clip of the girl, I do not know how to 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.410
 it is called that it has now become a manatee 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.950
 blue I do not know why but anyway 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.389
 guys 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.520
 another frequent doubt that people 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.229
 also usually have is that it just goes 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.400
 stay league 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.979
 they also said that they are 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.320
 working hard with mind strongly 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.080
 to be able to leave the Olympian himself 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.000
 aspect that you have today that is you 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.960
 you will not have to do any big on 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.669
 your pc 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.560
 if I realize that you have already 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.280
 free wheel it will keep rolling 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.990
 league 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.729
 even on that new map and salary that 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.370
 is currently pulling more ram 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:23.500
 but that in the future they hope not 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.729
 pulls anything that is basically the 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.710
 same thing then the visual improvement 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:29.240
 sensational and has no plans yet to 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.729
 the new charge subscriptions of raul and 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.229
 apis and 2007 is worth it for now is just the same 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:35.240
 without the same rhythm but we have to 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.830
 hope that much good will come and already 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.990
 There's a lot that we do. 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.999
 champion to stay inside this new 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.469
 thematic of the book in which many champions 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:45.770
 who have to go through a change 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:47.960
 visual remodeling remodeling at last 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.279
 A lot of cool stuff that canceled me. 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.349
 I'm very happy, I'm very happy. 

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:53.120
 I hope you have stayed too long. 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:54.680
 of you asked to bring a video 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.629
 showing and when opinions also 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.879
 so that's what you liked 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:07:01.099
 forget that let me like her favorite 

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:02.960
 comments share this is then 

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:05.029
 you are not yet written that there will 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.710
 stop here thank you very much until 

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:09.159
 close the hug 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.159
 went
