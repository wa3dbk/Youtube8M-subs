00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.760
 some time ago I made a video talking 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.950
 about real-life superheroes 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.520
 but after thinking about it for a 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:24.990
 time I 've realized that this topic 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.480
 gives for a lot more when I did that 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.770
 video I spent my time researching about 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.649
 several of these individuals to choose 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.800
 the six that I put in that count but 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.329
 those notes are intact and I thought 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.110
 terrible after iciar days so 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.110
 let's start all at once 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.960
 already leave or for your translation hare 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.559
 shadow is a hero who started his 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.570
 activities in 2005 which 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.300
 focused mainly on crimes in 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.040
 progress and public events that could 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.180
 become violent in the city of 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.720
 cincinnati obviously this had true 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.850
 risk just for giving you an example once 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.060
 when he intervened in a robbery 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.490
 dislocated the man apparently left 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.860
 his service as a superhero since 2012 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.460
 with the reason of having entered the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.290
 armed but left its mark in 2009 with 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.510
 the following statement 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.390
 If I had to save someone in a 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.720
 alley or if there is someone who needs 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.720
 help 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.720
 I'm going to run and give my life 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.520
 so far I have only shown heroism in 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.970
 these peculiar people but 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.250
 obviously among several of these 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.369
 to show someone that the last one was 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.280
 even if it's a little bad or not good that 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.619
 it was the case of nike they keep a watchman 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.039
 disguised that patrolled the streets of 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:14.140
 salford in england his real name is 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:17.390
 robert redford sit and began his wanderings 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.180
 approximately in 2011 as he 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.640
 I felt sick to see how people 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.950
 I was watching bad things happen and not 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.190
 they did nothing about it but to 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.750
 early 2013 is then removed 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.750
 that three guys beat him 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.629
 there are probably several in the audience 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.379
 they 're laughing and I do not blame them that 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:47.769
 yes here is a point of interest although 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:50.260
 some surprise him he has a partner 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.890
 which even made some patrols with him 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.870
 using the name light maiden and so 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.909
 last they said they were already 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.909
 committed and she pregnant 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.640
 throughout this video and the 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.880
 previous we have seen many men and 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.760
 masked women 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.500
 most of them are deeply rooted 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.810
 to the legal margin true good get ready 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.450
 Well, these last two you'll see 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.770
 then do a pretty act 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.950
 illegally so if the police 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.870
 comes to grab them will put prisoners in 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.340
 righ now 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.830
 will and me and windows and goodman are 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.049
 two citizens who have decided to start 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.500
 a crusade against the terrible ones 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:48.980
 wheel clamps but how do they 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.730
 exactly good the way you are 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.730
 watching at this moment 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.550
 these two watchers do this with the 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.980
 reason to prevent the owners of the 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.190
 vehicles have to pay a fine that 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.940
 in several cases they unfairly consider 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.730
 expensive reason why drivers 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.940
 they have taken affection, although the 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.790
 authorities for obvious reasons the 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:24.660
 they consider a danger to society 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.250
 there is no doubt the world is a very 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.420
 weird and crazy 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:35.550
 Well that's all for this farewell video 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.550
 Have a good week
