00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
so your warriors typically speaking in

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.330 
so your warriors typically speaking in
one<00:01:07.840> turn<00:01:08.110> your<00:01:08.320> warriors<00:01:08.680> can<00:01:08.860> only<00:01:08.980> be<00:01:09.190> used

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
one turn your warriors can only be used

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.150 
one turn your warriors can only be used
once<00:01:09.780> however<00:01:10.780> there<00:01:11.440> is<00:01:11.620> a<00:01:11.650> cheating

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
once however there is a cheating

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.330 
once however there is a cheating
precedes<00:01:12.610> it<00:01:12.700> you<00:01:12.880> can<00:01:13.030> use<00:01:13.210> for<00:01:13.870> instance

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
precedes it you can use for instance

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.940 
precedes it you can use for instance
this<00:01:15.340> red<00:01:15.580> card<00:01:15.880> has<00:01:16.180> a<00:01:16.210> chain<00:01:16.540> with<00:01:16.870> blue<00:01:17.590> and

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
this red card has a chain with blue and

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.250 
this red card has a chain with blue and
yellow<00:01:18.120> and<00:01:19.120> in<00:01:19.300> effect<00:01:19.540> it<00:01:19.870> can<00:01:20.020> be<00:01:20.110> changed

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
yellow and in effect it can be changed

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.219 
yellow and in effect it can be changed
with<00:01:20.620> this<00:01:20.710> yellow<00:01:21.070> card

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
with this yellow card

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.200 
with this yellow card
so<00:01:23.590> obviously<00:01:24.189> as<00:01:24.399> the<00:01:24.549> game<00:01:24.700> is<00:01:24.850> played<00:01:25.060> their

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
so obviously as the game is played their

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.700 
so obviously as the game is played their
strategic<00:01:25.360> advantages<00:01:26.200> to<00:01:26.439> certain

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
strategic advantages to certain

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.800 
strategic advantages to certain
competitions<00:01:27.280> now<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.270> practice<00:01:28.630> of<00:01:28.719> the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
competitions now the practice of the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.200 
competitions now the practice of the
game<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:30.009> really<00:01:30.430> that<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.700> Greek<00:01:30.969> in<00:01:31.119> the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
game is really that the Greek in the

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.870 
game is really that the Greek in the
Norse<00:01:31.390> gods<00:01:31.719> are<00:01:32.079> battling<00:01:32.469> one<00:01:32.590> another<00:01:32.649> so

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
Norse gods are battling one another so

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.470 
Norse gods are battling one another so
Apolo<00:01:34.630> for<00:01:35.049> instance<00:01:35.610> against<00:01:36.610> health

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
Apolo for instance against health

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.890 
Apolo for instance against health
so<00:01:38.990> your<00:01:39.140> two<00:01:39.320> gods<00:01:39.700> can<00:01:40.700> win<00:01:41.480> against<00:01:41.720> one

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
so your two gods can win against one

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.570 
so your two gods can win against one
another<00:01:41.930> in<00:01:42.470> either<00:01:42.800> of<00:01:42.950> two<00:01:43.040> ways

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
another in either of two ways

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.240 
another in either of two ways
the<00:01:44.180> first<00:01:44.390> way<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.930> kill<00:01:45.500> one<00:01:45.710> another<00:01:45.740> and

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
the first way is to kill one another and

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.670 
the first way is to kill one another and
get<00:01:46.460> their<00:01:46.670> point<00:01:46.880> value<00:01:47.240> down<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:48.410> zero

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
get their point value down to zero

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.020 
get their point value down to zero
another<00:01:50.460> way<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:51.000> win<00:01:51.150> is<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.780> make<00:01:53.030> an

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
another way to win is to make an

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.380 
another way to win is to make an
ascension<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.920> rank<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.580> get<00:01:56.760> up<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.970> 25

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
ascension and rank and get up to 25

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.420 
ascension and rank and get up to 25
typically<00:01:58.290> speaking<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.740> start<00:01:59.160> with<00:01:59.340> an

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
typically speaking you start with an

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.640

put<00:02:39.220> it<00:02:39.310> actually<00:02:39.640> on<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.790> top<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.090> your<00:02:40.150> deck

now<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:40.810> might<00:02:40.990> seem<00:02:41.550> intuitive<00:02:42.550> at<00:02:42.850> first

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
now that might seem intuitive at first

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.640 
now that might seem intuitive at first
but<00:02:43.270> really<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:43.660> gives<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.930> quite<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.230> good

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
but really it gives you quite a good

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.149 
but really it gives you quite a good
this<00:02:45.040> game<00:02:45.250> can<00:02:45.459> be<00:02:45.610> played<00:02:45.930> too<00:02:46.930> without<00:02:47.769> up

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
this game can be played too without up

to six people

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.090 
to six people
so<00:02:50.300> sometimes<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.020> gives<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.470> strategic

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
so sometimes that gives a strategic

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.800 
so sometimes that gives a strategic
mantas<00:02:52.580> need<00:02:52.850> that<00:02:53.000> because<00:02:53.180> it's<00:02:53.330> brutal<00:02:53.690> the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
mantas need that because it's brutal the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.760 
mantas need that because it's brutal the
other<00:02:53.960> thing<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.350> really<00:02:54.560> like<00:02:54.740> about

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.020 
if you're playing with two people I mean
it<00:03:00.200> can<00:03:00.410> get<00:03:00.590> really<00:03:01.010> bloody<00:03:01.190> really<00:03:01.580> fast<00:03:01.820> and

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
found like Loki really really tricky it

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.520

actually

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
actually

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.740 
actually
you<00:03:46.800> know<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:46.950> went<00:03:47.850> out<00:03:47.940> playing<00:03:48.210> I<00:03:48.450> guess<00:03:48.600> it

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
you know I went out playing I guess it

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.900 
you know I went out playing I guess it

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
would be hard to understand but low-key

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:47.159 
really long interesting game and which

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.429 
really long interesting game and which
you<00:06:47.310> can<00:06:47.430> develop<00:06:47.789> a<00:06:47.879> lot<00:06:48.120> of<00:06:48.240> strategy<00:06:48.749> so<00:06:49.050> I

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:49.439 
you can develop a lot of strategy so I

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:51.350 
you can develop a lot of strategy so I
like<00:06:49.800> that<00:06:50.009> you<00:06:50.129> can<00:06:50.249> kind<00:06:50.550> of<00:06:50.639> determine<00:06:50.849> what

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
like that you can kind of determine what

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.720 
like that you can kind of determine what
face

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:52.730 
face

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.730 
face
and<00:06:53.180> then<00:06:53.300> of<00:06:53.390> course<00:06:53.420> depending<00:06:53.990> on<00:06:54.140> your<00:06:54.290> I

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
and then of course depending on your I

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.400 
and then of course depending on your I
think<00:06:55.280> the<00:06:55.340> pace<00:06:55.520> also<00:06:55.910> really<00:06:56.350> depends<00:06:57.350> a

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:57.410 
think the pace also really depends a

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.040 
think the pace also really depends a
little<00:06:57.500> bit<00:06:57.650> on<00:06:57.800> what

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.050 
little bit on what

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.070 
little bit on what
you<00:06:59.740> drop<00:06:59.950> when<00:07:00.820> I'm<00:07:00.940> with<00:07:01.090> or<00:07:01.300> hate<00:07:01.750> the<00:07:01.930> game

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
you drop when I'm with or hate the game

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.020 
you drop when I'm with or hate the game
always

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030 
always

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.790 
always
because<00:07:03.630> he's<00:07:03.780> really<00:07:04.020> aggressive<00:07:04.200> and<00:07:04.590> so<00:07:04.770> I

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
because he's really aggressive and so I

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.510 
because he's really aggressive and so I
can<00:07:05.100> knock<00:07:05.310> somebody<00:07:05.670> out

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
can knock somebody out

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.650 
can knock somebody out
but<00:07:07.699> with<00:07:07.880> a<00:07:08.060> different<00:07:08.389> card<00:07:08.630> like<00:07:08.900> Loki

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660 
but with a different card like Loki

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.330 
but with a different card like Loki
it<00:07:10.810> is<00:07:10.990> different<00:07:11.200> kind<00:07:11.500> of<00:07:11.590> case<00:07:11.740> you<00:07:12.190> know

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
it is different kind of case you know

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.600 
it is different kind of case you know
it's

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
it's

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.189 
it's
