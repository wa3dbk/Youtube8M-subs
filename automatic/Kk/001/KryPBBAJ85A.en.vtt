00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.430 
ended up with having like a minor stroke
and<00:01:30.490> then<00:01:31.060> they<00:01:31.210> realized<00:01:31.690> that<00:01:31.870> that<00:01:32.050> was<00:01:32.290> the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
and then they realized that that was the

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.030 
and then they realized that that was the
cause<00:01:32.620> was<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:34.210> hole<00:01:34.390> in<00:01:34.480> his<00:01:34.630> heart<00:01:34.780> so

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
cause was the the hole in his heart so

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.280 
cause was the the hole in his heart so
they<00:01:36.040> obviously<00:01:36.190> had<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:36.910> perform<00:01:37.870> some

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
they obviously had to perform some

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.670 
they obviously had to perform some
surgery<00:01:38.940> and<00:01:39.940> he's<00:01:40.540> doing<00:01:40.720> well<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:43.030> I<00:01:43.680> don't

money and spend it on developing methods
for<00:02:27.100> earlier<00:02:27.459> detection<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:28.300> mean<00:02:29.489> does<00:02:30.489> it

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
for earlier detection I mean does it

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.759 
for earlier detection I mean does it
have<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.850> take<00:02:31.180> somebody<00:02:31.450> getting<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.440> stroke

to discover that they have a problem

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.600 
to discover that they have a problem
like<00:02:34.420> this<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.930> then<00:02:35.500> performing<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.400> test

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
like this and then performing the test

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.449 
like this and then performing the test
find<00:02:37.209> out<00:02:37.450> what<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.840> real<00:02:37.989> cause<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.620> maybe

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
find out what the real cause is maybe

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.090 
find out what the real cause is maybe
they<00:02:39.640> can<00:02:39.790> put<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.060> money<00:02:40.269> towards<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.980> know

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
they can put that money towards you know

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.280 
they can put that money towards you know
better<00:02:43.030> manage<00:02:43.390> us<00:02:43.540> better<00:02:43.750> methods<00:02:44.200> of

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
better manage us better methods of

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.050 
better manage us better methods of
detection<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.980> know<00:02:45.150> not<00:02:46.150> necessarily

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
detection you know not necessarily

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.670 
detection you know not necessarily
solving<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.150> problem<00:02:49.600> but<00:02:49.900> detecting<00:02:50.560> it

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
solving the problem but detecting it

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.289 
solving the problem but detecting it
before<00:02:51.070> it<00:02:51.130> becomes<00:02:51.400> huge<00:02:51.790> problem<00:02:52.180> and

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
before it becomes huge problem and

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.660 
before it becomes huge problem and
people<00:02:53.110> end<00:02:53.260> up<00:02:53.320> getting<00:02:53.650> strokes<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.280> really

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
people end up getting strokes and really

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.220 
people end up getting strokes and really
