00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.229
 to be matte 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.310

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.310
 it's all the same in Chinese 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.940
 So the film is not matte, I already see that 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.470
 simple ordinary messengers i plenochka well 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:19.170

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.380
 case 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:37.830

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:44.040

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:58.650
 smart here does not even smell 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:02.730
 but the material is nice to the touch but I kind of 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:07.080
 would order black why is it gray not 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:15.180
 I can understand Well, let's see how 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:19.850

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.850
 very sat 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.550

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:03.500
 is it now possible to raise 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:03.500

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.910
