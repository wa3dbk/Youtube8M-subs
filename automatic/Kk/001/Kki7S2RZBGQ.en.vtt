assembly before you take these off it
might<00:00:25.859> be<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> good<00:00:26.160> idea<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.760> mark<00:00:27.000> where<00:00:27.240> they

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
might be a good idea to mark where they

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.189 
might be a good idea to mark where they
are<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.410> get<00:00:28.500> them<00:00:28.710> lined<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.570> right<00:00:30.570> or

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
are that you get them lined up right or

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.720 
are that you get them lined up right or
how<00:00:31.380> they<00:00:31.590> were<00:00:31.769> before<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.340> took<00:00:32.489> them<00:00:32.640> off

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
how they were before you took them off

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.209 
how they were before you took them off
so<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:33.750> took<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.260> marker<00:00:34.890> made<00:00:35.190> a

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
so I just took a little marker made a

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.690 
so I just took a little marker made a
mark<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.690> master<00:00:36.989> cylinder<00:00:37.250> clamps<00:00:38.250> and
