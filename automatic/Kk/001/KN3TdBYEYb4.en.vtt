to<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.960> bottom<00:02:04.079> because<00:02:04.409> sometimes<00:02:04.890> our<00:02:05.130> hair

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
to the bottom because sometimes our hair

to the bottom because sometimes our hair
tie<00:02:05.549> holders<00:02:05.880> can<00:02:06.149> kind<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.450> crunch<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.960> little

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.960 
tie holders can kind of crunch a little
bit<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.190> leave<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.489> little<00:02:08.729> bit<00:02:08.910> of

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
bit so I like to leave a little bit of

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.940 
bit so I like to leave a little bit of
the<00:02:09.239> ends<00:02:09.599> out
