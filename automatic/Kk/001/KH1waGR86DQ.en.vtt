00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.580
 the kitchen faucet is one of the objects 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.700
 of the house we use the most so many 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.400
 Sometimes you need a mesh 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.110
 In this example the stuck tap and that 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.230
 we have to do here is exchange for a 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:27.960
 new and installing a faucet is 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:33.239
 very simple for this project let's 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:37.890
 need the new faucet kit one 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.500
 the screw ribbon and the pipe wrench 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.250
 The first thing we have to do is close the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.590
 record the water and then open the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.470
 tap to get out all the rest of water 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:58.260
 of the barrel with the help of the faucet 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:01:00.810
 unscrew carefully after the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:09.990
 first round is easier withdrawn 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:12.149
 hands and clean the outlet tube 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.729
 removing any dirt that is left 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.950
 embedded there including the remains of 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.479
 Thread sealing tape that other tap 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.549
 stayed around 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.369
 now that it's all clear it's time to 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.469
 install the new faucet in this case 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.810
 you will need to use the next adapter 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.799
 with kit of the fit everything fits 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.889
 perfectly in the hole in the wall 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:37.020
 put the tape on the veda thread about five 

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:39.289
 turns is enough for a good 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.289
 adhesion 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:59.750
 the finish that comes next to the 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:02:02.020
 kit installed on the wall and with the help of 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.909
 griffin key let's get a grip 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.990
 but be careful not to hurt the 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.990
 heiress's metal 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.480
 now we can open the registry and 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.480
 find out if everything is ok 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.799
 and that's all in order to space and been 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.360
