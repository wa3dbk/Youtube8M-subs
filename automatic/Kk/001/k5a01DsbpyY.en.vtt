 immediately of course we can clapper 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.790

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.710
 necessary building objects 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.960

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:47.009

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.009

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:06.849
 bonfire to go to its menu 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:11.560
 need to hold the letter e also put 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:13.810
 About 60 firewood is enough for 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.519
 to fry meat and not overcook 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.859
 set it up the cabinet is done in order 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.470
 so that the raiders could not build 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:25.299
 nothing but near your house like you 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.280

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.019
 build until i 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.019
 I log in to this closet 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:38.250
 we put firewood metal sulfur into the furnace 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.469
 at the door set code lock as 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.499
 I usually set all the fives and 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:03:03.019
 close the door the way the door is now 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:05.549

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:11.669
 we take up the beater with the right key 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.010
 click on the wall and modernize and 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:16.379

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:23.510

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.639
 Now objects of the house can be dismantled 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.959
 so well, we do beam balcony by the way 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.359
 I recommend to do always 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.780
 and I also recommend going out through 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:41.430
 him as if you go out below you 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:43.439

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.129
 let's look at the physics we 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:50.180
 dismantled one square of the foundation and 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.180
 half the house fell apart 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:08.130
 dress up buy pants shoes 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.290

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:21.950
 naked men with spears did not kill us 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:21.950
