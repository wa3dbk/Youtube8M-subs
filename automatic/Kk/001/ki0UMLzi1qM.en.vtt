00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.650 

and<00:06:31.960> see<00:06:32.320> how<00:06:32.500> easy<00:06:32.860> that<00:06:32.890> is<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:33.520> reason<00:06:34.330> I

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
and see how easy that is the reason I

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.170 
and see how easy that is the reason I
have<00:06:34.840> chosen<00:06:35.230> the<00:06:35.590> angel<00:06:36.040> moths<00:06:36.280> is<00:06:36.730> the<00:06:36.970> ease

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
have chosen the angel moths is the ease

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.380 
have chosen the angel moths is the ease
of<00:06:37.210> side<00:06:37.750> planting<00:06:38.500> and<00:06:39.000> also<00:06:40.000> the<00:06:40.180> water

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
of side planting and also the water

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.720 
of side planting and also the water
holding<00:06:40.960> like<00:06:41.200> this<00:06:41.500> so<00:06:42.190> when<00:06:42.370> this<00:06:42.520> has<00:06:42.700> been

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.730 
holding like this so when this has been

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.700 
holding like this so when this has been
watered<00:06:43.510> it<00:06:43.960> will<00:06:44.170> swell<00:06:44.560> like<00:06:45.220> this<00:06:46.560> and<00:06:47.560> the

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
watered it will swell like this and the

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.460 
watered it will swell like this and the
water<00:06:47.860> they<00:06:48.310> lost<00:06:48.610> holds<00:06:49.510> 20<00:06:49.930> times<00:06:50.200> its

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
water they lost holds 20 times its

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.770 
water they lost holds 20 times its
weight<00:06:50.680> in<00:06:50.740> water<00:06:51.030> so<00:06:52.030> you<00:06:52.090> can<00:06:52.330> see<00:06:52.630> it<00:06:52.750> just

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
weight in water so you can see it just

00:06:52.780 --> 00:07:01.470 
weight in water so you can see it just
acts<00:06:53.230> like<00:06:53.350> a<00:06:53.500> big<00:06:53.770> sponge<00:07:00.090> now<00:07:01.090> I'm<00:07:01.180> going<00:07:01.390> to

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
easy it is to hang it up on the hook

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:31.270 
easy it is to hang it up on the hook
with<00:07:07.030> a<00:07:07.090> rigid<00:07:07.510> change

don't worry if there's a little bit of

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.590 
don't worry if there's a little bit of
potting<00:07:36.740> mix<00:07:36.980> showing<00:07:37.430> here<00:07:37.730> because<00:07:38.330> it<00:07:38.450> will

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:38.600 
potting mix showing here because it will

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.379 
potting mix showing here because it will
swell<00:07:38.930> more<00:07:39.260> heat<00:07:39.740> and<00:07:39.980> just<00:07:40.460> close<00:07:40.790> all<00:07:41.180> those

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:41.389 
swell more heat and just close all those

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:44.260 
swell more heat and just close all those
little<00:07:41.600> gets<00:07:41.960> them
