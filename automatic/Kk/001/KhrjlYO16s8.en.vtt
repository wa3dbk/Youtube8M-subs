00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
well there's a company of ASA striving

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.860 
well there's a company of ASA striving
to<00:01:31.979> make<00:01:32.130> more<00:01:32.430> natural<00:01:32.910> product<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.570> we've

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
to make more natural product and we've

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.249 
to make more natural product and we've
got<00:01:34.080> it<00:01:34.200> opportunity<00:01:35.780> 96<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.930> let's<00:01:40.140> divide

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
got it opportunity 96 so let's divide

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.140 
got it opportunity 96 so let's divide
that<00:01:40.560> one<00:01:40.979> or<00:01:41.130> two<00:01:41.160> percent<00:01:41.550> that's<00:01:41.790> veil

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that one or two percent that's veil

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.020 
that one or two percent that's veil
unnatural<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.170> called<00:01:43.380> oxidative<00:01:43.979> die<00:01:44.400> but

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
unnatural it's called oxidative die but

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.420 
unnatural it's called oxidative die but
what<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.300> it<00:01:45.450> mean<00:01:45.660> and<00:01:46.080> then<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
what is it mean and then what is it the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:58.540 
what is it mean and then what is it the
oxidative<00:01:47.940> dye<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:49.400> kill<00:01:50.400> yourself

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.160 

we<00:01:59.550> have<00:01:59.700> been<00:01:59.850> making<00:02:00.030> some<00:02:00.210> leaps<00:02:00.990> and

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
we have been making some leaps and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.260 
we have been making some leaps and
bounds<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.619> trend<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.070> make<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.490> color<00:02:02.700> very

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
bounds and trend to make the color very

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.410 
bounds and trend to make the color very
natural<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.899> there's<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.229> couple<00:02:04.530> really<00:02:05.420> bad

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
natural so there's a couple really bad

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.969 
natural so there's a couple really bad
ingredients<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.110> you've<00:02:07.260> no<00:02:07.470> longer<00:02:07.800> had

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
ingredients that you've no longer had

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.720 
ingredients that you've no longer had
which<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.610> pvd's<00:02:09.510> and<00:02:10.100> you<00:02:11.100> know<00:02:11.190> ammonia

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
which is that pvd's and you know ammonia

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.280 
which is that pvd's and you know ammonia
and<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.239> some<00:02:12.510> cases<00:02:12.750> as<00:02:13.140> well<00:02:13.380> as<00:02:13.560> LED<00:02:14.190> and

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
and in some cases as well as LED and

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:38.590 
and in some cases as well as LED and
cool<00:02:16.290> which<00:02:16.769> a<00:02:16.950> lot<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.160> other<00:02:17.610> different

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600

there<00:02:39.600> are<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.989> few<00:02:40.230> other<00:02:40.470> really<00:02:40.799> cool<00:02:40.950> things

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
there are a few other really cool things

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.479 
there are a few other really cool things
about<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:43.290> dyeing<00:02:43.830> process<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.459> I
