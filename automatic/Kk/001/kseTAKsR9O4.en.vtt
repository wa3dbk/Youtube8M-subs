00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.620 
and select this tool make sure this is
converted<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:23.869> path<00:01:24.940> and<00:01:25.940> then<00:01:26.210> I'm<00:01:26.390> going

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
converted to a path and then I'm going

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.710 
converted to a path and then I'm going
to<00:01:26.780> grab<00:01:27.110> these<00:01:27.409> two<00:01:27.770> nodes<00:01:28.240> move<00:01:29.240> them<00:01:29.420> over

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
to grab these two nodes move them over

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.580 
to grab these two nodes move them over
here

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.709
