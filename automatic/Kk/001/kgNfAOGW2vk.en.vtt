00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
piece like this so the tutorial itself

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.290 
piece like this so the tutorial itself
is<00:00:23.070> actually<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.850> be<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.119> two

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.000 
is actually going to have to be in two
parts<00:00:24.510> as<00:00:24.750> well<00:00:24.840> because<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> video<00:00:25.859> was

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
parts as well because the video was

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.800 
parts as well because the video was
gonna<00:00:26.130> be<00:00:26.279> really<00:00:26.490> really<00:00:26.670> long<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.539> thought

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
I would just separate it so in this

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.370 
I would just separate it so in this

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
do that on all four sides and then it

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.780 
do that on all four sides and then it
should<00:03:25.680> turn<00:03:25.860> out<00:03:26.040> looking<00:03:26.370> something<00:03:26.550> like

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
should turn out looking something like

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.530 
should turn out looking something like
this<00:03:28.130> now<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.190> make<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.760> inside<00:03:30.180> section

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
this now to make the inside section

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.940 
this now to make the inside section
we're<00:03:30.900> going<00:03:31.050> to<00:03:31.110> do<00:03:31.230> pretty<00:03:31.470> much<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.770> same

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
we're going to do pretty much the same

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.520 
we're going to do pretty much the same
thing<00:03:32.400> so<00:03:33.150> take<00:03:33.360> your<00:03:33.510> three<00:03:33.750> square<00:03:34.080> pieces

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
thing so take your three square pieces

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.500 
thing so take your three square pieces
and<00:03:34.710> line<00:03:35.070> them<00:03:35.280> up<00:03:35.370> like<00:03:35.430> I've<00:03:35.910> done<00:03:36.090> here<00:03:36.330> and

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
and line them up like I've done here and

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.840 
and line them up like I've done here and
then<00:03:37.230> you're<00:03:37.410> too<00:03:37.590> short<00:03:37.860> rectangular<00:03:38.610> pieces

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
then you're too short rectangular pieces

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.170 
then you're too short rectangular pieces
place<00:03:39.300> those<00:03:39.510> on<00:03:39.690> either<00:03:39.870> side<00:03:40.340> then<00:03:41.340> using<00:03:42.030> a

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
place those on either side then using a

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.880 
place those on either side then using a
blanket<00:03:42.540> stitch<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.080> a<00:03:43.170> white<00:03:43.350> thread<00:03:43.650> I'm

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
blanket stitch and a white thread I'm

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.920 
blanket stitch and a white thread I'm
going<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.280> sew<00:03:44.490> along<00:03:44.640> all<00:03:44.970> these<00:03:45.240> four<00:03:45.540> edges

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
going to sew along all these four edges

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.860 
going to sew along all these four edges
to<00:03:46.590> make<00:03:46.800> just<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.430> little<00:03:47.730> box<00:03:48.090> shape<00:03:48.390> like<00:03:48.690> we

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
to make just a little box shape like we

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.500 
to make just a little box shape like we
did<00:03:49.020> earlier<00:03:49.380> here<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.640> what<00:03:50.970> that<00:03:51.000> looks<00:03:51.420> like

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
did earlier here is what that looks like

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.720 
did earlier here is what that looks like
and<00:03:51.870> now<00:03:52.380> just<00:03:52.680> like<00:03:52.830> before<00:03:53.040> I'm<00:03:53.460> going<00:03:53.490> to

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
and now just like before I'm going to

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.400 
and now just like before I'm going to
use<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:54.000> blanket<00:03:54.360> stitch<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.840> sew<00:03:55.080> up<00:03:55.200> all

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
use the blanket stitch to sew up all

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.710 
use the blanket stitch to sew up all
four<00:03:55.740> of<00:03:55.770> these<00:03:56.010> edges<00:03:56.520> but<00:03:57.180> obvious<00:03:57.540> of

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
four of these edges but obvious of

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.990 
four of these edges but obvious of
course<00:03:58.230> we<00:03:58.440> only<00:03:58.620> need<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:58.980> sell<00:03:59.220> up<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.430> this

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
course we only need to sell up to this

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.670 
course we only need to sell up to this
section<00:04:00.300> here<00:04:00.690> because<00:04:01.020> these<00:04:01.170> bits<00:04:01.470> are

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
section here because these bits are

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.100 
section here because these bits are
going<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.040> be<00:04:02.160> like<00:04:02.340> little<00:04:02.640> flaps<00:04:03.000> here<00:04:03.960> is

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
going to be like little flaps here is

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.990 
going to be like little flaps here is
what<00:04:04.350> this<00:04:04.530> part<00:04:04.860> looks<00:04:05.040> like<00:04:05.250> once<00:04:05.550> it's<00:04:05.790> done

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
what this part looks like once it's done

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.240 
what this part looks like once it's done
and<00:04:06.270> just<00:04:07.140> really<00:04:07.500> quickly<00:04:07.740> is<00:04:07.920> something

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
and just really quickly is something

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.710 
and just really quickly is something
that<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.490> need<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:08.760> remember<00:04:09.000> is<00:04:09.330> that<00:04:09.360> this

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
that you need to remember is that this

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.780 
that you need to remember is that this
part<00:04:10.140> on<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.590> inside<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.160> going<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.430> be<00:04:11.610> what's

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
part on the inside is going to be what's

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.030 
part on the inside is going to be what's
on<00:04:11.970> show<00:04:12.210> so<00:04:12.960> you<00:04:13.020> need<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.380> make<00:04:13.500> sure<00:04:13.560> you<00:04:13.830> cut

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
on show so you need to make sure you cut

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.470 
on show so you need to make sure you cut
off<00:04:14.220> all<00:04:14.430> your<00:04:14.460> loose<00:04:14.790> threads<00:04:15.120> on<00:04:15.300> the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
off all your loose threads on the

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.420 
off all your loose threads on the
outside<00:04:15.960> so<00:04:16.230> that<00:04:16.410> way<00:04:16.530> it's<00:04:16.799> actually<00:04:17.280> going

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
outside so that way it's actually going

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.729 
outside so that way it's actually going
to<00:04:17.520> be<00:04:17.700> on<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.630> inside<00:04:18.900> if<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:19.530> makes<00:04:19.710> sense

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
to be on the inside if that makes sense

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.220 
to be on the inside if that makes sense
okay<00:04:20.730> so<00:04:20.790> now<00:04:21.180> we<00:04:21.239> have<00:04:21.510> these<00:04:21.690> two<00:04:21.989> pieces

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
okay so now we have these two pieces

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.290 
okay so now we have these two pieces
that<00:04:22.650> look<00:04:22.800> kind<00:04:23.010> of<00:04:23.130> similar<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.910> what<00:04:24.150> I'm

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
that look kind of similar and what I'm

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.700 
that look kind of similar and what I'm
going<00:04:24.510> to<00:04:24.600> do<00:04:24.720> is<00:04:24.930> I'm<00:04:25.050> going<00:04:25.230> to<00:04:25.290> put<00:04:25.530> some

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
going to do is I'm going to put some

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.300 
going to do is I'm going to put some
stuff<00:04:25.950> in

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
stuff in

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.060 
stuff in
side<00:04:26.490> here<00:04:26.760> just<00:04:26.970> like<00:04:27.840> that<00:04:28.260> and<00:04:28.650> now<00:04:28.980> I'm

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
side here just like that and now I'm

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.890 
side here just like that and now I'm
going<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.310> put<00:04:29.550> this<00:04:29.669> little<00:04:29.910> piece<00:04:30.060> right<00:04:30.840> on

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
going to put this little piece right on

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.290 
going to put this little piece right on
the<00:04:31.139> inside<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:31.919> make<00:04:32.490> sure<00:04:32.700> you<00:04:32.880> do<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.150> this

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
the inside and make sure you do it this

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.210 
the inside and make sure you do it this
way<00:04:33.510> around<00:04:33.750> so<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.169> these<00:04:34.380> flaps<00:04:34.770> line<00:04:35.070> up

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
way around so that these flaps line up

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.400 
way around so that these flaps line up
with<00:04:35.430> these<00:04:35.820> flaps<00:04:36.150> if<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:36.840> have<00:04:37.050> sewn

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
with these flaps if you have sewn

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.650 
with these flaps if you have sewn
everything<00:04:38.100> up<00:04:38.280> correctly<00:04:38.850> it<00:04:39.180> should<00:04:39.419> fit

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
everything up correctly it should fit

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.560 
everything up correctly it should fit
nicely<00:04:39.690> in<00:04:40.290> place<00:04:40.320> like<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:40.980> and<00:04:41.400> now<00:04:42.030> I<00:04:42.060> need
