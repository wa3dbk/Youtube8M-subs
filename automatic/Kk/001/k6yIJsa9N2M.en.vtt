00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
hyper minimum wage the truth is is that

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.400 
hyper minimum wage the truth is is that
most<00:02:51.270> working<00:02:52.270> americans<00:02:52.750> make<00:02:52.959> more<00:02:53.200> than<00:02:53.380> a

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
minimum wage already but people I think

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.960 
minimum wage already but people I think
