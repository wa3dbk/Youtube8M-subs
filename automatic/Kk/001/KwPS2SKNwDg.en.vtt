 the city is home to the gods asos 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.409
 its name is translated as ases 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.809
 the city of wasp is the main group of gods 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:47.359
 Norse mythology their supreme 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.030
 god was one about the origins of asgard 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.799
 many legends are folded and there is no 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.079
 the only correct version of it 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.479
 appearances therefore we remember everything and 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.329

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.850
 entrust svartalfheim 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.590
 heym you will break his tongue and god 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.780
 most popular and most basic 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.729
 legends of the origin of asgard to which 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.610
 to some extent refer and comics 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.520
 here is a tale at the beginning of everything 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.610
 There was absolutely nothing 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.399
 any worlds no people no gods was 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.819
 emptiness and in one moment two were formed 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.009
 the opposite of the world of ice and fire 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.929
 fiery land was called muspelheim 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.030
 the abode before got the name niflheim 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.100
 they existed independently of 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.860
 friend until one moment the flow of warm 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.110
 air hundreds on earth did not collide with 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.509
 ice and ice fountain niflheim 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.320
 This combination gave birth to two living 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.799
 creatures 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.170
 giant and the world, and as a udumala udumala 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.899
 was a cow emerging from melting ice 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.119
 and she generally played a key role in 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.670
 all this business because it is a udumala 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.890
 fed her milk and peace and all 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.500
 his descendants the same cow ate 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.109
 salty lumps of ice and from heat and and 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.109
 language from one of the clumps appeared were 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:15.019
 who became the ancestor of the aces 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:16.549
 Here twisted thing he had a son in 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.670
 which subsequently 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.720
 sons also appeared and called them one 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.510
 twisted and ve 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.970
 this trinity killed and the world to 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.410
 deal with the giants further there 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.569
 small differences in different 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.090
 sources but the point is that blood 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.130
 deceased flooded the world and in the same 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.410
 moment dead or missing autumn 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.300

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.850
 brothers first thing created 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.100
 humanity and midgard between nickel 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.200
 and film and Muspelheim of bones 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.900
 dead giant mountains were created 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.300
 and the hair is greenery from his skull 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.700
 they created the vault of heaven after 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.860
 completion of the construction wasps created over 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.530
 our world has a house and called it 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.970
 asgard over between the two worlds formed 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.730

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.470
 the guardian of whom stalheim before nor after 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.300
 death of brothers in one of the battles 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.090
 one becomes the sole ruler 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.100
 gods are also believed to be asgard 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.590
 collapses every few thousand years 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.420
 for a new 1 and letting anew 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.660
 form a city and start life 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.970

 all of the world tree planted by father 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.140
 our brothers and there is still a version that all 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:37.080
 the gods were originally mortal but later 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.300
 ascended divinity and became home 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.310
 asgard and still in the younger edda 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.880
 it is told that the heavenly city was 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.920
 built by 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.110
 iota to us by a bricklayer and in payment for 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.540
 construction wasp should have given him 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.550
 the sun and the moon but the gods got rid of 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.340
 obligations due to the fact that the work is not 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.350
 was completed on time 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.360

 thorin is actually unknown in which 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.410
 the extent of each of these stories is 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.959
 true but our knowledge is limited 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.020
 by the way it is in asgard 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.680
 famous valhalla dwelling fallen 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.109
