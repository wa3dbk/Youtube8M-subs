00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.990 
wants and then I kind of go through and
do<00:02:56.110> it<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:57.280> approach<00:02:57.459> is<00:02:57.550> different<00:02:57.700> but

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
do it so the approach is different but

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.310 
do it so the approach is different but
they're<00:02:58.180> definitely<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:59.019> know<00:02:59.110> there's

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
they're definitely you know there's

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.710 
they're definitely you know there's
there<00:02:59.590> space<00:02:59.800> for<00:02:59.830> everybody<00:03:00.160> how<00:03:00.730> about<00:03:01.150> film

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
there space for everybody how about film

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.140 
there space for everybody how about film
versus<00:03:02.260> digital<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.860> everybody<00:03:03.430> digital<00:03:04.000> is

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
versus digital is everybody digital is

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.790 
versus digital is everybody digital is
there<00:03:04.330> any<00:03:04.480> reason<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.959> use<00:03:05.170> film<00:03:05.530> anymore

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
there any reason to use film anymore

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.340 
there any reason to use film anymore
well<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.190> think<00:03:06.550> some<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.230> some<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.320> the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
well I think some of the some of the

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.390 
well I think some of the some of the
guys<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.530> have<00:03:08.739> been<00:03:08.830> shooting<00:03:09.100> for<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.250> long

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
guys that have been shooting for a long

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.220 
guys that have been shooting for a long
time<00:03:09.670> stick<00:03:10.450> with<00:03:10.540> film<00:03:10.750> because<00:03:10.959> that's<00:03:11.110> what

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
time stick with film because that's what

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.960 
time stick with film because that's what
they<00:03:11.320> know<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.620> essentially<00:03:12.580> even<00:03:12.790> if<00:03:12.880> you

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
they know and essentially even if you

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.280 
they know and essentially even if you
are<00:03:13.090> shooting<00:03:13.239> film<00:03:13.540> they<00:03:13.630> get<00:03:13.750> scanned<00:03:14.080> into

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
are shooting film they get scanned into

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.979 
are shooting film they get scanned into
digital<00:03:15.010> anyway<00:03:15.550> so<00:03:15.610> it's<00:03:16.390> just<00:03:16.600> an<00:03:16.720> extra

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
digital anyway so it's just an extra

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.870 
digital anyway so it's just an extra
step<00:03:17.140> in<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.380> process<00:03:17.560> digital<00:03:18.459> is<00:03:18.549> so<00:03:18.730> much

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
step in the process digital is so much

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.410 
step in the process digital is so much
better<00:03:20.459> workflow<00:03:21.459> wise<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.940> can<00:03:21.970> turn<00:03:22.180> stuff

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
better workflow wise you can turn stuff

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.509 
better workflow wise you can turn stuff
