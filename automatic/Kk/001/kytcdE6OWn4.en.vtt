generates<00:02:16.910> heat<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:18.050> naturally<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.500> would

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
generates heat so naturally you would

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.080

assume<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:18.860> he<00:02:19.040> can<00:02:19.160> pick<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.430> up<00:02:19.490> on<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:19.820> on

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
assume that he can pick it up on this on

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.580 
assume that he can pick it up on this on

you<00:02:22.220> look<00:02:22.370> very<00:02:22.400> carefully<00:02:22.879> you're<00:02:23.209> gonna

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
you look very carefully you're gonna

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.000 
you look very carefully you're gonna
find<00:02:23.540> there's<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.810> faint<00:02:24.019> one<00:02:24.170> here<00:02:24.410> to

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
find there's a faint one here to

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.520 
find there's a faint one here to
extremely<00:02:25.430> bright<00:02:25.700> ones<00:02:25.940> there<00:02:26.230> bayonne<00:02:27.230> here

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
extremely bright ones there bayonne here

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.070 
extremely bright ones there bayonne here
I'll<00:02:28.040> bunch<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.580> them<00:02:28.730> right<00:02:28.910> in<00:02:29.090> there<00:02:29.269> here

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
I'll bunch of them right in there here

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.600 
I'll bunch of them right in there here
he<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.230> zoomed<00:02:30.620> in<00:02:30.860> there<00:02:31.129> are<00:02:31.220> several

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
he is zoomed in there are several

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.250 
he is zoomed in there are several
different<00:02:31.970> magnifications<00:02:32.780> of<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.019> flea<00:02:33.230> or

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
different magnifications of the flea or

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.040 
different magnifications of the flea or
so<00:02:33.580> anyway<00:02:34.580> this<00:02:34.790> pair<00:02:35.239> which<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.660> call<00:02:35.840> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
so anyway this pair which I call the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.100 
so anyway this pair which I call the
Quinns<00:02:36.910> goes<00:02:37.910> behind<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.330> clouds<00:02:38.629> or<00:02:38.959> the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
Quinns goes behind the clouds or the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.009 
Quinns goes behind the clouds or the
others<00:02:41.860> are<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.700> cloud<00:02:43.940> moves<00:02:44.299> between<00:02:44.540> them

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
others are the cloud moves between them

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.690 
others are the cloud moves between them
and<00:02:45.170> then<00:02:45.319> whatever<00:02:45.590> playing<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.459> have<00:02:46.580> to

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
and then whatever playing you have to

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.339 
and then whatever playing you have to
realize<00:02:47.000> is<00:02:47.180> traveling<00:02:47.540> along<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.959> looks<00:02:48.170> like

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
realize is traveling along it looks like

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.070 
realize is traveling along it looks like
those<00:02:48.500> objects<00:02:48.950> are<00:02:49.099> moving<00:02:49.720> but<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:50.870> could

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
those objects are moving but that could

know what it was whether it be Bigfoot

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.210 
know what it was whether it be Bigfoot
or<00:05:09.690> something<00:05:10.080> like<00:05:10.199> a<00:05:10.229> bear<00:05:10.530> who<00:05:10.800> knows<00:05:10.979> but

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
around the swamps that's for sure now

around the swamps that's for sure now
what<00:05:14.580> about<00:05:14.699> you<00:05:14.820> Natalie<00:05:15.560> could<00:05:16.560> lizardmen

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
what about you Natalie could lizardmen

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.839 
what about you Natalie could lizardmen
be<00:05:17.789> a<00:05:17.820> kink<00:05:18.240> in<00:05:18.389> evolution<00:05:18.960> a<00:05:19.610> dinosaur<00:05:20.610> that

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
be a kink in evolution a dinosaur that

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:24.890 
be a kink in evolution a dinosaur that
evolved<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.479> humanoid<00:05:21.960> form<00:05:23.419> warble<00:05:24.419> there<00:05:24.720> is

evolved a humanoid form warble there is
no<00:05:25.199> doubt<00:05:25.560> in<00:05:25.590> my<00:05:25.800> mind<00:05:26.190> that<00:05:26.580> these<00:05:26.849> reptilian

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
no doubt in my mind that these reptilian

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.600 
no doubt in my mind that these reptilian
creatures<00:05:28.080> are<00:05:28.740> not<00:05:28.979> part<00:05:29.280> of<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.490> animal

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
creatures are not part of the animal

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.420 
creatures are not part of the animal
world<00:05:30.080> there's<00:05:31.080> no<00:05:31.260> evidence<00:05:31.470> of<00:05:31.919> them<00:05:32.190> in<00:05:32.340> the

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
world there's no evidence of them in the

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.750 
world there's no evidence of them in the
fossil<00:05:32.820> record<00:05:32.970> and<00:05:33.510> there<00:05:34.169> are<00:05:34.289> no<00:05:34.409> living

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760

representatives<00:05:35.760> of<00:05:35.909> their<00:05:36.210> evolutionary

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
representatives of their evolutionary

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.620 
representatives of their evolutionary
history<00:05:37.190> just<00:05:38.190> like<00:05:38.310> Apes<00:05:38.729> and<00:05:38.970> monkeys<00:05:39.030> are

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
history just like Apes and monkeys are

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.810 
history just like Apes and monkeys are
living<00:05:39.900> representatives<00:05:40.650> of<00:05:40.919> our<00:05:41.310> evolution

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
living representatives of our evolution

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.660 
living representatives of our evolution
of<00:05:41.909> this

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.130 

it<00:05:45.670> really<00:05:45.850> doesn't<00:05:46.180> sound<00:05:46.360> like<00:05:46.630> people<00:05:47.020> were

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
it really doesn't sound like people were

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.770 
it really doesn't sound like people were
seeing<00:05:47.440> a<00:05:47.800> lizard<00:05:48.220> man<00:05:48.420> sounds<00:05:49.420> like<00:05:49.570> they

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
seeing a lizard man sounds like they

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.230 
seeing a lizard man sounds like they
were<00:05:49.810> seeing<00:05:50.260> a<00:05:50.590> large<00:05:50.920> primate<00:05:51.490> so<00:05:52.090> I<00:05:52.120> think

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
were seeing a large primate so I think

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.970 
were seeing a large primate so I think
the<00:05:52.420> name<00:05:52.600> lizard<00:05:52.960> man<00:05:53.110> actually<00:05:53.320> came<00:05:53.710> from<00:05:53.890> a

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
the name lizard man actually came from a

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.340 
the name lizard man actually came from a
few<00:05:54.160> songs<00:05:54.340> that<00:05:54.610> were<00:05:54.670> written<00:05:54.730> at<00:05:55.030> the<00:05:55.060> time

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
few songs that were written at the time

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.420 
few songs that were written at the time
most<00:05:56.350> of<00:05:56.410> the<00:05:56.500> witnesses<00:05:56.650> that<00:05:56.980> we've<00:05:57.160> spoken

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
most of the witnesses that we've spoken

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.160 
most of the witnesses that we've spoken
to<00:05:57.580> in<00:05:57.760> fact<00:05:57.850> all<00:05:58.120> of<00:05:58.150> them<00:05:58.420> and<00:05:58.600> said<00:05:58.840> it<00:05:58.960> looks

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
to in fact all of them and said it looks

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.070 
to in fact all of them and said it looks
like<00:05:59.380> a<00:05:59.410> big<00:05:59.680> hairy<00:05:59.980> ape-like<00:06:00.490> creature<00:06:01.080> well

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
like a big hairy ape-like creature well

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.990 
like a big hairy ape-like creature well
I<00:06:02.170> think<00:06:02.230> that<00:06:02.620> the<00:06:02.710> people<00:06:02.920> that<00:06:03.820> perhaps

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
I think that the people that perhaps

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.200 
I think that the people that perhaps
described<00:06:04.780> it<00:06:05.110> as<00:06:05.380> being<00:06:05.880> reptilian<00:06:06.880> like

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
described it as being reptilian like

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.050 
described it as being reptilian like
green<00:06:07.660> having<00:06:08.380> scales<00:06:08.800> on<00:06:09.100> it<00:06:09.310> I<00:06:09.490> mean<00:06:09.910> we're

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
green having scales on it I mean we're

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.670 
green having scales on it I mean we're
in<00:06:10.150> a<00:06:10.240> swamp<00:06:10.660> there's<00:06:10.960> algae<00:06:11.260> growing

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
in a swamp there's algae growing

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.220 
in a swamp there's algae growing
everywhere<00:06:12.100> so<00:06:12.880> that's<00:06:13.060> perhaps<00:06:13.690> where<00:06:14.080> they

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 
everywhere so that's perhaps where they

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.890 
everywhere so that's perhaps where they
got<00:06:14.440> the<00:06:14.890> green<00:06:15.160> coloring<00:06:15.580> from<00:06:15.850> and<00:06:16.240> they're

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
got the green coloring from and they're

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.320 
got the green coloring from and they're
going<00:06:16.990> to<00:06:17.110> be<00:06:17.200> coated<00:06:17.650> in<00:06:17.770> mud<00:06:18.100> and<00:06:18.430> you<00:06:19.150> know

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
going to be coated in mud and you know

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.850 
going to be coated in mud and you know
that<00:06:19.540> when<00:06:19.660> you<00:06:19.780> cut<00:06:19.990> yourself<00:06:20.170> in<00:06:20.650> mud<00:06:20.830> and

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
that when you cut yourself in mud and

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.190 
that when you cut yourself in mud and
the<00:06:21.040> mud<00:06:21.220> dries<00:06:21.520> it<00:06:22.510> looks<00:06:22.750> like<00:06:22.930> you've<00:06:23.080> got

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
the mud dries it looks like you've got

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.140 
the mud dries it looks like you've got
scales<00:06:23.560> that's<00:06:24.100> right<00:06:26.430> what<00:06:27.430> you're<00:06:27.730> saying

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
scales that's right what you're saying

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.920 
scales that's right what you're saying
then<00:06:28.690> is<00:06:28.990> that<00:06:29.470> Blizzard<00:06:30.100> man<00:06:30.310> is

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
then is that Blizzard man is

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.990 
then is that Blizzard man is
misidentified<00:06:32.250> that<00:06:33.250> was<00:06:33.550> something<00:06:33.760> else

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
misidentified that was something else

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.610 
misidentified that was something else
completely<00:06:35.910> okay<00:06:37.020> so<00:06:38.020> what<00:06:38.620> happened<00:06:39.100> to<00:06:39.280> it

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
completely okay so what happened to it

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.470 
completely okay so what happened to it
whatever<00:06:41.620> it<00:06:41.800> is<00:06:41.950> is<00:06:42.280> it<00:06:42.580> still<00:06:42.880> lurking<00:06:43.180> in

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480 
whatever it is is it still lurking in

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.770 
whatever it is is it still lurking in
the<00:06:43.600> Bishopville<00:06:44.110> swamp<00:06:45.360> the<00:06:46.360> swamp<00:06:46.600> is<00:06:46.720> a

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780 
the Bishopville swamp the swamp is a

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.570 
the Bishopville swamp the swamp is a
very<00:06:47.050> big<00:06:47.290> places<00:06:47.560> a<00:06:47.770> lot<00:06:47.860> of<00:06:48.070> places<00:06:48.220> for<00:06:48.400> it

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
very big places a lot of places for it

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.130 
very big places a lot of places for it
to<00:06:48.700> hide<00:06:48.910> and<00:06:50.910> all<00:06:51.910> the<00:06:52.240> people<00:06:52.660> that<00:06:52.690> win<00:06:53.110> in

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140 
to hide and all the people that win in

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.420 
to hide and all the people that win in
there<00:06:53.350> looking<00:06:53.620> for<00:06:53.800> it<00:06:53.919> I<00:06:53.980> probably<00:06:54.220> don't

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
there looking for it I probably don't

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.670 
there looking for it I probably don't
didn't<00:06:54.820> get<00:06:54.940> very<00:06:55.030> far<00:06:55.150> off<00:06:55.450> the<00:06:55.570> road<00:06:55.780> I<00:06:56.020> think

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
didn't get very far off the road I think

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.560 
didn't get very far off the road I think
the<00:06:56.770> people<00:06:57.010> were<00:06:57.070> scattered<00:06:57.400> often<00:06:57.729> with<00:06:57.940> got

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.570 
the people were scattered often with got

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.940
