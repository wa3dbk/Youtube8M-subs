transfer molding this material is laid
down<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.299> then<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.420> vacuum<00:02:42.720> bag<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.319> placed

down and then a vacuum bag is placed

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.280 
down and then a vacuum bag is placed
over<00:02:43.799> it<00:02:44.220> suction<00:02:45.090> draws<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.660> resin<00:02:46.019> through

over it suction draws the resin through

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.690 
over it suction draws the resin through
and<00:02:46.500> that's<00:02:46.769> where<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.040> gets<00:02:47.129> its<00:02:47.340> hardness

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
and that's where it gets its hardness

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.569 
and that's where it gets its hardness
from<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.629> takes<00:02:48.840> many<00:02:49.110> more<00:02:49.349> steps<00:02:49.709> much<00:02:50.340> more

from it takes many more steps much more

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.119 
from it takes many more steps much more

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
so than putting it into a mold

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.259 
so than putting it into a mold
