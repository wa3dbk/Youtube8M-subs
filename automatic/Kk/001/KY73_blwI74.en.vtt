00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:13.070
 attention now begins the material or biology of high school 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.329
 You are going to watch 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.470
 until the crescent of number 19 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.470
 good studies 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.470
 at this moment he deceived 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.359
 the number 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.359
 carney 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.170
 a 22-year-old woman was also in school, everything indicates that this 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.490
 it is also expected to be difficult to see the bid before the decisive game 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.290
 will also be discussed 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.600
 reinforce that it is about the headache when ana maria fontenele se 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.960
 animated the paulista 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.250
 That's why we'd better go and visit the Paulista 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.049
 with that our eyes 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:02.770
 how they work 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.770
 This I assume all our skin is today's time 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.550
 you will know how the eyeball is, I would say that there is a mechanism of 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.260
 protection that controls the light input 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.160
 to where it will still show some visual defects and the lenses that are 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.240
 used to correct them 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.930
 everyone knows that brain eyes to see 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.930
 but it's not as simple as that. 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.930
 works with a complex light receiving system 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.000
 received us reflected in the objects enabling the formation of images 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.510
 this reception of the light that is transformed into pulses of votes 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.710
 which our brain interprets as an image 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.840
 when we are in a place without light 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.020
 we could not see anything 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.020
 now when we are in a room with low light 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.410
 we see many of the objects but we do not notice the details 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.270
 when someone is eliminated from you 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.740
 we realize everything inviting them things shapes the texture all 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.080
 we are in recess 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.080
 It also disturbs you, you can not see it right. 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.599
 until I like 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.739
 about 80% of the information our brain rcn 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:16.959
 reach the truth 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.679
 this is absurd 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:21.489
 super sophisticated 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.899
 last to stay 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:24.669
 in high pitched 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.799
 wants the dark part that defending my father 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.819
 this is the other headline who played in the games 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.360
 You are the wallet hunt. 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.579
 in the midst of networks of envy 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.559
 Click Here! 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.559
 That's when we use a lot of girlfriends. 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.660
 knowledge of one year and has a system 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.759
 which controls the entry of pike 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.659
 the clear river I know he wants 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.629
 it is necessary 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.629
 I would love to stay with water in the direction of uel 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.609
 one of the creditors 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:58.999
 the injury is doubt 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:03.450
 the recipe does not have much light in the eye of a person there pupil path that is 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.649
 unprecedented 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:09.109
 Would you like to know which side he's been running since 2006? 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.290
 when we are in the East of penury in low light what happens to the 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.339
 our eyes 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:22.269
 the muscles of the iris relax this makes the pupil that is the space in the 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.499
 center of the ilicitude follows great between the maximum of possible goals for 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:28.649
 inside the river 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:33.179
 we did not do it well because the amount of light rays reflected 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:36.789
 on objects is not enough to form a sharp image 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:41.179
 now what happens when the light that enters the eyes of the press 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:44.229
 if too much light comes on the eye 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:47.229
 we also can not form a clear image 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:53.719
 then to reduce the light entering the muscles from there contracting and ending 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.839
 closing pupil spaces 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:59.619
 is this mechanism that controls the light in the eyes 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:04.199
 It's not doomed I was impressed I did not know I would not leave 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.279
 so sophisticated would do that 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:10.419
 and once again explained that there is so much different from olhÃ£o 

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:22.079
 did you know it was an impediment that determines the color of people's eyes 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.819
 the segment called melatonin is the same one that gives color to our skin according to 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.370
 amount of it in the magazine people have eyes with different colors of the elmium 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.440
 to understand how the vision works is better to see with my record 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.129
 let's imagine we make a cut 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.830
 the globe the collar is formed by various structures 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.890
 this transparent organ that looks more like a round lens is the lens 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.889
 whose current name is exactly 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.020
 it changes shape to focus on the rays of light 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.240
 and adjust the formation of the image in the fundus of the eye is a 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.009
 retina 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.840
 the retina this inner layer of gold 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.000
 where the cells that transform the light rays are located 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.240
 nervous 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.830
 the spaces between colony and alentejo 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.069
 and between the lens the retina are filled by clear liquids 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.610
 light the cornea transverse beyond the title 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.169
 and liquids until you reach the sensitive cells of the retina 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:35.100
 the light rays are transformed into a wrist the nerves 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.100
 taken to the brain by means of the portico 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:44.039
 in the brain these impulses are interpreted and recognized with the 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.229
 objects in front of us 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.940
 if for some reason the optic nerve was prevented from sending messages to the brain 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:53.379
 the person fails to see 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:58.180
 the same happens if the victim is unable to be sensitized by light 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.259
 sure therefore all care is little with this organ so delicate and 'special' 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.919
 what are our eyes 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.080
 who knew that most animals 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.150
 at 12:30 a.m. 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.939
 I did not know that 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.939
 so the case but I knew it was so with most 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.320
 just in time 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.589
 same house 

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.229
 nothing is finished 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:26.330
 is located 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.150
 the fourth team 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.150
 the author 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:33.369
 at 9:30 p.m. and fold 

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:35.490
 so the doctor 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.650
 knows that there are two types of skin 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.650
 she is fifty years old 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.669
 bush but also concentrate in this region of the eyes 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:47.479
 are very sensitive to light 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:50.729
 to distinguish images from poorly lit environments
