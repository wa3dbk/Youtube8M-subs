00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 there are many treaties of gt5 and good today 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.060
 I bring you a trick to get inside 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.010
 of the alien workshop is a very trick 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.900
 very easy to do and as you are seeing 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.030
 what you will need is to have two 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.679
 characters in case you have 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.690
 less than a million you do not need to have 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.390
 two characters I'll explain them by 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.770
 the reason why you need two me in 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.180
 my case as I have more than five million 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.670
 What I have to do is take the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.820
 secondary character and take out all that 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.130
 money - for 600,000 that is to say let 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.380
 less than a million dollars in the bank 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.660
 once you get all the money 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.940
 what do you need to take out with the character 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.160
 secondary what you will have to do is 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.300
 go to catch the main character as 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.730
 you have seen I have left some 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.320
 600,000 in the character in the bank 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.350
 then now with the character 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.059
 main I will have 600,000 just now 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.250
 as you are going to see I am going to take the character 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.170
 main and with that character is going to be 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.020
 with which we are going to make the clip is a 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.510
 trick how are you going to see very easy to do 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.859
 you will not take much longer and you have just 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.989
 see that I just caught the character 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.090
 main now you are simply going to have 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.070
 to come to this area 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.590
 on the map so you can see it if not 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.840
 you know where your vis is inside this 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.170
 caravan you jump over and you will have to 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.850
 put you exactly where I 'm going to put 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.610
 just so that you get it right and that 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.560
 enter inside the alien workshop os 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.030
 you put more or less in this area where I 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.070
 I was getting and now what 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.630
 you will have to do is go buy a 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.430
 vehicle but before that I'm going to 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.979
 mark where you are in case you do not 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.119
 you know and it is in this area 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.340
 where are you seeing that I was now 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.080
 same you put here on top of this 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.119
 caravan you put in the place where I 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.979
 I just put and go to travel and 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.750
 transports in trips and transports 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.090
 what you have to do is buy a 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.950
 vehicle that is worth a million for that 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.750
 I said you have to have less money 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.670
 of a million and now what will happen 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.410
 is that he's going to send us for playstation 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.690
 store and he's going to tell us that we do not have 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.520
 enough money to be able to buy that 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.200
 vehicle will then send us as I have 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.250
 told the playstation story once 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.800
 inside the pri station history 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.350
 we simply give the circle and go to 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.910
 see that he will send us again for the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.920
 site where we were but in this case 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.319
 what's going to happen is that we're going to be 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.440
 already within that area and good is a 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.080
 pretty curious area I was the first 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.670
 came in because previously, 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.470
 could because there was no clichÃ© or 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.570
 anything but good now that is 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.760
 this clip then we can enter quite 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.960
 easy and works exactly the same with 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.150
 different sites already going up 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.830
 previously to the channel but seen that it 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.880
 I could also enter this area and I say 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.440
 Well, I'm going to share it with 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.180
 you so that things also enter 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.670
 in case you've never seen it before 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.230
 you have entered and that you can do so 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.240
 that nothing the truth that is a very trick 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.100
 easy as you have just seen is quite 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.360
 simple or a rather curious place that 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.190
 see and well I hope you liked it 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.200
 let him schedule subscribe where not 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.380
 you are and see you in the next one 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.380
 then
