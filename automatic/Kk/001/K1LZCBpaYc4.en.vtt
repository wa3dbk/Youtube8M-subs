00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:14.640 
put line on and what it finished at tip
up<00:00:13.540> should<00:00:13.690> look<00:00:13.870> like<00:00:13.900> when<00:00:14.230> it's<00:00:14.379> ready<00:00:14.559> to

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
up should look like when it's ready to

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.800 
up should look like when it's ready to
fish<00:00:14.950> so<00:00:15.759> it's<00:00:15.940> pretty<00:00:16.059> simple<00:00:16.450> and<00:00:16.630> I'm<00:00:16.720> gonna

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
up line and I like to just make a loop

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.150 
up line and I like to just make a loop
make<00:00:37.960> it<00:00:38.080> a<00:00:38.140> loop<00:00:38.260> I'm<00:00:38.410> gonna<00:00:38.560> tie<00:00:38.800> a<00:00:38.830> knot<00:00:39.100> like

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
make it a loop I'm gonna tie a knot like

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:48.270 
make it a loop I'm gonna tie a knot like
this

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.440 

folding<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.400> line<00:00:49.580> over<00:00:50.000> in<00:00:50.210> my<00:00:51.140> hand<00:00:52.390> got<00:00:53.390> a

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
folding the line over in my hand got a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.840 
folding the line over in my hand got a
fairly<00:00:53.780> long<00:00:53.930> tag<00:00:54.290> and<00:00:55.220> I'm<00:00:55.370> just<00:00:55.520> going<00:00:55.790> to

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
fairly long tag and I'm just going to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.450 
fairly long tag and I'm just going to
tie<00:00:56.840> a<00:00:56.870> knot<00:00:59.710> and<00:01:00.710> what<00:01:00.860> I've<00:01:00.950> done<00:01:01.130> is<00:01:01.310> I've

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
tie a knot and what I've done is I've

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.740 
tie a knot and what I've done is I've
created<00:01:01.700> a<00:01:03.670> small<00:01:04.670> little<00:01:05.000> loop<00:01:05.240> that<00:01:05.270> you<00:01:05.600> can

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
created a small little loop that you can

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.380 
created a small little loop that you can
see<00:01:05.990> there<00:01:06.200> there's<00:01:06.620> a<00:01:06.740> tiny<00:01:06.920> little<00:01:07.100> loop

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
see there there's a tiny little loop

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.060 
see there there's a tiny little loop
when<00:01:08.390> I<00:01:08.450> cut<00:01:08.690> off<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:08.960> excess<00:01:09.350> tag<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:09.920> I've

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
when I cut off that excess tag that I've

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.850 
when I cut off that excess tag that I've
got<00:01:12.610> my<00:01:13.610> scissors<00:01:13.880> maybe<00:01:14.240> leave<00:01:14.480> about<00:01:14.900> an

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
got my scissors maybe leave about an

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.440 
got my scissors maybe leave about an
eighth<00:01:16.850> of<00:01:17.000> an<00:01:17.150> inch<00:01:18.460> so<00:01:19.460> I<00:01:19.550> cut<00:01:19.760> that<00:01:19.910> off<00:01:20.150> and

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
eighth of an inch so I cut that off and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.670 
eighth of an inch so I cut that off and
now<00:01:20.690> what<00:01:20.990> I'm<00:01:21.050> gonna<00:01:21.170> do<00:01:21.440> is<00:01:21.800> take<00:01:22.760> my<00:01:23.030> line<00:01:23.680> my

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
now what I'm gonna do is take my line my

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.080 
now what I'm gonna do is take my line my
my<00:01:25.100> line<00:01:25.250> that<00:01:25.369> I've<00:01:25.460> got<00:01:25.610> right<00:01:25.790> here<00:01:26.000> I'm

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
my line that I've got right here I'm

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.400 
my line that I've got right here I'm
gonna<00:01:26.210> push<00:01:26.540> it<00:01:26.750> back<00:01:27.430> through<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.580> loop<00:01:29.410> and

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
gonna push it back through that loop and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.770 
gonna push it back through that loop and
now<00:01:30.590> what<00:01:30.740> I've<00:01:30.860> created<00:01:31.190> as<00:01:31.610> a<00:01:31.640> bigger<00:01:32.420> loop

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
now what I've created as a bigger loop

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.109 
now what I've created as a bigger loop
here<00:01:33.110> that<00:01:33.320> I<00:01:33.350> can<00:01:33.560> cinch<00:01:33.920> down<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.910> I<00:01:34.970> just

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
here that I can cinch down so I just

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.969 
here that I can cinch down so I just
cinch<00:01:35.360> that<00:01:35.420> down<00:01:35.570> onto<00:01:35.960> my<00:01:35.990> fingers<00:01:36.470> like<00:01:36.710> so

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
cinch that down onto my fingers like so

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.070 
cinch that down onto my fingers like so
I'm<00:01:37.430> going<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.030> take<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:38.450> line<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:38.750> I'm

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
I'm going to take that line and I'm

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.450 
I'm going to take that line and I'm
actually<00:01:39.320> going<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:40.750> push<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:41.960> now<00:01:42.460> through

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
actually going to push it now through

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.430 
actually going to push it now through
the<00:01:43.490> line<00:01:43.790> guide<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:45.100> then<00:01:46.100> over<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.440> around

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
the line guide and then over and around

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.620 
the line guide and then over and around
my<00:01:48.740> spool<00:01:49.190> so<00:01:49.520> now<00:01:49.729> what's<00:01:49.970> gonna<00:01:50.030> happen<00:01:50.150> is

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
my spool so now what's gonna happen is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.810 
my spool so now what's gonna happen is
it's<00:01:50.660> cinched<00:01:51.200> down<00:01:53.080> onto<00:01:54.080> my<00:01:54.259> spool<00:01:54.610> nice<00:01:55.610> and

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
it's cinched down onto my spool nice and

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.889 
it's cinched down onto my spool nice and
tight<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:56.149> have<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.330> worry<00:01:56.509> about<00:01:56.539> trying

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
tight and you have to worry about trying

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.090 
tight and you have to worry about trying
to<00:01:56.929> make<00:01:57.110> some<00:01:57.259> sort<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.470> slip<00:01:57.740> knot<00:01:57.920> or

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
to make some sort of slip knot or

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.520 
to make some sort of slip knot or
anything<00:01:58.280> it's<00:01:59.149> tightened<00:01:59.630> up<00:01:59.750> like<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.229> and

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
anything it's tightened up like so and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.380 
anything it's tightened up like so and
now<00:02:00.590> I<00:02:01.009> can<00:02:01.340> just<00:02:01.520> take<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:01.970> here's<00:02:02.119> a<00:02:02.210> couple

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
now I can just take and here's a couple

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.419 
now I can just take and here's a couple
of<00:02:02.509> different<00:02:02.780> ways<00:02:02.899> to<00:02:02.929> do<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:03.289> take<00:02:04.250> your

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
of different ways to do it take your

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.270 
of different ways to do it take your
finger<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:04.880> just<00:02:04.940> start<00:02:05.240> spinning<00:02:05.569> and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
finger and just start spinning and

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.300 
finger and just start spinning and
that's<00:02:07.280> gonna<00:02:07.490> spin<00:02:07.789> line<00:02:08.740> right<00:02:09.740> onto<00:02:10.130> your

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
that's gonna spin line right onto your

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.480 
that's gonna spin line right onto your
on<00:02:11.240> your<00:02:11.540> spool<00:02:11.950> there's<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.010> little<00:02:13.340> rubber

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
on your spool there's a little rubber

so so that's one simple way to do it
just<00:02:46.069> put<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.610> line<00:02:46.819> on<00:02:47.060> there<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:48.080> boom

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
just put that line on there and boom

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.590 
just put that line on there and boom
step<00:02:48.740> using<00:02:48.950> your<00:02:49.190> finger<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.790> slowly
