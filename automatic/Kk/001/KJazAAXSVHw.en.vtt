hi<00:00:00.760> this<00:00:01.000> is<00:00:01.030> Frank<00:00:01.360> Carmody<00:00:01.750> today<00:00:01.990> we're

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:02.139 
hi this is Frank Carmody today we're

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:03.719 
hi this is Frank Carmody today we're
going<00:00:02.229> to<00:00:02.290> be<00:00:02.469> creating<00:00:02.679> an<00:00:02.979> assembly<00:00:03.489> and

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:03.729 
going to be creating an assembly and

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:06.900 
going to be creating an assembly and
we're<00:00:03.969> going<00:00:04.150> to<00:00:04.180> use<00:00:04.420> the<00:00:05.760> couple<00:00:06.760> of<00:00:06.820> the

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:06.910 
we're going to use the couple of the

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.089 
we're going to use the couple of the
features<00:00:06.940> that<00:00:07.360> allow<00:00:08.200> us<00:00:08.349> to<00:00:08.679> work<00:00:08.860> a<00:00:08.980> little

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:09.099 
features that allow us to work a little

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.489 
features that allow us to work a little
bit<00:00:09.280> more<00:00:09.459> quickly<00:00:10.049> so<00:00:11.049> let's<00:00:11.200> go<00:00:11.320> ahead<00:00:11.349> and

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:11.499 
bit more quickly so let's go ahead and

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:15.539 
bit more quickly so let's go ahead and
create<00:00:11.829> a<00:00:11.919> new<00:00:12.009> assembly<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:14.469> I'm<00:00:15.309> going<00:00:15.519> to

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549 
create a new assembly and I'm going to

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.060 
create a new assembly and I'm going to
go<00:00:15.700> ahead<00:00:15.730> and<00:00:15.909> create<00:00:16.269> place<00:00:16.779> to<00:00:17.080> two<00:00:17.650> parts

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
go ahead and create place to two parts

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.220 
go ahead and create place to two parts
on<00:00:18.220> that<00:00:18.340> assembly<00:00:18.789> they're<00:00:19.750> going<00:00:19.869> to<00:00:19.960> be<00:00:20.050> the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
on that assembly they're going to be the

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.210 
on that assembly they're going to be the
example<00:00:21.179> cylinder<00:00:22.500> oops<00:00:23.500> actually<00:00:24.130> we're

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
example cylinder oops actually we're

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.320 
example cylinder oops actually we're
going<00:00:24.339> to<00:00:24.400> do<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:24.550> block<00:00:24.939> with<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:25.210> whole

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
going to do the block with the whole

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.550 
going to do the block with the whole
purse<00:00:25.599> open<00:00:26.789> right<00:00:27.789> click<00:00:28.060> done<00:00:28.390> and<00:00:28.630> then

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
purse open right click done and then

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.230 
purse open right click done and then
we're<00:00:29.650> going<00:00:29.740> to<00:00:29.830> create<00:00:30.039> the<00:00:30.249> example<00:00:30.849> or

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
we're going to create the example or

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.639 
we're going to create the example or
we're<00:00:31.449> going<00:00:31.539> to<00:00:31.630> place<00:00:31.869> the<00:00:32.079> examples

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
we're going to place the examples

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.479 
we're going to place the examples
cylinder<00:00:33.190> on<00:00:33.219> there<00:00:33.579> as<00:00:33.730> well<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:36.100> this<00:00:36.280> is<00:00:36.460> a

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
cylinder on there as well and this is a

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.990 
cylinder on there as well and this is a
very<00:00:36.910> simplistic<00:00:37.980> example<00:00:38.980> of<00:00:39.520> using<00:00:39.670> these

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
very simplistic example of using these

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.080 
very simplistic example of using these
features<00:00:40.600> of<00:00:40.750> a<00:00:40.780> program<00:00:41.640> these<00:00:42.640> things<00:00:42.879> can

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
features of a program these things can

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.119 
features of a program these things can
get<00:00:43.210> fairly<00:00:43.690> complicated<00:00:44.260> so<00:00:44.770> just<00:00:45.039> be

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
get fairly complicated so just be

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.910 
get fairly complicated so just be
patient<00:00:45.309> with<00:00:45.609> yourself<00:00:45.699> and<00:00:46.800> experiment<00:00:47.800> a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
patient with yourself and experiment a

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.220 
patient with yourself and experiment a
lot<00:00:48.539> ok<00:00:49.539> we're<00:00:49.629> going<00:00:49.719> to<00:00:49.780> go<00:00:49.870> ahead<00:00:49.930> and<00:00:50.020> click

and apply ok let's go ahead and we're

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.220 
and apply ok let's go ahead and we're
going<00:01:01.149> to<00:01:01.269> look<00:01:01.420> at<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.629> front<00:01:01.989> of<00:01:02.109> the

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
going to look at the front of the

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.660 
going to look at the front of the
drawing<00:01:02.500> or<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.579> front<00:01:03.789> of<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.000> assembly<00:01:05.670> ok

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
drawing or the front of the assembly ok

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.840 
drawing or the front of the assembly ok
and<00:01:07.470> now<00:01:08.470> we're<00:01:08.619> going<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:08.830> use<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.040> what<00:01:09.729> the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
and now we're going to use the what the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.480 
and now we're going to use the what the
company<00:01:10.270> want<00:01:10.450> then<00:01:11.259> we're<00:01:11.380> going<00:01:11.470> to<00:01:11.530> use<00:01:12.250> the

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
company want then we're going to use the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.789 
company want then we're going to use the
we're<00:01:12.759> going<00:01:12.880> to<00:01:12.939> use<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.119> rectangular

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
we're going to use the rectangular

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.109 
we're going to use the rectangular
pattern<00:01:14.799> feature<00:01:15.250> so<00:01:15.729> we're<00:01:15.820> going<00:01:15.909> to<00:01:16.030> do<00:01:16.090> a

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
pattern feature so we're going to do a

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.950 
pattern feature so we're going to do a
column<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.920> at<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.250> top<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.909> bottom<00:01:19.659> go

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
column is at the top and bottom go

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.190 
column is at the top and bottom go
different<00:01:20.320> directions<00:01:21.570> ok<00:01:22.570> so<00:01:22.630> you<00:01:22.869> can<00:01:22.990> tell

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
different directions ok so you can tell

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.569 
different directions ok so you can tell
that<00:01:23.229> we<00:01:23.380> get<00:01:23.500> a<00:01:23.530> good<00:01:23.770> preview<00:01:24.159> here<00:01:24.369> and

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
that we get a good preview here and

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.490 
that we get a good preview here and
let's<00:01:25.030> go<00:01:25.210> ahead<00:01:25.299> and<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:26.110> you<00:01:26.200> notice<00:01:26.470> that

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
let's go ahead and and you notice that

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.840 
let's go ahead and and you notice that
it<00:01:26.680> gives<00:01:26.860> us<00:01:26.979> an<00:01:27.130> automatic<00:01:29.850> distance

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
it gives us an automatic distance

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.170 
it gives us an automatic distance
between<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.390> two<00:01:31.570> we<00:01:31.899> went<00:01:32.140> down<00:01:32.350> one<00:01:32.680> inch<00:01:36.180> ok

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
between the two we went down one inch ok

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.270 
between the two we went down one inch ok
or<00:01:37.570> one<00:01:37.780> column<00:01:38.229> count<00:01:38.470> here<00:01:38.770> so<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:42.130> would

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
or one column count here so this would

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.270 
or one column count here so this would
be<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.490> number<00:01:42.880> of<00:01:43.060> pieces<00:01:43.299> across<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.320> a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
be the number of pieces across and a

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.270 
be the number of pieces across and a
number<00:01:45.579> of<00:01:45.700> pieces<00:01:45.880> down<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:47.710> reduce<00:01:48.009> the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
number of pieces down we reduce the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.920 
number of pieces down we reduce the
distance<00:01:48.670> between<00:01:49.000> them<00:01:49.360> notice<00:01:49.659> that<00:01:49.810> the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
distance between them notice that the

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.800 
distance between them notice that the
pieces<00:01:50.259> actually<00:01:50.409> will<00:01:50.770> overlap<00:01:51.250> here<00:01:51.719> so<00:01:52.719> we

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
pieces actually will overlap here so we

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.179 
pieces actually will overlap here so we
want<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:52.990> keep<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.259> at<00:01:53.350> two<00:01:53.500> inches<00:01:53.680> just<00:01:53.979> so

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
want to keep it at two inches just so

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.249 
want to keep it at two inches just so
happens<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:55.090> pieces<00:01:55.659> are<00:01:55.810> two<00:01:55.960> inches

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
happens that the pieces are two inches

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.310 
happens that the pieces are two inches
it<00:01:56.409> gives<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.710> two-inch<00:01:58.049> automatically<00:01:59.049> so

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
it gives a two-inch automatically so

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.899 
it gives a two-inch automatically so
let's<00:01:59.469> take<00:01:59.619> a<00:01:59.649> look<00:01:59.829> at<00:01:59.920> what<00:01:59.950> we<00:02:00.130> have<00:02:00.250> so<00:02:00.460> far

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.600 

ok<00:02:03.909> so<00:02:04.000> we're<00:02:04.180> going<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.360> go<00:02:04.390> ahead<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.659> zoom

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
ok so we're going to go ahead and zoom

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.920 
ok so we're going to go ahead and zoom
ok<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:06.700> let's<00:02:06.729> actually<00:02:07.060> make<00:02:07.360> this

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.880 

okay<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:13.990> now<00:02:14.320> we've<00:02:14.560> used<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:15.220> pattern<00:02:15.700> tool

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
okay so now we've used the pattern tool

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.540 
okay so now we've used the pattern tool
and<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:19.150> actually<00:02:20.100> now<00:02:21.100> we've<00:02:21.250> used<00:02:21.400> the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
and I actually now we've used the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.770 
and I actually now we've used the
pattern<00:02:21.910> tool<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:23.200> it's<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.360> it's<00:02:25.360> interesting

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
pattern tool and it's a it's interesting

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.540 
pattern tool and it's a it's interesting
because<00:02:26.110> now<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.440> we<00:02:26.710> have<00:02:26.740> this<00:02:27.070> this<00:02:27.490> a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
because now that we have this this a

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.350 
because now that we have this this a
wide<00:02:28.390> array<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:30.570> pieces<00:02:31.570> here<00:02:33.030> okay<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.090> now

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
wide array of pieces here okay so now

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.210 
wide array of pieces here okay so now
that<00:02:34.390> we<00:02:34.600> have<00:02:34.630> our<00:02:34.840> pattern<00:02:35.740> here<00:02:35.950> what<00:02:36.100> we're

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
that we have our pattern here what we're

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.200 
that we have our pattern here what we're
going<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.430> do<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.730> we're<00:02:36.880> going<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.060> go<00:02:37.180> ahead

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
going to do is we're going to go ahead

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.940 
going to do is we're going to go ahead
and<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:39.690> use<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.870> mirror<00:02:41.170> feature<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:41.830> we're

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
and and use the mirror feature so we're

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.470 
and and use the mirror feature so we're
going<00:02:42.070> to<00:02:42.130> right<00:02:42.310> click<00:02:42.340> done<00:02:43.150> we're<00:02:43.300> going<00:02:43.420> to

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
going to right click done we're going to

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.440 
going to right click done we're going to
zoom<00:02:43.660> out<00:02:43.780> right<00:02:44.110> click<00:02:44.350> done<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.450> we're

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
zoom out right click done and we're

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.670 
zoom out right click done and we're
going<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:46.630> go<00:02:46.750> ahead<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.380> select<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.220> mirror

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
going to go ahead and select a mirror

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.190 
going to go ahead and select a mirror
now<00:02:50.700> there's<00:02:51.700> an<00:02:51.850> interesting<00:02:51.970> thing<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:52.600> if<00:02:52.870> I

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
now there's an interesting thing I if I

now there's an interesting thing I if I
go<00:02:53.380> ahead<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.860> can<00:02:54.340> select<00:02:54.550> all<00:02:54.850> these

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
go ahead and I can select all these

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.550 
go ahead and I can select all these
individually<00:02:55.720> but<00:02:55.810> what<00:02:55.959> if<00:02:56.080> I<00:02:56.140> were<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.290> click

notice my pattern inert and rouser bar
is<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.630> is<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.940> work<00:03:49.120> with<00:03:49.150> it's<00:03:49.420> just<00:03:49.600> a<00:03:49.720> little

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
is a is to work with it's just a little

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.780 
is a is to work with it's just a little
bit<00:03:50.080> different<00:03:50.500> than<00:03:50.680> other<00:03:50.890> things<00:03:51.220> in<00:03:51.519> your

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
bit different than other things in your

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.949 
bit different than other things in your
in<00:03:52.030> your<00:03:52.090> piece<00:03:53.019> notice<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:53.680> can't<00:03:54.959> notice

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
in your piece notice that I can't notice

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.199 
in your piece notice that I can't notice
that<00:03:56.080> I<00:03:56.140> can't<00:03:56.410> move<00:03:56.620> these<00:03:56.830> out<00:03:57.040> ok<00:03:57.880> so<00:03:57.940> the

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
that I can't move these out ok so the

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.640 
that I can't move these out ok so the
pattern<00:03:58.600> itself<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.230> is<00:03:59.500> stationary<00:04:01.170> ok<00:04:02.170> so

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
pattern itself is is stationary ok so

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.949 
pattern itself is is stationary ok so
that's<00:04:03.280> your<00:04:03.430> assignment<00:04:03.670> go<00:04:04.060> ahead<00:04:04.330> and<00:04:04.600> use

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
that's your assignment go ahead and use

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.350 
that's your assignment go ahead and use
the<00:04:05.110> pattern<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.709> copy<00:04:06.010> features<00:04:06.489> and<00:04:06.730> when

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
the pattern and copy features and when

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:15.490 
the pattern and copy features and when
you're<00:04:07.480> done
