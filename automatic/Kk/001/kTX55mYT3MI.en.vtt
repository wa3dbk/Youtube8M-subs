00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:15.890
 I'm really dirty now 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:20.189
 Dirty as bad I've never caught a cold 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.869
 I come degree from his nudes's her 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.890
 have participated in a small expedition 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:30.210
 at the arctic expedition it is actually 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.680
 So people the earth is flat and now 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.920
 all the all-important question 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.640
 Of course, how could he do that? 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.430
 Afford 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.260
 yes because sun arctic expedition is 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.059
 already disproportionately expensive that is 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.690
 really good for what you leave there 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.579
 must and indeed back to the very short 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.140
 future almost back into the future 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.680
 So past is in mine 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.590
 Of course, the past completely 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.390
 especially interested and it is so 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.480
 that very close and short 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.990
 I was model yes I am really model 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.470
 No joke for now 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.400
 a well-known voice of god modelabels 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.049
 they say yes I am, I'm almost looking 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.729
 I ran 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.590
 actually run over the catwalk 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.659
 So a live performance live 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:33.509
 performance so no photoshop snaps 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:36.840
 snaps fake here short photo shoot and 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.189
 I am then these stories 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.900
 run and have really fat 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.869
 Reibach made really good money 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.970
 No joke people deserve now 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.780
 but then the whole thing has changed 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.820
 done relatively quickly abruptly abruptly 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.740
 because I got a few problems with the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.390
 got justice with the authorities 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.979
 was I want to describe it very briefly 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.380
 In the evening you have me on one 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.570
 silver tray me so funny 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.170

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.799
 orange juice woltmann to offer me there 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.180
 measure up 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.079
 and there is just the back pipe for me 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.079

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.170
 I'm not feeling well and I'm this 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.970
 whistle slipped and certainly 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.440
 later on the revier at the station yes 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.300
 at the police department 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.160
 Someone told me to go there 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.830
 Not only do I sell my body 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.350
 Should do something up here as well 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.720
 So the keyword intelligence 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.180
 the most intelligent person in the world is yes 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.650
 this stephen hawkins and maybe 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.500
 has noticed that only at this 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.840

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.270
 spoken or his robot voice has 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.730
 just keep talking and ask 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.170
 Of course I already 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.330

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.400

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.620
 who continued to talk for him and 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.920

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.860
 allowed to take 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.239

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:06.519
 year market sun in warmer climes 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.470
 warmer places to travel 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.660
 one must not neck and was eliminated 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.230
