 but actually we have to go back to that 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.930
 phase because what happens once you 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.850
 are surprised you come there freely 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.300

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.439
 prefer to know the value you don't care 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.689
