00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.529
 we have days that we continue in this 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.819
 campaign but I told them at the beginning 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.410
 I have a very good news, sir 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.219
 director please for the red team 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.400
 very good news for you the lord 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.400
 director 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:22.180
 for this team the yellow francisco 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:25.710
 Rodriguez at a moment said the women 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.779
 of the red team do not have a level 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.710
 enough for the competition the team 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:36.160
 red has been slowly gone 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:40.290
 removing each one of its elements from 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.440
 production has decided to match 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.539
 to 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.539
 leave the teams at the same level 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.989
 to a yellow team competitor 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.270
 Red 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.300
 ah 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.160
 and I want to know what this team thinks 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.680
 because today they are leaving a 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.810
 competitor to the red team 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.880
 what do you think of what you just reported 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.850
 when insular today they lose a member 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.830
 from their ranks nothing I think that place to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.420
 doubt is something very scary mediocre because 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.610
 by our effort all the reds have 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.900
 has been decreasing and instead of rewarding us 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.370
 to us who do take us out 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.040
 competitor I think that's not something that 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.369
 be ethical good that does not leave for the other 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.369
 side 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.350
 what do you mean 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.500
 the production may never be wrong 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.509
 never and is wrong a little bit 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.399
 in putting together the equipment and put the two 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.439
 two-time champions on the other side so it's a 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.939
 good way to invent there an error 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.020
 federico so do not see it so unfair 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.020
 I'm pulling all these days 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.450
 with the yellow team who will be the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.180
 member who is going one who did the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.670
 critical formula psico rodríguez one was 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.270
 francisco rodríguez I want to know 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.210
 francisco if a man should arrive 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.859
 or if a woman arrives it will be fine 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.860
 received in this team will follow the 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.840
 fights not sure we need that 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.360
 we need an injection no air 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.010
 new energy and if I look for the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.660
 side of yellow team those hard 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.430
 competitors both men and women 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.870
 yes whoever the team comes 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.849
 we 're going to stop it with arms 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.959
 open and win from today starts at 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.459
 write a new story the team 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.580
 red although I want to ask a question 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.430
 before that young editor of journalism 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.980
 that a country needs a little question 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.670
 understand if he came to Cáceres Cáceres 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.980
 from the yellow team to the red team you 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.140
 you tell me you would come to love the team 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.480
 red would come love 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.980
 it would be complicated with carlos cáceres 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.030
 participate to suffer it being you 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.380
 captain of the yellow team of this 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.630
 I'm in charge of the team 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.330
 say for this change to integrate it into 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.840
 the charter team 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.340
 Pancho said we need an injection in 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.170
 their problems and they do not have equipment 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.270
 and people leave the red team because 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.490
 we cast them they have nothing 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.620
 seeing is a problem if we are a 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.070
 good solid team and we keep winning 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.980
 it's our merit the ladies hockey and 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:19.260
 Gentlemen let's know who will be 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.709
 the yellow team participant who 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.430
 it goes to the instance of the other time to 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:30.239
 red team I want to tell you already 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.260
 it is not man of the yellow team of 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.030
 the woman 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.530
 it can be a telescope 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:44.350
 gallardo fernando acevedo reads lippi 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:48.050
 carla cáceres the result I already have 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.690
 and the competitor who stops dressing 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.630
 the front of the yellow team and it's going to 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.960
 compete he would say himself to the red team 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.960
 is 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.760
 Miss 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.799
 fernando gallardo on the way back 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.510
 impressions of what happens with fernando 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.640

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.640
