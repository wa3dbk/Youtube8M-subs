00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 beautiful girl as always gianpi speaks 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.549
 today I returned with a temporary 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.589
 of my series on photography you have 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.179
 really required so many is 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.740
 like the one that arose already immediately 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.240
 I like to leave a nice one now 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.219
 we can start with today's topic 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.049
 which are the shutter speeds 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.789
 then to talk about shutter speed 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.490
 we must introduce the concept of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.109
 exposure what is this ugly 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.789
 word then you know when 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.010
 take that you hear that noise it makes 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.330
 click chuck cook in short how you want it 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.699
 call well that is yours 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.840
 shutter that opens and closes one 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.719
 sort of curtain behind it 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.059
 to the goal that precisely regulates when 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.829
 the light passes and when we do not say 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.540
 that like a door that is present naked 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.770
 like a rolling shutter that goes up and down maybe 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.829
 the metaphor of the rolling shutter and more 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.200
 then corrected the exposure time 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.239
 then first you need to see in 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.190
 what a situation we are if we are for 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.320
 example in the midday sun is 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.440
 recommended to get a fast time 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.850
 how made a 125 after there also depends 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.160
 from the goal we have on anyway 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.350
 in a situation of strong light once 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.789
 fast is required precisely as if 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.680
 we leave the shutter open for 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.590
 too long our photo will come 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.810
 burnt very clear and probably not 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.240
 then you will see nothing in those cases 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.250
 you need to reduce the shutter speed 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.979
 putting it very fast precisely if 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.000
 instead we are in conditions of pitch darkness 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.189
 it is then necessary to stretch the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.009
 shutter speed so maybe it's night 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.420
 it's night time, you have to put a second one 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.250
 always depends on the situation I am 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.680
 speaking for example if you know background and 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.470
 let's take a second, however, there is a 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.079
 slight problem I don't know if 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.610
 have you ever noticed or run into 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.439
 this problem if photographed and I think 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.320
 yes, but very often ours 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.350
 photos are moved there are strange 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.759
 trails that people use to do things 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.130
 but artists who need to do one 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.439
 distinction between artistic blur is moved 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.299
 because the artistic blur is wanted 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.310
 in short, there is the photographer who chooses to 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.140
 take a picture to give a precise picture 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.729
 meaning is not what one wanted 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.530
 takes a still photo and shakes his hand 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.420
 because there is a second exposure 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.320
 obviously the camera records every 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.790
 small 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.310
 for what there are easels 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.100
 and the photo is moved how to avoid 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.010
 this thing if we have one 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.510
 poor light or light condition 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.070
 let's open the diaphragm like I told you 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.830
 in the last episode are you have seen 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.870
 went to see or lengthen the time 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.550
 all of a sudden all are done e 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.280
 two things together then first of all 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.230
 if we have to adjust the shifted times the 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.080
 ring of your room or the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.600
 selector on s indicating speed why 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.910
 it is not true that beautiful photos are made 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.860
 only in manual, not in iron for a case 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.690
 because to master a car 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.970
 it takes a lot of photographic and manual work 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.010
 lots of experience and very often you have 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.020
 better results using others 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.550
 functions that are given to you so you know 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.070
 which is about to open the opening of 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.870
 diaphragm and knows that it's going to speed for 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.610
 the shutter speed p for 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.290
 program that is practically 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.870
 automatic and manual are modes that 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.910
 should be used depending on the types of 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.670
 situation therefore a general rule 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.260
 now to try not to take pictures 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.220
 moves that in the end is what we do 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.959
 interest 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.320
 it is generally recommended to use 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.820
 a time that is more or less equal to 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.370
 focal length of the lens that 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.370
 we are therefore using if we mount a 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.070
 50 mm it is advisable to use a 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.840
 60th time to stop 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.390
 what we are photographing them 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.910
 a person or a building if obviously 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.920
 we talk about cars or trucks that go 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.620
 200 then the speech changes must 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.570
 speed up time 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.810
 if instead we took a telephoto lens 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.780
 from 300 mm we can not use a 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.950
 sixtieth but we must by force 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.230
 speed up the shutter speed because 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.790
 being longer the focal length is more 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.709
 risk of hand vibration e 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.540
 so obviously a time like a 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.480
 60th is not enough because we have a 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.220
 300 mm maybe we have to use a 250 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.560
 in short, we have to be more or less 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.390
 around the focal value always 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.430
 precisely considering what we are 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.989
 that is, taking a firm thing is fine if 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.180
 we have to photograph a horse that 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.430
 a car runs a person one 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.760
 bicycle must necessarily speed up 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.280
 then there are some techniques which 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.600
 will have to offer 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.090
 removed artistic there are some 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.940
 techniques that can be used 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.650
 with times such as panning 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.660
 what is the clothes I do not know if you have ever seen 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.120
 those photos where there is for example a 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.250
 cyclist firm, that is, stopped more or less 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.500
 still and the background behind him all 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.720
 a trail all moved as you do this 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.490
 what then very simply yes 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.740
 chooses not to use a time 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.750
 very fast to freeze everything but 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.639
 only marginally that 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.040
 that we want to achieve as a subject 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.110
 so if a cyclist is moving 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.870
 we put a long time not extremely 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.820
 fast the right to keep him and 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.230
 we follow it in the movement then sum 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.730
 is passing cyclist we keep a 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.760
 time not too fast 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.110
 we take it and follow it if we succeed 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.870
 it's not a very easy thing 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.310
 a more or less firm cyclist will come, that is 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.810
 his face will be known yes 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.940
 they will recognize the details of his 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.440
 clothes and the background will be a whole scene 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.169
 in short, this was an example of a blur 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.050
 artistic that many people choose to 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:12.139
 do now we have to analyze another 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.120
 small problem we talked about photos 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.300
 in the dark and I told you that I have 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.340
 increased the diaphragm or stretched 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.140
 the shutter speed well or you have a 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.850
 easel, however, or you can't 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.260
 do this because if I told you 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.210
 first put a second freehand 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.919
 take off your head to shoot me 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.410
 you need to force a tripod on which 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.419
 room square and taken 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.550
 there are, however, two ways to contrast the 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.500
 moved when it is dark and we are alone with the 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.140
 our hands without this stand today 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.270
 I will tell you about one of these two others 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.460
 it's not that iso what is iso 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.590
 then the face is the sensitivity to 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.390
 our room light I don't know if you have 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.550
 never noticed that little writer you see 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.070
 inside 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.820
 in the viewfinder, however, the menus are written 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:57.250
 iso iso 100 200 300 400 500 1000 2000 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.900
 up to what the car pulls what 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.250
 the face is precisely the sensitivity to 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.380
 light therefore if we are in a situation 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.240
 of pitch black and we realize that the 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.970
 Our ISO 100 machine allows us to 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.270
 take just a second the thing most 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.250
 normal to do is raise the iso then 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.650
 we arrive at values ​​that perhaps are of 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.800
 thousand and in this way we put the 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.810
 light sensitivity of the room e 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.520
 it also automatically increases the time 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.230
 click that the machine allows us 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.760
 to use then maybe if before a 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.100
 iso 100 we had a second 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.320
 now the dreams we have a penny e 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.180
 so we can take pictures by hand 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.680
 free and this we say one of the two 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.570
 methods I was talking about for you 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.030
 counter the blur in situations of 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.760
 July, however, there is a problem that the 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.460
 problem is that the ISO introduce 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.440
 noise in the picture noise is a term 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.770
 photographic that indicates the grain 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.870
 which is present in your image 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.700
 of course it can be reduced with programs like 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.310
 photoshop as a lightroom 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.350
 but what is better if it is not there 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.810
 to keep it low then the noise is 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:01.090
 practically absent at ISO values 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.430
 low then 100 200 as you go 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.740
 increase the face increases the noise 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.750
 this also depends on the quality of the 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.550
 your room if you have a full frame 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.130
 for example that has a very sensor 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.320
 great even at very high ISO 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.420
 you will have a noise that is still contained 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.590
 while if you have an entry level oh fuck 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:22.090
 I know a compact one is already there is a great one 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.950
 problem because the sensor is a lot 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.630
 small if you pull the ISO already a thousand 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.700
 you get a picture that you don't 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.569
 can see by how much it is grainy 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.300
 so here 

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:34.580
 use them sparingly because they can 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.009
 backfire on you anyway 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.649

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:42.379

00:07:39.649 --> 00:07:44.389
 shutter release iso i hope you do 

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:45.949

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:47.990

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:49.699
