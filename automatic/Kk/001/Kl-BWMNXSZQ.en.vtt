00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.060
Okay, so you want to clean your brushes.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.190
There's a couple of different ways.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.550
I'm going to first use a professional brush
cleaner.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.500
The benefit to the professional brush cleaner
is that it dries quickly so if you want your

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.590
brushes to dry quicker like in between classes
or in between usages then it's the way to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.880
go.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.050
It comes in a spray so that you can spray
your bigger brushes and then simply just wipe

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.050
them.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.710
Now I don't like to use the spray out of this
spray bottle.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.870
So I poor mine into another container because
really all you have to do is dip the brush

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.340
in there, wipe it off and it's perfectly clean.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.690
It's as simple as that.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.810
And you wipe off all of the makeup on there
and you leave it to dry and you can see there's

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.120
no makeup on there, no makeup on there.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.720
That's all there is to it.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:06.040
Just dip and wipe, dip and wipe, dip and wipe
and you'll just let them dry.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.200
There's other brands out there.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.760
My preferable is the Japonesque brush cleaner
as far as professional bush cleaners.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.260
Be careful because some of your professional
brush cleaners can have too much alcohol in

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.420
them and I prefer to have less alcohol.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.140
I'm going to show you how to shampoo the bigger
brushes 'cause that's my preferable way to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.530
clean them.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.400
So when you're cleaning bigger brushes with
your blender cleanser, you can use shampoo

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.400
and conditioner.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.890
A light shampoo first and then conditioner.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.750
But when you're cleaning them with water or
shampooing them, remember you want the water

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.750
to run down the brush.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.750
You do not want to do it like this 'cause
then the water will go up to where the glue

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.750
is.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.780
You want to make sure and get it plenty wet.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.470
Take a little blender cleanser, and it could
be shampoo, a gentle shampoo and conditioner

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.270
and you're just going to work it into it.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.760
And you're going to see the blender cleanser
start to turn colors.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.220
That means you're getting all that product
out of there.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.780
And then simply rinse it down to rinse out
the blender cleanser.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.980
And you can see all that color coming out.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.900
And don't be afraid if you think you need
to do it twice, you can do it again.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.200
Now it's important when you're done to really
squeeze out that water to get rid of it.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.170
Sometimes I'll squeeze it out and then redo
it and then squeeze it out.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.170
And you're going to lay it flat to dry.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.010
Okay, let's just do another one really quickly,
another shape.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.500
Remember getting it wet running the water
down the brush.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.260
Putting a little cleanser, working that cleanser
into the brush.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.230
You'll see the cleanser starting to turn colors.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:01.210
And then you're going to work it, rinsing
it out of your hands.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.590
Squeeze it, I'll rinse a little bit more.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.330
Rinsing it doing that same motion.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.330
Squeeze it.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:20.990
The tighter you squeeze it the better it's
going to dry 'cause then it will dry in it's

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.990
natural shape.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.990
And then you simply lay it to dry.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.989
It's really important to squeeze them tight
to get them in their right shape as they lay

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.300
to dry.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:36.569
Tighter that you squeeze them together, the
more tightly the bristles will dry together.

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:37.830
How often should you clean them?

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.870
Your big fluffy brushes like powder, cheek,
mineral powder foundation all those should

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.130
be cleansed please, once a week.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.580
I'll settle for twice a month.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.349
Worst case scenario, once a month.

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.019
Your eye brushes, as long as you don't cross
contaminate depth level, you have a highlight

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.510
brush always, a midtone brush always, a contour
brush always, you could get away with twice

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.739
a week or once a week.

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.940
Please twice.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:12.269
I would prefer after each use but you know
it's up to you.
