want to go towards more of just shorter
units<00:04:44.620> this<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:44.860> think<00:04:45.040> this<00:04:45.160> is<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.370> cute<00:04:45.639> one

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
units this I think this is the cute one

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.760 
units this I think this is the cute one
it's<00:04:45.970> not<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.270> shortest<00:04:46.720> but<00:04:46.990> it's<00:04:47.200> you<00:04:47.740> know

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
it's not the shortest but it's you know

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.680 
it's not the shortest but it's you know
it's<00:04:48.190> not<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.580> longest<00:04:48.790> either<00:04:49.210> it's<00:04:49.389> kind<00:04:49.600> of

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
it's not the longest either it's kind of

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.200 
it's not the longest either it's kind of
like<00:04:49.900> right<00:04:50.200> here<00:04:50.350> it's<00:04:50.500> my<00:04:50.970> drastically<00:04:51.970> low

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
like right here it's my drastically low

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.260 
like right here it's my drastically low
so<00:04:52.660> I<00:04:52.690> think<00:04:52.810> this<00:04:53.080> would<00:04:53.260> be<00:04:53.320> great<00:04:53.650> for<00:04:53.889> arm

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.210 
so I think this would be great for arm
for<00:04:55.270> this<00:04:55.450> time<00:04:55.660> of<00:04:55.810> year<00:04:56.020> as<00:04:56.200> well<00:04:56.470> and<00:04:56.740> this
