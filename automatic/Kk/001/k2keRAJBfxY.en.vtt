00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.509 
right at four feet to the top of the
edge<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.499> I<00:01:00.530> could<00:01:00.739> use<00:01:00.859> a<00:01:00.890> regular<00:01:01.100> sheet<00:01:01.429> of

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
edge so I could use a regular sheet of

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.630 
edge so I could use a regular sheet of
plywood<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.440> use<00:01:03.440> that<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.010> rip<00:01:04.430> it<00:01:04.580> down<00:01:04.750> so

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
plywood and use that and rip it down so

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.969 
plywood and use that and rip it down so
then<00:01:07.640> I<00:01:07.670> gained<00:01:08.210> another<00:01:08.540> four<00:01:09.140> inches<00:01:09.560> with

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
then I gained another four inches with

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.749 
then I gained another four inches with
the<00:01:10.840> bottom<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.920> casters<00:01:13.430> on<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.670> bottom

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
the bottom and the casters on the bottom

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.179 
the bottom and the casters on the bottom
so<00:01:14.509> it<00:01:14.659> looks<00:01:14.840> something<00:01:15.049> similar<00:01:15.470> to<00:01:15.649> this<00:01:15.860> on

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.120 
so it looks something similar to this on
the<00:01:16.700> bottom<00:01:17.060> of<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:18.380> case<00:01:18.590> with<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:18.950> wheels

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
into a seat with the little crate type

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.009 
into a seat with the little crate type
of<00:03:42.269> a<00:03:42.299> step<00:03:43.200> stool<00:03:43.410> type<00:03:43.680> seating<00:03:44.720> inside<00:03:45.720> the

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
of a step stool type seating inside the

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.259 
of a step stool type seating inside the
lid<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.680> it's<00:03:46.830> going<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.040> look<00:03:47.190> like<00:03:47.250> an<00:03:47.670> anvil

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
lid so it's going to look like an anvil

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.180 
lid so it's going to look like an anvil
lid<00:03:48.810> but<00:03:49.080> it's<00:03:49.200> going<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.500> be<00:03:49.620> actually<00:03:49.739> a

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
lid but it's going to be actually a

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.460 
lid but it's going to be actually a
little<00:03:50.220> metal<00:03:51.120> seat<00:03:51.570> underneath<00:03:52.049> it<00:03:52.170> really

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
little metal seat underneath it really

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.800 
little metal seat underneath it really
nice<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.830> sturdy<00:03:53.070> built<00:03:53.940> for<00:03:54.209> it<00:03:54.299> holds<00:03:54.540> up<00:03:54.660> to

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
nice and sturdy built for it holds up to

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.539 
nice and sturdy built for it holds up to
almost<00:03:55.110> 300<00:03:55.590> pounds<00:03:55.709> so<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.220> think<00:03:56.370> we'll<00:03:56.519> be

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
almost 300 pounds so I think we'll be

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.000 
almost 300 pounds so I think we'll be
good<00:03:56.640> Terra<00:03:57.140> so<00:03:58.140> two<00:03:58.290> or<00:03:58.380> three<00:03:58.530> people<00:03:58.709> can

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
good Terra so two or three people can

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.590 
good Terra so two or three people can
sit<00:03:59.220> on<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.400> chair<00:03:59.430> and<00:04:00.090> actually<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.540> a

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
sit on the chair and actually and a

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.750 
sit on the chair and actually and a
couple<00:04:00.750> people<00:04:01.110> behind<00:04:01.380> at<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.280> three<00:04:02.580> foot

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
couple people behind at a three foot

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.830 
couple people behind at a three foot
distance<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.330> looks<00:04:03.480> like<00:04:03.600> we're<00:04:03.750> getting

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
distance it looks like we're getting

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.640 
distance it looks like we're getting
plenty<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.850> picture<00:04:05.880> Faceman<00:04:06.720> facing<00:04:07.530> the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
plenty of picture Faceman facing the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.940 
plenty of picture Faceman facing the
camera<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:09.110> able<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.140> put<00:04:10.380> two<00:04:10.500> people<00:04:10.680> in<00:04:10.860> the

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
camera and able to put two people in the

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.039 
camera and able to put two people in the
frame<00:04:11.160> or<00:04:11.970> more<00:04:12.299> on<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.450> back<00:04:12.600> so<00:04:12.900> I<00:04:12.930> think

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
frame or more on the back so I think

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.110 
frame or more on the back so I think
we're<00:04:13.230> good<00:04:13.350> there<00:04:13.500> also<00:04:14.130> if<00:04:14.459> you're<00:04:14.580> tall<00:04:14.820> you

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
we're good there also if you're tall you

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.240 
we're good there also if you're tall you
still<00:04:15.299> have<00:04:15.390> enough<00:04:15.570> Headroom<00:04:16.100> common<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.160> the

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
still have enough Headroom common to the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.860 
still have enough Headroom common to the
screen<00:04:17.579> shot<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.209> it<00:04:18.359> looks<00:04:18.510> pretty<00:04:18.750> good

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
screen shot so it looks pretty good

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.020 
screen shot so it looks pretty good
there<00:04:19.340> so<00:04:20.479> two<00:04:21.479> feet<00:04:21.690> wide<00:04:21.810> four<00:04:22.590> foot<00:04:22.770> tall

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
there so two feet wide four foot tall

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.219 
there so two feet wide four foot tall
I'm<00:04:24.030> not<00:04:24.180> sure<00:04:24.300> how<00:04:24.419> deep<00:04:24.450> yet<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.900> figure<00:04:25.080> that

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
I'm not sure how deep yet to figure that

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.960 
I'm not sure how deep yet to figure that
out<00:04:25.290> here<00:04:25.470> in<00:04:25.560> a<00:04:25.590> second<00:04:25.919> but<00:04:26.280> that's<00:04:26.700> kind<00:04:26.940> of

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
out here in a second but that's kind of

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.610 
out here in a second but that's kind of
the<00:04:27.030> quickest<00:04:27.479> update<00:04:27.840> I<00:04:27.870> can<00:04:28.050> give<00:04:28.169> you<00:04:28.320> on

like the taller and integrate the you
know<00:04:38.099> you<00:04:38.160> could<00:04:38.430> make<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.699> taller<00:04:38.910> if<00:04:39.060> you're

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
know you could make it taller if you're

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.939 
know you could make it taller if you're
going<00:04:39.240> to<00:04:39.330> stand<00:04:39.539> up<00:04:39.780> if<00:04:40.379> you're<00:04:40.560> going<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:40.740> sit

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
down and you got to angle the computer

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.290 
down and you got to angle the computer
screen<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:43.650> everything<00:04:43.860> else<00:04:44.099> so<00:04:44.909> if<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:45.180> go

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
screen and everything else so if you go

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.700 
screen and everything else so if you go
with<00:04:45.479> a<00:04:45.650> SLR<00:04:46.650> style<00:04:47.520> camera<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:49.199> might<00:04:49.379> have

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
with a SLR style camera you might have

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.020 
with a SLR style camera you might have
to<00:04:49.949> you<00:04:50.039> might<00:04:50.250> be<00:04:50.370> a<00:04:50.400> little<00:04:50.669> bit<00:04:50.759> better<00:04:50.819> off

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
to you might be a little bit better off

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
to you might be a little bit better off
you<00:04:51.150> can<00:04:51.270> put<00:04:51.389> it<00:04:51.479> up<00:04:51.539> a<00:04:51.599> little<00:04:51.690> bit<00:04:51.840> higher

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
you can put it up a little bit higher

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.110 
you can put it up a little bit higher
make<00:04:52.289> your<00:04:52.409> booth<00:04:52.560> taller<00:04:52.830> angle<00:04:53.699> the<00:04:53.789> camera

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
make your booth taller angle the camera

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.659 
make your booth taller angle the camera
down<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.599> then<00:04:54.960> you're<00:04:55.530> good<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.710> go<00:04:55.770> there<00:04:55.830> so

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
down and then you're good to go there so

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.820 
down and then you're good to go there so
something<00:04:57.479> to<00:04:57.539> think<00:04:57.659> about<00:04:57.810> depending<00:04:58.770> on

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
something to think about depending on

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.140 
something to think about depending on
when<00:04:58.979> you're<00:04:59.099> designing<00:04:59.490> your<00:04:59.789> building<00:05:00.060> your

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
when you're designing your building your

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.930 
when you're designing your building your
cabinet<00:05:01.009> SLR<00:05:02.009> versus<00:05:02.750> webcam<00:05:03.750> versus

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
cabinet SLR versus webcam versus

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.570 
cabinet SLR versus webcam versus
built-in<00:05:05.940> screen<00:05:06.300> monitor<00:05:07.050> and<00:05:07.169> screen<00:05:07.580> yeah

built-in screen monitor and screen yeah

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.110 
built-in screen monitor and screen yeah
you<00:05:08.880> know<00:05:09.380> teachers<00:05:10.380> own<00:05:10.500> so<00:05:10.919> I<00:05:11.250> know<00:05:11.639> I<00:05:11.789> think

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
you know teachers own so I know I think

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.219 
you know teachers own so I know I think
one<00:05:12.240> of<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:12.449> manufacturers<00:05:13.050> out<00:05:13.199> there

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
one of the manufacturers out there

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.200 
one of the manufacturers out there
hasn't<00:05:13.530> screen<00:05:14.069> up<00:05:14.250> top<00:05:14.280> but<00:05:14.729> the<00:05:14.819> cameras

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
hasn't screen up top but the cameras

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.140 
hasn't screen up top but the cameras
lower<00:05:15.419> so<00:05:16.229> I<00:05:16.590> like<00:05:16.889> that<00:05:17.099> look<00:05:17.400> with<00:05:18.120> the

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
lower so I like that look with the

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.610 
lower so I like that look with the
screen<00:05:18.569> up<00:05:18.659> a<00:05:18.720> little<00:05:18.900> bit<00:05:18.990> higher<00:05:19.199> but<00:05:19.470> when

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
screen up a little bit higher but when

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.659 
screen up a little bit higher but when
