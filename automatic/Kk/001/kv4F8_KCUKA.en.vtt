00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello everyone welcome to nutrition with 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.230
 taste where we are going to learn to eat 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.820
 healthy and delicious in this video we are going to 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.320
 talk about why there are times that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.179
 we hear that carbohydrates are 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.130
 bad and because other 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.230
 we hear that they are part of a diet 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.570
 healthy with so much information about 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.260
 nutrition in the media there is confusion 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.150
 on certain issues and questions arise 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.960
 frequent as carbohydrates are 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.090
 good or bad in this short video we're going 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.719
 to resolve this doubt with information from 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.730
 the university of Wester we must first 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.460
 clarify that carbohydrates are 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.590
 our main source of energy and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.960
 they play an important role in a diet 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.379
 healthy 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.960
 there are two types of carbohydrates and one 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.470
 it is better than the other the myth of the 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.149
 Bad carbs is based on one type 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.410
 of carbohydrate carbohydrates 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.449
 simple or refined some examples are 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.000
 table sugar juices 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.540
 industrialized white bread rice 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.570
 white potatoes or pasta 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.990
 complex or good carbohydrates like 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.660
 the fruits vegetables whole grains are 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.330
 excellent source of energy and you can 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.750
 eat more of this type without adding 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.399
 so many calories the fiber content of 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.920
 these carbohydrates makes us 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.280
 we feel satisfied and we decrease the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.679
 feeling anxious about eating more 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.140
 serious problem is when we combine the 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.630
 fats and simple carbohydrates by 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.030
 chocolates with caramel example the 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.890
 sweet ifab industrialized cookies 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.100
 the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.780
 and bitumen and many other products or 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.180
 when we consume or add 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.409
 simple carbohydrates by themselves to 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.750
 our diet 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.030
 for example sugary soda juices 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.670
 industrialized or any kind of 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.610
 sugar marshmallows candies and so on 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.440
 these foods cause the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.380
 blood sugar and we produce 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.410
 insulin and insulin makes 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.590
 store the extra calories as 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.989
 fat in the cells in conclusion is 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.630
 most important the type of carbohydrates 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.970
 that the quantity we should enjoy 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.850
 high fiber foods like fruits 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.010
 vegetables and whole grains without abusing 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.959
 the carbohydrates always very many 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.880
