00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.000
 hello to all of you it's nawak 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.880
 and today we are with carbon on 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.119
 is at the gt 10 is we are we are here to 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:31.310
 a little interview so hi carbon 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:32.449
 so we're on the 2nd day how do you see 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.400
 there and before you talk a little bit about your 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.170
 course we will perhaps return to the 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.430
 choice of this team game we saw that 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.230
 jonas it's a little dad of the team 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.940
 still it was him who wanted a little 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:56.620
 how exactly she did this 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:56.620
 preparation of a good quarter of an hour 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.580
 and precisely this owl this 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.780
 composition of how equipped how 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:14.370
 you did it it's done 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:16.170
 naturally to talk about the match of 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.560
 all stars a very beautiful match on 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:39.990
 can rightly say you were motivated 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:41.280
 and all that happened a little bit 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.460
 any case you managed to make us 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.840
 dreaming it's super pretty and just right 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.729
 after you chained the match against 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.350
 the tec is precisely you lost 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.950
 unfortunately I do not know it was maybe 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.950
 to be on the verge of euphoria 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.800
 for some if I'm wrong it's 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.960
 your first European lan have that 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:22.160
 for you no 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.160
 and just that motivates you or not a little 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.560
 you discover a little the city and 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.850
 precisely with this composition you 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.140
 think about going all the way 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.360
 do you think that's going to hold 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.360
 do you want to go super slow 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.600
 any way you are quite a team 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.250
 young I think it can work 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.410
 I saw I say just stopped 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.090
 together and do your best in 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.650
 anyway we hope the best for you 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.060
 on this European manna 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.550
 anyway for some it's your 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.290
 first and so here I leave you a 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.850
 little word of the end if you have any 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.850
 dedications to pass on and serves what 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.740

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.070
