00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:04.819
 we continue the global budget of our shakespeare play for the time being 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:06.730
 two elements that had fun 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.890
 the reader but of course since the power supply 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.940
 raymond bachand sector find it more and more 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.940
 one who are wrong here 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:20.289
 and on the back 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.699
 a united states team raises 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.509
 these five countries fell to the ground on foot 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.509
 to be able to remove the power supply 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.300
 think well that if you go up in a little box in Peru the side 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.710
 behind you have the 13 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.870
 food 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.340
 aqmi fight simply 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.490
 we decided to stop 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.490
 the readers 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.150
 how many French 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.610
 the police 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.610
 Why 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.410
 I lift power supply 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.690
 and you will notice that I have two little things 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.920
 party to the hook hanging ap 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 the first being a date titi site 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.980
 we need solidarities 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.900
 the second half a small power cable 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.310
 river to position themselves 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.500
 we see that the 15th 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.070
 this site here 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.070
 according to the study I will come 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.610
 to the power to finish 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.820
 eclipse 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.820
 my diet 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.870
 it simply allows 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.670
 on the side 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.569
 and here is our diet 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:28.119
 I take advantage 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.119
 to clean it tame situations 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.619
 in different places you take the doubt 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.029
 but these pictures 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.999
 hush 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.429
 hush 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.429
 the study bears no pressure 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.029
 to other colleagues 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:59.839
 notice that I put myself for the expert their behavior 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.559
 we have political marketing policy 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.939
 that I dissociate myself
