00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.560
 relative but I did a lot of 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.599

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.550

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.550
 and that's it I already have the glossybox then 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.660
 I would never understand the dates at 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.579
 glossybox I received the last 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.399

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:09.230
 it just really nice design by the n y 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.360
 I do not know this brand is everything 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.470
 just in fact it's new york so 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.570
 I will try to put you in the picture 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.710
 at the same time as I speak but it's the 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.450
 new york design 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.850
 so we attacked by the products 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.430
 I love the voice orange class design 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.470
 rose relief flock we'll say too much 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.890
 selva and I discover at the same time that 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.590
 you the new one too wants to get 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.909
 name rock the city 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:40.069
 with always the little flyer that 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.229
 I had less already present themselves too 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:46.130
 happy like these I hope it 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.979
 holds so I see some products 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.810
 already people who already give me a can 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.890
 we will start with the dry shampoo a 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.049
 background a touch of brown color 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.359
 so is actually it's a shampoo of 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.229
 the baptist mark that has 5 euros 95 the 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:02.390
 200 milliliters 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.390
 we have fifty minutes you will mark the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.759
 cost price and so it brings 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.069
 fresh volume without any trace 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.610
 white and pussies hair 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.590
 light browns can use it in 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.099
 any circumstance finally you go 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.750
 against spacing satan mixes so in 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.060
 night is not going to color the hair 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.769
 I thought it colored hair 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.480
 no at all it will not color the shapes 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.120
 and it's going to clean it's for the hair 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.379
 brown but as they say the chestnut 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.360
 clear can still use it 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.709
 so having I had already tested a 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.200
 Baptist shampoo is good but me 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.329
 I do not like that kind of shampoo 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.530
 that's right - honda do not have 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.880
 really happened had failed when we 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.500
 really had ice cream but that 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.400
 do not happen to me human so that's first 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.980
 product that we receive 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.340
 after that I also have a product of 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.230
 the brand 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.099
 March is the mascara black moon no 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.470
 but it's a joke 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.030
 oh no I was scared I thought 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.050
 it was a red mascara to see the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.550
 design like that red 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.290
 so this is a mascara of the brand nars 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.000
 I never tested the masquerades the 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.610
 mark nars i'm so happy so 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.180

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.680
 have exactly 3 milliliters always 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.860
 would mark the private the cost price 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.420

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.580

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.769

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.049

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.410

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.209

 macadamia oil enters and a 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.920
 concentration of targeted assets at
