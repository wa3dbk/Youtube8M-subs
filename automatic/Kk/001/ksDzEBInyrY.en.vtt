is<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.729> when<00:01:45.149> you're<00:01:45.240> driving<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
is that when you're driving a

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.660 
is that when you're driving a
convertible<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.380> always<00:01:46.590> just<00:01:46.950> feels<00:01:47.189> faster

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
convertible it always just feels faster

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.160 
convertible it always just feels faster
you<00:01:47.790> could<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.060> doing<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.329> hundred<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
you could be doing a hundred on the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.170 
you could be doing a hundred on the
highway<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.770> there'd<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.340> train<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.939> cars

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
highway and there'd be a train of cars

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.789 
highway and there'd be a train of cars
behind<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.750> but<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> wind<00:01:52.229> would<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.470> put<00:01:52.649> on

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
behind you but the wind would be put on

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.679 
behind you but the wind would be put on
you'd<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.220> hard<00:01:53.460> fly<00:01:53.850> egg<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.329> absolutely

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
you'd be like hard fly egg of absolutely

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.719 
you'd be like hard fly egg of absolutely
fly<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.229> why<00:01:55.409> people<00:01:55.590> still<00:01:56.009> buy<00:01:56.189> em<00:01:56.430> jeez

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
something else that's quick on this I

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.620 
something else that's quick on this I
think<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.969> quite<00:02:00.119> impressive<00:02:00.329> but

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
think this is quite impressive but

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.090 
think this is quite impressive but
before<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.409> has<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.649> very

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
before we do that it has this very

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.039 
before we do that it has this very
clever<00:02:02.369> system<00:02:02.670> yeah<00:02:03.000> these<00:02:03.149> are<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.719> cool

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
clever system yeah these are so cool

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.990 
clever system yeah these are so cool
hello<00:02:04.259> look<00:02:04.500> at<00:02:04.649> these<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.159> these<00:02:05.549> are<00:02:05.759> wind

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
hello look at these so these are wind

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.580 
hello look at these so these are wind
deflectors<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:06.899> love<00:02:07.229> how<00:02:07.439> they're

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
deflectors and I just love how they're

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.800 
deflectors and I just love how they're
integrated<00:02:07.890> into<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.670> safety<00:02:08.910> roll<00:02:09.330> bar<00:02:09.599> yeah

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
integrated into the safety roll bar yeah

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.360 
integrated into the safety roll bar yeah
just<00:02:10.020> flick<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.289> over<00:02:10.500> like<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.129> it

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
just flick it over like that and it

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
just flick it over like that and it
stops<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.790> wind

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
stops the wind

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.330 
stops the wind
back<00:02:12.810> into<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.260> cabin<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.770> flapping<00:02:14.220> you're

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
back into the cabin and flapping you're

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.520 
back into the cabin and flapping you're
hearing<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:15.300> car<00:02:15.510> plays<00:02:15.720> havoc<00:02:16.050> with<00:02:16.230> my

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
hearing of this car plays havoc with my

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.449 
hearing of this car plays havoc with my
hair<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.830> don't<00:02:17.190> know<00:02:18.440> but<00:02:19.440> anyway<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:20.100> has<00:02:20.280> a

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
hair I don't know but anyway that has a

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.850 
hair I don't know but anyway that has a
very<00:02:20.880> clever<00:02:21.420> ruthless<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:22.230> sure<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.530> will<00:02:22.740> now

give a full technical explanation of
hardware<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.110> okay<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.040> here<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.400> go<00:02:26.490> I'm

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
hardware this okay so here we go I'm

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.340 
hardware this okay so here we go I'm
gonna<00:02:26.700> do<00:02:26.880> my<00:02:27.030> best<00:02:27.060> not<00:02:27.480> someone<00:02:28.020> much

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
gonna do my best not someone much

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.930 
gonna do my best not someone much
cleverer<00:02:28.830> than<00:02:28.890> me<00:02:29.220> work<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.580> out<00:02:29.730> what

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
cleverer than me work this out what

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.210 
cleverer than me work this out what
happens<00:02:30.270> is<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.660> but<00:02:30.930> opens<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:32.070> then

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
happens is that but opens and then

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.220 
happens is that but opens and then
there's<00:02:32.400> plastic<00:02:33.030> flap<00:02:33.360> moves<00:02:33.840> out<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.110> the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
there's plastic flap moves out of the

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.690 
there's plastic flap moves out of the
way<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.770> then<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.580> whole<00:02:35.910> glass<00:02:36.570> bit<00:02:37.020> sort<00:02:37.620> of

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
way and then the whole glass bit sort of

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.550 
way and then the whole glass bit sort of
flops<00:02:38.700> over<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.690> puts<00:02:40.020> itself<00:02:40.320> together

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
flops over and and puts itself together

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.520 
flops over and and puts itself together
while<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.250> moving<00:02:41.489> look<00:02:41.910> at<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.330> Hey<00:02:43.140> and

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
while it's moving look at that Hey and

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.590 
while it's moving look at that Hey and
then<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.860> but<00:02:44.100> closes<00:02:44.520> over<00:02:44.730> there<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.150> then

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
then that but closes over there and then

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.860 
then that but closes over there and then
it's<00:02:45.900> done<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.670> think<00:02:47.670> that's<00:02:47.880> seriously<00:02:48.690> cool

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
it's done I think that's seriously cool

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.729 
it's done I think that's seriously cool
