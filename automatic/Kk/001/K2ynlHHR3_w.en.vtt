possibly be worth up to 4000 pounds well
some<00:02:22.260> people<00:02:22.620> seem<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.040> think<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.459> was<00:02:23.610> worth

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
some people seem to think it was worth

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.630 
some people seem to think it was worth
every<00:02:24.030> penny

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
every penny

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.309 
every penny
best<00:02:26.640> part<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.360> feeling<00:02:27.569> is<00:02:27.840> when<00:02:28.079> you<00:02:28.170> like

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
best part of feeling is when you like

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.080 
best part of feeling is when you like
going<00:02:28.620> down<00:02:28.799> there's<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.160> main<00:02:29.459> straight<00:02:29.819> and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
going down there's the main straight and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.030 
going down there's the main straight and
you'd<00:02:30.599> go<00:02:30.900> along<00:02:31.049> eat<00:02:31.380> in<00:02:31.530> about<00:02:31.739> hundred<00:02:31.950> and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
you'd go along eat in about hundred and

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.390 
you'd go along eat in about hundred and
445<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:34.319> go<00:02:34.470> under<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.829> bridge<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.310> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
445 and you go under the bridge and the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.979 
445 and you go under the bridge and the
front<00:02:35.730> wheel<00:02:35.879> steps<00:02:36.150> away<00:02:36.299> because<00:02:36.599> it<00:02:36.720> dips

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
front wheel steps away because it dips

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.050 
front wheel steps away because it dips
and<00:02:37.290> you're<00:02:37.799> just<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.250> light<00:02:38.519> but<00:02:38.549> you<00:02:38.790> know

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
and you're just so light but you know

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.800 
and you're just so light but you know
you're<00:02:39.299> drawing<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:39.780> for<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:41.540> stunning<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
you're drawing in for it so stunning the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.840 
you're drawing in for it so stunning the
way<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.109> comes<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.709> then<00:02:44.130> you're<00:02:44.489> thinking

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
way that comes and then you're thinking

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.370 
way that comes and then you're thinking
about<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.209> feeling<00:02:45.780> all<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.230> then

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
about that feeling all that and then

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.479 
about that feeling all that and then
he's<00:02:46.500> put<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.739> front<00:02:46.859> wheel<00:02:46.950> down<00:02:47.190> but<00:02:47.370> it's

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
he's put the front wheel down but it's

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.620 
he's put the front wheel down but it's
going<00:02:47.639> like<00:02:47.819> that<00:02:47.880> because<00:02:48.239> obviously<00:02:48.389> it's

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
going like that because obviously it's

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.150 
going like that because obviously it's
coming<00:02:48.870> from<00:02:48.959> here<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.200> it's<00:02:49.500> biting<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.950> find

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
coming from here so it's biting to find

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.129 
coming from here so it's biting to find
a<00:02:50.250> spot<00:02:50.519> you're<00:02:51.329> thinking<00:02:51.600> about<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.959> and

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
a spot you're thinking about that and

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.180 
a spot you're thinking about that and
he's<00:02:52.290> suddenly<00:02:52.470> breaking<00:02:52.829> and<00:02:53.100> you're

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
he's suddenly breaking and you're

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.309 
he's suddenly breaking and you're
breaking<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.670> hard<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.269> you're<00:02:54.480> holding<00:02:55.019> on

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
breaking so hard that you're holding on

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.390 
breaking so hard that you're holding on
where<00:02:55.470> all<00:02:55.560> your<00:02:55.739> life<00:02:55.859> trying<00:02:56.190> not<00:02:56.340> to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
where all your life trying not to
