00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.910
 mustache we do the next step that is 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.680
 that of jumping over here we are going to enter 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.110
 our dog jumping to make his 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.450
 legs can be strengthened and first 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.760
 what we are going to get is love from 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.069

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.129
 unicorn ham that is half me but 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.590
 here we have this very rare special for 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.870

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.849
 get our dog friends 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.489
 and here we are in a trickle and have to 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.290
 jump to be able to practice the highs to 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.140

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.049

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.790
 up by the vagina 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.370

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.879
 you know very delicious for these canines 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:15.260
 since he was well trained we caught 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:20.629
 the ham and leave it without food or mode 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.629
 nobody needs your reward 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.359

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.040
 2 conversion to your dog and very good 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.389

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.950

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.410

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.830

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.690
