00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
I have a feeling that is probably to go

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.800 
I have a feeling that is probably to go
to<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.250> few<00:01:35.460> air<00:01:35.580> shows<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.180> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.510> go<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
to a few air shows is going to go on the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870 
to a few air shows is going to go on the
road<00:01:36.990> as<00:01:37.140> far<00:01:37.290> as<00:01:37.440> our<00:01:37.560> cross<00:01:37.770> countries<00:01:38.190> and<00:01:38.550> I

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
road as far as our cross countries and I

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.550 
road as far as our cross countries and I
think<00:01:38.910> it's<00:01:39.150> going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.300> be<00:01:39.390> showing<00:01:39.600> off<00:01:39.750> as

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
think it's going to be showing off as

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.470 
think it's going to be showing off as
much<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:40.830> possible<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.760> have<00:01:41.910> a<00:01:41.970> whole<00:01:42.240> plane

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
much as possible to have a whole plane

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.760 
much as possible to have a whole plane
set<00:01:42.720> up<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.380> something<00:01:43.560> that's

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
set up like this is something that's

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.770 
set up like this is something that's
it's<00:01:44.550> fun<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.910> be<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> part<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.660> it<00:01:45.720> if

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
