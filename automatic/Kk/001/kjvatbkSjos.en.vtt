 fashionable i am in the forest that is parks and 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.750

 and comments to one of my past 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.120
 video where I talked about how to read on 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.520
 foreign language and including 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.140
 said he was letting urbanization in 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.090
 given language and then you will want it 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.490

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.570
 just as I have decided to choose is not the most such 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.400
 famous screen versions which 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.500
 most people do i like too 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.870
 fight club and natural prestige 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.700
 perfumer girl became fitting on a 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.530
 just pick such pains a little 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.780
 known fixes 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.780
 leads and call them 6 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.010
 and goat two film versions of the same 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.760
 at home on this novel emma jane austin and and 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.100
 turned green 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.770
 and now he is my favorite taste 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.170
 add so here the plot sound with what u 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.390
 young and test short emma and here together 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.280
 with her father and barely exposed she 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.680
 finds such a thing becomes 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.630
 matchmaker and starts to all your friends and 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.860
 familiar look for the format we are now 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.510
 nobody knows his whole life 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.910
 intervenes intervenes 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.240
 then it turns out a lot of comic 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.340
 situations so here is the first conization of this 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.500
 BBC mini-series consists of 3 episodes 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.600
 the main role is played by romola garay 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.390
 it's great because 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.150
 the character is very lively and it did not work 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.780
 so annoying stupid stupid 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.479
 you are preparing a stupid but alive sky 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.729
 I don't know, I want to be like that 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.790
 So I think that everyone who read 90 is not 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.080
 should read you will recognize this right 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.450
 duties once need my mind straight 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.899
 the best that has ever been shot in twos 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.370
 wear it was on the screen except one more 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.810
 thing and 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:07.350
 and the second film adaptation of the same house on 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.040
 who can argue with 1 this video 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.110
 it was m we omit it in english 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.200
 Produces by the way in my john is 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.300
 england is in green singing this brother 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.760
 replace with john and wrote we sat down 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.850
 who is there everything in the world lunin and assessment 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.160
 so there its plot is moved to 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.870
 modern twist and already so young 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.240
 modern girl he manages 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.890
 business agency as if they 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.810
 make a documentary about their 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.370
 work and it turns out cool 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.740
 some things because not all 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.210
 characters want to be filmed by nobody 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.870
 why do not you shoot me clean 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.670
 the camera leads did not spend this all in 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.680
 video blog format dont know only that 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.900
 I have been to most video 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.120
 why not right every week I sit with 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.790
 I look forward to when they do not lay out this 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.900
 miserable 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.829
 but alone every week about what it is very 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.829
 bitch clear below 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.490
 and another film adaptation of the same lights green 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.640
 tomatoes in a cafe 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.290
 The film is 91 years old and for a long time I appeared exactly 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.600
 this book and why because it gives me 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.190
 I watched the movie I remember that I was two 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.110
 remembered this year and was going to 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.440
 open and read what is there about 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.600
 drawing is about american yoga and and 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.370
 I do not know something in this novel is 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.090
 magical for me he's like a hundred years 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.980
 loneliness 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.950
 just moved to another location 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.750
 got used and sold in a different flavor but 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.570
 at the same time the structure there seems to be too 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.790
 all these people live their lives somehow 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.750
 intertwined there are funny moments 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.790
 really 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.500
 like this all makes no sense 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.070
 in fact this is the reason 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.860
 that people's lives in general so in real 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.610
 life especially do not carry nick 80 how sad 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.610
 and mind 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.650
 if for some reason, sincerely happy then 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.900
 probably this is the meaning of life to him 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.880
 it seems this book in what sense this idea 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.520
 propaganda that years but when her that 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.580
 What do you know what that is charged to this 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.830
 energy and no not so stupid on petipa 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.130
 oh my God how everything is joyful in the life of one 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:12.090
 it is really philosophical but joyful and 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.090
 gave the pacifier a joyous tune 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.840
 favorite movie called you orlando 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.790
 and shot by it seems this belt they are at home on 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.820
 rapprochement which is so called 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:29.740
 orlando my husband as my life personally 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.170
 the book is important they are very 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.880
 strongly offended there the soul there at all 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.370
 in fact everything revolves around 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.990
 one character and dad sydney you're not 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.830
 you know who it is because he lives very 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.490
 long and fit through different eras and 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.960
 some point even changes the gender and 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:51.770
 you really a surgical sense in 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.090
 me this key character and waiting 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.349
 miracle 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.479
 the main role to help tilda suinton 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.069
 guard unibus for example with gifted 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.080
 It seems cool because coped 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:04.229
 early she plays a man and then 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:08.099
 woman and at the same time he saves androgyne 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:11.009
 personal such state and by the way so 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:13.669
 I will help us cool soundtrack as if 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.740
 would not be very suitable to most there 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.770
 important point is jazz is cut 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.580
 but then when you look and think 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.580
 they took me very much 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:29.960
 and after all the Soviet implementation I do not know you 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.690
 lovers of my points I am a son and all 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.250
 that but I just love it I 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.490
 was able to turn on one 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.400
 writer and about life and you are it was 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:44.480
 would be mine because he is so humorous and 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:48.530
 Flood approximate land and cynical and 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.630
 all the time it's pretty cynical real 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:57.580
 stood out that saved me till it seems 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:06:01.370
 70s movie which is called me and 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.880
 Ivar Kalnins and fashion and left it 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.890
 example 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.810
 young jeremy allen smith is like 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.170
 he is completely sexual with him 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.840
 sense of 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.580
 of such heat and dash the children that if 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.900
 meaning 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.550
 who would have a love affair 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.480
 it would seem banal love 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.440
 triangle 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.100
 basically narration there goes about 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.000
 internal 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.070
 actress who has a fee at the same time 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.090
 she starts a love affair with a young man 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.699
 because they don't know 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.620
 tired with her husband on her rocks boring a lot 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:34.050
 philosophical thoughts in this novel such 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.810
 interesting philosophical thoughts they listen 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.150
 you ace and tells exactly when 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.580
 my talk about what she is on stage 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.919
 and what is she like in life 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.560
 it's not just some degree 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:49.229
 caligari our life sometimes we are on stage and 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.470
 I'm just like special keys on stage 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:51.470
 what 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:07:01.460
 and this phallic story n100 lights and 

00:06:57.619 --> 00:07:03.800
 I think this organization will bring out 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.589
 but those who love the whole work me 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.409
 cursing because, in general, by 

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:12.169
 the official version is not so I think 

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:14.149
 what is it so accustomed did not sell target anger 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:16.399
 during my lifetime as far as i know 

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:19.039
 never sold the right to film 

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:21.619
 one of his works and in general it is 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:24.229
 his sister is right but this is cunning and all 

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:26.659
 equally managed somehow I shall weld the quote 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:29.659
 on the cube there the plot and shoot it to your 

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:32.569

 for the reason that suffers from 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:48.729
