the black with white so that you get a

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.090 
the black with white so that you get a
small<00:02:06.030> contour<00:02:06.450> around<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.050> eye<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.890> will

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
small contour around the eye that will

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.830 
small contour around the eye that will
give<00:02:08.310> your<00:02:08.430> public<00:02:08.850> viewed<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.330> cartoony

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
look you can also add a small reflection

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.880 
look you can also add a small reflection
onto<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.800> nose<00:02:14.840> next<00:02:15.840> step<00:02:16.020> is<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.380> dot<00:02:16.560> on<00:02:16.740> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
onto the nose next step is to dot on the
