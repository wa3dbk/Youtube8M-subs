I<00:01:34.020> don't<00:01:34.740> think<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.130> mean<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.460> think<00:01:35.520> if<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
I don't think so I mean I think if the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.149 
I don't think so I mean I think if the
three<00:01:36.119> car<00:01:36.299> was<00:01:36.479> here<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:37.049> don't<00:01:37.740> think<00:01:37.920> we'd

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
three car was here I don't think we'd

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.499 
three car was here I don't think we'd
have<00:01:38.220> those<00:01:38.490> many<00:01:38.759> problems<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.240> series

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
have those many problems in this series

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.359 
have those many problems in this series
as<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.750> have<00:01:39.930> because<00:01:40.170> he<00:01:40.829> always<00:01:40.979> had<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> way

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
as we have because he always had a way

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.679 
as we have because he always had a way
of<00:01:41.490> letting<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> drivers<00:01:42.210> know<00:01:42.360> where<00:01:42.540> they

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
of letting the drivers know where they

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.850
