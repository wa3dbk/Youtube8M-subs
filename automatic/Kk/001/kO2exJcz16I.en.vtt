00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.539
 the health

 it is a citizen's right 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:37.119
 it's a state duty 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:41.059
 is the 30th most 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:44.099
 This shows that the tragic situation and 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:50.219
 those who are able to live in what was held hostage to the ideb is that 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:52.819
 talk a little about ip prices 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:53.889
 what brings it closer 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.439
 if every stem cell is human 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.249
 so 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:01.549
 ah we worked with neurological diseases title was among the 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.650
 neurological diseases have those easy to go and see if they are 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:06.949

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:11.119
 the company present raise a very interesting feeling called 

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:12.209
 hope 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.239
 and currently one of the highest expectations is the representative of each 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.489
 stem cell 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.710
 it's a semiotic the team is growing for us to better understand this 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.020
 mechanism is as if the mechanism is criticized products the farmer 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.659
 he has to use a suitable destination 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:35.509
 good seed he has to act in a proper way because 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.389
 This seed brings us closer to a plant. 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.810
 we are still in the group stage in the next stage 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.830
 but we're already understanding how to grow them like this 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.860
 no club in switzerland 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.860
 sometimes the program talks a little about the campaign if it has some time and even 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.569
 tomorrow 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:56.650
 the little town 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.040

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.310
 he was fine if they got on very well than I did I went there in the holy house with my 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.780
 I can not in periperi parents but it is as independent 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.419
 It's a bit about this media that the 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.860
 none of them can take a little blood is a brand that we have 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:22.240
 this is a brand that we carry this brand it can be equal to the brand 

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:24.259
 that other people carry 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.270
 then the owners received 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.270
 the products of other people must be compatible 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.629
 this compatibility is seen through this brand so you have 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:39.580
 have the same mark so that there is no rejection of that product which 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.889
 We are receiving 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.279
 when we talk in transplant the fundamental HIV AIDS test ' 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:49.270
 kidney transplantation, liver transplantation and perhaps even 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.850
 treatment of stem cells 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.779
 with cells of other people the staff was the brand name ipad strap 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:57.860
 the tricolor beat the kitten 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.409
 is there a person like dengue 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.270
 but he was there the most important allotting a little bit about that word 

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:07.650
 and letter that the projected 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.389
 when the stem cell despite the network and having a rich family 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:16.020
 technician who tries to help the ema tries to help and we do not find combativeness the 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.900
 largest fish asylum 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.520
 she came from a bag saying that she had other projects which would be 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:25.580
 - we work with degenerative diseases 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.669
 the stem cell 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:27.789
 it was a hope 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.469
 It's a hope that everything can happen and that it's going to happen. 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:35.749
 but the present moment it is fundamental what is necessary we have to do 

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:40.629
 from this moment the richest moment of our life what to do in that 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:43.479
 moment by that person who is in need of 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:48.099
 that a situation such as that 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:49.460
 treatments 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.610
 so that the application is worthy that life is respected 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.860
 and that society understands this 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.310
 as the main meaning you have to live every day of every moment 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.810
