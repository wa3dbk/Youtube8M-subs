thought Aamir Khan can still to the life
right<00:00:36.930> now<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.430> even<00:00:38.430> then<00:00:38.579> give<00:00:38.850> Floyd<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> run

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
right now and even then give Floyd a run

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.290 
right now and even then give Floyd a run
for<00:00:39.870> his<00:00:39.960> money<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.350> think<00:00:41.030> Maidana<00:00:42.030> did

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
for his money and I think Maidana did

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.180 
for his money and I think Maidana did
give<00:00:42.540> Floyd<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.320> think<00:00:43.410> Amir<00:00:43.920> Khan<00:00:44.160> I

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
give Floyd that but I think Amir Khan I

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.000 
give Floyd that but I think Amir Khan I
think<00:00:44.579> would<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.539> brought<00:00:46.110> out<00:00:46.170> more<00:00:46.710> and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
think would have brought out more and

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.580 
think would have brought out more and
you<00:00:48.000> never<00:00:48.180> know<00:00:48.420> possibly<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.020> win<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:49.500> you
