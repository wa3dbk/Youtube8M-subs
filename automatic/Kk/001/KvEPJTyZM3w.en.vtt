00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
to about a half inch or so from the edge

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.780 
to about a half inch or so from the edge
of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> body<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:58.290> later<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.790> we're

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
of the body here because later on we're

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.469 
of the body here because later on we're
going<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> use<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.450> to<00:01:01.550> adjust<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:05.040> trim

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
going to use that to adjust the the trim

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.820 
going to use that to adjust the the trim
for<00:01:06.950> how<00:01:07.950> loose<00:01:08.190> it<00:01:08.370> is<00:01:08.460> or<00:01:08.700> how<00:01:08.790> tight<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.240> is

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
for how loose it is or how tight it is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.640 
for how loose it is or how tight it is
okay<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.700> that's<00:01:11.880> good<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.180> start<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:13.530> you're

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
okay so that's good to start and you're

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.460 
okay so that's good to start and you're
going<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:13.860> need<00:01:14.100> at<00:01:14.280> some<00:01:14.909> point<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.600> put<00:01:16.170> your

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
going to need at some point to put your

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.219 
going to need at some point to put your

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
ground wire through into the next cavity

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.320 
ground wire through into the next cavity
so<00:01:19.890> there's<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> first<00:01:20.370> step<00:01:20.670> I'm<00:01:21.120> going<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330

whatever<00:03:55.989> this<00:03:56.169> happens<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.590> be<00:03:56.680> paraffin<00:03:57.099> but

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
whatever this happens to be paraffin but

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.250 
whatever this happens to be paraffin but
this<00:03:57.819> really<00:03:58.180> helps<00:03:58.450> lubricate<00:03:58.599> the<00:03:58.989> screw

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
this really helps lubricate the screw

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.110 
this really helps lubricate the screw
and<00:03:59.530> make<00:03:59.919> it<00:04:00.040> much<00:04:00.160> easier<00:04:00.549> for<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.030> be

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
and make it much easier for you to be

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.460 
and make it much easier for you to be
able<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.299> put<00:04:01.419> the<00:04:01.510> screw<00:04:01.780> in<00:04:01.959> so<00:04:02.430> here<00:04:03.430> we<00:04:03.549> go

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
able to put the screw in so here we go

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.349 
able to put the screw in so here we go
okay<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.889> can<00:04:06.069> see<00:04:06.250> I've<00:04:06.430> screwed<00:04:06.940> these<00:04:07.120> down

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
okay you can see I've screwed these down

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.210 
okay you can see I've screwed these down
close<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.019> bridge<00:04:08.230> plate<00:04:08.500> now<00:04:08.980> what<00:04:09.129> I'm

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
close to the bridge plate now what I'm

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.809 
close to the bridge plate now what I'm
going<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.400> do<00:04:09.549> is<00:04:09.819> is<00:04:10.540> on<00:04:10.959> each<00:04:11.590> screw<00:04:12.400> you'll

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
going to do is is on each screw you'll

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.509 
going to do is is on each screw you'll
notice<00:04:13.209> that<00:04:13.329> I'm<00:04:13.419> going<00:04:13.569> to<00:04:13.599> take<00:04:13.750> it<00:04:13.930> down<00:04:14.079> to

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
notice that I'm going to take it down to

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.640 
notice that I'm going to take it down to
where<00:04:15.519> the<00:04:16.239> bridge<00:04:16.389> tilts<00:04:16.989> a<00:04:17.049> little<00:04:17.289> you<00:04:17.469> see

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
where the bridge tilts a little you see

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.440 
where the bridge tilts a little you see
that<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.070> then<00:04:18.430> I<00:04:18.459> back<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:18.940> off<00:04:19.060> till<00:04:19.299> it's

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
that and then I back it off till it's

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.670 
that and then I back it off till it's
flat<00:04:19.719> then<00:04:19.750> I'm<00:04:19.989> going<00:04:20.140> to<00:04:20.200> do<00:04:20.260> that<00:04:20.409> on<00:04:20.530> every

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
flat then I'm going to do that on every

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.830 
flat then I'm going to do that on every
screw<00:04:21.099> this<00:04:21.849> way<00:04:22.090> you<00:04:22.150> don't<00:04:22.539> have

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
screw this way you don't have

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.340 
screw this way you don't have
anything<00:04:23.050> holding<00:04:23.560> up<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:24.669> bridge<00:04:25.000> it's<00:04:25.990> free

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
anything holding up the bridge it's free

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.140 
anything holding up the bridge it's free
to<00:04:26.470> float<00:04:26.770> so<00:04:27.370> here<00:04:27.550> we<00:04:27.610> go<00:04:27.730> it's<00:04:27.910> going<00:04:28.060> to

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
to float so here we go it's going to

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.280 
to float so here we go it's going to
tilt<00:04:28.360> see<00:04:28.870> and<00:04:29.530> I<00:04:29.620> back<00:04:29.860> it<00:04:30.040> off<00:04:30.190> just<00:04:31.290> about

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
tilt see and I back it off just about

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.030 
tilt see and I back it off just about
quarter<00:04:32.949> turn<00:04:33.190> from<00:04:33.940> where<00:04:34.120> it<00:04:34.210> tilts<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.860> will

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
quarter turn from where it tilts it will

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.530 
quarter turn from where it tilts it will
lay<00:04:36.160> flat<00:04:36.190> see<00:04:37.180> there<00:04:37.479> it<00:04:37.570> tilts<00:04:37.900> back<00:04:38.080> it<00:04:38.889> off

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
lay flat see there it tilts back it off

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.850 
lay flat see there it tilts back it off
and<00:04:40.540> do<00:04:40.690> that<00:04:40.780> on<00:04:40.840> all<00:04:41.080> six<00:04:41.350> of<00:04:41.470> these<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.740> that

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
and do that on all six of these and that

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.340 
and do that on all six of these and that
allows<00:04:42.850> a<00:04:42.880> pretty<00:04:43.389> even<00:04:45.479> point<00:04:46.479> of<00:04:46.690> contact

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
allows a pretty even point of contact

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.469 
allows a pretty even point of contact
across<00:04:47.650> all<00:04:48.010> of<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.280> screws<00:04:48.550> here<00:04:48.820> come<00:04:49.150> see

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
across all of the screws here come see

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.570 
across all of the screws here come see
it's<00:04:49.930> tilting<00:04:50.410> and<00:04:50.979> I<00:04:51.040> bring<00:04:51.280> it<00:04:51.400> back<00:04:51.550> a

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
it's tilting and I bring it back a

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.730 
it's tilting and I bring it back a
little<00:04:52.979> do<00:04:53.979> the<00:04:54.100> same<00:04:54.310> thing<00:04:54.550> here

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
little do the same thing here

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.090 
little do the same thing here
tilts<00:04:56.740> back<00:04:56.950> and<00:04:57.790> last<00:04:58.570> one<00:04:59.370> okay<00:05:00.450> tilts<00:05:01.450> back

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
tilts back and last one okay tilts back

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.010 
tilts back and last one okay tilts back
there<00:05:03.100> now<00:05:03.550> please<00:05:03.910> you<00:05:04.419> can<00:05:04.570> see<00:05:04.720> how<00:05:04.840> this

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
there now please you can see how this

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.050 
there now please you can see how this
floats<00:05:05.889> pretty<00:05:06.130> good<00:05:06.930> okay<00:05:08.610> next<00:05:09.610> step<00:05:09.850> is

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
floats pretty good okay next step is

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.340 
floats pretty good okay next step is
going<00:05:10.240> to<00:05:10.330> be<00:05:10.860> installing<00:05:11.860> the<00:05:12.190> trim<00:05:13.030> claw

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
going to be installing the trim claw

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.520 
going to be installing the trim claw
this<00:05:14.350> goes<00:05:14.560> in<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:14.800> back<00:05:14.979> of<00:05:15.130> the<00:05:15.389> route<00:05:16.530> for

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
this goes in the back of the route for

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.500 
this goes in the back of the route for
the<00:05:17.650> bridge<00:05:17.830> pocket<00:05:18.280> to<00:05:18.430> allow<00:05:19.180> for<00:05:19.450> the

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
the bridge pocket to allow for the

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.050 
the bridge pocket to allow for the
springs<00:05:19.840> that's<00:05:20.169> what<00:05:20.560> makes<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:21.060> tremolo

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
springs that's what makes the tremolo

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.010 
springs that's what makes the tremolo
float<00:05:22.479> so<00:05:22.780> first<00:05:23.139> thing<00:05:23.260> I'm<00:05:23.380> going<00:05:23.500> to<00:05:23.560> do<00:05:23.740> is

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
float so first thing I'm going to do is

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.279 
float so first thing I'm going to do is
I'm<00:05:26.020> going<00:05:26.110> to<00:05:27.060> wax<00:05:28.060> the<00:05:28.389> screw<00:05:28.780> so<00:05:29.020> they'll<00:05:29.169> be

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
I'm going to wax the screw so they'll be

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.969 
I'm going to wax the screw so they'll be
a<00:05:29.320> little<00:05:29.530> bit<00:05:29.710> easier<00:05:30.070> to<00:05:30.130> put<00:05:30.669> in<00:05:31.770> it's<00:05:32.770> good

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
a little bit easier to put in it's good

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.860 
a little bit easier to put in it's good
if<00:05:33.160> you<00:05:33.190> can<00:05:33.280> to<00:05:33.669> get<00:05:33.789> a<00:05:33.850> long<00:05:34.479> screwdriver

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
if you can to get a long screwdriver

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.469 
if you can to get a long screwdriver
like<00:05:35.260> this<00:05:35.500> one<00:05:35.789> so<00:05:36.789> that<00:05:36.970> you're<00:05:37.150> not<00:05:37.360> going

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
like this one so that you're not going

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:38.820 
like this one so that you're not going
to<00:05:37.539> ding<00:05:37.720> up<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:37.960> body<00:05:38.169> as<00:05:38.410> you're<00:05:38.560> putting

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
to ding up the body as you're putting

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.469 
to ding up the body as you're putting
this<00:05:38.919> in<00:05:38.979> and<00:05:39.430> I<00:05:40.030> also<00:05:40.270> like<00:05:40.630> to<00:05:40.840> use<00:05:41.220> the

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
this in and I also like to use the

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.990 
this in and I also like to use the
screwdriver<00:05:43.479> to<00:05:43.810> kind<00:05:43.990> of<00:05:44.110> open<00:05:44.289> up<00:05:44.820> the<00:05:45.820> end

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
screwdriver to kind of open up the end

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.969 
screwdriver to kind of open up the end
of<00:05:46.120> the<00:05:46.240> or<00:05:47.050> the<00:05:47.289> beginning<00:05:47.680> of<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.830> hole<00:05:47.950> I

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
of the or the beginning of the hole I

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.700 
of the or the beginning of the hole I
should<00:05:48.220> say<00:05:48.430> here<00:05:48.700> to<00:05:48.940> allow<00:05:49.450> it<00:05:49.660> easier<00:05:50.530> to

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
should say here to allow it easier to

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.070 
should say here to allow it easier to
screw<00:05:50.889> these<00:05:51.070> screws<00:05:51.340> in<00:05:51.550> this<00:05:52.150> is<00:05:52.330> probably

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
screw these screws in this is probably

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.710 
screw these screws in this is probably
one<00:05:53.229> of<00:05:53.260> the<00:05:53.349> harder<00:05:53.820> physically<00:05:54.820> harder

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
one of the harder physically harder

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.600 
one of the harder physically harder
things<00:05:55.930> to<00:05:56.080> do<00:05:56.229> because<00:05:56.560> of<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:57.160> angle<00:05:57.520> of

things to do because of the angle of

things to do because of the angle of
this<00:05:57.789> screw<00:05:58.030> so<00:05:58.060> I'm<00:05:58.539> going<00:05:58.690> to<00:05:58.750> hold<00:05:58.990> my

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
this screw so I'm going to hold my

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.580 
this screw so I'm going to hold my
fingers<00:06:00.340> around<00:06:00.520> the<00:06:00.880> screwdriver<00:06:01.419> and<00:06:02.349> kind

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
fingers around the screwdriver and kind

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.700 
fingers around the screwdriver and kind
of<00:06:02.620> on<00:06:02.770> the<00:06:02.889> body<00:06:03.070> to<00:06:03.639> make<00:06:03.789> sure<00:06:03.940> that<00:06:04.060> I'm<00:06:04.180> not

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
of on the body to make sure that I'm not

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.900 
of on the body to make sure that I'm not
tearing<00:06:05.710> the<00:06:05.800> body<00:06:05.979> up<00:06:06.160> with<00:06:06.190> the<00:06:06.460> handle<00:06:06.849> of

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
tearing the body up with the handle of

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.390 
tearing the body up with the handle of
the<00:06:07.000> screwdriver<00:06:07.270> as<00:06:07.690> I'm<00:06:07.840> doing<00:06:08.020> this

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
the screwdriver as I'm doing this

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.129 
the screwdriver as I'm doing this
probably<00:06:09.400> a<00:06:09.490> good<00:06:09.610> idea<00:06:09.729> to<00:06:10.030> not<00:06:10.450> use<00:06:10.660> a<00:06:10.690> drill

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
probably a good idea to not use a drill

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:12.839 
probably a good idea to not use a drill
for<00:06:11.410> this<00:06:11.560> step<00:06:11.860> you<00:06:12.160> don't<00:06:12.520> want<00:06:12.639> to<00:06:12.700> use<00:06:12.820> a

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
for this step you don't want to use a

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:16.200 
for this step you don't want to use a
drill<00:06:13.150> it's<00:06:14.050> really<00:06:14.560> dangerous<00:06:15.130> I've<00:06:15.610> ruined

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
drill it's really dangerous I've ruined

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.210 
drill it's really dangerous I've ruined
bodies<00:06:16.630> trying<00:06:16.870> to<00:06:16.960> do<00:06:17.050> that<00:06:17.229> for<00:06:17.440> so<00:06:17.800> I'm

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
bodies trying to do that for so I'm

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.550 
bodies trying to do that for so I'm
going<00:06:18.430> to<00:06:18.460> take<00:06:18.700> this<00:06:18.960> screw<00:06:19.960> to<00:06:20.080> about<00:06:20.260> half

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
going to take this screw to about half

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.460 
going to take this screw to about half
an<00:06:20.710> inch<00:06:22.110> from<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:24.400> pocket<00:06:25.110> there<00:06:26.110> we<00:06:26.289> go

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
an inch from the pocket there we go

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.340 
an inch from the pocket there we go
about<00:06:27.099> like<00:06:27.340> that

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
about like that

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.190 
about like that
now<00:06:28.890> as<00:06:29.250> you<00:06:30.000> get<00:06:30.120> ready<00:06:30.360> to<00:06:30.420> wire<00:06:30.660> the<00:06:30.870> guitar

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.200 
now as you get ready to wire the guitar

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.060 
now as you get ready to wire the guitar
this<00:06:31.770> trim<00:06:32.580> claw<00:06:32.760> will<00:06:32.970> actually<00:06:33.330> have<00:06:33.510> a

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
this trim claw will actually have a

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.800 
this trim claw will actually have a
ground<00:06:35.070> on<00:06:35.340> it<00:06:35.520> that<00:06:36.240> will<00:06:36.330> help<00:06:36.420> ground<00:06:36.660> the

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
ground on it that will help ground the

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.270 
ground on it that will help ground the
bridge<00:06:37.020> when<00:06:37.440> you're<00:06:37.560> touching<00:06:37.860> the<00:06:37.950> strings

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
bridge when you're touching the strings

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.450 
bridge when you're touching the strings
if<00:06:38.460> it<00:06:38.580> isn't<00:06:38.790> grounded<00:06:39.120> you'll<00:06:39.630> have<00:06:39.810> noise

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
if it isn't grounded you'll have noise

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.510 
if it isn't grounded you'll have noise
and<00:06:41.460> then<00:06:42.530> see<00:06:43.530> these<00:06:43.860> Springs<00:06:44.160> are<00:06:44.280> a<00:06:44.310> little

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
and then see these Springs are a little

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.410 
and then see these Springs are a little
bit<00:06:44.610> hard<00:06:44.790> so<00:06:44.970> I'll<00:06:45.090> generally<00:06:45.630> take<00:06:46.320> the

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
bit hard so I'll generally take the

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.890 
bit hard so I'll generally take the
screwdriver<00:06:48.420> and<00:06:48.690> and<00:06:49.260> line<00:06:49.620> it<00:06:49.800> up<00:06:49.890> like<00:06:50.280> that

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
screwdriver and and line it up like that

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:59.480 
screwdriver and and line it up like that
these<00:06:51.900> Springs<00:06:52.230> are<00:06:52.320> pretty<00:06:52.530> tight<00:06:58.370> help<00:06:59.370> me

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
these Springs are pretty tight help me

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.460 
these Springs are pretty tight help me
put<00:06:59.670> it<00:06:59.700> in<00:06:59.880> like<00:07:00.060> that<00:07:00.090> this<00:07:00.900> is<00:07:01.080> a<00:07:01.110> little<00:07:01.350> bit

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
put it in like that this is a little bit

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.960 
put it in like that this is a little bit
tricky<00:07:01.770> the<00:07:01.890> other<00:07:02.010> thing<00:07:02.220> you<00:07:02.310> can<00:07:02.550> do<00:07:02.790> is

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
tricky the other thing you can do is

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.320 
tricky the other thing you can do is
leave<00:07:03.660> the<00:07:03.690> claw<00:07:04.230> out<00:07:04.470> farther<00:07:05.120> attach<00:07:06.120> the

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
leave the claw out farther attach the

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.420 
leave the claw out farther attach the
springs<00:07:06.660> and<00:07:06.930> then<00:07:07.140> tighten<00:07:07.530> it<00:07:07.650> but<00:07:08.190> I<00:07:08.220> like

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
springs and then tighten it but I like

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.530 
springs and then tighten it but I like
to<00:07:08.550> get<00:07:08.670> it<00:07:08.790> close<00:07:08.970> to<00:07:09.000> where<00:07:09.240> it's<00:07:09.360> going<00:07:09.510> to

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:09.540 
to get it close to where it's going to

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.070 
to get it close to where it's going to
end<00:07:09.600> up<00:07:09.900> before<00:07:10.050> I<00:07:10.260> put<00:07:10.710> the<00:07:10.860> springs<00:07:11.160> in<00:07:12.080> makes

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
end up before I put the springs in makes

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.960 
end up before I put the springs in makes
the<00:07:13.290> bridge<00:07:14.100> more<00:07:14.340> stable<00:07:14.790> there<00:07:15.630> there<00:07:16.320> we<00:07:16.470> go

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:16.970 
the bridge more stable there there we go

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.670 
the bridge more stable there there we go
that's<00:07:17.970> it<00:07:18.240> next<00:07:19.020> thing<00:07:19.260> you<00:07:19.380> would<00:07:19.470> do<00:07:19.650> would

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 
that's it next thing you would do would

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.050 
that's it next thing you would do would
be<00:07:20.010> put<00:07:20.220> the<00:07:20.310> rest<00:07:20.490> of<00:07:20.580> the<00:07:20.640> guitar<00:07:20.940> together

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 
be put the rest of the guitar together

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.010 
and you can adjust the springs for the

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.490 
and you can adjust the springs for the
tension<00:07:23.490> of<00:07:23.670> the<00:07:23.720> trim<00:07:24.720> some<00:07:25.020> people<00:07:25.290> like<00:07:25.470> to

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 
tension of the trim some people like to

tension of the trim some people like to
tighten<00:07:25.890> it<00:07:26.130> so<00:07:26.820> that<00:07:27.000> it<00:07:27.090> stays<00:07:27.300> on<00:07:27.480> the<00:07:27.720> body

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.230

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.210 
and others like it to float but that

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.730 
and others like it to float but that
would<00:07:30.360> be<00:07:30.390> part<00:07:30.690> of<00:07:30.750> the<00:07:30.840> setup<00:07:31.080> thank<00:07:31.650> you
