00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.760
 so we scored beads 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.090
 only two types 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.190
 we fix 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:34.650
 such leaves as a blade of grass are obtained 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.580
 points on 5 flowers but up to 10 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.370
 leaves 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.180
 not necessarily that they were 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.750
 same size 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.750
 he will be given a blade of grass longer than the other 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.530
 will be shorter and be sure to use 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.070
 koval 4 millimeter otherwise 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.070
 Leaf will not you have to take 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.690
 yellow beads and start making stamens 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:05.780
 for our flower we type on the shelf 10 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.780
 yellow beads 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.810
 on a 10 centimeters wire 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:28.439
 make a loop do a loop and start 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:29.789
 twist the wire up to 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.009
 the very end 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.009
 neat beautiful scrub. 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:52.960
 need 25 pieces of these stamens of five pieces 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.410
 on one flower start the race of the flower 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.610
 beats access to a wolf 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.610
 stamens 5 pieces 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.090
 and fasten them to the very base oki 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:17.020
 so that the stamens stuck on top about 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:19.500
 four centimeters from a tick take our 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.500
 petals 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.269
 and as if we bend inward 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.500
 such here 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.530
 we put 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.530
 one edge 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.100
 and from the other side 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:49.500
 to see our yellow stamens 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.500
 fasten them with thread 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.349
 now take two more petals 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.349
 also a little prog on them 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.330
 and fasten from this side 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:23.760
 fasten very tightly 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:27.030
 lest they crumble all 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:33.020
 fasten about level 10 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.020
 centimeters we fasten our leaves 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.160
 our crocuses are ready I put them 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.820
