00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.340 
another reason why in the country we
only<00:05:51.930> have<00:05:52.169> two<00:05:52.350> parties<00:05:52.800> you<00:05:53.759> have<00:05:53.910> to

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
only have two parties you have to

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.540 
only have two parties you have to
sometimes<00:05:55.350> hold<00:05:55.620> your<00:05:55.770> nose<00:05:55.949> and<00:05:55.979> vote<00:05:56.370> for

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
sometimes hold your nose and vote for

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.120 
sometimes hold your nose and vote for
the<00:05:56.610> one<00:05:56.930> that's<00:05:57.930> going<00:05:58.169> to<00:05:58.259> at<00:05:58.680> least<00:05:58.830> going

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
the one that's going to at least going

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.219 
the one that's going to at least going
to<00:05:59.190> appoint<00:05:59.490> better<00:06:00.060> Supreme<00:06:00.539> Court<00:06:00.810> justices

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
to appoint better Supreme Court justices

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.140 
to appoint better Supreme Court justices
because<00:06:01.560> that<00:06:01.770> that's<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.520> key<00:06:02.669> to<00:06:02.789> a<00:06:02.820> lot<00:06:03.030> of

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
because that that's the key to a lot of

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.999 
because that that's the key to a lot of
things<00:06:03.360> let's<00:06:03.750> not<00:06:03.900> forget<00:06:04.229> that<00:06:04.380> Obama<00:06:04.710> did<00:06:04.979> a

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
things let's not forget that Obama did a

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:06.620 
things let's not forget that Obama did a
point<00:06:05.340> to<00:06:05.520> pretty<00:06:05.759> good<00:06:05.940> Supreme<00:06:06.389> Court

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
point to pretty good Supreme Court

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.910 
point to pretty good Supreme Court
justices

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
justices

that we can change the system from my
family<00:06:17.760> current<00:06:18.240> structure<00:06:18.570> dia<00:06:18.900> very<00:06:19.710> much

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
family current structure dia very much

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.800 
family current structure dia very much
you<00:06:20.100> know<00:06:20.220> she'd<00:06:20.880> most<00:06:21.030> currently<00:06:21.600> the<00:06:21.720> only

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
you know she'd most currently the only

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.170 
you know she'd most currently the only

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
way multiple parties would work in this

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.180 
way multiple parties would work in this
country<00:06:24.930> is<00:06:25.080> if<00:06:25.230> we<00:06:25.410> had<00:06:25.530> a<00:06:25.560> parliamentary

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
country is if we had a parliamentary

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.430 
country is if we had a parliamentary

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
system which we don't you know we don't

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.170 
system which we don't you know we don't
have<00:06:28.590> a<00:06:28.710> system<00:06:29.160> like<00:06:29.400> the<00:06:29.670> European

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
have a system like the European

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.880 
have a system like the European
countries<00:06:30.660> where<00:06:30.900> that's<00:06:31.290> where<00:06:31.380> multiple

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
countries where that's where multiple

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.920 
countries where that's where multiple
parties<00:06:32.280> work<00:06:32.520> we<00:06:32.850> don't<00:06:32.940> form<00:06:33.300> coalition

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.020 
parties work we don't form coalition
governments<00:06:34.440> so<00:06:35.100> i<00:06:35.130> doubt<00:06:35.580> if<00:06:35.730> we're<00:06:35.850> going<00:06:35.970> to

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
governments so i doubt if we're going to

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.260 
governments so i doubt if we're going to
get<00:06:36.120> a<00:06:36.500> page-one<00:06:37.500> rewriter<00:06:38.340> the<00:06:38.520> constitution

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
to make that happen and as long as we

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.190 
to make that happen and as long as we
have<00:06:41.460> the<00:06:41.490> system<00:06:41.910> we<00:06:42.030> have<00:06:42.060> I<00:06:42.630> think<00:06:42.930> we're

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
have the system we have I think we're

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.330 
have the system we have I think we're
always<00:06:43.350> going<00:06:43.560> to<00:06:43.650> have<00:06:43.680> to<00:06:43.890> live<00:06:44.040> with<00:06:44.100> these
