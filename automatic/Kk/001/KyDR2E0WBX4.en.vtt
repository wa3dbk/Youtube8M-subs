goes<00:03:39.989> right<00:03:40.230> around<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.650> metal<00:03:40.860> bezel<00:03:41.190> and

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
goes right around that metal bezel and

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.830 
goes right around that metal bezel and
when<00:03:43.050> you<00:03:43.200> kind<00:03:43.860> of<00:03:43.950> close<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.459> up<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.840> you

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
when you kind of close that up and you

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.960 
when you kind of close that up and you
close<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.260> front<00:03:46.470> okay<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.280> only<00:03:47.340> thing<00:03:47.580> is

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
close the front okay the only thing is

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.449

there's<00:03:48.330> no<00:03:48.510> way<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:49.140> kind<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.190> front

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
there's no way that this kind of front

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.940 
there's no way that this kind of front
flap<00:03:50.700> stays<00:03:50.970> closed<00:03:51.330> there's<00:03:51.690> no<00:03:51.840> class<00:03:52.380> or

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
flap stays closed there's no class or

bungee or anything like that so that's a

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.890 
bungee or anything like that so that's a
little<00:03:55.320> bit<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.739> drawback<00:03:56.780> obviously<00:03:57.780> with

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
little bit of a drawback obviously with

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.510 
little bit of a drawback obviously with
the<00:03:57.930> first<00:03:58.320> iPad<00:03:58.739> there's<00:03:58.950> no<00:03:59.070> magnetic

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
the first iPad there's no magnetic

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.370 
the first iPad there's no magnetic
closure<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.450> there's<00:04:00.810> not<00:04:00.959> going<00:04:01.110> to<00:04:01.170> be<00:04:01.230> any

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
closure so there's not going to be any

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.530 
closure so there's not going to be any
sleep<00:04:01.680> awake<00:04:02.010> or<00:04:02.190> anything<00:04:02.489> like<00:04:02.520> that<00:04:02.670> but

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
rotation or a nice typing angle so

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.280 
rotation or a nice typing angle so
that's<00:05:23.700> a<00:05:23.850> really<00:05:24.120> nice<00:05:24.240> typing<00:05:24.750> angle<00:05:24.870> I<00:05:25.080> like

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
that's a really nice typing angle I like

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.560 
that's a really nice typing angle I like
that<00:05:25.470> a<00:05:25.530> lot<00:05:25.620> and<00:05:25.980> then<00:05:26.520> if<00:05:26.760> you<00:05:26.910> stand<00:05:27.240> it<00:05:27.420> up

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
that a lot and then if you stand it up

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.500 
that a lot and then if you stand it up
you<00:05:28.260> have<00:05:28.530> a<00:05:28.860> nice<00:05:29.280> viewing<00:05:29.790> angle<00:05:30.210> so<00:05:30.330> those

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
you have a nice viewing angle so those

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.150 
you have a nice viewing angle so those
are<00:05:30.660> pretty<00:05:30.810> much<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.080> two<00:05:31.410> viewing<00:05:31.830> angles

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
are pretty much the two viewing angles

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.980 
are pretty much the two viewing angles
and<00:05:32.520> I<00:05:32.700> really<00:05:33.000> like<00:05:33.180> how<00:05:33.360> that's<00:05:33.540> designed

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
and I really like how that's designed

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.540 
and I really like how that's designed
with<00:05:34.140> that<00:05:34.290> tab<00:05:34.590> that<00:05:34.830> goes<00:05:35.040> in<00:05:35.220> there<00:05:35.370> because

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
with that tab that goes in there because

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.970 
with that tab that goes in there because
it's<00:05:35.850> really<00:05:36.240> nice<00:05:36.390> and<00:05:36.660> solid<00:05:36.870> ok<00:05:37.620> it<00:05:37.800> doesn't

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
it's really nice and solid ok it doesn't

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.820 
it's really nice and solid ok it doesn't
flop<00:05:38.340> around<00:05:38.520> or<00:05:38.850> anything<00:05:38.880> like<00:05:39.180> that<00:05:39.330> so

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
flop around or anything like that so

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.830 
flop around or anything like that so
