and roll that out and you don't want the
size<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.500> too<00:01:04.890> thin<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.430> about<00:01:05.939> five

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
size to be too thin so about five

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.230 
size to be too thin so about five
millimeters<00:01:06.810> will<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.560> then<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.700> take<00:01:08.939> a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
millimeters will do then you can take a

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.570 
millimeters will do then you can take a
I<00:01:09.600> got<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> small<00:01:10.439> little<00:01:10.500> cookie<00:01:11.250> cutter<00:01:11.280> but

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
I got a small little cookie cutter but

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.429 
I got a small little cookie cutter but
you<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:11.970> use<00:01:12.180> anything<00:01:12.570> that's<00:01:12.930> really<00:01:13.260> slow

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
you can use anything that's really slow

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.410 
you can use anything that's really slow
circular<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.580> will<00:01:14.700> cut<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.060> out<00:01:15.210> that

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
circular and that will cut you out that

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.120 
circular and that will cut you out that
shape

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.070 

so<00:01:19.640> then<00:01:19.820> after<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.119> can<00:01:20.360> take<00:01:20.570> your<00:01:20.810> outside

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
so then after you can take your outside

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.350 
so then after you can take your outside
pieces<00:01:21.860> of<00:01:22.040> your<00:01:22.189> macaroons<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:22.970> start

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
pieces of your macaroons and start

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.330 
pieces of your macaroons and start
forming<00:01:23.659> them<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:23.990> little<00:01:24.380> bit<00:01:24.530> more<00:01:24.799> because

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
forming them a little bit more because

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.600 
forming them a little bit more because
macaroons<00:01:26.180> are<00:01:26.420> round<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:27.200> then<00:01:28.190> you<00:01:28.490> can

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
macaroons are round and then you can

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.969 
macaroons are round and then you can
take<00:01:28.759> your<00:01:28.909> toothpick<00:01:29.150> and<00:01:29.710> leave<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.740> little

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
take your toothpick and leave a little

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.639 
take your toothpick and leave a little
bit<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:31.280> space<00:01:31.610> at<00:01:31.790> the<00:01:31.909> top<00:01:32.119> and<00:01:32.619> poke<00:01:33.619> some

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
bit of space at the top and poke some

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.490 
bit of space at the top and poke some
holes<00:01:34.149> all<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.210> way<00:01:35.630> around<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:36.229> that

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
holes all the way around and that

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.859 
holes all the way around and that
represents<00:01:37.070> basically<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.119> inside<00:01:38.539> of<00:01:38.720> your

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
represents basically the inside of your

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.320 
represents basically the inside of your
macaron

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
macaron

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.240 
macaron
so<00:01:41.330> now<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:41.570> do<00:01:41.690> the<00:01:41.810> same<00:01:42.080> thing<00:01:42.440> for<00:01:42.830> the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
so now you do the same thing for the

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.639 
so now you do the same thing for the
inside<00:01:43.670> as<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:44.030> did<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.360> outside<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:45.170> this

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
inside as you did the outside and this

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.340 
inside as you did the outside and this
piece<00:01:45.979> can<00:01:46.310> be<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.520> little<00:01:46.880> bit<00:01:47.030> thinner<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:47.630> now

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
piece can be a little bit thinner so now

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.020 
piece can be a little bit thinner so now
you're<00:01:48.590> ready<00:01:48.619> to<00:01:48.860> piece<00:01:49.220> those<00:01:49.549> three

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
you're ready to piece those three

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.840 
you're ready to piece those three
together<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.690> you<00:01:51.649> just<00:01:51.830> want<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.190> press<00:01:52.490> on

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
together and you just want to press on

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.809 
together and you just want to press on
it<00:01:53.119> from<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.569> outside<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:54.520> make<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.729> little

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
it from the outside and make it a little

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.309 
it from the outside and make it a little
