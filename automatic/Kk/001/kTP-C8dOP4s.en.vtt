like to talk to you today about the use
of<00:00:18.669> a<00:00:18.730> metronome<00:00:19.029> while<00:00:19.749> you're<00:00:19.900> practicing

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
of a metronome while you're practicing

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.069 
of a metronome while you're practicing
this<00:00:21.369> is<00:00:21.519> probably<00:00:21.880> something<00:00:22.179> that<00:00:22.329> most<00:00:22.960> of

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:23.079 
this is probably something that most of

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.359 
this is probably something that most of
your<00:00:23.199> guitar<00:00:23.499> teachers<00:00:23.800> have<00:00:23.949> told<00:00:24.159> you<00:00:24.279> your

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
your guitar teachers have told you your

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.429 
your guitar teachers have told you your
whole<00:00:24.519> lives<00:00:24.730> everybody<00:00:25.240> is<00:00:25.689> you<00:00:26.259> know<00:00:26.320> it's

pretty well known fact that you should

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.009 
pretty well known fact that you should
play<00:00:27.579> with<00:00:27.609> the<00:00:27.789> metronome<00:00:27.909> but<00:00:28.779> I've<00:00:28.869> got

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
play with the metronome but I've got

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.529 
play with the metronome but I've got
some<00:00:29.140> real<00:00:29.320> specific<00:00:29.739> exercises<00:00:30.699> designed<00:00:31.300> to

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
some real specific exercises designed to

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.840 
some real specific exercises designed to
help<00:00:31.839> you<00:00:32.079> actually<00:00:32.680> do<00:00:32.980> that<00:00:33.190> and<00:00:33.430> actually

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850

help you actually do that and actually
make<00:00:34.149> it<00:00:34.180> a<00:00:34.270> lot<00:00:34.359> more<00:00:34.510> fun<00:00:34.690> than<00:00:34.719> maybe<00:00:34.960> just

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
make it a lot more fun than maybe just

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.709 
make it a lot more fun than maybe just
playing<00:00:35.350> with<00:00:35.440> a<00:00:35.500> simple<00:00:35.829> quarter<00:00:36.340> note<00:00:36.489> pulse

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
playing with a simple quarter note pulse

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.880 
playing with a simple quarter note pulse
so<00:00:37.719> the<00:00:37.870> first<00:00:38.079> thing<00:00:38.230> I<00:00:38.289> want<00:00:38.440> to<00:00:38.500> talk<00:00:38.620> about

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
so the first thing I want to talk about

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.209 
so the first thing I want to talk about
is<00:00:39.100> this<00:00:39.340> concept<00:00:39.850> of<00:00:39.969> the<00:00:40.870> inner<00:00:41.230> time<00:00:41.890> clock

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
is this concept of the inner time clock

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.849 
is this concept of the inner time clock
that<00:00:42.640> everybody<00:00:43.539> has<00:00:43.750> it's<00:00:44.530> that<00:00:44.739> little

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
that everybody has it's that little

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:46.470 
that everybody has it's that little
voice<00:00:44.980> inside<00:00:45.399> your<00:00:45.699> head<00:00:45.760> that<00:00:46.059> tells<00:00:46.120> you

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
voice inside your head that tells you

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.689 
voice inside your head that tells you
what<00:00:46.660> tempo<00:00:47.019> a<00:00:47.050> song<00:00:47.350> is<00:00:47.500> that<00:00:47.679> some<00:00:48.460> people

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
what tempo a song is that some people

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.459 
what tempo a song is that some people
have<00:00:48.820> it<00:00:48.940> more<00:00:49.120> developed<00:00:49.899> than<00:00:49.929> others<00:00:50.260> and

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
have it more developed than others and

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
have it more developed than others and
that's<00:00:50.559> kind<00:00:50.890> of<00:00:50.920> what<00:00:51.039> we're<00:00:51.160> going<00:00:51.250> to<00:00:51.309> work

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
that's kind of what we're going to work

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.979 
that's kind of what we're going to work
on<00:00:51.670> here<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:54.010> if<00:00:54.339> you<00:00:55.030> use<00:00:55.269> a<00:00:55.300> metronome<00:00:55.690> a<00:00:55.839> lot

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
on here so if you use a metronome a lot

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.360 
on here so if you use a metronome a lot
and<00:00:56.199> do<00:00:56.379> some<00:00:56.500> of<00:00:56.589> these<00:00:56.649> exercises<00:00:57.070> you<00:00:57.280> will

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
and do some of these exercises you will

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.860 
and do some of these exercises you will
actually<00:00:57.519> be<00:00:57.789> developing<00:00:58.390> your<00:00:58.510> internal

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
actually be developing your internal

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.060 
actually be developing your internal
time<00:00:59.050> clock<00:00:59.079> which<00:00:59.469> is<00:00:59.620> something<00:00:59.859> that's

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
time clock which is something that's

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.000 
time clock which is something that's
everybody's<00:01:01.059> responsibility<00:01:01.800> don't<00:01:02.800> ever

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
everybody's responsibility don't ever

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.200 
everybody's responsibility don't ever
think<00:01:03.219> that<00:01:03.429> it's<00:01:03.579> just<00:01:03.670> a<00:01:03.910> drummers

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
think that it's just a drummers

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.819 
think that it's just a drummers
responsibility<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:05.019> keep<00:01:05.170> time<00:01:05.409> in<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.619> band

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
responsibility to keep time in a band

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:07.710 
responsibility to keep time in a band
everybody<00:01:06.759> shares<00:01:07.030> in<00:01:07.180> that<00:01:07.270> responsibility

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
everybody shares in that responsibility

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.200 
everybody shares in that responsibility
so<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.829> first<00:01:09.070> exercise<00:01:09.280> I'm<00:01:09.700> giving<00:01:09.939> you<00:01:10.030> is

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
so the first exercise I'm giving you is

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.090 
so the first exercise I'm giving you is
the<00:01:10.240> real<00:01:10.630> simple<00:01:11.020> basic<00:01:11.380> one<00:01:11.530> we're<00:01:11.920> going<00:01:12.040> to

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
the real simple basic one we're going to

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.010 
the real simple basic one we're going to
start<00:01:12.340> out<00:01:12.460> with<00:01:12.610> a<00:01:12.670> simple<00:01:13.270> metronome<00:01:13.750> click

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
start out with a simple metronome click

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.260 
start out with a simple metronome click
I<00:01:14.229> made<00:01:14.409> 104<00:01:14.979> beats<00:01:15.189> per<00:01:15.400> minute<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:16.000> I<00:01:16.210> want

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
I made 104 beats per minute and I want

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.609 
I made 104 beats per minute and I want
to<00:01:16.390> play<00:01:16.479> a<00:01:16.509> little<00:01:16.600> funk<00:01:16.960> groove<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.409> then

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
to play a little funk groove and then

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:29.700 
to play a little funk groove and then
we'll<00:01:17.740> go<00:01:17.829> from<00:01:17.950> there<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:29.439> that's<00:01:29.560> pretty

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
we'll go from there so that's pretty

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.080 
we'll go from there so that's pretty
typical<00:01:29.950> everybody<00:01:30.399> has<00:01:30.549> done<00:01:30.670> that<00:01:30.880> at<00:01:30.969> one

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
typical everybody has done that at one

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.840 
typical everybody has done that at one
point<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:32.350> I'm<00:01:32.439> playing<00:01:32.920> there<00:01:33.219> is<00:01:33.399> a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
point what I'm playing there is a

point what I'm playing there is a
there's<00:01:34.149> a<00:01:34.210> quarter<00:01:34.479> note<00:01:34.600> quarter<00:01:35.200> note

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
there's a quarter note quarter note

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.380 
there's a quarter note quarter note
pulse<00:01:35.409> and<00:01:35.890> I'm<00:01:35.979> playing<00:01:36.219> a<00:01:36.430> little<00:01:36.490> sixteenth

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
pulse and I'm playing a little sixteenth

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.990 
pulse and I'm playing a little sixteenth
note<00:01:37.570> rhythm<00:01:37.750> what<00:01:38.469> I<00:01:38.500> like<00:01:38.680> to<00:01:38.770> do<00:01:38.890> now<00:01:39.130> is<00:01:39.399> I'm

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
note rhythm what I like to do now is I'm

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.899 
note rhythm what I like to do now is I'm
going<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.149> change<00:01:40.479> the<00:01:40.719> click<00:01:41.250> instead<00:01:42.250> of<00:01:42.369> 104

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
going to change the click instead of 104

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.310 
going to change the click instead of 104
I'm<00:01:43.000> gonna<00:01:43.119> take<00:01:43.270> it<00:01:43.390> down<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.540> 52<00:01:43.990> which<00:01:44.289> is

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
I'm gonna take it down to 52 which is

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.980 
I'm gonna take it down to 52 which is
exactly<00:01:44.860> half<00:01:45.189> of<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:45.670> now<00:01:46.539> the<00:01:46.600> pulse

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
exactly half of that and now the pulse

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.420 
exactly half of that and now the pulse
to<00:01:47.259> me<00:01:47.380> is<00:01:47.530> not<00:01:47.680> gonna<00:01:47.860> be<00:01:48.039> quarter<00:01:48.280> notes

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
to me is not gonna be quarter notes

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.100 
to me is not gonna be quarter notes
anymore<00:01:48.759> it's<00:01:48.909> going<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.119> be<00:01:49.210> half<00:01:49.869> notes

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
anymore it's going to be half notes

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.340 
anymore it's going to be half notes
which<00:01:50.560> are<00:01:50.710> worth<00:01:50.860> two<00:01:51.009> beats<00:01:51.219> and<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:53.140> whole

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
which are worth two beats and the whole

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.289 
which are worth two beats and the whole
idea<00:01:53.770> behind<00:01:53.829> this<00:01:54.280> is<00:01:54.520> I'm<00:01:54.759> gonna<00:01:54.939> start

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
idea behind this is I'm gonna start

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.660 
idea behind this is I'm gonna start
relying<00:01:55.990> less<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.619> less<00:01:56.770> on<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.219> click<00:01:57.520> to

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
relying less and less on the click to

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.510 
relying less and less on the click to
tell<00:01:57.909> me<00:01:58.060> where<00:01:58.630> every<00:01:58.899> beat<00:01:59.079> is<00:01:59.109> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
tell me where every beat is and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.679 
tell me where every beat is and
transferring<00:02:00.520> some<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:00.820> responsibility<00:02:01.329> to

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
transferring some that responsibility to

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:17.809 
transferring some that responsibility to
my<00:02:01.960> inner<00:02:02.140> time<00:02:02.409> clock<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:04.210> sounds

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.970 

okay<00:02:19.020> so<00:02:20.020> I<00:02:20.050> feel<00:02:20.260> like<00:02:20.380> I<00:02:20.470> pretty<00:02:20.620> much<00:02:20.709> nailed

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
okay so I feel like I pretty much nailed

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.460 
okay so I feel like I pretty much nailed
it<00:02:21.190> at<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.400> point<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.900> if<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:23.080> was<00:02:23.200> doing<00:02:23.380> this

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
it at that point and if I was doing this

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.780 
it at that point and if I was doing this
at<00:02:23.620> home<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:24.040> would<00:02:24.069> do<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:24.400> for<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.610> much

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
at home I would do this for a much

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.400 
at home I would do this for a much
longer<00:02:25.150> time<00:02:25.330> I'm<00:02:25.540> just<00:02:25.660> kind<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.900> shortening

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
longer time I'm just kind of shortening

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.770 
longer time I'm just kind of shortening
this<00:02:26.530> for<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.980> sake<00:02:27.519> of<00:02:27.550> this<00:02:27.760> example<00:02:27.819> but

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
this for the sake of this example but

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.850 
this for the sake of this example but
when<00:02:28.870> you're<00:02:28.989> doing<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:29.290> at<00:02:29.440> home<00:02:29.470> make<00:02:29.709> sure

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
when you're doing this at home make sure

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.050 
when you're doing this at home make sure
and<00:02:29.950> do<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.099> for<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.310> couple<00:02:30.340> minutes<00:02:30.580> straight

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
and do it for a couple minutes straight

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.880 
and do it for a couple minutes straight
don't<00:02:31.599> vary<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.019> rhythm<00:02:32.140> don't<00:02:32.620> marry<00:02:32.800> the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
don't vary the rhythm don't marry the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.500 
don't vary the rhythm don't marry the
attack<00:02:33.190> try<00:02:33.459> to<00:02:33.519> keep<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.819> as<00:02:33.940> consistent<00:02:34.480> as

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
attack try to keep it as consistent as

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.270 
attack try to keep it as consistent as
you<00:02:34.660> possibly<00:02:35.019> can<00:02:35.260> with<00:02:35.739> whatever<00:02:35.980> you're

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
you possibly can with whatever you're

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.280 
you possibly can with whatever you're
playing<00:02:36.489> now<00:02:37.480> I'm<00:02:37.720> going<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> take<00:02:38.019> that<00:02:38.170> and

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
playing now I'm going to take that and

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.680 
playing now I'm going to take that and
take<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.830> in<00:02:38.920> half<00:02:39.069> once<00:02:39.400> again<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.090> I'm<00:02:40.420> going

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
take it in half once again so I'm going

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.570 
take it in half once again so I'm going
from<00:02:40.780> 56<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:42.420> 58<00:02:43.420> when<00:02:44.140> t6<00:02:44.530> which<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:45.430> now

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
from 56 to 58 when t6 which is now

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.539 
from 56 to 58 when t6 which is now
giving<00:02:46.000> me<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.150> quarter<00:02:46.780> note<00:02:46.930> pulse<00:02:47.549> remember

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
giving me a quarter note pulse remember

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.039 
giving me a quarter note pulse remember
it's<00:02:48.670> very<00:02:48.760> important<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.239> keep<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.480> to

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
it's very important to keep it to

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.770 
it's very important to keep it to
remember<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.980> tempo<00:02:51.430> has<00:02:52.060> not<00:02:52.299> changed

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
remember that the tempo has not changed

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.289 
remember that the tempo has not changed
and<00:02:52.959> it's<00:02:53.769> we're<00:02:54.040> still<00:02:54.220> at<00:02:54.340> 104<00:02:54.910> beats<00:02:55.120> per

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
and it's we're still at 104 beats per

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.940 
and it's we're still at 104 beats per
minute<00:02:55.599> it's<00:02:56.049> just<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.410> point<00:02:56.560> of<00:02:56.739> reference

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
minute it's just the point of reference

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.710 
minute it's just the point of reference
has<00:02:57.310> changed<00:02:57.700> we<00:02:57.880> went<00:02:58.060> from<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.299> quarter<00:02:58.599> note

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
has changed we went from a quarter note

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.350 
has changed we went from a quarter note
to<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.200> half<00:02:59.440> note<00:02:59.680> to<00:03:00.220> finally<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.819> whole<00:03:01.150> note

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
to a half note to finally a whole note

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:21.780 
to a half note to finally a whole note
to<00:03:02.140> what<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.380> sounds<00:03:02.620> like<00:03:19.799> okay<00:03:20.799> so<00:03:21.609> that

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
to what that sounds like okay so that

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.680 
to what that sounds like okay so that
was<00:03:21.940> at<00:03:22.350> 26<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.620> now<00:03:24.579> I'm<00:03:24.730> gonna<00:03:24.819> try<00:03:25.090> one<00:03:25.480> more

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
was at 26 and now I'm gonna try one more

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.210 
was at 26 and now I'm gonna try one more
time<00:03:25.989> I'm<00:03:26.260> gonna<00:03:26.410> take<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.680> in<00:03:26.769> half<00:03:26.920> one<00:03:27.160> more

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
time I'm gonna take it in half one more

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.660 
time I'm gonna take it in half one more
time<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.609> go<00:03:27.670> down<00:03:27.819> to<00:03:27.970> 13<00:03:28.450> which<00:03:29.230> is<00:03:29.680> now<00:03:30.069> once

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
time and go down to 13 which is now once

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.300 
time and go down to 13 which is now once
every<00:03:31.150> two<00:03:31.420> measures<00:03:32.230> which<00:03:32.590> is<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.769> lot<00:03:33.280> of

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
every two measures which is a lot of

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.610 
every two measures which is a lot of
space<00:03:33.640> now<00:03:34.239> before<00:03:34.690> you<00:03:34.780> do<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.019> once<00:03:35.319> I<00:03:35.410> turn

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
space now before you do this once I turn

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.920 
space now before you do this once I turn
it<00:03:35.739> on<00:03:36.030> it's<00:03:37.030> gonna<00:03:37.150> take<00:03:37.329> me<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.480> second<00:03:37.720> or<00:03:37.810> two

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
it on it's gonna take me a second or two

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.210 
it on it's gonna take me a second or two
to<00:03:37.959> find<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.290> quarter<00:03:38.620> note<00:03:38.799> so<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.040> want<00:03:39.190> to

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
to find the quarter note so I want to

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.229 
to find the quarter note so I want to
find<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.459> quarter<00:03:39.670> note<00:03:39.790> before<00:03:39.910> I<00:03:40.000> start

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
find the quarter note before I start

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.970 
find the quarter note before I start
playing<00:03:40.510> all<00:03:41.019> right<00:03:41.079> here<00:03:41.410> we<00:03:41.530> go<00:03:41.560> wish<00:03:41.829> me

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980

luck

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.390 

okay<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.440> kind<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.680> felt<00:04:16.889> like<00:04:16.919> I<00:04:17.070> found<00:04:17.220> it

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
okay so I kind of felt like I found it

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.990 
okay so I kind of felt like I found it
there<00:04:17.549> at<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:17.760> end<00:04:19.070> anyway<00:04:20.070> so<00:04:20.729> that's<00:04:20.850> a

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
there at the end anyway so that's a

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.730 
there at the end anyway so that's a
great<00:04:21.269> way<00:04:21.449> to<00:04:21.479> start<00:04:21.840> relying<00:04:22.260> more<00:04:22.500> on<00:04:22.560> your

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
great way to start relying more on your

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.960 
great way to start relying more on your
internal<00:04:22.979> time<00:04:23.220> clock<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.460> getting<00:04:23.760> away

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
internal time clock and getting away

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.700 
internal time clock and getting away
from<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.240> metronome<00:04:24.630> another<00:04:25.320> little<00:04:25.560> trick

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
from the metronome another little trick

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.490 
from the metronome another little trick
for<00:04:25.949> you<00:04:26.100> this<00:04:26.669> time<00:04:26.880> I've<00:04:27.060> taken<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.720> little

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
for you this time I've taken a little

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.580 
for you this time I've taken a little
click<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:28.949> I've<00:04:29.580> set<00:04:30.479> it<00:04:30.510> up<00:04:30.660> so<00:04:31.229> that<00:04:31.410> I'm

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
click and I've set it up so that I'm

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.830 
click and I've set it up so that I'm
gonna<00:04:31.740> hear<00:04:32.039> three<00:04:32.880> full<00:04:33.120> measures<00:04:33.449> of<00:04:33.600> click

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
gonna hear three full measures of click

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.230 
gonna hear three full measures of click
and<00:04:34.260> then<00:04:34.380> now<00:04:34.530> we<00:04:35.490> went<00:04:35.669> back<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:35.880> quarter

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
and then now we went back to quarter

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.090 
and then now we went back to quarter
notes<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:36.660> then<00:04:37.380> what's<00:04:37.560> going<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.710> happen<00:04:37.800> is

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
notes and then what's going to happen is

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.409 
notes and then what's going to happen is
the<00:04:38.190> click<00:04:38.370> is<00:04:38.490> just<00:04:38.639> going<00:04:38.760> to<00:04:38.820> drop<00:04:39.060> out<00:04:39.240> for

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
the click is just going to drop out for

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.260 
the click is just going to drop out for
a<00:04:39.479> whole<00:04:39.660> measure<00:04:40.039> come<00:04:41.039> back<00:04:41.220> for<00:04:41.910> two<00:04:41.940> beats

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
a whole measure come back for two beats

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.820 
a whole measure come back for two beats
or<00:04:42.630> two<00:04:42.780> measures<00:04:43.139> and<00:04:43.229> then<00:04:43.320> drop<00:04:43.680> out

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
or two measures and then drop out

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.040 
or two measures and then drop out
another<00:04:44.220> time<00:04:44.729> for<00:04:44.760> a<00:04:44.970> whole<00:04:45.150> measure<00:04:45.330> so<00:04:45.900> here

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
another time for a whole measure so here

00:04:46.050 --> 00:05:17.839 
another time for a whole measure so here
it<00:04:46.139> is<00:05:15.410> now<00:05:16.410> I'm<00:05:16.800> going<00:05:17.070> to<00:05:17.130> do<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.340> same<00:05:17.520> thing

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
it is now I'm going to do the same thing

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.909 
it is now I'm going to do the same thing
except<00:05:18.630> we're<00:05:19.169> gonna<00:05:19.289> start<00:05:19.500> dropping<00:05:19.650> out

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
except we're gonna start dropping out

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.029 
except we're gonna start dropping out
for<00:05:20.190> two<00:05:20.610> measures<00:05:20.760> at<00:05:21.060> a<00:05:21.120> time<00:05:21.650> now<00:05:22.650> before<00:05:22.950> we

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
for two measures at a time now before we

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.200 
for two measures at a time now before we
start<00:05:23.099> this<00:05:23.400> I<00:05:23.520> should<00:05:23.669> say<00:05:23.820> that<00:05:23.940> we've<00:05:24.060> taken

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
start this I should say that we've taken

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.839 
start this I should say that we've taken
the<00:05:24.510> tempo<00:05:25.050> down<00:05:25.080> 90<00:05:25.830> and<00:05:26.070> that's<00:05:26.550> something

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
the tempo down 90 and that's something

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:27.980 
the tempo down 90 and that's something
you<00:05:26.970> really<00:05:27.360> want<00:05:27.539> to<00:05:27.599> do<00:05:27.690> during<00:05:27.870> your

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
you really want to do during your

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.839 
you really want to do during your
practice<00:05:28.410> session<00:05:28.740> is<00:05:28.889> try<00:05:29.190> to<00:05:29.250> vary<00:05:29.669> the

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
practice session is try to vary the

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.640 
practice session is try to vary the
metronome<00:05:30.240> settings<00:05:30.630> as<00:05:30.750> much<00:05:30.930> as<00:05:31.080> you<00:05:31.200> can

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
metronome settings as much as you can

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.560 
metronome settings as much as you can
faster<00:05:32.370> is<00:05:32.490> definitely<00:05:32.970> not<00:05:33.090> harder

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
faster is definitely not harder

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.210 
faster is definitely not harder
especially<00:05:34.289> when<00:05:34.650> you're<00:05:34.740> doing<00:05:34.830> this<00:05:35.010> kind

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
especially when you're doing this kind

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.100 
especially when you're doing this kind
of<00:05:35.340> stuff<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:36.090> it's<00:05:36.479> really<00:05:36.630> important<00:05:37.080> that

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
of stuff and it's really important that

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.370 
of stuff and it's really important that
you<00:05:37.380> play<00:05:37.830> it<00:05:37.889> all<00:05:38.099> different<00:05:38.760> tempos<00:05:39.380> so

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
you play it all different tempos so

00:05:40.380 --> 00:06:13.330 
you play it all different tempos so
we're<00:05:40.740> at<00:05:40.800> 90<00:05:41.099> now<00:05:41.220> and<00:05:41.900> here<00:05:42.900> we<00:05:42.990> go

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.050 

maybe<00:06:14.340> I<00:06:14.430> can<00:06:14.550> do<00:06:14.610> that<00:06:14.700> one<00:06:14.850> again<00:06:15.000> so<00:06:16.970> here<00:06:17.970> we

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
maybe I can do that one again so here we

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:58.760 
maybe I can do that one again so here we
go<00:06:55.130> okay<00:06:56.360> so<00:06:57.360> there<00:06:57.480> you<00:06:57.510> have<00:06:57.600> it<00:06:57.750> uh<00:06:58.020> you

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
go okay so there you have it uh you

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.080 
go okay so there you have it uh you
could<00:06:58.919> take<00:06:59.070> this<00:06:59.190> as<00:06:59.340> far<00:06:59.370> as<00:06:59.640> you<00:06:59.760> want<00:06:59.790> you

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090

can<00:07:00.210> go<00:07:00.300> to<00:07:00.330> three<00:07:00.630> measures<00:07:00.960> four<00:07:01.200> measures

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
can go to three measures four measures

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.990 
can go to three measures four measures
whatever<00:07:01.860> you<00:07:02.040> think<00:07:02.550> you<00:07:02.640> can<00:07:02.790> work<00:07:02.910> yourself
