00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.419
 well these are from two to a new video 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.490
 good it seems that on the 26th you 

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:08.530
 we can have a supposed announcement of a 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.540
 new pokémon good supposedly announcing 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.910
 an announcement of a new pokémon that 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.580
 they predict that it will be a surprising announcement 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.939
 about pokemon so announced by the 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.369
 Japanese magazine famitsu and this announcement 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.960
 it will occur on August 26 basically 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.820
 we have speculations that it can be 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.310
 from a new movie to a new one 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.439
 video game I would bet because it can be 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.040
 some games are saying that it could 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.810
 be a fighting game called poker 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.630
 Paraguayan is still a fighting game 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.690
 although well done will not be a game of 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:44.440
 fight because very well done style 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.820
 Naruto and others like that handsome handsome with super 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.220
 attacks and all this would be pretty 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.440
 well according to how other 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.570
 options would be that there is a game of 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.400
 commercial pokemon letters for pc and 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.440
 You could go ipad but do not think 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.580
 that's a surprising and safe announcement 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.470
 if only Catalan like an eleven 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.290
 surprising the publication is therefore going 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.960
 to lose a lot of cache we could say in 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.980
 that good sense on the 26th you can see it 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.630
 live 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.549
 you have basically 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.799
 the stream in the description itself 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.219
 you want to spend the day doing it 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.960
 I do not know what time it is at 10 p.m. 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.780
 japan I do not know how many hours apart 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.000
 we take in Japan but I think 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.130
 enough are nine or ten I do not know 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.320
 I do not know it does not give me any fucking case because 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.450
 schedule I'm very bad so good that 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.799
 we'll be able to see it live from all 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.590
 ways I'm going to upload the news about 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.170
 what is the same day 26 so 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.490
 do not worry about this but 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.679
 if you want to see it live, well, yes 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.849
 you have the link to take a look I do not know 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.830
 speculate that you can 

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.780
 try I hope that as it is but as I say 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.030
 make it for a pokémon game 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.280
 slaughter because as I say the lack 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.170
 catalog of games and a pokémon 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.390
 a good pokémon would be good enough 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.000
 I mean one that is interesting 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.560
 assist the pokemon this language or something or 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.289
 something like that a pokémon with 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.729
 stories and long and cool good to do 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.380
 great things so good we'll see 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.759
 see what it's about on the 26th and we won 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.759
 in the next video will be next
