introducing so all the objects in the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.700 
introducing so all the objects in the
match<00:01:35.880> will<00:01:36.240> be<00:01:36.420> working<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.140> physics<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
match will be working with physics and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.410 
match will be working with physics and
so<00:01:37.829> everything<00:01:38.759> will<00:01:38.850> look<00:01:38.970> different<00:01:39.119> every

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
so everything will look different every

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.420 
so everything will look different every
single<00:01:39.509> time<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.869> play<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.009> tables

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
single time you play it's on the tables

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.280 
single time you play it's on the tables
will<00:01:41.700> break<00:01:41.939> different<00:01:42.299> ways<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:43.079> won't<00:01:43.200> see

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
will break different ways you won't see

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.109 
will break different ways you won't see
the<00:01:43.470> same<00:01:43.680> scripted<00:01:44.310> moves<00:01:44.549> break<00:01:44.939> through

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
the same scripted moves break through

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.510 
the same scripted moves break through
the<00:01:45.180> tables<00:01:45.479> every<00:01:45.689> single<00:01:45.960> time<00:01:46.250> we<00:01:47.250> really

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the tables every single time we really

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.580 
the tables every single time we really
want<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.759> recreate<00:01:48.240> those<00:01:48.450> crazy<00:01:48.930> TLC<00:01:49.409> matches

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
want to recreate those crazy TLC matches

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.300 
want to recreate those crazy TLC matches
you<00:01:49.829> see<00:01:49.950> ando<00:01:50.189> w<00:01:50.549> program<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:52.079> we're<00:01:53.040> able<00:01:53.130> to

do that with smacked immersive Rob this
year<00:01:54.810> 2011<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:56.040> TLC<00:01:56.610> match<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.060> going<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.240> be

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
year 2011 the TLC match is going to be

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.510 
year 2011 the TLC match is going to be
completely<00:01:58.020> blown<00:01:58.259> out<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.740> now<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.340> gonna

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
completely blown out and now it's gonna

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.950 
completely blown out and now it's gonna
be<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> lot<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.820> fun<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.180> think<00:02:00.390> fans<00:02:00.570> gonna<00:02:00.869> be

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
be a lot of fun we think fans gonna be

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.569 
be a lot of fun we think fans gonna be
able<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.710> know<00:02:01.770> create<00:02:02.009> some<00:02:02.159> crazy

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
able to you know create some crazy

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.940 
able to you know create some crazy
moments<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.060> their<00:02:03.180> own<00:02:03.329> on

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
moments of their own on

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.200 
moments of their own on
okay<00:02:04.399> all<00:02:04.640> right<00:02:04.759> well<00:02:04.789> let's<00:02:05.030> talk<00:02:05.149> about

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
okay all right well let's talk about

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.520 
okay all right well let's talk about
exactly<00:02:05.750> how<00:02:05.869> this<00:02:06.079> is<00:02:06.200> going<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:06.409> work

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
exactly how this is going to work

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.680 
exactly how this is going to work
because<00:02:06.740> what<00:02:07.490> what<00:02:07.729> does<00:02:07.850> dynamic<00:02:08.300> physics

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
because what what does dynamic physics

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.270 
because what what does dynamic physics
do<00:02:08.840> for<00:02:09.019> the<00:02:09.080> objects<00:02:09.379> that<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.709> didn't<00:02:10.039> do<00:02:10.129> in

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
do for the objects that it didn't do in

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.130 
do for the objects that it didn't do in
years<00:02:10.519> past<00:02:10.580> yeah<00:02:11.239> what's<00:02:11.660> going<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.840> happen

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
years past yeah what's going to happen

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.930 
years past yeah what's going to happen
is<00:02:12.230> that<00:02:12.319> each<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:12.830> know<00:02:12.920> each<00:02:13.099> object<00:02:13.340> itself

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
is that each you know each object itself

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.210 
is that each you know each object itself
is<00:02:14.209> going<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.599> be<00:02:14.750> moving<00:02:15.560> with<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:15.830> physics

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
is going to be moving with this physics

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.650 
is going to be moving with this physics
system<00:02:16.610> so<00:02:16.819> every<00:02:17.030> single<00:02:17.269> time<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.420> interact

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
system so every single time you interact

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.900 
system so every single time you interact
with<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.260> it's<00:02:18.890> going<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.099> be<00:02:19.190> dynamic<00:02:19.730> it's

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
with it it's going to be dynamic it's

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.339 
with it it's going to be dynamic it's
not<00:02:20.030> going<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.239> be<00:02:20.300> a<00:02:20.360> scripted<00:02:20.810> events<00:02:20.900> when<00:02:21.290> I

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
not going to be a scripted events when I

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.199 
not going to be a scripted events when I
pick<00:02:21.560> up<00:02:21.709> a<00:02:21.800> ladder<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.700> throw<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.090> at

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
pick up a ladder and I throw it at

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.240 
pick up a ladder and I throw it at
someone<00:02:23.420> is<00:02:23.599> going<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.810> throw<00:02:24.230> like<00:02:24.739> a<00:02:24.769> normal

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
someone is going to throw like a normal

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.250 
someone is going to throw like a normal
platter<00:02:25.849> with<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.150> throne<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.989> it's<00:02:27.170> going

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
platter with the throne and it's going

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.390 
platter with the throne and it's going
to<00:02:27.319> hit<00:02:27.470> your<00:02:27.590> opponent<00:02:27.709> it's<00:02:28.099> going<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.280> go

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
to hit your opponent it's going to go

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.460 
to hit your opponent it's going to go
flying<00:02:28.550> down<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.840> also<00:02:29.959> when<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.230> break<00:02:30.440> a

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
flying down and also when you break a

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.860 
flying down and also when you break a
table<00:02:30.890> sometimes<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:32.000> doesn't<00:02:32.420> always<00:02:32.480> break

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
table sometimes it doesn't always break

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.330 
table sometimes it doesn't always break
right<00:02:33.049> in<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.200> middle<00:02:33.349> right<00:02:33.500> sometimes<00:02:34.220> it

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
right in the middle right sometimes it

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.979 
right in the middle right sometimes it
breaks<00:02:34.459> off<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.849> side<00:02:35.090> sometimes<00:02:35.750> doesn't

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
breaks off to the side sometimes doesn't

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.660 
breaks off to the side sometimes doesn't
you<00:02:36.049> break<00:02:36.290> maybe<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.650> legs<00:02:36.860> get<00:02:37.130> swept<00:02:37.519> up

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
you break maybe the legs get swept up

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.150 
you break maybe the legs get swept up
from<00:02:37.940> under<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.660> collapses<00:02:39.200> we<00:02:39.980> really

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
from under it and it collapses we really

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.309 
from under it and it collapses we really
want<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.370> bring<00:02:40.549> out<00:02:40.670> all<00:02:40.700> those<00:02:41.090> moments<00:02:41.450> so

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
want to bring out all those moments so

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.270 
want to bring out all those moments so
that's<00:02:42.530> what<00:02:42.650> some<00:02:42.799> of<00:02:42.829> the<00:02:42.950> things<00:02:43.099> you<00:02:43.190> can

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
that's what some of the things you can

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.190 
that's what some of the things you can
go<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.430> see<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:44.390> build<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.630> pro<00:02:44.780> people<00:02:45.049> two

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
go to see you build a pro people two

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.449 
go to see you build a pro people two
ladders<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:45.680> ladders<00:02:45.890> will<00:02:45.980> actually<00:02:46.220> bend

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
ladders and ladders will actually bend

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.850 
ladders and ladders will actually bend
and<00:02:46.670> break<00:02:47.079> and<00:02:48.079> you'd<00:02:48.290> be<00:02:48.380> able<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.560> stack

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
and break and you'd be able to stack

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.120 
and break and you'd be able to stack
ladders<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:50.120> tables<00:02:50.569> on<00:02:50.720> touhy<00:02:50.870> area<00:02:51.410> of<00:02:51.650> the

not<00:04:19.140> a<00:04:19.170> fun<00:04:19.380> experience<00:04:19.410> so<00:04:20.040> we<00:04:20.580> made<00:04:20.760> sure

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
not a fun experience so we made sure

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.220 
not a fun experience so we made sure
that<00:04:21.090> it's<00:04:21.270> very<00:04:21.450> easy<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.780> put<00:04:21.990> through<00:04:22.170> the

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
that it's very easy to put through the

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.720 
that it's very easy to put through the
tables<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.710> new<00:04:22.890> control<00:04:23.340> is<00:04:23.490> really<00:04:23.640> going

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
tables and a new control is really going

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.250 
tables and a new control is really going
to<00:04:23.790> be<00:04:23.910> able<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.120> make<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:24.540> happen<00:04:24.690> when

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
to be able to make that happen when

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.570 
to be able to make that happen when
something<00:04:25.590> breaks<00:04:25.680> apart<00:04:26.010> like<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.250> ladder<00:04:26.490> or

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
something breaks apart like a ladder or

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.220 
something breaks apart like a ladder or
a<00:04:26.670> table<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.150> pizzas<00:04:27.480> stay<00:04:27.630> in<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.840> ring<00:04:28.020> the

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
a table the pizzas stay in the ring the

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.210 
a table the pizzas stay in the ring the
piece<00:04:28.410> is<00:04:28.440> gonna<00:04:28.650> stay<00:04:28.860> in<00:04:28.890> there<00:04:29.040> for<00:04:29.190> a

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
piece is gonna stay in there for a

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.560 
piece is gonna stay in there for a
little<00:04:29.400> while<00:04:29.640> we<00:04:29.970> want<00:04:30.180> you<00:04:30.270> to<00:04:30.300> be<00:04:30.360> able<00:04:30.420> to

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
little while we want you to be able to

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.300 
little while we want you to be able to
have<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.690> lot<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.020> tables<00:04:31.350> a<00:04:31.560> lot<00:04:31.710> of<00:04:31.860> ladder<00:04:32.040> so

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
have a lot of tables a lot of ladder so

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.440 
have a lot of tables a lot of ladder so
you<00:04:32.700> know<00:04:32.790> eventually<00:04:33.000> we're<00:04:33.180> gonna<00:04:33.270> have

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
you know eventually we're gonna have

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.570 
you know eventually we're gonna have
them<00:04:33.540> fade<00:04:33.780> out<00:04:33.990> but<00:04:34.830> we<00:04:34.890> like<00:04:35.040> the<00:04:35.190> effective

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
them fade out but we like the effective

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.270 
them fade out but we like the effective
time<00:04:35.670> the<00:04:35.820> pieces<00:04:36.180> in<00:04:36.300> there<00:04:36.500> see<00:04:37.500> you<00:04:37.980> check

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
time the pieces in there see you check

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.920 
time the pieces in there see you check
out<00:04:38.340> all<00:04:38.460> your<00:04:38.580> carnage<00:04:39.060> out<00:04:39.210> there<00:04:39.420> you<00:04:39.540> know

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
out all your carnage out there you know

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.170 
out all your carnage out there you know
five<00:04:40.380> broken<00:04:40.650> tables<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:41.520> all<00:04:41.640> that<00:04:41.850> we<00:04:42.000> want

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
five broken tables and all that we want

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.030 
five broken tables and all that we want
you<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.300> be<00:04:42.360> able<00:04:42.390> to<00:04:42.540> see<00:04:42.720> that<00:04:42.870> but<00:04:43.140> yeah<00:04:43.860> in

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
you to be able to see that but yeah in

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.560 
you to be able to see that but yeah in
order<00:04:44.250> for<00:04:44.370> you<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.610> be<00:04:44.670> able<00:04:44.730> to<00:04:44.880> bring<00:04:45.000> out<00:04:45.150> 20

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
order for you to be able to bring out 20

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.760 
order for you to be able to bring out 20
tables<00:04:45.960> whatever<00:04:46.230> it<00:04:46.290> is<00:04:46.350> won't<00:04:46.500> have<00:04:46.680> to

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
tables whatever it is won't have to

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.500 
tables whatever it is won't have to
eventually<00:04:46.950> fade<00:04:47.280> some<00:04:47.520> out<00:04:47.670> right<00:04:48.000> for

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
eventually fade some out right for

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.550 
eventually fade some out right for
performance<00:04:49.050> otherwise<00:04:49.260> you<00:04:49.380> can<00:04:49.470> have

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
performance otherwise you can have

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.970 
performance otherwise you can have
stacks<00:04:49.860> of<00:04:50.130> wood<00:04:50.550> all<00:04:50.730> over<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.030> place<00:04:51.240> and

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
stacks of wood all over the place and

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.380 
stacks of wood all over the place and
well<00:04:52.980> let<00:04:53.040> me<00:04:53.160> ask<00:04:53.250> you<00:04:53.400> then<00:04:53.580> about<00:04:53.790> the

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
well let me ask you then about the

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.850 
well let me ask you then about the
chairs<00:04:54.660> we've<00:04:55.050> talked<00:04:55.290> about<00:04:55.380> tables<00:04:55.740> and

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
chairs we've talked about tables and

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.110 
chairs we've talked about tables and
ladders<00:04:56.130> but<00:04:56.250> chairs<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:56.850> have<00:04:56.940> some

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
ladders but chairs you have some

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.850 
ladders but chairs you have some
specific<00:04:57.420> with<00:04:57.840> new<00:04:58.080> moves<00:04:58.350> for<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.590> chairs

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
specific with new moves for the chairs

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.200 
specific with new moves for the chairs
right<00:04:59.130> that's<00:04:59.310> right<00:04:59.520> yeah<00:04:59.670> cheers<00:04:59.970> we've

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
right that's right yeah cheers we've

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.550 
right that's right yeah cheers we've
also<00:05:00.390> spent<00:05:00.750> some<00:05:00.780> time<00:05:00.900> with<00:05:01.260> that<00:05:01.440> they're

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
also spent some time with that they're

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.990 
also spent some time with that they're
also<00:05:01.680> how<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:02.010> physics<00:05:02.370> working<00:05:02.550> on<00:05:02.760> them<00:05:02.880> as

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
also how the physics working on them as

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.700 
also how the physics working on them as
well<00:05:03.180> but<00:05:03.330> we<00:05:03.720> allow<00:05:03.930> you<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.290> throw<00:05:04.530> the

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
well but we allow you to throw the

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.350 
well but we allow you to throw the
chairs<00:05:04.950> as<00:05:05.190> well<00:05:05.400> now<00:05:05.610> so<00:05:05.910> you<00:05:05.970> can<00:05:06.180> go<00:05:06.300> ahead

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
chairs as well now so you can go ahead

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.940 
chairs as well now so you can go ahead
and<00:05:06.480> pick<00:05:06.900> up<00:05:07.020> a<00:05:07.080> chair<00:05:07.290> throw<00:05:07.560> right<00:05:07.740> at<00:05:07.860> your

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
and pick up a chair throw right at your

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.950 
and pick up a chair throw right at your
opponents<00:05:08.490> do<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.120> lot<00:05:09.300> of<00:05:09.330> new<00:05:09.450> cool<00:05:09.720> moves

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
opponents do a lot of new cool moves

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.660 
opponents do a lot of new cool moves
about<00:05:10.200> it<00:05:10.440> I'm<00:05:10.740> everyone's<00:05:11.220> gonna<00:05:11.400> be<00:05:11.460> able<00:05:11.610> to

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
about it I'm everyone's gonna be able to

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.430 
about it I'm everyone's gonna be able to
check<00:05:11.850> out<00:05:12.000> at<00:05:12.120> e3<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:12.600> it<00:05:12.930> sounds<00:05:13.200> like<00:05:13.260> this

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
check out at e3 and it sounds like this

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.410 
check out at e3 and it sounds like this
physics<00:05:13.890> system<00:05:14.160> will<00:05:14.520> apply<00:05:14.850> itself<00:05:15.300> in

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
physics system will apply itself in

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.730 
physics system will apply itself in
other<00:05:15.630> types<00:05:15.870> of<00:05:15.990> matches<00:05:16.350> right<00:05:16.500> that's

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
other types of matches right that's

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.440 
other types of matches right that's
where<00:05:16.860> I<00:05:16.920> keep<00:05:17.130> saying<00:05:17.310> TLC<00:05:17.880> because<00:05:18.270> that's

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
where I keep saying TLC because that's

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.880 
where I keep saying TLC because that's
the<00:05:18.540> match<00:05:18.750> was<00:05:18.930> showing<00:05:19.230> up<00:05:19.350> but<00:05:19.530> really<00:05:19.680> the

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
the match was showing up but really the

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.950 
the match was showing up but really the
dynamic<00:05:20.550> physics<00:05:20.880> is<00:05:21.000> working<00:05:21.300> through<00:05:21.450> any

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
dynamic physics is working through any

dynamic physics is working through any
weapon<00:05:22.410> whether<00:05:22.830> it's<00:05:23.010> a<00:05:23.040> sledgehammer<00:05:23.310> the

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
steel steps any object that you have in

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.470 
steel steps any object that you have in
the<00:05:26.220> ring<00:05:26.430> it's<00:05:26.940> gonna<00:05:27.030> be<00:05:27.120> using<00:05:27.330> these

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
the ring it's gonna be using these

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.700 
the ring it's gonna be using these
physics<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:28.020> you<00:05:28.140> do<00:05:28.290> a<00:05:28.320> lot<00:05:28.560> of<00:05:28.620> different

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
physics and you do a lot of different

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.970 
physics and you do a lot of different
things<00:05:28.950> with<00:05:29.280> them<00:05:29.460> very<00:05:29.970> nice<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.420> of<00:05:30.690> course

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
things with them very nice and of course

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.230 
things with them very nice and of course
we<00:05:31.980> have<00:05:32.100> the<00:05:32.130> match<00:05:32.400> type<00:05:32.700> but<00:05:32.940> we<00:05:33.030> should

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
we have the match type but we should
