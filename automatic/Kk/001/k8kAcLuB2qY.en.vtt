00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
of view very very wide almost a fisheye

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.959 
of view very very wide almost a fisheye
maybe<00:01:45.079> I<00:01:45.200> don't<00:01:45.350> know<00:01:45.680> I<00:01:45.920> don't<00:01:46.670> know<00:01:46.729> what<00:01:46.850> the

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
maybe I don't know I don't know what the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.480 
maybe I don't know I don't know what the
technical<00:01:47.240> definition<00:01:48.140> of<00:01:48.619> a<00:01:48.740> fisheye<00:01:49.070> is<00:01:49.280> but

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
technical definition of a fisheye is but

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.940 
technical definition of a fisheye is but
this<00:01:49.640> thing<00:01:49.850> is<00:01:49.969> wide<00:01:50.210> now<00:01:51.049> a<00:01:51.079> wide<00:01:51.469> lens<00:01:51.770> is

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
this thing is wide now a wide lens is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.219 
this thing is wide now a wide lens is
great<00:01:52.280> because<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.479> lets<00:01:53.659> you<00:01:53.810> move<00:01:54.020> the

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
great because it lets you move the

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.580 
great because it lets you move the
camera<00:01:54.500> closer<00:01:55.219> to<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.820> source<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:56.509> that

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
camera closer to the source and that

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.260 
camera closer to the source and that
means<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.799> microphones<00:01:58.429> which<00:01:58.789> are<00:01:59.119> these

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
means the microphones which are these

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.440 
means the microphones which are these
cute<00:01:59.539> little<00:01:59.630> pop-up<00:02:00.369> 120<00:02:01.369> degree<00:02:03.130> cardioids

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
cute little pop-up 120 degree cardioids

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.209 
cute little pop-up 120 degree cardioids
this<00:02:05.450> moves<00:02:05.719> the<00:02:05.869> microphones<00:02:06.409> closer<00:02:06.859> when

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
this moves the microphones closer when

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.870 
this moves the microphones closer when
the<00:02:07.399> lens<00:02:07.670> is<00:02:07.880> wider<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:09.460> that<00:02:10.460> gives<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.850> better

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
the lens is wider so that gives a better

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.750 
the lens is wider so that gives a better
direct<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.840> reflected<00:02:12.440> ratio<00:02:12.860> which<00:02:13.190> is<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.400> lot

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
direct to reflected ratio which is a lot

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.640 
direct to reflected ratio which is a lot
of<00:02:13.910> what<00:02:14.120> getting<00:02:14.450> decent<00:02:14.930> sound<00:02:15.200> in<00:02:15.590> a

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
of what getting decent sound in a

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.040 
of what getting decent sound in a
typical<00:02:16.520> home<00:02:16.730> environment<00:02:17.390> is<00:02:17.510> all<00:02:17.720> about

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
typical home environment is all about

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.280 
typical home environment is all about
the<00:02:18.590> lens<00:02:18.710> is<00:02:18.950> also<00:02:19.280> faster<00:02:19.909> and<00:02:20.060> f<00:02:20.209> 2.8<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.140> it

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
the lens is also faster and f 2.8 so it

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
the lens is also faster and f 2.8 so it
should<00:02:21.470> work<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.709> little<00:02:21.830> better

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
should work a little better

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.490 
should work a little better
lowlight<00:02:22.780> although<00:02:23.780> that's<00:02:24.020> never<00:02:24.290> going<00:02:24.470> to

lowlight although that's never going to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.650 
lowlight although that's never going to
be<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.770> strong<00:02:25.069> point<00:02:25.400> of<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.910> camera<00:02:26.300> like

be the strong point of a camera like
this<00:02:28.510> one<00:02:29.510> more<00:02:29.750> cool<00:02:30.050> feature<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.709> they've

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
this one more cool feature that they've

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.690 
this one more cool feature that they've
added<00:02:31.099> that<00:02:31.849> I<00:02:32.020> hoped<00:02:33.020> for<00:02:33.400> here's<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.489> mic

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
added that I hoped for here's a mic

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
input

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.410 
input
it's<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.810> mic<00:02:36.050> line<00:02:36.470> input<00:02:37.400> so<00:02:37.640> you<00:02:37.670> as<00:02:38.300> you

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
it's a mic line input so you as you

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.000 
it's a mic line input so you as you
adjust<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.959> sensitivity<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.680> can<00:02:39.800> go

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
adjust the sensitivity you can go

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.640 
adjust the sensitivity you can go
between<00:02:40.190> mic<00:02:40.700> sources<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.360> line<00:02:41.510> sources<00:02:41.900> it

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
between mic sources and line sources it

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.740 
between mic sources and line sources it
provides<00:02:43.040> plug-in<00:02:43.550> power<00:02:43.760> not<00:02:44.120> phantom<00:02:44.540> power

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
provides plug-in power not phantom power

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.350 
provides plug-in power not phantom power
but<00:02:45.140> plug-in<00:02:45.530> power<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:46.580> mic<00:02:46.790> input<00:02:47.000> is

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
but plug-in power the mic input is

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.570 
but plug-in power the mic input is
always<00:02:47.569> a<00:02:47.750> handy<00:02:48.200> thing<00:02:48.230> because<00:02:48.830> no<00:02:49.370> matter

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
always a handy thing because no matter

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.180 
always a handy thing because no matter
how<00:02:49.849> close<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:51.019> get<00:02:51.200> with<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.470> camera<00:02:51.950> you

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
how close you get with the camera you

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.699 
how close you get with the camera you
can<00:02:53.030> generally<00:02:53.480> get<00:02:53.599> closer<00:02:53.989> with<00:02:54.680> a

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
can generally get closer with a

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.280 
can generally get closer with a
microphone<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.600> separating<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.780> camera

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
microphone and separating the camera

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.259 
microphone and separating the camera
position<00:02:57.830> from<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.250> mic<00:02:58.430> position<00:02:58.640> gives<00:02:59.180> you

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
position from the mic position gives you

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.110 
position from the mic position gives you
a<00:02:59.299> lot<00:02:59.540> more<00:02:59.720> flexibility<00:03:00.700> all<00:03:01.700> right<00:03:01.910> so

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
a lot more flexibility all right so

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.240 
a lot more flexibility all right so
those<00:03:02.299> are<00:03:02.600> those<00:03:03.170> are<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.470> three<00:03:03.739> features<00:03:04.100> I

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
those are those are the three features I

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.800 
those are those are the three features I
was<00:03:04.430> hoping<00:03:04.790> for<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.269> looking<00:03:05.540> for

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
was hoping for and looking for

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.559 
was hoping for and looking for
that<00:03:06.470> caused<00:03:06.769> me<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.640> go<00:03:07.760> ahead<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.150> spring

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
that caused me to go ahead and spring

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.470 
that caused me to go ahead and spring
for<00:03:08.840> this<00:03:08.959> little<00:03:09.260> camera<00:03:09.970> some<00:03:10.970> other<00:03:11.150> things

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
for this little camera some other things

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.620 
for this little camera some other things
that<00:03:11.599> have<00:03:11.720> been<00:03:11.900> added<00:03:12.230> one<00:03:12.950> of<00:03:13.099> them<00:03:13.220> is<00:03:13.400> a

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
that have been added one of them is a

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.380 
that have been added one of them is a
amount<00:03:14.630> that<00:03:15.260> matches<00:03:15.920> things<00:03:16.220> like<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.700> the

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
amount that matches things like the the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.250 
amount that matches things like the the
GoPro<00:03:18.519> equipment<00:03:19.519> so<00:03:19.819> it's<00:03:20.569> a<00:03:20.750> different<00:03:21.110> way

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
GoPro equipment so it's a different way

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.229 
GoPro equipment so it's a different way
to<00:03:21.319> mount<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.709> camera<00:03:21.769> and<00:03:22.340> maybe<00:03:22.730> adds<00:03:23.060> a

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
to mount the camera and maybe adds a

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.570 
to mount the camera and maybe adds a
little<00:03:23.450> flexibility<00:03:24.190> another<00:03:25.190> thing<00:03:25.430> that

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
little flexibility another thing that

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.640 
little flexibility another thing that
they've<00:03:25.730> done<00:03:25.760> is<00:03:26.120> used<00:03:26.359> a<00:03:26.660> rechargeable

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
they've done is used a rechargeable

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.310 
they've done is used a rechargeable
battery<00:03:27.680> instead<00:03:28.549> of<00:03:28.700> doublea's<00:03:30.640> now<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:32.320> q3

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
battery instead of doublea's now the q3

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.900 
battery instead of doublea's now the q3
was<00:03:33.440> famous<00:03:33.859> for<00:03:34.040> really<00:03:34.220> chewing<00:03:34.790> up

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
was famous for really chewing up

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.270 
was famous for really chewing up
batteries<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.500> rechargeable<00:03:37.250> battery

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
batteries so a rechargeable battery

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.009 
batteries so a rechargeable battery
should<00:03:37.670> be<00:03:37.880> more<00:03:38.209> economical<00:03:38.780> in<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.959> long

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
should be more economical in the long

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.740 
should be more economical in the long
run<00:03:39.440> there's<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.310> problem<00:03:40.760> right<00:03:40.970> now<00:03:41.000> because

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
run there's a problem right now because

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.229 
run there's a problem right now because
you<00:03:42.140> can't<00:03:42.380> get<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.650> second<00:03:43.519> battery<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.940> spare

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
you can't get a second battery a spare

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.830 
you can't get a second battery a spare
battery<00:03:44.420> so<00:03:44.930> far<00:03:45.170> but<00:03:46.239> presumably<00:03:47.239> they'll<00:03:47.660> be

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
battery so far but presumably they'll be

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.440 
battery so far but presumably they'll be
available<00:03:48.079> it<00:03:48.890> takes<00:03:49.220> about<00:03:49.430> three<00:03:49.910> hours<00:03:50.090> to

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
available it takes about three hours to

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.750 
available it takes about three hours to
charge<00:03:50.720> through<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.440> USB<00:03:52.040> port<00:03:52.340> which<00:03:52.609> is<00:03:52.639> the

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
charge through the USB port which is the

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.629 
charge through the USB port which is the
only<00:03:53.000> charging<00:03:53.480> method<00:03:53.780> available<00:03:53.959> and<00:03:54.709> it

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
only charging method available and it

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.340 
only charging method available and it
runs<00:03:55.910> out<00:03:56.120> of<00:03:56.389> juice<00:03:56.600> in<00:03:56.750> about<00:03:56.959> two<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.290> a

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
runs out of juice in about two and a

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.240 
runs out of juice in about two and a
half<00:03:57.560> hours<00:03:57.980> I<00:03:58.930> shot<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.109> clock<00:04:00.410> to<00:04:00.889> see<00:04:01.100> how

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
half hours I shot the clock to see how

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.830 
half hours I shot the clock to see how
long<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.639> thing<00:04:01.850> when<00:04:02.000> run<00:04:02.209> and<00:04:02.389> then<00:04:02.480> ran<00:04:02.660> for

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
long the thing when run and then ran for

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.720 
long the thing when run and then ran for
about<00:04:02.930> two<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.380> half<00:04:03.530> hours<00:04:03.859> shooting
