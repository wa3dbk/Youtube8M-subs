00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.179
 well this this I was trying to catch 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.960
 a delicate game has 20 I trust more 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.960
 legit madeleine titÃ­n 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.740
 there will be people who were doing very well I'm 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.740
 here 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.740
 no no no I approach 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.609
 we will separate you that I leave the 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.609
 last here is the point 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.170
 it's the same 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.170
 throughout 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:55.929
 pretty from diego valeri 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:58.500
 come on, if I get a lot, I want 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:02.130
 got the first time I fell 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.240
 I have not fallen, we are not going to have stepped on 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.300
 on where the latter was already Lupine 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.450
 back to see let's go care 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.140
 Care plays the childbirth the bum that I 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.360
 I've spent it saying that uncle a lot 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.360
 childbirth the toy is worth 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.320
 but that throws the problem uncle is that 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.810
 as you do not do everything straight if the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.610
 next point I did not ask for it now 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.899
 I also stay in the last light 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.899
 with everything we stopped 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.040
 speeding up 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.660
 all right 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.850
 sideways 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:15.690
 As I was doing in the middle of the 22 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.810
 for those who do not spend where to leave 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.940
 it's already good, good, good 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.349
 for the pag it is worth the truth that 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.660
 I had a prank because I passed it 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.470
 well do you know 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:32.190
 sure that this time they have blown the trap 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:36.200
 that is worth in that look and fuck and I leave 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:41.030
 good uncle good well good 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.030

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.150

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.450

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.450

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.510

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.950

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:25.799
 Look at where fallen uncle that I made I'm 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.230

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:58.110

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.110

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.470

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.470

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:27.780
 there it is there is the kinematics and the 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.780
 kinematics 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.950
 from point to point is a turn point to 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.670
