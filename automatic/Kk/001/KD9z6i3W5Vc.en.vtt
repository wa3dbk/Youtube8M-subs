00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.180
 flo and welcome today 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.910
 I'll tell you a little bit about that 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.990
 tell concealer and that there is 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.990
 little time 3 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.060
 You know her when to print 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.880
 the top of it and then it comes 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.700
 product out and then try always 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.269
 all somehow the whole product 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.039
 this little brush in the skin 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.410
 distribute and it works mostly 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.140
 not because you always look like 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.789
 each other more 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.699
 and you do not want to be that as well 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:51.609
 it is so after these are currently settling 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.280
 Fine oils simply and the skin works 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.510
 totally low and that actually knows 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.199
 do not say how do you do that yet 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.239
 better 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.219
 you have to first on the right color 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.499
 choose and as I always say do 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.300
 go to the level of the problem 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.409
 that means you have to have dark circles 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.590
 also in the dark council 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.070
 I take medium here and then 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.619
 I always do it so that I am above 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.170
 press the whole on my hand back 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.939
 I really do not even go for it 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.540
 from the edge of very little product 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:26.140
 pick it up and then down here 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.409
 Cheekbone application and with the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.960
 hands really up to work 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.180
 and really right in the skin 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.640
 penetration 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.729
 that is the best and then you have 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.890
 actually a continuous one 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.509
 even color gradient of the same 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.520
 around the eyes where the eye shadow 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.770
 that means only the dark service is 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.170
 you can go in even 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.659
 here, of course, see a lot here 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.850
 to help and here we have the 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.939
 right color chosen 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.009
 totally simply the concealer with us too 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.960
 buy so caspar and of course, too 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.320
 right now works bye bye 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.320
