00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.680
 same way only life and until then 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.390
 here in the case of bad cio is that you have 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.060
 that there is no 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:56.160
 bit if you get too sore to 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:59.430
 You do not know how much bigger you got along. 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.979
 in that difficult time of the left hand 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.750
 according to what happens here we go 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:11.880
 put some interval for example 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:21.110

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.780

 Chromatism is part of the defendant, right? 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:43.820
 you may think the scale is the only one 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.820
 think of the bed is less 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.959

 the music goes easy it would not be like that 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:03.920
 but it would be better if greater than the 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.920
