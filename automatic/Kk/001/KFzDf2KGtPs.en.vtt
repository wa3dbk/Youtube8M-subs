00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 yes my people what is it again 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.299
 hard and dad am starting today i have 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.730
 another borderlands 2 i station 20 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.130
 young today that honors an easter egg 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:17.699
 that we are in the brand new headhunter dlc 5 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:19.199
 and yes it sucks saxonia me 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.520
 wait with skepticism at the dlc have 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.820
 For a long time I wonder if I buy it 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.949
 should 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.600
 because the previous headhunter dlcs 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.490
 Everyone was not so cool so far 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.380
 So were very one-sided were very 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.820
 boring, however, there is one here 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.380
 clear purchase recommendation I have it 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.750
 I'm actually played it 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.739
 pretty cool i did during one 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.379
 mission but discover the state at the same time 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.090
 more when we are there 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.760
 and yes maybe I would like another one 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.829
 play streaming from the dlc would like 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.960
 when I look at it now too time 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.120
 have because I'm just in the morning easter 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.680
 all possibilities time and then I have 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.930
 Tommy time is from tuesday I am 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.879
 then with a buddy our friends in 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.289
 hamburg so I want there too 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.590
 can not make videos 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.710
 So Julius Zeh is that ever 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.030
 so it is not clear to you then wonder 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.189
 why then no videos come then so 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.270
 from tuesday to friday 6 means monday 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.950
 and probably another video and 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.110
 then stop again next week 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.090
 Saturday and now we are already there 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.750
 Here is the easter egg and 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.930
 Although this palm has been made 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.939
 hung 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.130
 and if we just look at each other he sees 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.049
 no longer so alive and he 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.110
 looks in the face already goethe as 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.729
 dead from so reminiscent to find a 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.369
 Bit of zombie and if you are 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.329
 now just the logo of your own what 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.329
 I'm just a blind 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.580
 then look if they notice that here 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.450
 an allusion is on the 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.310
 lettering dead island in the of a 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.229
 palm a zombie or a dead man 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.180
 The hangs then forms in the lettering 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.410
 that and yes I think that's a clear one 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.640
 based on that of the divide logo and yes 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.290
 I already have that with the easter egg 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.520
 Hope you liked that as always 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.080
 if that is that we just have one 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.270
 thumbs high or euro or 1 comment 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.770
 that would make me happy as always and 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.640
 yes, then their people skin and we see 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.640
 goodbye next time
