00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.780
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.750
 of trail running review from germany 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.000
 author 2012 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.360
 before us the new model of the 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.120
 sportive model the god 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.940
 as its name suggests is a model of a 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.880
 gas and helium is very light so 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.480
 so much we have with us a sneaker 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.250
 very light here you can see I do not know if 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.440
 You can perceive this difference in my 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.220
 hands but the truth is that it is very 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.650
 lightweight this sneaker uses the sole 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.309
 all the soles of the vertical model here 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.930
 as you see a very muffled garbage and 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.140
 you can see 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.360
 I flex it pretty easy with some strips 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.570
 with amorphous dynamic technology with 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.280
 some small tacos to pull 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.670
 best 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.670
 and that are hollow to win also 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.530
 weight gain flexibility as you see is very 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.659
 easy it is very easy to fight with certain 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.140
 control here of stability not too much 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.570
 but true yes 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.760
 and a sneaker that has changed in the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.830
 but regarding the verticals to do 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.650
 much more consistent as you see the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.540
 hard plastic here some nerves of 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.710
 plastic that gives a lot of consistency to 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.620
 all the side of the shoe 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.080
 and with a very finite mesh 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.830
 very accelerated 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.320
 and a more or less thick tongue like 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.870
 You see here the foot goes directly into 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.690
 a kind of booty that does not touch for 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.760
 nothing the part is more plastic more 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.250
 Tosca of the shoe that gives more 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.250
 white consistency the sportive has 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.380
 bet to make a shoe in 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.410
 many different colors therefore 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.950
 a shoe more or less easy to 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.380
 training a shoe not so much anymore 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.540
 competition but more a sneaker for 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.460
 go out to train as you see also 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.810
 details like this shooter because they are 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.610
 sneakers 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.130
 this model maybe not so much but other 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.170
 trolleys that cost a lot of 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.780
 put the foot because they are very 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.640
 compressed very subject the foot inside 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.970
 this shoe 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.110
 you have the heel also with certain 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.970
 structures therefore a sneaker 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.040
 to carry more or less every day 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.830
 to go out every day to practice 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.860

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.680

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:43.850

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.850
