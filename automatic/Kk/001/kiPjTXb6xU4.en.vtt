got hooked and now I want to spray

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.700 
got hooked and now I want to spray
everything<00:00:16.119> with<00:00:16.420> this<00:00:16.570> these<00:00:17.020> bright<00:00:17.440> happy

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
everything with this these bright happy

everything with this these bright happy
colors<00:00:19.200> so<00:00:20.200> you<00:00:20.260> do<00:00:20.470> want<00:00:20.650> to<00:00:20.710> experiment<00:00:21.040> a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.280 
colors so you do want to experiment a

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.710 
colors so you do want to experiment a
little<00:00:21.370> bit<00:00:21.520> on<00:00:21.730> some<00:00:21.880> scratch<00:00:22.180> paper<00:00:22.210> to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
little bit on some scratch paper to

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.210 
little bit on some scratch paper to
figure<00:00:22.960> out<00:00:23.140> which<00:00:23.320> colors<00:00:23.770> work<00:00:24.010> well

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
figure out which colors work well

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.950 
figure out which colors work well
together<00:00:24.460> and<00:00:24.910> don't<00:00:25.090> create<00:00:25.330> mud<00:00:25.600> when<00:00:25.870> you

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
together and don't create mud when you

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.930 
together and don't create mud when you
spray<00:00:26.260> one<00:00:26.500> color<00:00:26.770> over<00:00:27.190> the<00:00:27.280> top<00:00:27.520> of<00:00:27.700> another

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
spray one color over the top of another

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.150 
spray one color over the top of another
so<00:00:28.570> I<00:00:28.600> did<00:00:28.870> spend<00:00:29.050> some<00:00:29.260> time<00:00:29.470> expanding<00:00:29.980> with

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
so I did spend some time expanding with

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.180 
so I did spend some time expanding with
that<00:00:30.370> and<00:00:30.640> how<00:00:31.600> far<00:00:31.990> away<00:00:32.289> I<00:00:32.439> need<00:00:32.770> to<00:00:32.920> be<00:00:33.010> to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
that and how far away I need to be to

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.580 
that and how far away I need to be to
get<00:00:33.309> the<00:00:33.430> spray<00:00:33.700> pattern<00:00:33.969> I<00:00:34.300> wanted<00:00:34.780> and<00:00:35.050> I

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
get the spray pattern I wanted and I

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.650 
get the spray pattern I wanted and I
took<00:00:35.650> my<00:00:35.829> project<00:00:36.400> and<00:00:36.550> set<00:00:37.180> it<00:00:37.300> down<00:00:37.390> into<00:00:37.630> a

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
took my project and set it down into a

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.720 
took my project and set it down into a
cardboard<00:00:37.990> box<00:00:38.170> and<00:00:38.650> then<00:00:38.740> take<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.250> zigzag

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
cardboard box and then take the zigzag

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.580 
cardboard box and then take the zigzag
stencil<00:00:40.300> over<00:00:40.480> the<00:00:40.750> top<00:00:40.989> and<00:00:41.260> then<00:00:41.380> I'm<00:00:41.500> going

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
stencil over the top and then I'm going

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.290 
stencil over the top and then I'm going
to<00:00:41.650> start<00:00:41.920> with<00:00:42.010> my<00:00:42.190> lightest<00:00:42.640> color<00:00:42.880> first

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
to start with my lightest color first

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.810 
to start with my lightest color first
which<00:00:43.600> is<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.930> neon<00:00:44.200> yellow<00:00:44.680> and<00:00:45.430> you<00:00:45.520> do<00:00:45.700> want

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
which is the neon yellow and you do want

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.950 
which is the neon yellow and you do want
to<00:00:45.970> make<00:00:46.060> sure<00:00:46.120> that<00:00:46.300> you're<00:00:46.570> not<00:00:46.660> over

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
to make sure that you're not over

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.630 
to make sure that you're not over
saturating<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.560> paper<00:00:47.890> so<00:00:48.220> that<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.430> color

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
saturating the paper so that the color

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.490 
saturating the paper so that the color
you<00:00:49.030> know<00:00:49.180> doesn't<00:00:49.420> seep<00:00:49.810> underneath<00:00:50.290> your

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
you know doesn't seep underneath your

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.860 
you know doesn't seep underneath your
stencil<00:00:50.739> and<00:00:51.160> you<00:00:51.940> do<00:00:52.090> want<00:00:52.239> to<00:00:52.390> spray<00:00:52.690> with

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
conviction like don't wimp out depress

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.450 
conviction like don't wimp out depress
that<00:00:55.540> nozzle<00:00:56.079> firmly<00:00:56.350> like<00:00:56.710> you<00:00:56.860> mean<00:00:57.100> it<00:00:57.130> and

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
that nozzle firmly like you mean it and

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.729 
that nozzle firmly like you mean it and
just<00:00:58.210> determine<00:00:58.780> how<00:00:58.930> far<00:00:59.170> away<00:00:59.290> you<00:00:59.410> need<00:00:59.649> to

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
just determine how far away you need to

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.410 
just determine how far away you need to
be<00:00:59.829> to<00:01:00.040> get<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:00.309> type<00:01:00.520> of<00:01:00.550> coverage<00:01:00.969> and<00:01:01.210> spray

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
be to get the type of coverage and spray

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.150 
be to get the type of coverage and spray
pattern<00:01:01.780> that<00:01:01.930> you<00:01:02.110> want<00:01:02.320> now<00:01:02.559> my<00:01:02.710> project<00:01:03.130> was

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
pattern that you want now my project was

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.050 
pattern that you want now my project was
flat<00:01:03.550> in<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.850> box<00:01:04.089> but<00:01:04.719> you<00:01:04.780> could<00:01:05.079> also<00:01:05.320> try

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
flat in the box but you could also try

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.490 
flat in the box but you could also try
propping<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.210> box<00:01:07.390> or<00:01:07.720> tilting<00:01:08.080> it<00:01:08.170> so<00:01:08.350> that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
propping the box or tilting it so that

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.469 
propping the box or tilting it so that
your<00:01:08.620> project<00:01:08.830> is<00:01:09.100> vertical<00:01:09.670> like<00:01:09.790> tape<00:01:10.060> it<00:01:10.240> to

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
your project is vertical like tape it to

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.060 
your project is vertical like tape it to
the<00:01:10.510> inside<00:01:10.720> of<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:11.049> box<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:11.440> keep<00:01:11.950> it

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
the inside of the box and keep it

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.070 
the inside of the box and keep it
vertical<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.700> I<00:01:13.120> found<00:01:13.450> that<00:01:13.570> I<00:01:13.630> liked<00:01:13.930> it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
vertical and I found that I liked it

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.410 
vertical and I found that I liked it
best<00:01:14.350> when<00:01:14.620> I<00:01:14.680> let<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.040> color<00:01:15.430> hair<00:01:15.790> dry

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
best when I let the color hair dry

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.300 
best when I let the color hair dry
naturally<00:01:16.450> instead<00:01:17.409> of<00:01:17.500> heat<00:01:17.680> setting<00:01:18.040> it<00:01:18.130> for

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
naturally instead of heat setting it for

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.800 
naturally instead of heat setting it for
some<00:01:18.460> reason<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.850> heat<00:01:19.060> seemed<00:01:19.330> to<00:01:19.450> fade<00:01:19.659> the

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
some reason the heat seemed to fade the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.810 
some reason the heat seemed to fade the
color<00:01:20.020> out<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.530> I<00:01:20.619> wanted<00:01:20.830> to<00:01:20.979> keep<00:01:21.220> that<00:01:21.430> neon

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
color out and I wanted to keep that neon

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.870 
color out and I wanted to keep that neon
vibrancy<00:01:22.570> so<00:01:23.260> I<00:01:23.290> let<00:01:23.650> it<00:01:23.770> air<00:01:23.950> dry<00:01:23.979> now<00:01:24.520> i<00:01:24.549> have

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
vibrancy so I let it air dry now i have

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.450 
vibrancy so I let it air dry now i have
to<00:01:25.030> admit<00:01:25.290> my<00:01:26.290> video<00:01:26.590> camera<00:01:26.770> for<00:01:27.010> some<00:01:27.190> reason

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
to admit my video camera for some reason

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.490 
to admit my video camera for some reason
the<00:01:27.520> exposure<00:01:27.909> went<00:01:28.180> all<00:01:28.270> wonky<00:01:28.479> on<00:01:28.750> me<00:01:29.080> and<00:01:29.290> so

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
the exposure went all wonky on me and so

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.380 
the exposure went all wonky on me and so
the<00:01:29.680> vibrancy<00:01:30.220> of<00:01:30.250> these<00:01:30.460> neon<00:01:30.729> colors<00:01:31.150> isn't

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
the vibrancy of these neon colors isn't

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.090 
the vibrancy of these neon colors isn't
showing<00:01:31.810> up<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.290> well<00:01:32.530> during<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.950> video

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
showing up that well during the video

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.240 
showing up that well during the video
but<00:01:33.490> you'll<00:01:33.700> see<00:01:33.880> some<00:01:34.060> still<00:01:34.299> shots<00:01:34.330> later<00:01:34.810> on
