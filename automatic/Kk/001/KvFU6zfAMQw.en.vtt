00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
thing is it kind of makes it smell

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.710 
thing is it kind of makes it smell
olive<00:04:08.290> oil<00:04:08.470> kind<00:04:09.280> of<00:04:09.370> weird<00:04:09.610> but<00:04:09.879> you<00:04:10.480> want<00:04:10.689> to

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
olive oil kind of weird but you want to

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.780 
olive oil kind of weird but you want to
make<00:04:10.840> sure<00:04:10.900> you<00:04:11.230> rinse<00:04:11.439> all<00:04:11.829> of<00:04:12.220> it<00:04:12.340> out<00:04:12.459> and

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
make sure you rinse all of it out and

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.089 
make sure you rinse all of it out and
that's<00:04:12.909> going<00:04:13.180> to<00:04:13.239> take<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.510> few<00:04:14.019> because<00:04:14.260> you

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
that's going to take a few because you

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.990 
that's going to take a few because you
know<00:04:15.220> how<00:04:15.370> oil<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.690> water<00:04:17.019> don't<00:04:17.139> really<00:04:18.000> mix

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
know how oil and water don't really mix

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.200 
know how oil and water don't really mix
so<00:04:19.449> it's<00:04:20.199> going<00:04:20.350> to<00:04:20.440> take<00:04:20.919> a<00:04:20.949> few<00:04:21.130> rinses<00:04:22.030> to

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
so it's going to take a few rinses to

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.420 
so it's going to take a few rinses to
get<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.479> smell<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.199> a<00:04:23.620> little<00:04:24.039> completely

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
get the smell and a little completely

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.180 
get the smell and a little completely
out<00:04:24.580> what<00:04:24.729> what<00:04:24.850> it<00:04:24.970> does<00:04:25.150> is<00:04:25.389> it<00:04:25.570> does<00:04:26.380> wonders

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
out what what it does is it does wonders

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.790 
out what what it does is it does wonders
so<00:04:27.580> when<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.300> do<00:04:28.509> it<00:04:28.660> leave<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.080> olive<00:04:29.440> oil<00:04:29.530> in

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
so when you do it leave the olive oil in

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.999
