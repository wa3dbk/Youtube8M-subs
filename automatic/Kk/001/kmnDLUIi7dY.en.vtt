00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.490
 we are the artichoke in May 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.889
 let's say this artichoke field 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.920
 represents the last passage of the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.730
 This year's cultivation would be the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.859
 late Roman artichoke and some 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.199
 unusual because we are used to 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.689
 eating castro shows the artichoke 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.180
 in the month of February maximum March 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.640
 April, but not us here at the castles 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.439
 Romans we can do thanks to the fact 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.989
 that we have a mild climate 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.450
 we have a lot of volcanic soil 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.280
 particular and very generous 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.700
 puts us in a position to do the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.290
 artichoke even a little later and then 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.200
 that's why we have it in the month le 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.280
 images indeed the testimony as 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.020
 we can see is given by the fact that 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.260
 this artichoke plant or better 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.199
 this artichoke is the first artichoke that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.780
 let's cut both the violet I said also 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:07.470
 top rolo here we take it off 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:10.320
 beautiful colors and leave the others 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.240
 artichokes that are these two that you 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.159
 they call the armrests that though 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.170
 we collect in the following days in the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.229
 following days because I can't 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.979
 become swollen must have the time to 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.400
 grow again and therefore in this 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.680
 moment we take the first step 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.990
 how can you see this field of 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.119
 artichokes are all ready they are ready to 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.960
 gather between today and tomorrow 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.520
 we pass them all together as first 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.100
 passage and then we will arrive later 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.570
 we will return in the following days from about 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.329
 one week ten days 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.170
 to accommodate the armrests the part 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.140
 next one 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.119
 but it does not end here we still have 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.520
 as the very generous white one the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.689
 artichoke gives us more chances of fruit 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.290
 of harvest 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.840
 in fact we have our famous ones 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.840
 artichokes that right now 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.750
 they are very much in demand and desired 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.750
 what is calcium up is we say so 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.700
 represents the third generation of the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.470
 plant of the case because we have the before 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.459
 mom the pro the armrests and then we come 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.769
 with artichokes is much appreciated and 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.360
 this type of product is very valuable 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.519
 because they used it to make ours 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.459
 famous pickled artichokes in oil 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.290
 also called pickles are a lot 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.470
 details or additions are nice 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.200
 beautiful to look at but also because they are 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.180
 sweet are very tasty and there is 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.790
 this time a great demand for 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.099
 little artichokes that we can't even make 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.010
 satisfy because then it is not changed 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.470
 makes it as many as you can see this 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.069
 plant will bring out one 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.170
 see then they are ready for more 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.860
 little ones we would have in about 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.379
 ten days here laterally always 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.299
 baby artichokes that come out of the 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:10.950
 axillary leaves here they gave them 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:14.010
 this is a little bigger here 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:18.000
 every leaf from every leaf that remains 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.430
 a fruit comes out of the artichoke plant 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.980
 a peeping ok 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.739
 here these sprouts are different 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.900
 shape and size the most valuable are 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.970
 those that are closer to the 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.239
 artichokes arms because they come a little 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.430
 larger is a bit more beautiful formats i 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.530
 later are a little more available 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.819
 very good as we can 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.750
 see on this plan for example 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:49.109
 this plant which we have 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:53.130
 already wrong the c marolo you see 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:56.519
 I look for the cut a little if it sees it here 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.530
 has already generated other fruits that are 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.639
 these side as I said every kind 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.500
 but each axillary leaf follows a 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:10.260
 fruit that is 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:14.430
 a head even so say more than it is the 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.430
 our famous artichokes
