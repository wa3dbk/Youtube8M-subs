00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
ok so basically we have the good old

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.429 
ok so basically we have the good old
longevity<00:00:19.890> stick<00:00:20.160> well<00:00:20.310> 250<00:00:20.970> here<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.449> let's

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
longevity stick well 250 here and let's

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.929 
longevity stick well 250 here and let's
just<00:00:22.529> stopped<00:00:22.920> over<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.310> shown<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:23.820> this

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
just stopped over I shown on this

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.759 
just stopped over I shown on this
machine<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.359> force<00:00:24.779> cut<00:00:25.019> down<00:00:25.260> there<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.710> I

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
machine the force cut down there and I

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.470 
machine the force cut down there and I
was<00:00:25.859> like<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.070> know<00:00:26.220> be<00:00:26.699> kinda<00:00:27.029> cool<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.240> see

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
was like you know be kinda cool to see

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.330 
was like you know be kinda cool to see
how<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.750> does<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.260> scratch<00:00:28.560> start<00:00:28.920> tag<00:00:29.189> is

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
how this does the scratch start tag is

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.939 
how this does the scratch start tag is
like<00:00:29.519> yeah<00:00:29.670> sure<00:00:29.910> try<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.359> out<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:31.740> dug

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
like yeah sure try it out so I have dug

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.190 
like yeah sure try it out so I have dug
out<00:00:32.130> my<00:00:32.160> old<00:00:32.430> scratch<00:00:32.759> start<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.420> grig<00:00:33.719> which

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
out my old scratch start to grig which

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.430 
out my old scratch start to grig which
basically<00:00:34.649> consists<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.399> an<00:00:36.120> HTP<00:00:36.719> flow<00:00:37.140> meter

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
basically consists of an HTP flow meter

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.020 
basically consists of an HTP flow meter
and<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.710> bottle<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.070> argon<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:39.360> open<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:41.030> and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
and a bottle of argon just open this and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.810 
and a bottle of argon just open this and
sum<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.540> up<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.379> then<00:00:43.820> basically

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
sum that up like that and then basically

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.360 
sum that up like that and then basically
what<00:00:45.300> happens<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.410> regular<00:00:47.100> gas

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
what happens is we have a regular gas

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.040 
what happens is we have a regular gas
hose<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.180> same<00:00:48.450> hose<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.899> runs

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
hose this is the same hose that runs

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.810 
hose this is the same hose that runs
into<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> back<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.770> my<00:00:49.829> precision<00:00:50.190> TIG<00:00:50.579> just

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
into the back of my precision TIG just

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.119 
into the back of my precision TIG just
unscrewed<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.870> make<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.140> video<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
unscrewed it to make this video that

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.689 
unscrewed it to make this video that
leads<00:00:53.430> down<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:54.800> to<00:00:55.800> where<00:00:56.010> there's<00:00:56.489> all

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
leads down here to where there's all

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490 
leads down here to where there's all
this<00:00:56.910> good<00:00:57.180> stuff<00:00:57.449> right<00:00:57.660> here<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.320> our

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
this good stuff right here we have our

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.680 
this good stuff right here we have our
stick<00:00:58.739> electrode<00:00:59.219> holder<00:00:59.579> which<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.149> where<00:01:00.480> we

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
stick electrode holder which is where we

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.630 
stick electrode holder which is where we
get<00:01:00.809> power<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.379> into<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.739> take<00:01:01.980> rig<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.489> then

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
get power go into this take rig and then

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.759 
get power go into this take rig and then
we<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.300> power<00:01:03.570> block<00:01:03.930> or<00:01:04.170> power<00:01:04.320> lug<00:01:04.650> I

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
we have this power block or power lug I

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.039 
we have this power block or power lug I
think<00:01:04.979> they<00:01:05.129> call<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.180> red<00:01:06.450> hose<00:01:06.689> is

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
think they call it and this red hose is

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.590 
think they call it and this red hose is
a<00:01:07.110> gas<00:01:07.830> hose<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.580> there's<00:01:08.760> also<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.119> copper

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
a gas hose and there's also a copper

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.030 
a gas hose and there's also a copper
line<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.320> that's<00:01:10.530> how<00:01:10.619> we're<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
line in it so that's how we're going to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.190 
line in it so that's how we're going to
get<00:01:11.189> our<00:01:11.310> electric<00:01:12.210> flowing<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.869> it's

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
get our electric flowing and it's

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.600 
get our electric flowing and it's
actually<00:01:13.530> kind<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.799> dangerous<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.189> use<00:01:14.460> this

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
actually kind of dangerous to use this

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.249 
actually kind of dangerous to use this
as<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.330> there<00:01:15.540> should<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.990> rubber

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
as is we there should be like a rubber

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.380 
as is we there should be like a rubber
boot<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.710> covers<00:01:16.979> over<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.460> electrode

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
boot that covers over that electrode

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.460 
boot that covers over that electrode
holder<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.869> don't<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.140> one<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.320> those

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
holder but I don't have one of those

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.920 
holder but I don't have one of those
things<00:01:19.939> so<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.509> red<00:01:21.720> hose

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
things so then we have this red hose

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.499 
things so then we have this red hose
which<00:01:22.170> comes<00:01:22.439> down<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.240> goes<00:01:24.240> all<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
which comes down here and goes all the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.999 
which comes down here and goes all the
way<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.110> torch<00:01:25.439> which<00:01:25.650> should<00:01:25.890> be

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
way up to that torch which should be

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.870 
way up to that torch which should be
getting<00:01:26.310> gas<00:01:26.520> now<00:01:28.100> yeah<00:01:29.100> good

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
getting gas now yeah good

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.819 
getting gas now yeah good
all<00:01:30.150> right<00:01:30.420> ah<00:01:30.630> let's<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.320> you're<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.650> going

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
let's see we're going to need a lecture

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.609 
let's see we're going to need a lecture
negative<00:01:38.869> jeans<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:40.049> I've<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.170> switch

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
negative jeans like I've just switch

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.520 
negative jeans like I've just switch
these<00:01:40.829> two<00:01:40.860> around

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530
