00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.699
 clear 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.880
 It is life as beautiful as it is 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.340
 but plankton has always been one 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.560
 new plan evolved to the secret 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.409
 formula of the crabs citizens come to him 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.060
 absolutely wants himself he absolutely wants 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.299
 the secret formula of the crabs citizens 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.490
 have to finally mister crepes and the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.210
 clearest crÃªpes behind 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.900
 can and with the trash can 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.790
 to become successful with his 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.950
 restaurant but had a 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.109
 especially perfidious plan devised the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.439
 In the end this leads to a wholly wiki 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:36.509
 moths in a kind of sinks apokalypse 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.579
 and only Spongebob and his friends 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.710
 the power of the ideas and the 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.749
 possibility with cinema offered to save him 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.789
 The big question , of course, will be you 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:46.679
 it is part of this 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.720
 Rescue plan says they are for it 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:54.490
 even go ashore till do 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.490
 local chef that can do it all 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.860
 I admit I was very very very very 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.420
 very skeptical at the beginning than me 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.670
 see the first 3d pictures of spongebob 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.650
 So did you have to say what they 3d 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.690
 Implementation of let's say cartoon 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.340
 start concerns hollywood in the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.380
 That was not always the last ten years 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.630
 very happy about that as these first 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.340
 Spongebob 3d animations again on 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.770
 beach seen trailer have seen 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.980
 since I was really so well if that way 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.680
 but works the first calm 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.959
 Can I give you the 3d directly? 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.770
 Country life may make a quarter 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.440
 the film from the rest is flawless 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.209
 spongebob wonderfully gorgeous stupid 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.490
 cartoon and that's exactly what it is 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.990
 what's great about this thames 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.060
 if you take a first picture 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.860
 remember he was really great 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.810
 how do you think the bar is natural 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.240
 very high for this second film 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.280
 and that starts in which he tries one 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.620
 to establish something bigger story too 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.110
 with antonio banderas as pirate as 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.860
 real pirate what are you doing with there 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.420
 my form 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:12.090
 you mean 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:14.700
 both forms extremely colorful extremely wants 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.830
 and it makes a lot of sense in it 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.030
 his own internal logic that is 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.130
 really at the moment where the movie is on 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.860
 So strongest is when we are in 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:28.500
 are cartoon segment and if the 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.520
 fantasy knows no limits golf 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.980
 history 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.019
 I've seen that one 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.150
 fun to have had really got me 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.819
 really just pleased that 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.800
 which is a kind of a very nice one 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.140
 we always have anarchic humor 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.140
 can and can live out so much 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.150
 with the camera under annika though me 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.940
 here was talking 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.530
 what is there criticism of the film that 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.440
 thing is of course if you like abt 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.299
 Speckles and everything is free 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.739
 you run fast danger at some point 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.569
 get tired because you are always new 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.610
 and always has to create attractions 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.380
 it must be exciting that is a high one 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.910
 Number of bars that can not always hold 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.160
 as there are moments where the movie is like that 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.709
 has light hangover and this whole 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.000
 outside history if it could be his 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.919
 girlfriend moving ashore 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.840
 which is always saying when you have that 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.840
 Trailer has seen in most trains 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.560
 no longer super surprisingly told 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.630
 All this means summarized 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.410
 SpongeBob SquarePants 3D can by me 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.419
 get no other rating than before 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.370
 wonderful starfish for a very 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.740
 Worth seeing movie in which one but 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.660
 I believe a slight spongebob 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.350
 should have affinity or as it is 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.910
 affinity to total chaos around 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.050
 its cost to come but then can 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.050
 you have a lot of fun in the film 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.490
