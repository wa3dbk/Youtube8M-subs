00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
so let's get into the vehicle itself

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.210 
so let's get into the vehicle itself
it's<00:00:21.119> one<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.600> course<00:00:21.840> as<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.800> knew<00:00:23.070> it

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
it's one that of course as we knew it

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.340 
it's one that of course as we knew it
started<00:00:23.490> life<00:00:23.910> as<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.330> echo<00:00:24.660> then<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.080> course

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
started life as the echo then of course

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.740 
started life as the echo then of course
evolved<00:00:25.800> into<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.310> years<00:00:26.580> but<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:27.630> is

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
evolved into the years but what is

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.990 
evolved into the years but what is
interesting<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.500> why<00:00:28.800> we're<00:00:29.160> launching<00:00:29.369> here

and for sub compacts and compact cars in

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.770 
and for sub compacts and compact cars in
general<00:00:46.579> it's<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.730> more<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:47.969> an<00:00:48.090> urban<00:00:48.210> center

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
general it's a more of an urban center

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.290 
general it's a more of an urban center
you<00:00:49.200> know<00:00:49.289> tighter<00:00:49.530> streets<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.760> these

you know tighter streets and and these

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.760 
you know tighter streets and and these
types<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.690> vehicles<00:00:52.050> are<00:00:52.140> sought<00:00:52.350> after<00:00:52.379> by

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
types of vehicles are sought after by

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.529 
types of vehicles are sought after by
the<00:00:52.829> consumers<00:00:53.309> here<00:00:53.550> because<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> their

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the consumers here because of their

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.630 
the consumers here because of their
agility<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.890> also<00:00:56.010> their<00:00:56.250> versatility

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
agility there but also their versatility

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.340 
agility there but also their versatility
and<00:00:56.940> especially<00:00:57.329> with<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.960> new<00:00:58.109> years

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and especially with the the new years

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.740 
and especially with the the new years
you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.710> see<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.000> it<00:01:00.000> serves<00:01:00.239> not<00:01:00.480> only<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
you can see that it serves not only a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.689 
you can see that it serves not only a
purpose<00:01:01.500> as<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> commuter<00:01:02.100> vehicle<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.579> an

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
purpose as a commuter vehicle in an

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.579 
purpose as a commuter vehicle in an
urban<00:01:02.940> setting<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.510> also<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.930> family<00:01:04.260> vehicle

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
urban setting but also a family vehicle

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.649 
urban setting but also a family vehicle
for<00:01:04.710> many<00:01:04.830> Quebecers<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.880> when<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.450> take<00:01:06.630> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
for many Quebecers so when we take a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.510 
for many Quebecers so when we take a
look<00:01:06.840> at<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> vehicle<00:01:07.229> now<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.680> do<00:01:08.220> see

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
look at the vehicle now we do see

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.429 
look at the vehicle now we do see
something<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.330> definitely<00:01:09.869> different

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
something that is definitely different

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.350 
something that is definitely different
in<00:01:10.740> respect<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.189> some<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> styling<00:01:12.030> cues

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
in respect to some of the styling cues

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.300 
in respect to some of the styling cues
but<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:12.689> should<00:01:12.869> also<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.290> into<00:01:13.650> why<00:01:13.979> those

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
but we should also get into why those

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.590 
but we should also get into why those
styling<00:01:14.700> cues<00:01:14.939> are<00:01:15.090> occurring<00:01:15.450> especially

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
styling cues are occurring especially

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.560 
styling cues are occurring especially
for<00:01:16.560> aerodynamics<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.610> keeping<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.119> air<00:01:18.150> as

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
for aerodynamics and keeping the air as

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.870 
for aerodynamics and keeping the air as
efficient<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.409> yeah<00:01:19.680> absolutely

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
efficient as it is yeah absolutely

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.460 
efficient as it is yeah absolutely
you'll<00:01:20.880> notice<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.509> Aris<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.960> now<00:01:22.140> it's

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
you'll notice that the Aris is now it's

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.539 
you'll notice that the Aris is now it's
a<00:01:22.530> little<00:01:22.740> bit<00:01:22.860> lower<00:01:23.070> than<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.340> previous

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
a little bit lower than the previous

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.190 
a little bit lower than the previous
generation<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.750> also<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.990> little<00:01:25.110> bit

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
generation but it's also a little bit

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.770 
generation but it's also a little bit
longer<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.909> really<00:01:27.090> does<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> lot<00:01:27.600> to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
longer and that really does a lot to

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.870 
longer and that really does a lot to
increase<00:01:28.080> interior<00:01:28.500> space<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.070> you're<00:01:29.729> ending

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
increase interior space so you're ending

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.460 
increase interior space so you're ending
up<00:01:30.000> with<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> lot<00:01:30.240> more<00:01:30.360> cargo<00:01:30.869> volume<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.380> lot

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
up with a lot more cargo volume a lot

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.740 
up with a lot more cargo volume a lot
more<00:01:31.680> room<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:31.920> passengers<00:01:32.270> on<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.420> outside

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
more room for passengers on the outside

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.359 
more room for passengers on the outside
though<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.439> look<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> vehicle<00:01:35.250> is

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
though the the look of the vehicle is

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.460 
though the the look of the vehicle is
much<00:01:35.909> more<00:01:36.030> streamlined<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.900> little<00:01:37.229> bit<00:01:37.320> more

addressed<00:01:41.729> because<00:01:42.420> as<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:42.780> know

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
addressed because as we know

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.020 
addressed because as we know
aerodynamics<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> big<00:01:44.040> part<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.399> reducing

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
it is the fact that even at a car at

it is the fact that even at a car at
that<00:04:15.280> level<00:04:15.670> we're<00:04:15.880> actually<00:04:16.060> getting<00:04:16.479> into

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
that level we're actually getting into

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.320

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
the interior we hear a lot of still a

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.110 
the interior we hear a lot of still a
lot<00:04:24.880> of<00:04:24.970> misconceptions<00:04:25.660> that

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
lot of misconceptions that

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.100 
lot of misconceptions that
just<00:04:26.240> because<00:04:26.449> the<00:04:26.540> car<00:04:26.720> is<00:04:26.840> in<00:04:27.020> this

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
just because the car is in this

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.530 
just because the car is in this
subcompact<00:04:27.740> segment<00:04:28.430> that<00:04:28.580> perhaps<00:04:29.090> it's<00:04:29.419> of

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
subcompact segment that perhaps it's of

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.750 
subcompact segment that perhaps it's of
lower<00:04:29.720> quality<00:04:30.199> but<00:04:30.229> with<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.160> heirs<00:04:31.340> it's

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
lower quality but with the heirs it's

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.430 
lower quality but with the heirs it's
proof<00:04:32.030> that<00:04:32.240> someone<00:04:32.840> can<00:04:33.020> have<00:04:33.139> a<00:04:33.199> vehicle

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
proof that someone can have a vehicle

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.070 
proof that someone can have a vehicle
that's<00:04:33.740> small<00:04:34.070> that's<00:04:34.340> agile<00:04:35.060> versatile<00:04:35.690> but

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
that's small that's agile versatile but

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.430 
that's small that's agile versatile but
still<00:04:36.350> of<00:04:36.639> incredible<00:04:37.639> quality<00:04:38.180> incredible

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
still of incredible quality incredible

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.650 
still of incredible quality incredible
dependability<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:39.620> reliability<00:04:39.710> so<00:04:40.340> that's

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
dependability and reliability so that's

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.700 
dependability and reliability so that's
one<00:04:41.660> of<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.810> key<00:04:41.960> features<00:04:42.350> I<00:04:42.380> think<00:04:42.410> of<00:04:42.620> the

one of the key features I think of the

one of the key features I think of the
the<00:04:42.979> new<00:04:43.100> years<00:04:43.340> is<00:04:43.580> not<00:04:43.699> only<00:04:43.850> the<00:04:43.970> looks<00:04:44.150> and

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
the new years is not only the looks and

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.760 
the new years is not only the looks and
the<00:04:44.300> outside<00:04:44.660> of<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.870> new<00:04:44.990> handling<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:45.650> new

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
the new versatility in space but also
