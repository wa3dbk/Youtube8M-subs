on<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> show<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.460> media<00:00:39.059> host<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.930> also

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
on the show because a media host is also

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.920 
on the show because a media host is also
a<00:00:40.350> co<00:00:40.649> actor<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.610> we're<00:00:41.760> hoping<00:00:42.059> he<00:00:42.210> tell<00:00:42.809> us

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930

some<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> answers<00:00:43.469> or<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.100> was<00:00:44.190> some<00:00:44.399> clues

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
some of the answers or it was some clues

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.469 
based on our movie which is which is sad
because<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:14.729> really<00:01:14.939> looking<00:01:15.030> forward<00:01:15.210> to

playing<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.560> also<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.860> think<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.189> fact<00:01:17.340> that

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
playing and also I think the fact that

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.640 
playing and also I think the fact that
office<00:01:18.090> they're<00:01:18.210> not<00:01:18.330> allowing<00:01:18.570> us<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.840> talks

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
office they're not allowing us to talks

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.249 
office they're not allowing us to talks
about<00:01:19.920> equal<00:01:20.310> opportunity<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.720> think<00:01:21.960> ABC

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
about equal opportunity and I think ABC

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.289 
about equal opportunity and I think ABC
does<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.130> they've<00:01:23.400> given<00:01:23.580> everyone<00:01:24.030> in

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
does just that they've given everyone in

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.820 
does just that they've given everyone in
our<00:01:24.420> country<00:01:24.689> equal<00:01:24.990> opportunity<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.619> come
