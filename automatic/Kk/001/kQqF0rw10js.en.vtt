check this thing out

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.990 
check this thing out
it's<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.260> four<00:02:36.410> g63<00:02:36.890> non<00:02:37.130> turbo<00:02:37.370> motor<00:02:37.730> which

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
it's the four g63 non turbo motor which

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.490 
it's the four g63 non turbo motor which
is<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.300> exact<00:02:38.570> same<00:02:38.750> as<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.080> turbo<00:02:39.350> version

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
is the exact same as the turbo version

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.340 
is the exact same as the turbo version
except<00:02:40.010> obviously<00:02:40.400> no<00:02:40.580> turbo<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.900> cams

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
except obviously no turbo and the cams

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.180 
except obviously no turbo and the cams
are<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.590> little<00:02:42.740> different

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
are a little different

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.310 
are a little different
a<00:02:43.340> couple<00:02:43.820> other<00:02:43.940> small<00:02:44.210> changes<00:02:44.570> but<00:02:44.780> other

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
a couple other small changes but other

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.780 
a couple other small changes but other
than<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.860> whole<00:02:46.010> motor<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.459> pretty<00:02:46.670> much

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
than that the whole motor is pretty much

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.760 
than that the whole motor is pretty much
the<00:02:47.000> same<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:47.720> let's<00:02:47.840> go<00:02:47.959> ahead<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.230> pop<00:02:48.620> the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
the same so let's go ahead and pop the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.190 
the same so let's go ahead and pop the
valve<00:02:48.950> cover<00:02:49.190> off<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.640> I'm<00:02:50.570> lazy<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:50.990> we're

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
valve cover off and I'm lazy so we're

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.670 
valve cover off and I'm lazy so we're
gonna<00:02:51.290> do<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.709> easy<00:02:51.890> way

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.369 

so<00:02:59.250> poet<00:02:59.640> check<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.849> water<00:03:00.000> pump<00:03:00.299> off<00:03:00.510> we<00:03:00.840> turn

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
so poet check the water pump off we turn

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.140 
so poet check the water pump off we turn
the<00:03:01.560> crank<00:03:01.709> over<00:03:02.099> when<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.849> timing<00:03:03.120> belt

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
the crank over when the timing belt

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.360 
the crank over when the timing belt
everything<00:03:03.599> was<00:03:03.690> still<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.319> we<00:03:05.250> can

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
everything was still on it and we can

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.610 
everything was still on it and we can
hear<00:03:05.519> metal<00:03:05.879> scraping<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:07.110> really<00:03:07.379> wasn't
