I'm working with a 12 by 18 sheet of
paper<00:00:36.940> and<00:00:37.899> it's<00:00:38.890> just<00:00:39.100> regular<00:00:39.250> construction

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
paper and it's just regular construction

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.770 
paper and it's just regular construction
paper<00:00:40.000> and<00:00:40.989> first<00:00:41.379> thing<00:00:41.500> you<00:00:41.590> needs<00:00:41.769> to<00:00:41.859> do<00:00:41.980> is

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
paper and first thing you needs to do is

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.650 
paper and first thing you needs to do is
fold<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:44.320> paper<00:00:44.530> in<00:00:44.890> half<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:46.300> need<00:00:46.449> to<00:00:46.539> make

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
fold the paper in half you need to make

00:00:46.660 --> 00:01:01.220 
fold the paper in half you need to make
sure<00:00:46.690> that<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.109> corners<00:00:47.399> line<00:00:48.399> up

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.660 

and<00:01:02.000> make<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> solid<00:01:03.600> crease<00:01:03.979> all<00:01:04.979> along<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and make a solid crease all along the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.139 
and make a solid crease all along the
edge<00:01:08.990> then<00:01:09.990> open<00:01:10.259> it<00:01:10.350> back<00:01:10.439> up<00:01:11.060> you're<00:01:12.060> going

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
edge then open it back up you're going

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.080 
edge then open it back up you're going
to<00:01:12.270> use<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.479> crease<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.320> your<00:01:14.360> cutting<00:01:15.360> line

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
to use that crease as your cutting line

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.999 
to use that crease as your cutting line
take<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> ruler<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:19.250> from<00:01:20.250> each<00:01:20.520> edge<00:01:23.360> make<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
take a ruler and from each edge make a

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.690 
take a ruler and from each edge make a
line<00:01:26.009> at<00:01:26.310> an<00:01:26.789> inch<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> half<00:01:28.009> right<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
line at an inch and a half right in the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.950 
line at an inch and a half right in the
middle<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:32.280> using<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> crease<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.659> an<00:01:33.810> inch

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
middle so using the crease go an inch

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.770 
middle so using the crease go an inch
and<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> half<00:01:34.170> up<00:01:34.940> and<00:01:36.170> draw<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> line<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:39.420> then

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
and a half up and draw a line and then

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.770 
and a half up and draw a line and then
you<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.259> same<00:01:40.440> thing<00:01:41.659> to<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> other

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
you just do the same thing to the other

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.889 
you just do the same thing to the other
side<00:01:42.990> now<00:01:47.270> your<00:01:48.270> paper<00:01:48.450> should<00:01:48.569> look<00:01:48.750> like

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
side now your paper should look like

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.279 
side now your paper should look like
this

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:06.250 

on<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.630> line<00:01:59.810> cut<00:02:00.500> one

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.310 

cut<00:02:06.920> -<00:02:07.660> we're<00:02:08.660> gonna<00:02:08.750> go<00:02:08.840> ahead<00:02:08.900> and<00:02:08.990> take<00:02:09.140> this

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
cut - we're gonna go ahead and take this

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.140

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
page and set it off to the sides take

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.320 
page and set it off to the sides take
another<00:02:14.390> sheet<00:02:16.690> do<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.810> same<00:02:18.050> process<00:02:19.330> lining

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
that those two lines match make sure

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:05.390 
that those two lines match make sure
that<00:02:56.960> your<00:02:57.110> corners<00:02:57.560> match<00:02:59.380> and<00:03:00.380> just<00:03:01.930> press

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.809 

right<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.510> middle<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:08.370> what<00:03:08.700> you're

going to do again you're going to
measure<00:03:11.700> an<00:03:12.299> inch<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.110> half<00:03:13.140> from<00:03:14.420> this

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
measure an inch and a half from this

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:28.350 
measure an inch and a half from this
edge
