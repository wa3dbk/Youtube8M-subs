00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.710
 Y 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.629
 [Music] 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.139
 to me personally the music accompanies me 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:20.039
 all of life so he acted by listening 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.070
 music so it's like very natural 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.120
 for me if I can that in acting to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.190
 music 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.070
 but because in reality what I want is 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.280
 sing the ambulance all that side 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.890
 musical that I have with tints of 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:42.300
 acting but it's really how it is 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:45.930
 the pure artist that each one brings is 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.980
 it seems to me that each one found him as 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.090
 the individuality of that rock star 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.300
 we explore many of our things and 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:00.089
 we came to this rock vitro much more 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:02.720
 Mature settled and more spread out 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:05.759
 let's say all the tasks are more 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.590
 democratic we could say for this 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.390
 continuous movement which is what 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.909
 characterizes the ambulant state 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.520
 that we are interested in exploring not 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.290
 not the stillness 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.140
 let's call it rigidity or mathematics 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.450
 that demands music for us is more 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.450
 well the anti mathematical 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:36.410
 for me while more entertainment 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.450
 there may be it in the view of the viewer 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.490
 It is better for me 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.670
 because because I put myself on the side of 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.880
 viewer that I would like to see 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.299
 movements all the time with sounds 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.790
 then I do that from Chiquito have 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.490
 the boeing 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.780
 and that's what each ambulance will be 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.780
 did unconsciously 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.940
 A program 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.340
 [Music] 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.340
 very nice very special program 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.710
 Guillermo francella continues to explore his 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.120
 and the millions and millions of 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.150
 possibilities that you have as an actor and 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.340
 as a comedian 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.680
 through 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.200
 so yes very very happy to form 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.900
 part of the unit this is the name of your 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.030
