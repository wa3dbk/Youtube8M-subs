00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
been working really well but two times a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.080 
been working really well but two times a
week<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:11.870> use<00:02:12.020> my<00:02:12.170> Clarisonic<00:02:12.830> Mia<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.940> have

week I use my Clarisonic Mia and I have

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.730 
week I use my Clarisonic Mia and I have
to<00:02:14.240> use<00:02:14.360> like<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.570> little<00:02:14.870> cleanser<00:02:15.200> on<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.530> to

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
to use like a little cleanser on it to

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.740 
to use like a little cleanser on it to
lather<00:02:16.250> up<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.760> soap<00:02:16.970> up<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.420> clean<00:02:17.630> my

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.390 
lather up and to soap up and to clean my
face<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:18.530> is<00:02:18.680> really<00:02:18.830> perfect<00:02:19.070> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
face so this is really perfect the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.610 
face so this is really perfect the
cleanser<00:02:19.790> does<00:02:20.240> get<00:02:20.420> kind<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.660> expensive<00:02:20.780> so

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
cleanser does get kind of expensive so

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.140 
cleanser does get kind of expensive so
again<00:02:21.830> this<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.130> just<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.340> sample<00:02:22.490> size<00:02:22.850> but

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
again this is just a sample size but

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.880 
again this is just a sample size but
it's<00:02:23.450> actually<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:24.020> pretty<00:02:24.080> decent<00:02:24.320> sample

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
it's actually a pretty decent sample

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.550 
it's actually a pretty decent sample
size<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.340> i'll<00:02:25.400> probably<00:02:25.670> get<00:02:26.230> close<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.410> like

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
size and i'll probably get close to like

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.720 
size and i'll probably get close to like
three<00:02:27.800> weeks<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.220> month<00:02:28.280> out<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.610> this

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
three weeks to a month out of this

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.100 
three weeks to a month out of this
because<00:02:28.880> i<00:02:29.000> only<00:02:29.150> use<00:02:29.300> my<00:02:29.390> clarisonic<00:02:29.959> like

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.510 
because i only use my clarisonic like
twice<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.350> week<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:31.010> that's<00:02:31.160> pretty<00:02:31.280> awesome
