00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.660
 the military transport aircraft a400m Bruck Montagen it is the behavior of the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.660
 UBS 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.420
 all 400 at Airbus in Bremen 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.950
 even over ten thousand square meters the hull of the a400m becomes without that 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.500
 Cockpit mounted 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.090
 its individual segments come from different locations in Germany 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.000
 and abroad 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.540
 Teams from each production site construction work here 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.410
 their parts continue 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.510
 a challenge in the construction of a transport plane, he lies in the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.110
 Accommodation of all electronic and hydraulic systems 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.860
 on the roof two loft outlets they belong to the a400m and air conditioning 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.710
 which is similar to that of the giant aircraft a380 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.780
 past the times when soldiers were sweating behind the cockpit 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.750
 and froze at the loading dock 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.990
 even when the loading ramp is open it should be back within ten minutes 20 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.600
 Be warm 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.020
 over 100000 rivets ensure that the environment and stable 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.630
 between five and ten percent, the workers set by hand 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.100
 22,000 holders for different systems are installed 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.189
 for the assembly of the 32 meter long aluminum tube 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.860
 will go through nine stations 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.130
 in series production, a total of around 200 employees per station is to be allowed 8 days 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.130
 need 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.170
 after that, the completely removed fuselage is removed 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.969
 for further assembly with a Beelow even to the sea we transported 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.579
 a good impression as the OMV and especially the freighter look like 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.780
 The model for the caq system, respectively, communicates this work 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.719
 a construction made of wood and original parts 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:16.719
 a highlight in the nearly four by four meter cargo hold of the variable 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.599
 The special feature of the floor is that it is a completely new development that is special 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.409
 for the hard race 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.459
 the transporter has been developed the advantages are that percent 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.469
 the systems are integrated 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.619
 so they are percent always ready for action height they are so to speak 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.689
 Percent hidden in the floor area 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.870
 Lecturers of the hold can be activated at any time in which 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:40.629
 Here you can see roller conveyor can be turned over 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.459
 allow oil and thus for the loading of pallets 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.129
 want the roles were but can be turned back in the 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.599
 The lower areas are hidden in the living area, so to speak 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.310
 and then all vehicles can be loaded quite normal Kremlin wants Chavis 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.689
 Percent whatever 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.889
 The situation requires the mission should be successful 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.209
 and all within 15 minutes 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.999
 The entire freight system is monitored and controlled by LEW Tomas 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:09.329
 Wrecks which here the loadmaster can, among other things, all data about the mission 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.439
 View the load distribution automatically 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.209
 or operate the loading crane 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.369
 via a further control panel, the loadmaster can also do everything directly at the 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:22.369
 Operate the tailgate 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.749
 It will also be more comfortable for the soldiers 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:30.899
 54 new comfortable seats from Autoflug are suspended from the ceiling 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:33.829
 They hold over 180 kilograms 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.930
 Paratroopers left in plane for their patron on 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.649
 For more comfort, the two injured ones are also the standard ones 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:44.649
 correspond to normal passenger machine 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:46.319
 next to the cargo model 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.599
 is a so-called free space 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.819
 in the iron bird, the doors are the ramp karben and hydraulics like in the 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.429
 Originally installed 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:59.019
 Connected to a control station, the approximately 15 employees lead the test 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.809
 Department of functional and stress tests of Offinger parts through 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.919
 in the lab, there are three system tests beaches 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.679
 Doors and ramp 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:13.879
 Riedel and mounts 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.449
 as well as communication 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.729
 so this topic will Heinzelmann or tested in combination for example 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.939
 the meeting and closing of the loading ramp over the los Master Control Panel Â» 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.780
 In about 2000 tests, the approximately 30 are checked with systems 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:40.469
 World novelties elaborate tests highly complex networked technologies 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:44.599
 In it he sees DRS reasons for the increased costs 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.889
 the series production of the new military transport aircraft a400m is supposed to 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.080
 Start in early 2011
