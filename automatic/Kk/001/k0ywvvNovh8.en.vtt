00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.140
 what is it 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.650
 them 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 the very beginning 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.510
 he 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.210
 unknown 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.870
 center center percentage 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.309
 not implemented 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:16.990
 literally a couple 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.229
 m he company 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.289
 except 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:24.909
 France 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.649
 That is why as in Moscow 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:32.589

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.040

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:45.889
 wave 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.559
 a good percentage of the club back 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.149
 2 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:53.899
 I think 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:55.599
 generally needed 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.359
 here are the statistics 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.779
 who can change 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:04.179
