00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.250 

questions<00:02:58.680> for<00:02:58.860> any<00:02:59.040> other<00:02:59.250> videos<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:01.080> play

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
questions for any other videos you play

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.880 
questions for any other videos you play
to<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> part<00:03:01.830> too<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:05.730> as<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.209> can<00:03:06.420> see<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.590> ant

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
to a part too so as you can see the ant

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.150 
to a part too so as you can see the ant
is<00:03:08.280> pretty<00:03:09.030> strong<00:03:09.480> Oh<00:03:09.840> actually<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.950> think

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
is pretty strong Oh actually I think

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.220 
is pretty strong Oh actually I think
that<00:03:11.459> there<00:03:11.850> will<00:03:12.000> be<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.239> part<00:03:12.510> two<00:03:12.720> position

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
that there will be a part two position

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.370 
that there will be a part two position
there<00:03:13.410> will<00:03:13.500> be<00:03:13.530> three<00:03:13.890> winners<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:15.380> Hexbug

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
there will be three winners so Hexbug

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.370 
there will be three winners so Hexbug
and<00:03:18.560> hence<00:03:19.560> bog<00:03:20.060> inch<00:03:21.060> or<00:03:21.330> inch<00:03:21.600> worm<00:03:22.140> and

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
and hence bog inch or inch worm and

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.240 
and hence bog inch or inch worm and
Hexbug<00:03:22.709> spider<00:03:23.190> are<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.120> three<00:03:24.799> so<00:03:25.799> we<00:03:25.950> know

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
Hexbug spider are the three so we know

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.550 
Hexbug spider are the three so we know
that<00:03:26.610> this<00:03:26.850> bug<00:03:27.239> is<00:03:27.600> um<00:03:28.220> it's<00:03:29.220> not<00:03:30.030> weak<00:03:30.420> but

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
that this bug is um it's not weak but

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.530 
that this bug is um it's not weak but
once<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.890> get<00:03:32.010> one<00:03:32.250> attacker<00:03:32.610> into<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.330> wheel

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
once you get one attacker into the wheel

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.180 
once you get one attacker into the wheel
he<00:03:34.230> stops<00:03:34.650> um<00:03:35.070> also<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.720> thought<00:03:37.049> you<00:03:37.350> could

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
he stops um also you I thought you could

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.940 
he stops um also you I thought you could
see<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.750> got<00:03:39.959> stuck<00:03:40.290> right<00:03:40.560> here<00:03:40.590> like

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
see that it got stuck right here like

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:41.240 
see that it got stuck right here like
that

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
that

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.390 
that
that<00:03:41.970> this<00:03:42.709> day<00:03:43.709> was<00:03:44.959> snap<00:03:45.959> cuz<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:46.980> has<00:03:47.010> like

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
that this day was snap cuz it has like

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
that this day was snap cuz it has like
sensors<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:48.450> when<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:49.070> hits<00:03:50.090> it<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.269> go

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
sensors that when it hits it and go

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.520 
sensors that when it hits it and go
backward<00:03:52.310> this<00:03:53.310> one<00:03:53.519> on<00:03:53.640> top<00:03:53.989> so<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.019> could

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
backward this one on top so it could

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.460 
backward this one on top so it could
happen<00:03:55.680> again<00:03:55.860> approved<00:03:56.610> but<00:03:57.600> then<00:03:57.780> we<00:03:58.200> pushed

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
happen again approved but then we pushed

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.710 
happen again approved but then we pushed
it<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.829> we<00:03:58.980> probably<00:03:59.220> went<00:03:59.579> right<00:04:00.180> here<00:04:00.510> and

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
it and we probably went right here and

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.930 
it and we probably went right here and
when<00:04:01.170> on<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:01.890> spider<00:04:02.190> because<00:04:02.519> they<00:04:02.670> had<00:04:02.790> to

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
when on this spider because they had to

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.059 
when on this spider because they had to
find<00:04:03.209> out<00:04:03.390> like<00:04:03.420> it<00:04:04.049> got<00:04:04.260> right<00:04:04.500> into<00:04:04.709> there

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
find out like it got right into there

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.170 
find out like it got right into there
couldn't<00:04:05.430> move<00:04:05.579> so<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.749> got<00:04:07.019> yeah<00:04:08.010> so<00:04:08.310> uh<00:04:08.340> just
