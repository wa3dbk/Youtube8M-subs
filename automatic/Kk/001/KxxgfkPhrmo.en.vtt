00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
hi this is a McGregor how you doing

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.260 
hi this is a McGregor how you doing
today<00:00:03.149> we're<00:00:03.330> going<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.540> be<00:00:03.629> reviewing<00:00:03.959> a

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.270 
today we're going to be reviewing a

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.550 
today we're going to be reviewing a
product<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.420> I<00:00:06.509> picked<00:00:06.690> up<00:00:06.779> at<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:06.990> 2009

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
product that I picked up at the 2009

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.690 
product that I picked up at the 2009
green<00:00:07.890> gear<00:00:08.069> Expo<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:09.150> is<00:00:10.190> least<00:00:11.190> on<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.490> box

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
green gear Expo it is least on the box

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.470 
green gear Expo it is least on the box
it<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.410> unbranded<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:14.009> I'm<00:00:14.790> assuming<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.269> was

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
it is unbranded so I'm assuming that was

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.290 
it is unbranded so I'm assuming that was
purchased<00:00:15.839> out<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.789> made<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:17.940> China

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
purchased out of a made in China

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.810 
purchased out of a made in China
magazine<00:00:19.109> as<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.830> lot<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.250> these<00:00:20.340> things<00:00:20.580> are

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
magazine as a lot of these things are

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.400 
magazine as a lot of these things are
but<00:00:21.210> if<00:00:21.689> you've<00:00:21.810> seen<00:00:22.020> one<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.199> these<00:00:22.320> before

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
but if you've seen one of these before

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.040 
but if you've seen one of these before
they're<00:00:23.279> pretty<00:00:23.460> neat<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> clear

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
they're pretty neat so this is a clear

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.769 
they're pretty neat so this is a clear
flashlight<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.699> kind<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.570> sort<00:00:27.660> of

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
flashlight and it kind of sort of

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.150 
flashlight and it kind of sort of
reminds<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> experiment<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:28.920> used

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
reminds you of the experiment you used

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.859 
reminds you of the experiment you used
to<00:00:29.310> do<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.699> middle<00:00:30.359> school<00:00:30.570> when<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.779> just

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
to do in middle school when you just

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.600 
to do in middle school when you just
learn<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> lot<00:00:31.230> about<00:00:31.560> electricity<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.399> comes

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
learn a lot about electricity it comes

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.450 
learn a lot about electricity it comes
with<00:00:32.759> three<00:00:33.120> LEDs<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.950> here's<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> Ellen

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
with three LEDs and so here's the Ellen

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
with three LEDs and so here's the Ellen
off<00:00:35.550> switch<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:37.050> simply<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:38.040> coil

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
off switch and you simply have a coil

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.490 
off switch and you simply have a coil
right<00:00:39.480> there<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.340> a<00:00:41.340> magnet<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.230> you<00:00:43.230> just

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
right there and a magnet and you just

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:59.440 
right there and a magnet and you just
shake<00:00:44.129> it

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.420 

sometimes<00:01:00.450> it<00:01:00.570> takes<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.870> while<00:01:03.290> okay<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.559> won't

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
sometimes it takes a while okay I won't

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.290 
sometimes it takes a while okay I won't
make<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.640> joke<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.990> uh<00:01:07.050> you<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.729> you

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
make a joke and uh you do that and you

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.050 
make a joke and uh you do that and you
point<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.840> towards<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.170> wall<00:01:10.550> on<00:01:11.550> this<00:01:11.820> for

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
point it towards the wall on this for

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.700 
point it towards the wall on this for
you

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
you

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.370 
you
that<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.890> well<00:01:14.340> that's<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:14.970> three<00:01:15.210> LEDs<00:01:15.720> and

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.969 

an<00:01:19.380> LED<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.570> doesn't<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:22.080> best

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
an LED so it doesn't have the best

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.010 
an LED so it doesn't have the best
quality<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.670> light<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.630> doesn't<00:01:24.869> use<00:01:24.990> any

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
quality of light but it doesn't use any

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.660 
quality of light but it doesn't use any
batteries<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.830> that's<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.100> green<00:01:26.280> benefit

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
batteries so that's a green benefit

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.060 
batteries so that's a green benefit
there<00:01:27.350> when<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.410> took<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.649> on<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.830> plane<00:01:29.039> I

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
there when I took this on the plane I

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.880 
there when I took this on the plane I
was<00:01:29.280> sure<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.910> was<00:01:30.000> gonna<00:01:30.180> get<00:01:30.649> checked<00:01:31.649> out

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
was sure I was gonna get checked out

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.609 
was sure I was gonna get checked out
because<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.340> thing<00:01:32.610> looks<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.410> every<00:01:34.410> bomb

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
because this thing looks like every bomb

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.590 
because this thing looks like every bomb
you've<00:01:34.920> ever<00:01:35.039> seen<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.429> every<00:01:35.670> movie<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.450> got

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
you've ever seen in every movie it's got

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.270 
you've ever seen in every movie it's got
wires<00:01:36.869> running<00:01:37.350> all<00:01:37.500> over<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.710> place<00:01:38.009> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
wires running all over the place and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.910 
wires running all over the place and
magnets<00:01:38.929> but<00:01:39.929> it's<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:42.509> pretty<00:01:42.920> good

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
magnets but it's not so it's pretty good

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.139 
magnets but it's not so it's pretty good
product<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.670> I'm<00:01:45.119> not<00:01:46.820> quite<00:01:47.820> sure<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.030> think

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
product and I'm not quite sure I think

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.560 
product and I'm not quite sure I think
it<00:01:48.390> was<00:01:48.920> $9.99<00:01:49.920> if<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.429> remember<00:01:50.789> but<00:01:51.360> if<00:01:51.450> not

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
it was $9.99 if I remember but if not

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.359 
it was $9.99 if I remember but if not
I'll<00:01:51.750> correct<00:01:51.990> myself<00:01:52.080> on<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.130> written

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
I'll correct myself on the written

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.389 
I'll correct myself on the written
review<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.330> it<00:01:54.750> doesn't<00:01:55.140> mean<00:01:55.229> benefit<00:01:55.649> since

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
review but it doesn't mean benefit since

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.740 
review but it doesn't mean benefit since
it<00:01:56.550> doesn't<00:01:56.759> use<00:01:56.850> any<00:01:56.880> batteries<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.570> will

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
it doesn't use any batteries it will

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.960 
it doesn't use any batteries it will
last<00:01:57.899> for<00:01:58.380> up<00:01:58.440> to<00:01:58.590> 100,000<00:01:59.399> hours<00:01:59.520> because

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
last for up to 100,000 hours because

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.070 
last for up to 100,000 hours because
LEDs<00:02:00.239> last<00:02:00.630> for<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.869> very<00:02:00.899> long<00:02:01.200> time<00:02:01.229> and

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
LEDs last for a very long time and

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.540 
LEDs last for a very long time and
that's<00:02:04.080> pretty<00:02:04.380> much<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.619> I'm<00:02:05.160> not<00:02:05.250> gonna<00:02:05.369> give

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
that's pretty much it I'm not gonna give

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.770 
that's pretty much it I'm not gonna give
a<00:02:05.580> quality<00:02:05.789> rating<00:02:06.090> because<00:02:06.300> I<00:02:06.450> don't<00:02:06.599> think<00:02:06.750> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
a quality rating because I don't think a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.600 
a quality rating because I don't think a
quality<00:02:07.140> light<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:08.190> all<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.670> good<00:02:10.459> but<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.580> is

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
quality light is all that good but it is

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.729 
quality light is all that good but it is
a<00:02:11.730> nice<00:02:11.940> product<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:13.319> gonna<00:02:13.410> be<00:02:13.530> two<00:02:13.620> out
