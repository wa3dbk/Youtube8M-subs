that's exactly what this episode did and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.130 
that's exactly what this episode did and
it<00:02:25.980> definitely<00:02:26.400> built<00:02:26.940> out<00:02:27.150> my<00:02:27.299> expectations

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
it definitely built out my expectations

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.630

or<00:02:28.260> eight<00:02:28.440> Sean's<00:02:28.709> character<00:02:29.160> because<00:02:29.400> this

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
or eight Sean's character because this

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.670 
or eight Sean's character because this
this<00:02:30.030> little<00:02:30.209> section<00:02:30.540> like<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:30.930> guess<00:02:31.230> talent

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
this little section like I guess talent

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.770 
this little section like I guess talent
H<00:02:31.830> on<00:02:32.040> has<00:02:32.280> has<00:02:32.549> been<00:02:32.580> built<00:02:33.030> up<00:02:33.330> so

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
H on has has been built up so

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.690 
H on has has been built up so
technically<00:02:34.260> it's<00:02:34.530> not<00:02:34.620> an<00:02:34.830> ass<00:02:35.040> pool<00:02:35.370> it

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
technically it's not an ass pool it

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.190 
technically it's not an ass pool it
doesn't<00:02:36.000> come<00:02:36.120> out<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.360> nowhere<00:02:36.540> because<00:02:36.989> he

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
doesn't come out of nowhere because he

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.539 
doesn't come out of nowhere because he
has<00:02:37.379> been<00:02:37.650> training<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.250> he<00:02:38.310> has<00:02:38.519> been

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
has been training this and he has been

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.820 
has been training this and he has been
under<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> lot<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.360> constant<00:02:39.930> matches<00:02:40.349> recently

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
under a lot of constant matches recently

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.620 
under a lot of constant matches recently
with<00:02:41.250> all<00:02:41.400> these<00:02:41.580> top<00:02:41.849> players<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.390> he's<00:02:42.480> been

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
with all these top players and he's been

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.229 
with all these top players and he's been
forced<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.049> learn<00:02:43.349> so<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:43.950> liked<00:02:44.519> how<00:02:44.670> H<00:02:44.849> on<00:02:45.060> as<00:02:45.150> a

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
forced to learn so I liked how H on as a

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.580 
forced to learn so I liked how H on as a
character<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.660> developing<00:02:46.079> these<00:02:46.230> different

character is developing these different

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.350 
character is developing these different
moves<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.040> being<00:02:47.310> able<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.579> predict<00:02:48.000> where

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
moves and being able to predict where

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.720 
moves and being able to predict where
the<00:02:48.480> ball<00:02:48.690> will<00:02:48.900> go<00:02:49.170> before<00:02:49.620> even<00:02:50.099> lanza<00:02:50.549> gets

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
