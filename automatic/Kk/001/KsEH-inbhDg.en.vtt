past but not in this game but this gun
is<00:00:36.960> pretty<00:00:37.500> much<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> same<00:00:37.980> exact<00:00:38.340> thing<00:00:38.489> I

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
really like to think of it as an ak-47

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.889 
really like to think of it as an ak-47
because<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.250> pretty<00:00:41.399> much<00:00:41.520> identical<00:00:41.899> you

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
ops 1 it was pretty ok it was pretty

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.459 
ops 1 it was pretty ok it was pretty
average<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.239> gun<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.930> say<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.289> same

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
average and this gun I can say the same

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.450 
average and this gun I can say the same
for<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.800> know<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> pretty<00:00:56.280> average

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
for you know it's a pretty average

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.729 
for you know it's a pretty average
assault<00:00:56.910> rifle<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.750> my<00:00:57.899> opinion<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.350> think<00:00:58.590> it's

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
assault rifle in my opinion I think it's

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.220 
assault rifle in my opinion I think it's
ok<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.910> perform<00:01:00.480> well<00:01:00.629> up<00:01:00.899> at<00:01:01.020> close

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
ok like it can perform well up at close

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.410 
ok like it can perform well up at close
range<00:01:01.530> better<00:01:02.070> than<00:01:02.280> some<00:01:02.520> other<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:03.300> know

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
range better than some other you know

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.479 
range better than some other you know
assault<00:01:03.780> rifles<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.229> SWAT<00:01:04.589> or<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> SMR

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
assault rifles like the SWAT or the SMR

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.090 
assault rifles like the SWAT or the SMR
FAL<00:01:05.970> etc<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.900> think<00:01:07.320> at<00:01:07.409> long-range<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:08.040> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
FAL etc but I think at long-range it's a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.980 
FAL etc but I think at long-range it's a
little<00:01:08.340> bit<00:01:08.460> weak<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:08.970> what<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.479> actually<00:01:09.659> like

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
little bit weak but what I actually like

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.690 
little bit weak but what I actually like
about<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.380> gun<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.799> its<00:01:11.010> iron<00:01:11.220> sights<00:01:11.549> I

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
about this gun is its iron sights I

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.070 
about this gun is its iron sights I
really<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.150> them<00:01:12.330> because<00:01:12.450> they're<00:01:12.720> clear

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
really like them because they're clear

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.450 
really like them because they're clear
you<00:01:13.409> could<00:01:13.560> kind<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.799> see<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:14.010> target<00:01:14.340> at

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you could kind of see your target at

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.910 
you could kind of see your target at
long-range<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.150> especially<00:01:15.840> you'll<00:01:16.619> see<00:01:16.799> me

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
long-range and especially you'll see me

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.340 
long-range and especially you'll see me
use<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.509> stock<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.869> gameplay<00:01:19.080> which

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
sights you'll see me use that in this

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.310 
sights you'll see me use that in this
gameplay<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.509> putting<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.900> stock<00:01:25.140> on

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320

stuff<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:31.079> actually<00:01:31.439> got<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.770> gun<00:01:32.009> pretty

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
stuff and I actually got this gun pretty

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.100 
stuff and I actually got this gun pretty
fast<00:01:32.610> gold<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.509> got<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> hundred

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
fast gold because I got the hundred

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.499 
fast gold because I got the hundred
headshots<00:01:34.560> really<00:01:34.890> quickly<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.460> thought<00:01:36.299> like

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
headshots really quickly I thought like

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.830 
headshots really quickly I thought like
I<00:01:36.600> said<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.250> iron<00:01:38.250> sights<00:01:38.490> were<00:01:38.670> clear<00:01:39.540> and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
I said the iron sights were clear and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.780 
I said the iron sights were clear and
they<00:01:40.140> were<00:01:40.200> easy<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.740> get<00:01:40.890> headshots<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.520> so

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
they were easy to get headshots with so

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.539 
they were easy to get headshots with so
I<00:01:42.000> really<00:01:42.540> didn't<00:01:42.750> need<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:43.110> an<00:01:43.549> optical

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
I really didn't need like an optical

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.789 
I really didn't need like an optical
attachment<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> red<00:01:45.390> dot<00:01:45.600> reflux<00:01:46.140> or<00:01:46.320> ACOG

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
attachment like a red dot reflux or ACOG

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.620 
attachment like a red dot reflux or ACOG
anything<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.090> personally<00:01:48.479> find

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
anything like that and I personally find

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.660 
anything like that and I personally find
that<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:49.049> going<00:01:49.229> with<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.890> iron<00:01:50.189> sights<00:01:50.490> is

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
that just going with the iron sights is

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.120 
that just going with the iron sights is
the<00:01:50.820> best<00:01:51.000> choice<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.570> gun<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.740> think

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the best choice for this gun and I think

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.590 
the best choice for this gun and I think
you<00:01:53.189> guys<00:01:53.310> should<00:01:53.369> try<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.759> out<00:01:53.939> as<00:01:54.119> well<00:01:54.390> and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you guys should try it out as well and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.859 
you guys should try it out as well and
as<00:01:55.229> well<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.770> stock<00:01:56.610> I'm<00:01:56.939> using<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
as well as the stock I'm using the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.080 
as well as the stock I'm using the
quick-draw<00:01:58.500> handle<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.610> stock<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
quick-draw handle and the stock in the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.310 
quick-draw handle and the stock in the
quick-draw<00:02:00.299> handle<00:02:00.450> are<00:02:00.899> really<00:02:01.140> good

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
quick-draw handle are really good

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.690 
quick-draw handle are really good
especially<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.829> assault<00:02:02.159> rifles<00:02:02.280> because

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
especially on assault rifles because

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.120 
especially on assault rifles because
they<00:02:03.450> pretty<00:02:03.630> much<00:02:03.780> enable<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.290> make<00:02:04.950> it

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
they pretty much enable you to make it

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.800 
they pretty much enable you to make it
more<00:02:05.579> like<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> submachine<00:02:06.329> gun<00:02:06.509> make<00:02:06.659> it

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
more like a submachine gun make it

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.510 
more like a submachine gun make it
better<00:02:06.930> up<00:02:07.110> close<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.560> medium<00:02:07.710> range<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.340> I

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
better up close to medium range so I

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.160 
better up close to medium range so I
think<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.030> gun<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.300> pretty<00:02:09.479> versatile<00:02:09.959> like

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
think this gun is pretty versatile like

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.720 
think this gun is pretty versatile like
I<00:02:10.259> said<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.560> know<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.860> can<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.069> used<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.520> long

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
I said you know it can be used that long

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.050 
I said you know it can be used that long
range<00:02:11.940> but<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.360> bit<00:02:12.510> weak

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
range but it's a bit weak

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.089 
range but it's a bit weak
like<00:02:13.270> poor<00:02:13.480> shots<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.870> kill<00:02:14.020> at<00:02:14.230> long<00:02:14.709> ranges

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
like poor shots to kill at long ranges

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.400 
like poor shots to kill at long ranges
but<00:02:15.280> that's<00:02:16.239> how<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.480> kind<00:02:16.599> of<00:02:16.750> is<00:02:16.930> for<00:02:17.200> most

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
but that's how it kind of is for most

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.110 
but that's how it kind of is for most
assault<00:02:17.739> rifles<00:02:18.069> I<00:02:18.250> think<00:02:18.489> with<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.700> stock<00:02:18.940> in

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
assault rifles I think with the stock in

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.400 
assault rifles I think with the stock in
the<00:02:19.209> quick<00:02:19.360> drill<00:02:19.599> you'll<00:02:19.780> be<00:02:19.900> fine<00:02:20.140> and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
the quick drill you'll be fine and

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.809 
the quick drill you'll be fine and
that's<00:02:20.530> what<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.800> usually<00:02:20.980> use<00:02:21.190> with<00:02:21.489> this<00:02:21.610> gun

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
that's what I usually use with this gun

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.850 
that's what I usually use with this gun
as<00:02:22.239> well<00:02:22.330> as<00:02:22.569> that<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:22.780> really<00:02:23.140> like<00:02:23.319> that<00:02:23.590> you

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
as well as that I really like that you

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
definitely try it I think it's one of

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.030 
definitely try it I think it's one of
the<00:02:51.610> better<00:02:51.790> saw<00:02:52.120> rifles<00:02:52.660> in<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.930> game<00:02:53.110> it's

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
the better saw rifles in the game it's

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.680 
the better saw rifles in the game it's
definitely<00:02:54.430> one<00:02:54.549> that<00:02:54.700> I've<00:02:54.790> used<00:02:55.060> more<00:02:55.450> than

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
the Wii U which I thought was pretty

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.259 
the Wii U which I thought was pretty
cool<00:03:41.109> they<00:03:42.010> kind<00:03:42.220> of<00:03:42.310> made<00:03:42.489> it<00:03:42.519> exclusive<00:03:43.150> to

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
cool they kind of made it exclusive to

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.150 
cool they kind of made it exclusive to
the<00:03:43.389> Wii<00:03:43.420> U<00:03:43.720> where<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.170> double<00:03:44.470> XP<00:03:44.799> was<00:03:44.950> only

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
the Wii U where the double XP was only

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.590 
the Wii U where the double XP was only
for<00:03:45.340> people<00:03:45.489> who<00:03:45.670> played<00:03:45.880> headquarters<00:03:46.450> and

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
for people who played headquarters and

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.420 
for people who played headquarters and
the<00:03:47.290> reason<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:47.739> was<00:03:47.950> is<00:03:48.130> because

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
the reason that was is because

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.740 
the reason that was is because
headquarters<00:03:48.910> is<00:03:49.060> probably<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.540> least

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
headquarters is probably the least

headquarters is probably the least
