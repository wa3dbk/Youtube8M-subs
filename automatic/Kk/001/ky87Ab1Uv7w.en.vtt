00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.010 

something<00:01:34.790> like<00:01:34.970> this<00:01:35.240> obviously<00:01:35.720> it's<00:01:35.900> an

something like this obviously it's an

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.350 
something like this obviously it's an
extreme<00:01:36.500> example<00:01:36.680> but<00:01:37.370> this<00:01:37.490> can<00:01:37.940> tend<00:01:38.210> to

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
extreme example but this can tend to

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.930 
extreme example but this can tend to
happen<00:01:38.720> there<00:01:39.530> are<00:01:39.560> ways<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:39.950> overcome<00:01:40.400> these

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
happen there are ways to overcome these

kinds<00:01:41.390> of<00:01:41.510> problems<00:01:42.159> try<00:01:43.159> playing<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.640> left

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
kinds of problems try playing the left

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:54.400 
kinds of problems try playing the left
hand<00:01:44.119> all<00:01:44.360> staccato<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.680> quietly<00:01:53.410> this

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
hand all staccato and quietly this

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.680 
hand all staccato and quietly this
should<00:01:54.680> help<00:01:54.890> with<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.310> rhythmical<00:01:55.970> evenness

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
should help with the rhythmical evenness

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.140 
should help with the rhythmical evenness
it<00:01:57.409> also<00:01:57.560> dissuades<00:01:58.159> any<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.820> fingers

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
it also dissuades any of the fingers

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.030 
it also dissuades any of the fingers
when<00:01:59.330> trying<00:01:59.600> to<00:01:59.750> hang<00:01:59.990> on<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.380> certain<00:02:00.619> notes

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
when trying to hang on to certain notes

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.249 
when trying to hang on to certain notes
and<00:02:01.369> helps<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.150> legato<00:02:04.479> another<00:02:05.479> idea<00:02:05.960> is<00:02:06.050> to

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
and helps the legato another idea is to

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.830 
and helps the legato another idea is to
break<00:02:06.590> up<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:06.979> pattern<00:02:07.369> rhythmically<00:02:08.239> so

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
break up the pattern rhythmically so

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.140 
break up the pattern rhythmically so
rather<00:02:09.050> than<00:02:09.320> playing<00:02:09.530> even<00:02:10.160> quavers<00:02:10.670> try

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
rather than playing even quavers try

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:20.229 
rather than playing even quavers try
this<00:02:11.209> is<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.570> pattern

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.390 

this<00:02:21.239> should<00:02:21.540> help<00:02:21.810> if<00:02:22.110> you're<00:02:22.319> some<00:02:22.650> note<00:02:22.920> may

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
this should help if you're some note may

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.759 
this should help if you're some note may
has<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.640> tendency<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.330> stick<00:02:24.569> out<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.409> maybe

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
has a tendency to stick out and maybe

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.559 
has a tendency to stick out and maybe
even<00:02:26.010> combine<00:02:26.549> this<00:02:26.790> pattern<00:02:27.209> but<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
even combine this pattern but the

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:36.850 
even combine this pattern but the
staccato<00:02:27.870> feel

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.320 

after<00:02:37.860> playing<00:02:38.100> through<00:02:38.400> these<00:02:38.580> examples<00:02:38.820> a

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
after playing through these examples a

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330 
after playing through these examples a
few<00:02:39.540> times<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:40.080> should<00:02:40.140> find<00:02:40.740> when<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.220> go

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
few times you should find when you go

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.520 
few times you should find when you go
back<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.850> original<00:02:41.940> it's<00:02:42.570> much<00:02:42.960> easier<00:02:43.350> to

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
back to the original it's much easier to

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.790 
back to the original it's much easier to
play<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.210> don't<00:02:45.210> forget<00:02:45.600> if<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:46.290> section<00:02:46.650> is

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
play and don't forget if a section is

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.010 
play and don't forget if a section is
particularly<00:02:47.220> tricky<00:02:47.550> keep<00:02:48.270> going<00:02:48.570> back<00:02:48.780> over

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
it for example the very last four bars

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:14.580 
it for example the very last four bars
may<00:02:52.410> provide<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.830> little<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.520> problem

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.320

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
now the aim in the right hand is to keep

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.570 
now the aim in the right hand is to keep
the<00:03:17.480> melody<00:03:17.870> line<00:03:18.080> as<00:03:18.379> smooth<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:19.069> sustained

the great thing about digital pianos is
you<00:03:46.250> can<00:03:46.459> adjust<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:47.150> sound<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:47.780> your

the<00:03:50.870> Cherne<00:03:51.200> I'd<00:03:51.500> actually<00:03:52.099> like<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.609> softer

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.820 

so<00:04:07.610> here<00:04:07.880> I<00:04:08.090> can<00:04:08.270> adjust<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.750> brilliance<00:04:09.140> very

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
so here I can adjust the brilliance very

the pedaling helps to reinforce the
harmonic<00:04:45.650> feel<00:04:45.950> in<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.400> left<00:04:46.580> hand<00:04:46.850> by

your pedal will typically engage on
every<00:04:53.060> dotted<00:04:53.510> crotchet<00:04:53.660> beat

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.560 

there<00:05:08.800> is<00:05:08.920> sometimes<00:05:09.250> a<00:05:09.700> danger<00:05:10.150> amongst

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
students to rely on the sustain pedal

for<00:05:13.060> a<00:05:13.090> legato<00:05:13.510> melody<00:05:14.140> this<00:05:14.440> can<00:05:14.740> sometimes

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
for a legato melody this can sometimes

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.150 
for a legato melody this can sometimes
muddle<00:05:15.880> the<00:05:16.090> melody<00:05:16.510> for<00:05:17.110> example<00:05:17.650> if<00:05:17.860> we<00:05:18.130> look

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
muddle the melody for example if we look

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:27.309

at<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.520> last<00:05:18.730> four<00:05:18.970> bars<00:05:19.300> of<00:05:19.480> this<00:05:19.720> piece

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.959 

so<00:05:28.319> you<00:05:28.379> can<00:05:28.590> hear<00:05:28.830> the<00:05:28.949> last<00:05:29.159> section<00:05:29.939> here

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
so you can hear the last section here

the<00:05:30.689> pedal<00:05:31.050> is<00:05:31.229> muddling<00:05:31.979> the<00:05:32.280> melody<00:05:32.729> let's

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
the pedal is muddling the melody let's
