hi<00:00:04.770> everyone<00:00:05.069> so<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.670> did<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:05.940> video<00:00:06.089> recently<00:00:06.270> of

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
hi everyone so I did a video recently of

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.750 
hi everyone so I did a video recently of
showering<00:00:07.440> with<00:00:07.680> tape<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.040> extensions<00:00:08.580> in

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
showering with tape and extensions in

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.400 
showering with tape and extensions in
and<00:00:09.090> somebody<00:00:09.450> wrote<00:00:09.599> underneath<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.200> and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
and somebody wrote underneath that and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.620 
and somebody wrote underneath that and
asked<00:00:10.710> if<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.860> could<00:00:11.040> do<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> blow-dry<00:00:11.730> segment<00:00:12.420> I

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
asked if I could do a blow-dry segment I

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
asked if I could do a blow-dry segment I
did<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.590> video<00:00:14.070> on<00:00:14.610> week<00:00:14.910> 9<00:00:15.240> where<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.990> me

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
did do a video on week 9 where I have me

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.950 
did do a video on week 9 where I have me
blow<00:00:16.890> drying<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:17.369> tapings<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.240> all<00:00:18.690> of

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
blow drying with tapings in and all of

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
blow drying with tapings in and all of
that<00:00:18.990> but<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.289> was<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.410> really<00:00:19.590> long<00:00:19.830> video

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
that but it was a really long video

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.800 
that but it was a really long video
because<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.550> cut<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.060> styled<00:00:21.330> my<00:00:21.420> hair<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.689> that

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
because I cut and styled my hair in that

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.750 
because I cut and styled my hair in that
video<00:00:21.930> too<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:23.070> wanted<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.340> put<00:00:23.460> one<00:00:23.609> up

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
video too so I just wanted to put one up

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.939 
video too so I just wanted to put one up
of<00:00:23.910> just<00:00:24.210> blow<00:00:24.420> drying<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.650> think<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
of just blow drying and I think the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.380 
of just blow drying and I think the
timing<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.430> good<00:00:26.609> for<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:26.880> because<00:00:27.210> these

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
timing is good for this because these

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.540 
timing is good for this because these
extensions<00:00:27.960> I've<00:00:28.080> had<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.439> about<00:00:28.710> 6<00:00:29.070> or<00:00:29.189> 7

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
extensions I've had in about 6 or 7

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.880 
extensions I've had in about 6 or 7
weeks<00:00:29.580> now<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> left<00:00:31.500> side<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.859> can

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
weeks now and on the left side you can

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.290 
weeks now and on the left side you can
see<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.160> little<00:00:32.460> piece<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.940> getting<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
see that little piece is getting a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.790 
see that little piece is getting a
little<00:00:33.420> bit<00:00:33.630> loose<00:00:33.870> but<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.649> how

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
little bit loose but this is how

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.830 
little bit loose but this is how
extensions<00:00:35.550> look<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.360> know<00:00:36.510> when<00:00:36.660> they've

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
extensions look you know when they've

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.770 
extensions look you know when they've
had<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.079> few<00:00:37.680> weeks<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.430> growth<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
had a few weeks of growth and in the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.240 
had a few weeks of growth and in the
other<00:00:39.899> video<00:00:40.200> where<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.469> was<00:00:40.649> blow-drying<00:00:40.920> my

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
other video where I was blow-drying my

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.819 
other video where I was blow-drying my
hair<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.820> actually<00:00:42.570> had<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.020> installed<00:00:43.620> them

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
hair I actually had just installed them

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.139 
hair I actually had just installed them
so<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.190> think<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.700> way<00:00:44.850> you'll<00:00:45.000> get<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
so I think this way you'll get a

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.150 
so I think this way you'll get a
slightly<00:00:45.539> different<00:00:45.780> perspective<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:47.070> I'm

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
slightly different perspective so I'm

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.700 
slightly different perspective so I'm
using<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.550> John<00:00:47.820> Frieda<00:00:48.239> style<00:00:48.780> revival<00:00:49.469> heat

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
using the John Frieda style revival heat

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.770 
using the John Frieda style revival heat
activating<00:00:50.399> styling<00:00:50.940> spray<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.420> feel<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.690> I

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
activating styling spray I feel like I

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.970 
activating styling spray I feel like I
could<00:00:51.930> say<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.230> my<00:00:52.350> sleek<00:00:52.590> now<00:00:52.710> because<00:00:52.920> I

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
could say that my sleek now because I

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.290 
could say that my sleek now because I
talk<00:00:53.219> about<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.520> all<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> time

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
talk about it all the time

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.420 
talk about it all the time
but<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> really<00:00:55.350> love<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.039> kind<00:00:56.370> of

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
but I really love this it's just kind of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.299 
but I really love this it's just kind of
like<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.640> detangler<00:00:57.600> slashed<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.859> know<00:00:58.980> heat

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
up the other way and it's going resting

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.010 
up the other way and it's going resting
against<00:01:53.220> my<00:01:53.369> hair<00:01:53.549> upside<00:01:53.670> down<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.020> that's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
against my hair upside down and that's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.870 
against my hair upside down and that's
fine<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.680> I'm<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:55.950> really<00:01:56.100> gentle<00:01:56.549> still

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
fine and I'm just really gentle still

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.999 
fine and I'm just really gentle still
but<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> usually<00:01:57.899> do<00:01:58.110> blow-dry<00:01:58.590> my<00:01:58.619> hair

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
but I usually do blow-dry my hair

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.639 
but I usually do blow-dry my hair
most<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.820> way<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.750> every<00:02:01.259> day<00:02:01.290> just

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
most of the way like this every day just

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.280 
most of the way like this every day just
because<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.070> creates<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.430> little<00:02:02.549> more<00:02:02.640> volume

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
because it creates a little more volume

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.270 
because it creates a little more volume
and<00:02:04.290> everything<00:02:04.799> instead<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.159> just

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and everything instead of just

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.130 
and everything instead of just
blow-drying<00:02:05.729> standing<00:02:06.390> straight<00:02:06.689> up<00:02:06.840> I

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
blow-drying standing straight up I

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.600 
blow-drying standing straight up I
prefer<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.770> way

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
prefer this way

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.250 
prefer this way
and<00:02:09.729> then<00:02:10.030> I'll<00:02:10.300> do<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.479> little<00:02:10.720> bit<00:02:10.899> more

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
and then I'll do a little bit more

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.740 
and then I'll do a little bit more
blow-drying<00:02:12.100> standing<00:02:12.820> straight<00:02:13.180> up<00:02:13.390> and

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
blow-drying standing straight up and

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.480 
blow-drying standing straight up and
again<00:02:14.050> I'm<00:02:14.170> being<00:02:14.320> very<00:02:14.560> gentle<00:02:15.130> when<00:02:15.310> I'm

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
again I'm being very gentle when I'm

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.640 
again I'm being very gentle when I'm
brushing<00:02:16.090> my<00:02:16.300> hair<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.960> even<00:02:17.440> though<00:02:17.530> it's

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
brushing my hair and even though it's

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.620 
brushing my hair and even though it's
mostly<00:02:17.920> dry<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.310> still<00:02:18.820> always<00:02:19.060> want<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.510> hold

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
mostly dry you still always want to hold

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.970 
mostly dry you still always want to hold
your<00:02:19.840> hair<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.200> know<00:02:20.320> I<00:02:20.350> talk<00:02:20.620> about<00:02:20.740> this

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
all of that because some of that natural

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.320 
all of that because some of that natural
because<00:03:00.220> some<00:03:00.459> of<00:03:00.489> your<00:03:00.670> natural<00:03:00.820> hair<00:03:01.150> like

because some of your natural hair like
falls<00:03:01.540> over<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.989> tape<00:03:02.200> I<00:03:02.380> still<00:03:02.650> feel<00:03:02.800> like<00:03:02.830> it

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
falls over the tape I still feel like it

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.030 
falls over the tape I still feel like it
secures<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:04.390> um<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:05.230> mean<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.470> think<00:03:05.590> that's<00:03:05.830> I

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
secures it so um I mean I think that's I

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.440 
secures it so um I mean I think that's I
you<00:03:06.370> know<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.580> piece<00:03:06.790> on<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.030> side<00:03:07.209> is

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
you know the piece on the side is

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.990 
you know the piece on the side is
sticking<00:03:07.810> out<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.430> obviously<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.700> know<00:03:09.850> it's

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
sticking out so obviously I know it's

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.940 
sticking out so obviously I know it's
falling<00:03:10.630> but<00:03:10.840> because<00:03:11.350> I'm<00:03:11.650> it's<00:03:11.860> really

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
falling but because I'm it's really

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.920 
falling but because I'm it's really
bright<00:03:12.489> blonde<00:03:12.760> right<00:03:12.970> there<00:03:13.030> if<00:03:13.450> it<00:03:13.810> was<00:03:13.900> a

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
bright blonde right there if it was a

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.180 
bright blonde right there if it was a
little<00:03:14.200> bit<00:03:14.320> darker<00:03:14.500> piece<00:03:14.860> I'm<00:03:14.980> going<00:03:15.100> to

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
little bit darker piece I'm going to

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.060 
little bit darker piece I'm going to
know<00:03:15.250> if<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.400> notice<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:15.880> as<00:03:16.000> much<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:17.070> I

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
know if you notice it as much and I

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.610 
know if you notice it as much and I
think<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:19.030> um<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.810> probably<00:03:20.019> could<00:03:20.350> have<00:03:20.440> kept

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
think that um I probably could have kept

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.590 
think that um I probably could have kept
these<00:03:20.739> extensions<00:03:21.370> in<00:03:21.549> maybe<00:03:21.970> another<00:03:22.390> week

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
these extensions in maybe another week

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.509 
these extensions in maybe another week
or<00:03:22.750> two<00:03:22.810> I<00:03:23.200> know<00:03:23.320> that<00:03:23.650> sounds<00:03:23.920> crazy<00:03:24.070> maybe

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
or two I know that sounds crazy maybe

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.949 
or two I know that sounds crazy maybe
aside<00:03:24.850> from<00:03:25.000> that<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.390> know<00:03:25.510> piece<00:03:25.720> on<00:03:25.870> the

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
aside from that you know piece on the

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.320 
aside from that you know piece on the
side<00:03:26.080> but<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.320> think<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.680> could<00:03:26.980> have<00:03:27.160> kept<00:03:28.060> them

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
side but I think I could have kept them

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.449 
side but I think I could have kept them
in<00:03:28.540> but<00:03:28.900> here's<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.560> thing<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:29.980> feel<00:03:30.220> like<00:03:30.340> they

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
in but here's the thing I feel like they

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.250 
in but here's the thing I feel like they
look<00:03:30.640> okay<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.239> they're<00:03:31.360> fine<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:31.989> all<00:03:32.140> of

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
look okay and they're fine and all of

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.289 
look okay and they're fine and all of
that<00:03:32.440> it's<00:03:32.769> just<00:03:33.040> they<00:03:33.190> feel<00:03:33.549> a<00:03:33.790> little<00:03:34.090> bit

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
that it's just they feel a little bit

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.630 
that it's just they feel a little bit
out<00:03:34.660> of<00:03:34.930> place<00:03:35.290> like<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.709> feel<00:03:35.950> them<00:03:36.160> hanging

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
out of place like you feel them hanging

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.890 
out of place like you feel them hanging
a<00:03:36.730> little<00:03:36.850> bit<00:03:37.060> it's<00:03:37.180> not<00:03:37.239> heavy<00:03:37.570> or<00:03:37.690> anything

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
a little bit it's not heavy or anything

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.960 
a little bit it's not heavy or anything
weird<00:03:38.380> but<00:03:38.620> when<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.280> first<00:03:39.489> put<00:03:39.670> extensions

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
weird but when you first put extensions

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.640 
weird but when you first put extensions
in<00:03:40.209> they're<00:03:40.420> super<00:03:40.720> close<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.080> your<00:03:41.200> scalp<00:03:41.410> and

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
in they're super close to your scalp and

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.380 
in they're super close to your scalp and
then<00:03:41.739> over<00:03:41.980> time<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.519> starts<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.940> kind<00:03:43.090> of<00:03:43.209> fall

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
then over time it starts to kind of fall

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.870 
then over time it starts to kind of fall
down<00:03:43.420> so<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.290> felt<00:03:44.680> like<00:03:44.890> in<00:03:45.160> my<00:03:45.400> head<00:03:45.670> I'm<00:03:45.850> like

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
down so I felt like in my head I'm like

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.520 
down so I felt like in my head I'm like
oh<00:03:46.150> they<00:03:46.450> feel<00:03:46.630> like<00:03:46.750> they're<00:03:46.930> showing<00:03:47.170> or

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
oh they feel like they're showing or

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.840 
oh they feel like they're showing or
they<00:03:47.650> feel<00:03:47.799> like<00:03:47.920> they're<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:48.400> know<00:03:48.519> lower

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
they feel like they're you know lower

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.380 
they feel like they're you know lower
than<00:03:49.239> maybe<00:03:49.900> I'm<00:03:50.260> used<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.160> actually<00:03:52.000> you

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
than maybe I'm used to and actually you

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.340 
than maybe I'm used to and actually you
know<00:03:52.480> throughout<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.810> day<00:03:53.019> I<00:03:53.049> mean<00:03:53.230> they

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
know throughout the day I mean they

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.050 
know throughout the day I mean they
still<00:03:53.590> totally<00:03:54.220> go<00:03:54.370> with<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.610> flow<00:03:54.790> of<00:03:54.820> your

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
still totally go with the flow of your

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.970 
still totally go with the flow of your
hair<00:03:55.269> and<00:03:55.600> I<00:03:55.959> don't<00:03:56.019> you<00:03:56.560> know<00:03:56.620> they<00:03:56.799> never

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
hair and I don't you know they never

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.740 
hair and I don't you know they never
peak<00:03:57.250> through<00:03:57.519> or<00:03:57.760> anything<00:03:57.880> weird<00:03:58.330> like<00:03:58.420> that

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
peak through or anything weird like that

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.720 
peak through or anything weird like that
but<00:03:59.380> I<00:03:59.410> think<00:03:59.680> just<00:03:59.830> because<00:03:59.950> in<00:04:00.250> my<00:04:00.400> own<00:04:00.519> head

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
but I think just because in my own head

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.340 
but I think just because in my own head
I<00:04:00.760> was<00:04:00.970> like<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.209> just<00:04:01.239> want<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.630> redo<00:04:01.870> them<00:04:02.049> and

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
usage out of these tapings but I

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.340 
usage out of these tapings but I
probably<00:04:27.850> just<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.420> be<00:04:28.540> honest<00:04:28.750> with<00:04:28.870> you<00:04:29.080> it's

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
probably just to be honest with you it's

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.870 
probably just to be honest with you it's
probably<00:04:29.470> every<00:04:29.830> six<00:04:30.100> weeks<00:04:30.190> that<00:04:30.550> I<00:04:30.580> change

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880

them out okay and I think that's it I'm
just<00:04:33.790> kind<00:04:33.940> of<00:04:33.970> doing<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.270> final<00:04:34.450> touches

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570

just kind of doing the final touches
right<00:04:35.080> here<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.740> then<00:04:36.190> I'm<00:04:36.460> going<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:36.820> add<00:04:37.300> a
