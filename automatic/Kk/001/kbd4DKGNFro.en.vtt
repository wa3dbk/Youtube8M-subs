so though that would be the two features

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.620 
so though that would be the two features
i<00:03:29.500> would<00:03:29.650> say<00:03:29.829> that<00:03:30.069> we<00:03:30.849> concentrate<00:03:31.389> on<00:03:31.510> those

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
i would say that we concentrate on those

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.539 
i would say that we concentrate on those
other<00:03:32.079> things<00:03:32.440> related<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.920> documentation

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
details on the presentation but i would

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.110 
details on the presentation but i would
say<00:03:38.410> two<00:03:38.470> big<00:03:38.799> points<00:03:39.010> delivery<00:03:39.639> every<00:03:39.880> six

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120

months and the management mechanism is

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.379 
months and the management mechanism is

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
was the the one thing that you would

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.280 
was the the one thing that you would

those<00:03:56.169> two<00:03:56.349> mechanisms<00:03:56.560> that<00:03:57.069> i<00:03:57.130> just

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
those two mechanisms that i just

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.659 
those two mechanisms that i just
mentioned<00:03:57.720> that<00:03:58.889> delivery<00:03:59.889> every<00:04:00.130> six<00:04:00.370> months

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
mentioned that delivery every six months

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.550 
mentioned that delivery every six months
is<00:04:00.790> one<00:04:00.940> of<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.090> key<00:04:01.239> features<00:04:01.450> of<00:04:01.840> receiving
