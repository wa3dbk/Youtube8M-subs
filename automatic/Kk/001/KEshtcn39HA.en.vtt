doing landscape construction so there's

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.840 
doing landscape construction so there's
a<00:00:29.160> number<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.609> how<00:00:29.880> to's<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.960> here<00:00:31.529> as<00:00:31.769> well<00:00:32.130> we

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
a number of how to's in here as well we

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.270 
a number of how to's in here as well we
get<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.870> dive<00:00:34.140> deep<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> lot<00:00:35.100> of

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280

I'm doing plant design so I share that
information<00:00:46.170> with<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:48.030> make

better choices when you're deciding what

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.660 
better choices when you're deciding what
to<00:00:50.700> use<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.180> your<00:00:51.329> landscape<00:00:51.899> design<00:00:52.520> then<00:00:53.520> we

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
to use in your landscape design then we

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.590 
to use in your landscape design then we
move<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:55.309> landscape<00:00:56.309> construction<00:00:56.879> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
move on to landscape construction and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.439 
move on to landscape construction and
some<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> things<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.920> are<00:00:59.190> critical<00:00:59.820> to

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
some of the things that are critical to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.860 
some of the things that are critical to
again<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> long<00:01:01.379> term<00:01:02.120> success<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.449> landscape

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
again a long term success in a landscape

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.759 
again a long term success in a landscape
design

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
