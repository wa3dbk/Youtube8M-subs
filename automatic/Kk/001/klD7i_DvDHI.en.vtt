dungeons and dragons fantasy i think the

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.640 
dungeons and dragons fantasy i think the

that once you get to handle on this

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.309 
that once you get to handle on this
you'll<00:04:51.389> just<00:04:51.539> be<00:04:51.660> able<00:04:51.720> to<00:04:51.840> rock<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.259> roll
