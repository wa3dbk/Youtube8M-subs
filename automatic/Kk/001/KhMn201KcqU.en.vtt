00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello welcome one more day does bad hd 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.359
 today I bring you with a tutorial that 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.309
 you asked a lot of people like 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.050
 I have configured the pvr so 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.509
 let's go there this is the audacity that then 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.570
 I'll talk about him today I bring you good let's go 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.449
 to see this would be what is the menu or the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.189
 configuration I'm not going to give you here a 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.430
 click to get a little more 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.220
 bright the subject is not good this is 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.460
 the configuration that I have of the hd 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.270
 pvr 2 many people have asked me 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.300
 we are with mp4 vale 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.370
 hdmi and audio hdmi video input yes 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.620
 you have the component will be put here then 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.990
 make up you have to put components and 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.590
 the rest 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:47.580
 a component and here equal is good 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.580
 device configuration 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.790
 this really does not need to touch 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.370
 practically nothing is the brightness and it comes 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.870
 by default so the important thing is in the 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.510
 Format configuration is worth 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.579
 you have to leave it as it is or such 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.400
 what if you want the quality that I have 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.009
 in the videos 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.200
 the definition and others leave it as 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.119
 is here I expand it a little if I do not 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.450
 You see what you put on the screen 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.360
 big what the country pauses and if you want a 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.850
 little what you good what you fancy 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.460
 just as it is here since you avoided 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.140
 the lines that avoid the lines that 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.340
 they happen when the subject of 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.759
 fast movements of the game worth 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.429
 you can put the ccb and audio network 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.460
 a little bit higher in 256 but I do not think 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.110
 that it is necessary to test it and not 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.070
 you need, you do not really need 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.810
 put it as you see frame rate in source and 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.659
 the only thing you have to change is the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.899
 resolution of a scaling so that 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.320
 so they are encentran 1080 rescue us 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.020
 but they leave you 1080 voucher 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.820
 the rest good video encoder this is very 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.950
 important I have it to the fullest in 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.920
 constant viceroy here you have then 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.140
 variable or constant is valid and this is the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.940
 maximum that can be put not because I 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.220
 I have the maximum value 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.500
 dynamic royce noise resolution is 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.980
 same as always and as I say if you have 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.750
 some subject or some history or not 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.870
 you have seen it very clear because you give it 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.100
 to the pause and it's better that you have 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.190
 asked good have you asked me 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.989
 that how to record a gameplay with this 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.840
 capturing with this capturing and 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.700
 record a live audio by me what I use is 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.500
 this program that I have taught you before 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.090
 audacity and as I'm talking 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.250
 now I would be playing the gameplay 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.080
 recording with the captor is worth once 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.030
 that once you play the gameplay 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.520
 was already recorded with the capture 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.220
 I would appear then in this in this 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.350
 tab of videos that I have here is worth 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.390
 would appear here and then simply by 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.330
 example the road to go is worth of this 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.390
 this one of that ere 50 simply because 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.590
 would be here to open the premier 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.840
 we would open the premiere side and 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.319
 we would have an audio file that I do not know 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.989
 I have some here we will make new project 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:09.379
 ok yes, yes, I have it 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.510
 baixa configuration you will see how it is 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:15.319
 adjusted I have it this way is worth a thousand 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.780
 eight 1280 x 720 79 frames per 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.239
 second we give you to accept and as 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.860
 always if we have time to catch something 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.190
 you just give the break and what 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.980
 you will have there perfect to see it 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.280
 So, well, that's where you have the 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.400
 premier just put in and it 's the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.130
 chapter worth 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.930
 is here the chapter 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:44.170
 from that ere 50 ok we'll put it here 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.469
 quietly worth this would be for 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.390
 change the settings to the video is worth and 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:51.579
 well this would not be chapter 2 I do not know 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.680
 what chapter is this wrongly named maner 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.180
 but we go even if we had a 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.519
 audio that I do not know if I have any audio 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.579
 right here I do not have any audio like that 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.650
 audios ok see here I have audio 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.959
 black ops 2 because simply this one would be 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.469
 the audio the live your we would put it 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.650
 here it is valid and you will have to adjust it 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:13.120
 according to that according to him to where more or 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.950
 except where I've started talking about 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.000
 ccoo gameplay always Acordaros by 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.979
 example if you start talking in the 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.910
 second 3 of the game then you put this 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:24.009
 in the second 3 and simply file 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.949
 export media is going to come out here the 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:31.419
 window I always sports or in hd or hd 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:34.650
 point 6 12 4 and always always 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:40.870
 always now I'm being a 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:43.080
 here 1080 29.97 is worth it or you go down 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.800
 down here, it's worth 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.319
 You see that he puts vv of a pass, so you put 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.569
 vr two passes and I always adjusted this 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:53.610
 to 40 as you see the video occupies a 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.949
 outrageous but it looks pretty pretty 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.759
 well you can play a little with the ones with the 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.199
 duration and with those with this quality of 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.060
 here as you see here if the quality went down 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.400
 then lowers the size of the video 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.729
 but I do not recommend good I do not know 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.509
 at least 30 30 here and 30 here is what 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:14.550
 minimum that is required not so nothing this 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.229
 it's been like that the tutorial I hope that you 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.979
 serve I hope it helps you I hope that 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.090
 good to be worth something and if you have 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.159
 Any doubt you leave it in the 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.229
 comments I give you a video or the 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:27.060
