00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
of building units sometimes if you're

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.039 
of building units sometimes if you're
going<00:03:38.799> room<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.489> it's<00:03:40.299> supposed<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.690> be<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:40.810> 10

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
going room and it's supposed to be a 10

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.500 
going room and it's supposed to be a 10
by<00:03:41.200> 10<00:03:41.230> sometimes<00:03:41.920> it'll<00:03:42.640> split<00:03:43.060> off<00:03:43.269> and

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
by 10 sometimes it'll split off and

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.570 
by 10 sometimes it'll split off and
there's<00:03:43.690> a<00:03:43.780> 10<00:03:44.019> by<00:03:44.170> 10<00:03:44.200> with<00:03:44.590> 10<00:03:44.739> my<00:03:45.190> tent<00:03:45.430> here

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
there's a 10 by 10 with 10 my tent here

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.370 
there's a 10 by 10 with 10 my tent here
10<00:03:45.760> by<00:03:45.880> 10<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:46.239> it's<00:03:46.360> like<00:03:46.480> 10<00:03:46.690> by<00:03:46.840> 30<00:03:47.049> and

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
10 by 10 so it's like 10 by 30 and

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.490 
10 by 10 so it's like 10 by 30 and
that's<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.590> tea<00:03:47.830> or<00:03:48.100> they'll<00:03:49.030> go<00:03:49.330> and<00:03:49.600> hook<00:03:50.230> to

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
that's a tea or they'll go and hook to

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.410 
that's a tea or they'll go and hook to
the<00:03:50.620> left<00:03:50.830> or<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.130> right<00:03:51.220> on<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.850> L<00:03:52.060> shape

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
the left or the right on the L shape

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.380 
the left or the right on the L shape
which<00:03:52.989> makes<00:03:53.200> it<00:03:53.380> like<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.530> 10<00:03:53.830> by<00:03:54.010> 20<00:03:54.549> 10<00:03:54.820> by<00:03:54.970> 25

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
which makes it like a 10 by 20 10 by 25

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.340 
which makes it like a 10 by 20 10 by 25
and<00:03:56.459> they're<00:03:57.459> usually<00:03:57.610> short<00:03:58.060> well<00:03:58.930> I<00:03:58.959> get<00:03:59.230> in

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
and they're usually short well I get in

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.660 
and they're usually short well I get in
there<00:03:59.470> and<00:03:59.530> I'm<00:03:59.650> pulling<00:03:59.890> that<00:03:59.920> stuff<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.459> I

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
there and I'm pulling that stuff and I
