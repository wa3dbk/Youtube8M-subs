00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:01.879
 Hello 

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:03.960
 I have long promised an indicator 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.620
 lesson how to shoot panoramic 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.369
 among them formats 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:10.859
 many people ask this question on the site 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:13.859
 it is interesting to people as a digit is a 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.019
 children from the film, he still does not die 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.599
 and such questions even come I bought 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.599
 old camera tried shot and what 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.189
 continue to calm 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.669
 so that such comic situations 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.619
 did not arise about how it is all done 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.349
 so 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.929
 small video story aton 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.760
 this is how shooting happens 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.450
 here is the camera itself 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.460
 sport sport 612 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.360
 one of the last 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.380
 issued to horse company 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.700
 on the shooting 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.350
 the camera is the simplest but when 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.230
 are saying 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.020
 to the people that this is the same camera 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.880
 change the youth is already in the burn does not understand 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.060
 what a change 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.160
 this people know my generation 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.390
 that is, it is elementary 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.880
 smart camera 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.840
 connecting the company port in that you can 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.590
 parse evaluate lens and shop 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.580
 viewfinder 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.670
 removed does not go away 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.780
 it is convenient to walk around the territory 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.210
 to get after 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.860
 and from the dead man 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.270
 watch 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.210
 here so about zok 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.550
 a thief like that 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.110
 what is there to see 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.280
 find a place then to this place 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.600
 the camera 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.390
 in principle, you need two things to shoot first 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.050
 what is a photographer 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.510
 and there is no 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.520
 and the second thing is the subject but here 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.830
 today to 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.830
 I don't have to run far 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.370
 kind of like nothing 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.580
 shoot it is interesting and now we start 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.990
 step by step this thing to do 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.280
 from him such an institution 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.660
 set it on a tripod chk 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.300
 have made a year 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.290
 leveled it along the horizon 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.320
 to avoid debris 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.730
 basically shooting he is ready 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.380
 that now we need the most important light to try on 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.119
 but in a digital camera that's all 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.970
 done automatically 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.860
 right here 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.520
 instrument ulcer 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.520
 Why is it more difficult for search? 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.480
 in the EU hangs on my neck 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.549
 can take a brute force 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:09.999
 simpler 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:11.759
 also desan 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:13.879
 which is the most elementary 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.879
 for measurements 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.499
 not quite right 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.489
 what kind of numbers str show apparatus 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:30.059
 so charging the film here it is the film itself 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:32.119
 hold so that Dynamo 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:34.539
 virginity 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:38.799
 which festival area 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.199
 remove means control 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:47.339
 and gets sms 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:49.129
 6 centimeters wide 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.129
 Irina meter twenty 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.769
 rubles 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.019
 we charge 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.650
 my gosh one of the most convenient systems 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.869
 charging 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:01.709
 and all 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.509
 everything is done simply and conveniently under 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.109
 spring 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.109
 impossible to miss 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:14.339
 non-charging backward 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:16.509
 wraps around cassette 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:18.709
 what makes a very good leveling 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.709
 relative to the shooting plane 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.459
 worried hands tremble 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.459
 movies are filming 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.529
 sixteenth 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.929
 sometimes 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:40.119
 an arrow will appear in the cat section 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.129
 black 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.129
 everything can be inserted 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.319
 turns it over 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.029
 our camera is ready to go 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:57.019
 per month 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.679
 all elementary 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:01.679
 next believe 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.009
 here is an excerpt 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.009
 here the aperture and in the lens dome 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.199
 an hour more time 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:20.569
 sixteen 125 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.990
 the parade started the nation 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.380
 like that instead and central 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.909
 slightly overlap the territory 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:32.039
 gender division to compensate them 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.899
 principle should quit but filing 

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:35.339
 light a lot you can build a game not 

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:36.460
 bother 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.300
 and just click on the trigger 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.389
 shooting made all elementary 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.300
 watson 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.270
 his deputy was filmed 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.270
 1603 fourth year 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:53.229
 fashion on the history of civilization
