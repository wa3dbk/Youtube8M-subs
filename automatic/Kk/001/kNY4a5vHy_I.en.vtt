00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.890 
the tops together just put a little bit
of<00:02:23.100> glue<00:02:28.610> just<00:02:29.610> just<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.150> little<00:02:30.180> bit<00:02:30.540> I'm<00:02:30.750> going

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
of glue just just a little bit I'm going

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.240 
of glue just just a little bit I'm going
to<00:02:30.990> take<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.140> little<00:02:31.380> bit<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.800> glue<00:02:32.040> off

to take a little bit of that glue off
and<00:02:33.470> I'm<00:02:34.470> going<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.710> make<00:02:34.860> sure<00:02:35.070> this<00:02:35.280> is

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
and I'm going to make sure this is

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:46.369 
and I'm going to make sure this is
aligned<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:39.200> foliat<00:02:40.200> flat

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379

okay<00:02:47.379> well<00:02:47.530> this<00:02:47.739> dries<00:02:49.860> I'm<00:02:50.860> going<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.099> go

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
okay well this dries I'm going to go

00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:01.399 
okay well this dries I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:52.500> fold<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.739> outside<00:02:53.920> card<00:02:58.769> like<00:02:59.769> so

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
ahead and fold the outside card like so

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.039 
ahead and fold the outside card like so
okay<00:03:02.409> the<00:03:02.590> next<00:03:02.829> step<00:03:03.099> is<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:04.180> attach<00:03:04.480> this

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
okay the next step is to attach this

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.789 
okay the next step is to attach this
into<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:07.269> outside<00:03:07.569> card<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.230> I've<00:03:08.500> already

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
into the outside card so I've already

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.280 
into the outside card so I've already
cut<00:03:09.040> these<00:03:09.159> little<00:03:09.370> corners<00:03:09.849> out<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.360> you<00:03:11.140> can

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
cut these little corners out and you can

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:20.460 
cut these little corners out and you can
easily<00:03:11.500> slide<00:03:11.890> them<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.400> like<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:19.260> okay<00:03:20.260> and

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
easily slide them in like so okay and

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.420 
easily slide them in like so okay and
let's<00:03:20.739> make<00:03:20.920> sure<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.250> folds<00:03:21.609> flat<00:03:23.190> okay<00:03:24.190> and

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
let's make sure this folds flat okay and

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.069 
let's make sure this folds flat okay and
now<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.730> next<00:03:25.090> step<00:03:25.390> is<00:03:25.829> to<00:03:26.829> glue<00:03:27.099> the<00:03:28.079> candles

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079

make it a little bit smaller as you can
see<00:05:01.280> I'm<00:05:01.400> cutting<00:05:01.669> inside<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.690> lines

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.640 

okay<00:05:18.530> so<00:05:18.590> now<00:05:18.919> I<00:05:18.949> have<00:05:19.280> two<00:05:19.849> pink<00:05:20.349> sheets<00:05:21.349> that

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
I can glue on the inside of the frosting

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.379 
I can glue on the inside of the frosting
so<00:05:29.270> let's<00:05:29.509> go<00:05:29.720> ahead<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:29.930> do<00:05:30.199> that<00:05:31.360> put<00:05:32.360> a

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
so let's go ahead and do that put a

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.740 
so let's go ahead and do that put a
little<00:05:32.449> bit<00:05:32.629> of<00:05:32.750> glue<00:05:32.930> there<00:05:32.960> and<00:05:33.520> then<00:05:34.750> as

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
little bit of glue there and then as

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:42.850 
little bit of glue there and then as
long<00:05:35.870> as<00:05:36.199> I<00:05:36.319> make<00:05:36.530> sure<00:05:36.860> that<00:05:38.979> the<00:05:39.979> holes<00:05:41.860> are

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
long as I make sure that the holes are

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:50.409 
long as I make sure that the holes are
covered<00:05:43.129> up<00:05:43.400> it<00:05:44.120> should<00:05:44.300> be<00:05:44.360> fine<00:05:49.060> do<00:05:50.060> the<00:05:50.180> same

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
covered up it should be fine do the same

00:05:50.419 --> 00:06:04.960 
covered up it should be fine do the same
on<00:05:50.599> this<00:05:50.719> side
