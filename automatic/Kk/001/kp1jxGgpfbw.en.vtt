coming off of the network across the
cellular<00:03:53.100> network<00:03:53.160> so<00:03:53.580> this<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:53.820> going<00:03:53.940> to

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
cellular network so this is going to

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.520 
cellular network so this is going to
cost<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.769> bandwidth<00:03:55.769> or<00:03:55.920> connection<00:03:56.850> charges

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
cost you bandwidth or connection charges

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.830 
cost you bandwidth or connection charges
based<00:03:58.530> on<00:03:58.739> your<00:03:58.830> data<00:03:59.010> plan<00:03:59.280> so<00:03:59.820> most<00:04:00.690> people

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
based on your data plan so most people

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.540 
based on your data plan so most people
have<00:04:01.050> lots<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.410> data<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:02.190> some<00:04:02.370> cases

have lots of data in some cases

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.949 
have lots of data in some cases
unlimited<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:03.390> won't<00:04:03.570> cost<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.900> anything

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959

extra<00:04:04.760> but<00:04:05.760> note<00:04:05.940> that<00:04:05.970> this<00:04:06.390> actually<00:04:06.660> does

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
extra but note that this actually does

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.550 
extra but note that this actually does
take<00:04:08.580> a<00:04:08.610> toll<00:04:08.730> on<00:04:09.180> your<00:04:09.269> data<00:04:09.720> plan<00:04:10.019> so<00:04:10.380> if<00:04:10.470> you

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
take a toll on your data plan so if you

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.470 
take a toll on your data plan so if you

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
have a limited data plan be fairly

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.620 
have a limited data plan be fairly
