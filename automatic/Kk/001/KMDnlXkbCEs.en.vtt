00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
 next day wish you and welcome to 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.850
 probably the most stupid unbeaten 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.340
 namely from South Tyrol gaming 1 he 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.220
 write max about bratwurst challenge 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.680
 play eg or sg after every kill call 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.689
 You ali and ask him if he is roasting 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.550
 like to say hello 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.490
 human have only that okay one 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.480
 Absolutely good job but make a leaf 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.320
 a few days ago on twitter that you 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.310
 I've written that 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.630
 remembers the 42nd 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.640
 I have the word one week ago 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.110
 bratwurst filtered on youtube resp 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.930
 lock all comments the hearing 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.100
 to be checked 1021 okay if he already 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.540
 on youtube filter the comment 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.489
 then we have to call him because I have 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.960
 thought of me and that's why we do that 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.340
 now it will be hard to fool 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.620
 but nice thing okay if it is already 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.820
 then we have to lock the word 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.879
 of course call this is natural 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.559
 the same thing is only there 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.170
 a problem finally is the phone is 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.969
 the whole challenge was already over 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.829
 We will now see that a team 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.620
 world then I can take it directly 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.350
 ask twice 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.810
 ok hello you are a ti and that's why 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.150
 you have to die 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.700
 And because you have to be a team you 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.690
 Hello, your teammate does not die 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.790
 weapon that means he can not handle you 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.110
 be protected 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.280
 team colleague of him also run angels 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.260
 fire ok i killed one 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.300
 I will call a plan then I am 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:35.580
 curious if he goes to it and if he does 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:48.950
 what he says yes viktor I have a whole 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:48.950
 short question likes bratwurst first time 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.440

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.450
 hung up because he was on the way 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.740
 I suddenly got out there but it was not 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.170
 We think our last call will be 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.000
 Call even more often and yes, let's see if 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.270

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.119
 if he comments the video here 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.160
 maybe he is something maybe 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.220
 he finds very nice that someone at 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.850
 his bratwurst love thinks so will 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.650

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.740
 Answer was correct 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.820
 Are you asking spectators or what's okay 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.700

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.960
 seven people still ok seven people 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:35.040
 six people only oh oh I thought so 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:38.850

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.620
 I like him I'm invincible now he has 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:55.830
 his bottom is still running out with her 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:59.580
 He is definitely willing to fight 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:09.570
 I first something next to it first 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:10.440
 previous because the front is rather that way 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.980
 we're fine 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.520
 I can do that and not on 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.520
 cancel 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.000
 why here so funny the things 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.650
 Well that has stopped me now where 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.350

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.220
 In the beginning but briefly look here 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.850
 nothing to eat anymore i would need 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.970
 All sounds like yes I have them 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:48.030

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.580
 but that's nice thanks a lot I know 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.560

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.229
 but we will see 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.000

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.240

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.150

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.220
 I understand I know that a lot of tactics 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.960

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:15.830
 again télé called okay that's it 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.910
 not even badly placed I think 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.060
 I thought so first when laughing 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.390
