00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
are going to move pretty quickly whereas

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.889 
are going to move pretty quickly whereas
over<00:00:22.759> edged<00:00:23.029> it<00:00:23.300> might<00:00:23.419> be<00:00:23.509> a<00:00:23.540> little<00:00:23.689> bit

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:23.899 
over edged it might be a little bit

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:27.310 
over edged it might be a little bit
slower<00:00:24.730> another<00:00:25.730> thing<00:00:25.849> almost<00:00:26.320> personally

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
slower another thing almost personally

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.929 
slower another thing almost personally
curious<00:00:27.590> about<00:00:27.770> is<00:00:27.950> how<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:28.309> keyboard<00:00:28.759> works

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
device now you don't have to use the the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.820 
device now you don't have to use the the
loop<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.450> order<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.750> get<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.350> text

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
loop in order to get the text

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.609 
loop in order to get the text
positioning<00:01:14.840> like<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.289> actually

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
positioning like this you can actually

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.800 
positioning like this you can actually
just<00:01:16.740> tap<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:16.979> right<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.490> there<00:01:17.610> apparently<00:01:18.030> so

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
just tap it right in there apparently so

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.899 
just tap it right in there apparently so
that's<00:01:19.080> nice<00:01:19.549> one<00:01:20.549> thing<00:01:20.700> I've<00:01:20.789> noticed

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
that's nice one thing I've noticed

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.420 
that's nice one thing I've noticed
though<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.420> there's<00:01:21.750> no<00:01:21.930> way<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.140> knowing

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
though is there's no way of knowing

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.039 
though is there's no way of knowing
besides<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.270> arrow<00:01:24.570> whether<00:01:24.810> or<00:01:24.960> not

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
besides this up arrow whether or not

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.240 
besides this up arrow whether or not
you're<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.830> caps<00:01:26.399> lock<00:01:26.670> or<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.539> lowercase

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
you're in caps lock or in lowercase

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.499 
you're in caps lock or in lowercase
unfortunately<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.399> is<00:01:29.700> kind<00:01:30.300> of<00:01:30.330> irritating

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
unfortunately that is kind of irritating

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.050 
unfortunately that is kind of irritating
because<00:01:31.190> it<00:01:32.190> looks<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.520> basically<00:01:32.880> your

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
because it looks like basically your

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:42.370 
because it looks like basically your
caps<00:01:33.240> lock<00:01:33.330> all<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.630> time

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.960 

your<00:01:43.380> auto<00:01:43.470> corrected<00:01:43.980> with<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.310> apostrophe

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
your auto corrected with the apostrophe

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.780 
your auto corrected with the apostrophe
there

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.250 

and<00:01:51.790> we<00:01:51.909> have<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.210> other<00:01:52.479> simple<00:01:52.810> keyboard<00:01:53.140> in

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
and we have the other simple keyboard in

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:08.800 
and we have the other simple keyboard in
here

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.330 

yeah<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.080> when<00:02:10.410> i<00:02:10.440> mistyped<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.009> actually

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
yeah and when i mistyped to actually

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.510 
yeah and when i mistyped to actually
need<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.580> pick<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.910> one<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.209> well<00:02:13.520> but

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
need to pick this one as well but

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.650 
need to pick this one as well but
interestingly<00:02:14.849> enough<00:02:15.330> when<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:17.599> hit<00:02:18.599> that

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
interestingly enough when I hit that

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.000 
interestingly enough when I hit that
word<00:02:19.080> looks<00:02:20.040> like<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.340> took<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.209> save<00:02:21.450> it

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
word looks like it took it and save it

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.670 
word looks like it took it and save it
so<00:02:23.010> we<00:02:23.970> n<00:02:24.269> is<00:02:24.660> now<00:02:24.870> apparently<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.319> word<00:02:25.470> in<00:02:25.620> my

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
so we n is now apparently a word in my

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.620 
so we n is now apparently a word in my
dictionary<00:02:27.860> alright<00:02:32.030> one<00:02:33.030> thing<00:02:33.180> i<00:02:33.269> noticed

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
dictionary alright one thing i noticed

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.670 
dictionary alright one thing i noticed
playing<00:02:33.810> with<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.019> thing<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.290> little<00:02:34.470> bit

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
playing with this thing a little bit

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.990 
playing with this thing a little bit
earlier<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.660> from<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:36.810> safari<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:40.819> see<00:02:41.819> if<00:02:41.910> i

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
earlier is from in safari and see if i

00:02:42.000 --> 00:03:00.270 
earlier is from in safari and see if i
can<00:02:42.180> get<00:02:42.299> this<00:02:42.480> thing<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.810> landscape<00:02:43.260> mode

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.580 

the<00:03:01.280> landscape<00:03:01.760> keyboard<00:03:01.940> is<00:03:02.480> far<00:03:03.170> larger

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
the landscape keyboard is far larger

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.110 
the landscape keyboard is far larger
keys<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.190> it's<00:03:04.310> much<00:03:04.550> more<00:03:04.700> comfortable<00:03:05.060> to

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
keys and it's much more comfortable to

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:20.679 
keys and it's much more comfortable to
type<00:03:05.270> on

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:20.689 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.720 

but<00:03:21.689> apparently<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.500> autocorrection<00:03:23.010> or<00:03:23.459> the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
but apparently the autocorrection or the

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.399 
but apparently the autocorrection or the
correction<00:03:24.269> helper<00:03:24.599> does<00:03:24.870> not<00:03:25.019> really<00:03:25.200> work

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
correction helper does not really work

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.860 
correction helper does not really work
in<00:03:26.180> web<00:03:27.180> fields<00:03:28.129> unlike<00:03:29.129> an<00:03:29.280> email<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:29.870> text

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
in web fields unlike an email and text

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.720 
in web fields unlike an email and text
messaging<00:03:31.290> very<00:03:31.590> interesting<00:03:32.040> stuff

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.649 

probably<00:03:35.730> putting<00:03:36.000> everybody<00:03:36.329> asleep<00:03:36.480> so
