00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:19.110
 they are mainly good ribs 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.540

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.110
 I have them of pork so cut in 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.770
 cubes 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.290
 we're going to need carrots like two or 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.030
 three a couple of potatoes or three 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.830
 depending on the size they have a 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.070
 good size so with a couple of them 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.110
 it will be enough half onion we are going to 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.120
 also need a little bit of flour 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.540
 for those to alienate the ribs 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.460
 laurel 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.760

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.559
 a pill broth and optionally 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.839
 we can take a couple of pieces of 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.859
 chorizo ​​that gives very good flavor what 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.399
 first thing we're going to do is going to be 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.960
 enharinar very soon ribs 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.489
 little bit that is to say they do not have to be 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.469
 caked with flour alone with a 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.909
 little bit of flour over we're going to 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.130
 pour a little bit of olive oil in 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.450
 we will put a pot to heat and 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.450
 let's brown the ribs 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.700
 when the oil is already hot 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.329
 we are going to add the ribs so that 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.329
 go brown 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.310

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.910
 that in flour 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.020
 We are going to pour the oil 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.770
 and while the tortillas are leaving 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.039
 let's prepare the rest of the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.039
 ingredients 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.290
 peel and wash the onion and 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.290
 cut into tiny squares 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.840

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.530

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.350
 finite slices 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.719
 and the potato is going to glass not the 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.790

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:26.040
 exact or nothing but with the knife 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.040
 we are breaking pieces of the potato 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.300
 when we already have the golden pills 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.760
 we are going to take them out of 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.050
 of the pot and let's make in it a 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.050
 stir-fry with the rest of the ingredients 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.170
 first we add the onion and we're going to 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.170
 let brown lightly 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.160
 when the onion is taking color 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.160
 let's add the carrots 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.080
 and the chorizo 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.780
 and we're going to fix everything 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.780
 five or six months 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.920
 after a few minutes we add again 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.920
 the ribs 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.470
 of 9º and we let it cook everything to 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.030
 point 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.030
 72 more minutes 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.410
 after this time we add the rest of 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.410
 the ingredients to the potatoes 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.370

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.950
 One teaspoon of food coloring 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.950
 we remove everything and add water 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.859
 we will go pouring water until 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.859
 we sow all the ingredients 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.129
 and now that we have all the 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:33.030
 ingredients covered with water we're going to 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:35.419
 Let boil for about 40 to 45 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.419
 minutes 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:44.169
 about an hour later this is the 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.169
 result and let's see it in the dishes 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.060
