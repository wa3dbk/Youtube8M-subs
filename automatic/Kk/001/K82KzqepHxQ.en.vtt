00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.870
 resources 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.630
 then hot 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.149
 in the evening 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.959
 Harms 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.709
 so 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.470
 since we can students that is very cool percent of the coal to run away 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.470
 yet my tip should be stronger than ourselves 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:23.689
 Adenauer 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.640
 not every de Mar 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.979
 with sea water clock with 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.979
 Percent showed was okay 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 Platinum experience continues 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.420
 a real game totally entertaining what is it 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.690
 It's made by the makers of Black and White 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.010
 Percent anyway makes games the percent 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.460
 Occasion are as normal games 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.330
 and that's great for you 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.130
 I use deduction 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.830
 and this game is definitely a change 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.830
 so now we can do the world 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.390
 Scare creatures around this is a special ability we receive when 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.020
 more 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.180
 here is 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.180
 that would almost have played through 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.490
 and there is a very practical above, for example, the beds are 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.490
 apart too 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.830
 the gate 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.990
 come on 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.880
 more exactly one on it and then roll up again 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.200
 times 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.800
 see at the same time 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.800
 you have to get out of it 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.190
 Prof 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.870
 which can be toxic 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.870
 that could not swallow with light that's not nice 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.770
 that's really not nice 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.230
 next games TuS triggered 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.230
 and her water St 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.830
 eaten 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.830
 and pick up Jena 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.290
 and again topic 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.679
 and it starts to rain 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.599
 if the video quality is a little bad then I'm honest 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.219
 Sorry about 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.280
 the weather means Phelps me if it just single-handed the game 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.279
 immeasurable and that is absolutely not playable anymore 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:33.979
 such a sprint 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.889
 very funny but no matter 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.029
 and so it will be 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:42.589
 what is that a shell 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:44.339
 to cheat per supervisor 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:47.669
 "It's not great 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.609
 it now serves as a weapon 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.609
 we could confine ourselves now 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.709
 Lohr collected something for the net 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.739
 what are you doing here 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.629
 he wanted to attack our net 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.049
 I'm listening 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.049
 work like that one of the willing to mate 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.419
 Maria 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:24.309
 that's okay Bob do something 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:28.019
 Red one sees it from a damaged Japanese player 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.559
 2 Georg Klein 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:39.559
 Min now also the Rapener 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.379
 I also send 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:56.259
 Soest Kiss technique 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.419
 the authors we are dead unfortunately we died 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:05.269
 through the attack 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.149
 this specialist 

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:10.659
 Tourists came to them until the injured see you in yours to heal up 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.659
 thanks for the tip, we know that 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.799
 March go on the road, where I continue Narayen narrowly looking for them 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.139
 now a new home 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.139
 and how beautiful they waved that now 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.919
 one stays there
