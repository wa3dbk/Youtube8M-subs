00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
a total blunder I mean let's have a look

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.380 
a total blunder I mean let's have a look
at<00:04:57.830> this<00:04:57.980> in<00:04:58.280> slow<00:04:58.400> motion<00:04:58.700> what<00:04:59.210> happened<00:05:01.390> he

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
at this in slow motion what happened he

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.470 
at this in slow motion what happened he
plays<00:05:02.630> F<00:05:02.930> for<00:05:03.320> hair<00:05:03.710> I've<00:05:03.980> got<00:05:04.880> Knight<00:05:05.180> takes

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
plays F for hair I've got Knight takes

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.790 
plays F for hair I've got Knight takes
e4<00:05:05.660> I<00:05:05.930> don't<00:05:06.080> need<00:05:06.170> to<00:05:06.230> move<00:05:06.410> the<00:05:06.590> knight

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
e4 I don't need to move the knight

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.630 
e4 I don't need to move the knight
Knight<00:05:07.130> takes<00:05:07.430> e4<00:05:07.720> hitting<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:08.810> Queen<00:05:12.640> so

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
Knight takes e4 hitting the Queen so

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.420 
Knight takes e4 hitting the Queen so
here<00:05:14.090> I<00:05:14.300> care<00:05:14.870> play<00:05:15.050> 94<00:05:15.680> and<00:05:15.920> all<00:05:16.160> of<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.400> sudden

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
here I care play 94 and all of a sudden

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.090 
here I care play 94 and all of a sudden
I'm<00:05:16.820> thinking<00:05:17.330> that<00:05:18.200> Bishop<00:05:18.680> b5<00:05:19.190> is<00:05:20.740> is<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:21.800> good

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
I'm thinking that Bishop b5 is is a good

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.740 
I'm thinking that Bishop b5 is is a good
move<00:05:22.310> for<00:05:22.340> some<00:05:22.700> reason<00:05:23.090> for<00:05:23.390> some<00:05:23.420> crazy

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
move for some reason for some crazy

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.890 
move for some reason for some crazy
reason<00:05:24.100> when<00:05:25.100> it's<00:05:25.250> not<00:05:25.520> I'm<00:05:25.820> thinking<00:05:26.630> takes

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
reason when it's not I'm thinking takes

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.260 
reason when it's not I'm thinking takes
takes<00:05:27.200> Queen<00:05:27.890> moves<00:05:28.160> i'm<00:05:28.340> taking<00:05:28.700> on<00:05:28.850> e3<00:05:29.000> of

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
takes Queen moves i'm taking on e3 of

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.000 
takes Queen moves i'm taking on e3 of
course<00:05:29.480> the<00:05:29.630> Knights<00:05:29.840> ping<00:05:30.110> who<00:05:30.290> is<00:05:30.500> to<00:05:30.980> come

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
course the Knights ping who is to come

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.180 
course the Knights ping who is to come
back<00:05:31.520> so<00:05:32.270> that's<00:05:32.480> a<00:05:32.630> total<00:05:32.810> blunder<00:05:33.410> bishop

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190

blunder Here I am threatening well this

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.060 
blunder Here I am threatening well this
was<00:05:41.270> blonde<00:05:41.570> the<00:05:41.720> maybe<00:05:44.620> we'll<00:05:45.620> make<00:05:45.800> maybe

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
was blonde the maybe we'll make maybe

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.680 
was blonde the maybe we'll make maybe
the<00:05:46.220> conceptions<00:05:46.790> good<00:05:46.970> actually<00:05:47.180> because

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
the conceptions good actually because

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.970 
the conceptions good actually because
I'm<00:05:47.810> hitting<00:05:48.350> h2<00:05:48.860> and<00:05:49.130> III<00:05:50.470> so<00:05:51.470> I'm<00:05:51.770> wondering

I'm hitting h2 and III so I'm wondering

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.340 
I'm hitting h2 and III so I'm wondering
now<00:05:52.250> that<00:05:52.400> in<00:05:52.610> this<00:05:52.669> position<00:05:53.150> if<00:05:53.690> it's

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
now that in this position if it's

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.530 
now that in this position if it's
actually<00:05:54.740> a<00:05:54.770> very<00:05:54.919> good<00:05:55.010> idea<00:05:55.220> by<00:05:56.120> excellent

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
actually a very good idea by excellent

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.999 
actually a very good idea by excellent
this<00:05:57.260> Bishop<00:05:57.590> f5

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009

so<00:06:03.009> I<00:06:03.039> kind<00:06:03.250> of<00:06:03.280> see<00:06:03.580> saw<00:06:03.789> motion<00:06:04.389> so<00:06:05.229> to<00:06:05.289> get

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
so I kind of see saw motion so to get

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.430 
so I kind of see saw motion so to get

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
there's like f 2 so this is actually

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:24.379 
there's like f 2 so this is actually
work<00:06:21.509> all<00:06:22.509> this<00:06:22.720> I<00:06:22.900> mean<00:06:23.050> it<00:06:23.110> seems<00:06:23.349> too

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:24.389 
work all this I mean it seems too

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:30.089 
work all this I mean it seems too
strange<00:06:28.199> so<00:06:29.199> he<00:06:29.289> just<00:06:29.500> collapsed<00:06:29.710> here

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
strange so he just collapsed here
