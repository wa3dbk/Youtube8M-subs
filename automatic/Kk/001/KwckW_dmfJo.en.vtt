00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Hello I love you today 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.420
 e-book tip for you because I have 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.440
 this book read trends by jennifer 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.349
 wolf reveals a short novel 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.639
 my ipad had this book 72 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.310
 Of course it always happens like that 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.050
 bit on the font size and is 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.550
 ongoing more than a short story 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.710
 but less than a really long one 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.710
 novel and yet it was a story 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.269
 absolutely round for me so they had 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.900
 she has a lot of tension and 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.380
 very nice end so what's up in the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.450
 story it's about looking and sofia 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.280
 the two are half their lives 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.480
 So you really friends half 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.860
 live their lives as they know each other 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.469
 was both nine years old 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.350
 Now they are both 18 and because 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.000
 always really best friends and as already 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.530
 but now suddenly a friend 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.989
 had more to 4 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.120
 I think I'm jealous what 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.890
 means she has already fallen in love and 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.480
 It occurs naturally not good 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.199
 all because she also represents this thesis 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.059
 he represents 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.090
 There is true friendship between 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.760
 men and women only true 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.799
 Friendship that really exists 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.360
 then noted but suddenly so with 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.220
 but it works for her now 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.810
 so not and now she has this to him 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.610
 problem and she goes to the internet and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.130
 Find a blog there 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.439
 that's called love hurts and there 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.390
 then you will be wonderful tips 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.130
 given wonderfully in quotes 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.049
 because everyone knows if something 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.820
 Googles and just when you are in such a forum 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.250
 go or be there in the square so 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.990
 sometimes really the weirdest tips 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.130
 just given whatever diseases 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.240
 As for 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.130
 that's what she has 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.259
 No matter what you have googles in the end 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.159
 you always crawl and that's really how it is 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.350
 quite often and so well they did this 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.670
 tips and it is super interesting 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.799
 written because then always such a blog 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.240
 Post is on and then answer below 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.100
 also the others and that is very very 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.930
 written witty so ever 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.620
 this whole book 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.060
 funny and I really liked it 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.680
 that the author in some places too 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.090
 really no leaf in the mouth 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.280
 and then really writes that the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.480
 characters apparently think that and that 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.130
 I like it really well if I like it 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.910
 by a bit naughty, too, somehow 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.709
 they have really liked it is just 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.240
 a book you have through very quickly 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.680
 so in a two evening I have two 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.910
 evenings needed and have me 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.380
 Super entertained and likes the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.740
 story easy and I have too 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.560
 Determined whether it is 18 or over 40 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.020
 So what the love affair so dear 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.760
 As for 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.560
 that is not very different so if you are 18 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.330
 is or over 40 I have such a 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.450
 situation does not get lucky 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.230
 but how to handle it or how 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.600
 how people feel when they are 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.070
 so I have to love 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.770
 Do not be silly and 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.030
 so take all the young readers if you 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.310
 It can really get older 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.350
 just like ton love loves and and 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.930
 I think it also belongs to wlan too 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.030
 that one has real feelings, yes, like now 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.700
 but then in the end sofia this whole 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.739
 of course history is in there 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.900
 this book and I just wish you 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.519
 Have fun reading 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.519
 good until next time
