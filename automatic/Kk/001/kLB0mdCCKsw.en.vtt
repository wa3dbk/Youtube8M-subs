explain it to you what I found were two
different<00:00:51.780> types<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.320> these<00:00:52.969> 3m<00:00:55.129> damage<00:00:56.129> free

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
different types of these 3m damage free

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.990 
different types of these 3m damage free
hanging<00:00:57.059> hooks<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:59.070> larger<00:00:59.579> ones<00:00:59.789> will

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
hanging hooks and the larger ones will

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
hanging hooks and the larger ones will
hold<00:01:00.420> up<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.660> 1<00:01:00.989> pound<00:01:01.320> each<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:03.290> this<00:01:04.290> cutting

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
hold up to 1 pound each so this cutting

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.820 
hold up to 1 pound each so this cutting
board<00:01:05.129> weighs<00:01:05.810> just<00:01:06.810> under<00:01:07.049> 10<00:01:07.470> ounces

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
board weighs just under 10 ounces

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.429 
board weighs just under 10 ounces
according<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.400> my<00:01:08.520> postage<00:01:08.970> scale<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
according to my postage scale and the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.140 
according to my postage scale and the
way<00:01:10.560> these<00:01:10.770> work<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.880> these<00:01:12.030> little

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
way these work you have these little

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.620 
way these work you have these little
sticky<00:01:12.659> tabs<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.340> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.640> back<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.299> service

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
sticky tabs and on the back the service

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.660 
sticky tabs and on the back the service
now<00:01:15.810> these<00:01:15.960> work<00:01:16.229> good<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:16.560> slick<00:01:17.130> surfaces

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
now these work good for slick surfaces

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.640 
now these work good for slick surfaces
they<00:01:17.880> won't<00:01:18.119> work<00:01:18.330> well<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> textured<00:01:19.409> walls

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
they won't work well on a textured walls

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.940 
they won't work well on a textured walls
so<00:01:19.950> keep<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.369> mind<00:01:20.900> but<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.200> these<00:01:22.560> little

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
so keep that in mind but on these little

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.609 
so keep that in mind but on these little
tabs<00:01:23.280> one<00:01:23.729> side<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.420> actually<00:01:24.570> says<00:01:25.049> wall

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
tabs one side of it actually says wall

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.090 
tabs one side of it actually says wall
side<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.240> other<00:01:27.270> side<00:01:27.530> you<00:01:28.530> want<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.829> peel

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
side so the other side you want to peel

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.640 
side so the other side you want to peel
off<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.610> stick<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> back<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
off and stick to the back of this and it

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.760 
off and stick to the back of this and it
leaves<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:31.950> little<00:01:32.280> tag<00:01:33.180> hanging<00:01:33.570> down<00:01:33.960> you

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
leaves this little tag hanging down you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.230 
leaves this little tag hanging down you
might<00:01:34.920> want<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.159> trim<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.430> off<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.090> don't

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
might want to trim that off if you don't

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.899 
might want to trim that off if you don't
want<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> see<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.650> that's<00:01:38.310> there<00:01:38.670> so

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
want to see that but that's there so

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.580 
want to see that but that's there so
that<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.210> pull<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:39.990> remove<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.439> at

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
that you can pull on it and remove it at

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.710 
that you can pull on it and remove it at
a<00:01:40.650> later<00:01:40.770> time<00:01:40.939> I'd<00:01:41.939> say<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.600> can

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
a later time I'd say that you can

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.410 
a later time I'd say that you can
probably<00:01:43.290> pop<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.070> off<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> wall<00:01:44.520> or<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.299> know

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
probably pop it off the wall or you know

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.179 
probably pop it off the wall or you know
simply<00:01:45.869> give<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.140> twist<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.829> pull<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.100> off

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
simply give it a twist and pull it off

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.950 
simply give it a twist and pull it off
the<00:01:47.250> wall<00:01:47.549> later<00:01:47.850> as<00:01:48.090> well<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.630> working<00:01:48.840> with

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the wall later as well so working with

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.530 
the wall later as well so working with
like<00:01:49.680> 3m<00:01:50.280> things<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.820> seems<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
like 3m things and that seems to be the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.310 
like 3m things and that seems to be the
way<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:52.380> work<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.850> these<00:01:54.540> larger<00:01:55.110> ones

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
way they work and so these larger ones

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.770 
way they work and so these larger ones
and<00:01:55.470> I'll<00:01:55.619> put<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.009> barcodes<00:01:56.790> pictures

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
and I'll put the barcodes pictures

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.179 
and I'll put the barcodes pictures
barcodes<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.469> screen<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:58.860> I'm<00:01:59.009> showing

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
barcodes on the screen as I'm showing

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.090 
barcodes on the screen as I'm showing
this<00:01:59.460> for<00:02:00.090> each<00:02:00.210> one<00:02:00.500> but<00:02:01.500> these<00:02:01.680> larger<00:02:02.070> ones

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
this for each one but these larger ones

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.090 
this for each one but these larger ones
actually<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.479> little<00:02:04.020> kind<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.649> divot

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
actually have a little kind of a divot

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.999 
actually have a little kind of a divot
down<00:02:05.340> inside<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.030> hook<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.259> could<00:02:07.649> put

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
down inside the hook so you could put

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.940 
down inside the hook so you could put
one<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.520> wall<00:02:08.729> put<00:02:09.629> one<00:02:09.929> on<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.259> back<00:02:10.590> of

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
one on the wall put one on the back of

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.080 
one on the wall put one on the back of
the<00:02:11.849> cutting<00:02:12.209> board

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
the cutting board

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.580 
the cutting board
and<00:02:13.209> it<00:02:13.450> will<00:02:13.569> hang<00:02:13.840> just<00:02:14.709> like<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:16.590> it

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
and it will hang just like that and it

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.500 
and it will hang just like that and it
is<00:02:17.770> a<00:02:17.800> little<00:02:18.130> large<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.670> can<00:02:18.819> see<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.270> through

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
is a little large you can see it through

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.320 
is a little large you can see it through
the<00:02:19.630> glass<00:02:19.920> maybe<00:02:20.920> not<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:21.640> much<00:02:21.819> when<00:02:22.060> it's<00:02:22.209> on

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
the glass maybe not so much when it's on

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.730 
the glass maybe not so much when it's on
the<00:02:22.420> wall<00:02:22.630> well<00:02:22.870> -<00:02:22.990> a<00:02:23.080> piece<00:02:23.230> of<00:02:23.260> paper<00:02:23.470> behind

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
the wall well - a piece of paper behind

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.660 
the wall well - a piece of paper behind
it<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:25.590> know<00:02:26.590> there's<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:27.069> got<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.370> little

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
it and you know there's I got a little

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.880 
it and you know there's I got a little
light<00:02:27.850> in<00:02:28.000> here<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.500> probably<00:02:29.500> shoots

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
light in here so that probably shoots

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.740 
light in here so that probably shoots
through<00:02:30.100> a<00:02:30.130> little<00:02:30.550> bit<00:02:30.730> more<00:02:31.120> than<00:02:31.390> what<00:02:31.630> it

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
through a little bit more than what it

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.350 
through a little bit more than what it
would<00:02:31.900> on<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.110> wall<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:33.340> not<00:02:33.489> too<00:02:33.730> bad<00:02:33.970> it's<00:02:34.209> a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
would on a wall it's not too bad it's a

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.840 
would on a wall it's not too bad it's a
real<00:02:34.630> easy<00:02:34.989> option<00:02:35.620> they<00:02:35.800> are<00:02:35.950> clear<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.730> they

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
real easy option they are clear so they

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.910 
real easy option they are clear so they
don't<00:02:37.030> look<00:02:37.180> too<00:02:37.239> bad<00:02:37.600> they<00:02:38.410> don't<00:02:38.530> look<00:02:38.770> out

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
don't look too bad they don't look out

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.229 
don't look too bad they don't look out
of<00:02:39.010> place<00:02:39.190> any<00:02:39.430> more<00:02:39.550> than<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.760> little<00:02:40.000> rubber

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
of place any more than a little rubber

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.580 
of place any more than a little rubber
feet<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.630> course<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:40.930> could<00:02:41.050> take<00:02:41.200> those<00:02:41.350> off

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
feet of course you could take those off

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.010 
feet of course you could take those off
as<00:02:41.800> well<00:02:42.239> but<00:02:43.239> this<00:02:43.360> will<00:02:43.540> hold<00:02:43.660> up<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.959> pound

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
as well but this will hold up to a pound

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.250 
as well but this will hold up to a pound
and<00:02:44.470> that's<00:02:45.310> six<00:02:45.970> ounces<00:02:46.300> over<00:02:46.510> what<00:02:47.110> these

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
and that's six ounces over what these

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.840 
and that's six ounces over what these
ways<00:02:47.530> so<00:02:47.830> you<00:02:47.890> should<00:02:48.130> be<00:02:48.250> okay<00:02:48.280> as<00:02:48.670> long<00:02:48.700> as

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
ways so you should be okay as long as

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.850 
ways so you should be okay as long as
you're<00:02:48.940> putting<00:02:49.180> on<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.660> slick<00:02:50.019> wall<00:02:50.290> smooth

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
you're putting on a slick wall smooth

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.720 
you're putting on a slick wall smooth
wall<00:02:51.130> surface<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.709> other<00:02:53.860> option<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.519> I

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
wall surface so the other option that I

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.380 
wall surface so the other option that I
found<00:02:55.120> were<00:02:56.459> similar<00:02:57.459> same<00:02:57.790> things<00:02:58.090> these<00:02:58.330> are

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
found were similar same things these are

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.449 
found were similar same things these are
little<00:02:58.840> damage<00:02:59.110> free<00:02:59.319> hangers<00:02:59.650> they<00:03:00.250> come

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
little damage free hangers they come

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.090 
little damage free hangers they come
with<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.760> same<00:03:01.360> little<00:03:01.660> stickies<00:03:02.100> the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
with the same little stickies the

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.130 
with the same little stickies the
difference<00:03:03.550> though<00:03:03.910> is<00:03:04.150> these<00:03:04.750> will<00:03:05.019> only

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
difference though is these will only

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.890 
difference though is these will only
hold<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.680> half<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.250> pound<00:03:06.489> each<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.269> they<00:03:07.720> don't

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
hold a half a pound each and they don't

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.290 
hold a half a pound each and they don't
have<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.230> little<00:03:08.500> divot<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:09.040> hook<00:03:09.760> one<00:03:09.790> on<00:03:10.180> the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
have the little divot to hook one on the

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.780 
have the little divot to hook one on the
other<00:03:10.450> one<00:03:10.569> upside<00:03:10.930> down<00:03:11.140> like<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:11.530> just<00:03:11.590> did<00:03:11.980> so

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
other one upside down like I just did so

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.940 
other one upside down like I just did so
the<00:03:13.360> option<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.900> would<00:03:14.050> suggest<00:03:14.260> for<00:03:14.739> those

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
the option I would suggest for those

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.180 
the option I would suggest for those
would<00:03:15.850> be<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.390> put<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.320> sticky<00:03:17.739> on<00:03:17.950> there

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
would be to put the sticky on there

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.250 
would be to put the sticky on there
again<00:03:18.489> it<00:03:18.640> has<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.820> wall<00:03:19.180> side<00:03:19.540> marked<00:03:20.049> and

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
again it has the wall side marked and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.440 
again it has the wall side marked and
you<00:03:21.250> will<00:03:21.459> definitely<00:03:21.730> want<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.120> trim<00:03:22.420> that

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
you will definitely want to trim that

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.120 
you will definitely want to trim that
off<00:03:22.780> trim<00:03:23.170> it<00:03:23.260> off<00:03:23.350> of<00:03:23.500> this<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.799> because<00:03:24.010> it

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
off trim it off of this and because it

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.160 
off trim it off of this and because it
will<00:03:24.190> stick<00:03:24.459> out<00:03:24.579> if<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:24.820> don't<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:25.989> want

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
will stick out if you don't and you want

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.330 
will stick out if you don't and you want
to<00:03:26.260> put<00:03:26.440> two<00:03:26.769> of<00:03:26.799> them<00:03:27.130> on<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.940> bottom<00:03:29.310> let<00:03:30.310> me

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
to put two of them on the bottom let me

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.290 
to put two of them on the bottom let me
put<00:03:30.579> this<00:03:30.760> down<00:03:31.709> like<00:03:32.709> this

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.840 

and<00:03:36.510> then<00:03:37.170> so<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.710> they<00:03:38.070> they<00:03:38.370> are<00:03:38.400> kind<00:03:38.790> of

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
and then so that they they are kind of

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.540 
and then so that they they are kind of
but<00:03:39.210> I'd<00:03:40.020> say<00:03:40.230> about<00:03:40.320> five<00:03:40.740> and<00:03:40.950> seven<00:03:41.310> o'clock

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
but I'd say about five and seven o'clock

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.400 
but I'd say about five and seven o'clock
on<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.090> bottom<00:03:42.480> curve<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:43.110> way<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.380> just

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
on the bottom curve that way it just

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.520 
on the bottom curve that way it just
kind<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.280> sits<00:03:44.520> in<00:03:44.700> there<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.030> rest<00:03:45.300> and<00:03:45.600> then

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
kind of sits in there and rest and then

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.050 
kind of sits in there and rest and then
to<00:03:46.710> hold<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.130> top<00:03:47.400> in<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:50.790> could<00:03:50.910> take

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
to hold the top in you could take

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.850 
to hold the top in you could take
another<00:03:51.360> one<00:03:51.570> and<00:03:51.780> stick<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.560> wall<00:03:52.800> and

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
another one and stick it to the wall and

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.330 
another one and stick it to the wall and
put<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.400> on<00:03:53.580> top<00:03:54.300> just<00:03:55.080> to<00:03:55.290> hold<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.680> against

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
put it on top just to hold it against

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.670 
put it on top just to hold it against
the<00:03:56.520> wall<00:03:56.730> now<00:03:57.390> all<00:03:57.750> three<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.410> them<00:03:58.530> are

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
the wall now all three of them are

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.500 
the wall now all three of them are
load-bearing<00:03:59.070> just<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.760> two<00:03:59.880> bottom<00:04:00.210> ones<00:04:00.240> so

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
load-bearing just the two bottom ones so

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.080 
load-bearing just the two bottom ones so
that's<00:04:00.690> a<00:04:00.870> half<00:04:01.050> a<00:04:01.170> pound<00:04:01.320> apiece<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:02.190> so<00:04:02.760> one

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
that's a half a pound apiece and so one

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.300 
that's a half a pound apiece and so one
pound<00:04:03.330> total<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:04.020> it<00:04:04.620> will<00:04:04.770> probably<00:04:05.130> hold

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
pound total and it will probably hold

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.610 
pound total and it will probably hold
better<00:04:05.670> than<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.540> one<00:04:06.870> if<00:04:07.050> you're<00:04:07.230> since<00:04:07.440> it's

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
better than the one if you're since it's

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.350 
better than the one if you're since it's
two<00:04:07.800> points<00:04:08.100> of<00:04:08.190> contact<00:04:08.670> with<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.910> third<00:04:09.210> one

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
two points of contact with the third one

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.290 
two points of contact with the third one
holding<00:04:09.660> against<00:04:09.990> the<00:04:10.140> wall<00:04:10.460> so<00:04:11.460> I<00:04:11.820> wanted<00:04:12.210> to

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
holding against the wall so I wanted to

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.360 
holding against the wall so I wanted to
throw<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:12.960> out<00:04:12.990> there<00:04:13.320> suggests<00:04:14.010> that<00:04:14.160> might

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
throw that out there suggests that might

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.050 
throw that out there suggests that might
be<00:04:14.520> a<00:04:14.550> good<00:04:14.820> way<00:04:15.300> to<00:04:15.330> do<00:04:15.570> that<00:04:15.980> these<00:04:16.980> do<00:04:17.400> look<00:04:17.760> a

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
be a good way to do that these do look a

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.680 
be a good way to do that these do look a
little<00:04:18.510> bit<00:04:18.690> less<00:04:19.430> invasive<00:04:20.430> on<00:04:20.670> the<00:04:20.850> cutting

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
little bit less invasive on the cutting

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.480 
little bit less invasive on the cutting
board<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.049> net<00:04:22.200> large<00:04:22.470> one<00:04:22.710> does<00:04:22.920> behind<00:04:23.310> it

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
board the net large one does behind it

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.510 
board the net large one does behind it
in<00:04:23.610> my<00:04:23.850> opinion<00:04:24.420> but<00:04:25.140> you'll<00:04:26.130> have<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.280> judge

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
in my opinion but you'll have to judge

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.160 
in my opinion but you'll have to judge
that<00:04:26.730> for<00:04:26.790> yourself<00:04:27.330> if<00:04:27.570> that'll<00:04:27.750> work<00:04:27.840> for

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
that for yourself if that'll work for

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.590 
that for yourself if that'll work for
you<00:04:28.350> if<00:04:29.100> you<00:04:29.310> have<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.490> textured<00:04:29.970> wall<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.420> only

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
you if you have a textured wall the only

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.180 
you if you have a textured wall the only
thing<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:30.870> could<00:04:31.020> really<00:04:31.050> come<00:04:31.410> up<00:04:31.530> with<00:04:31.770> that

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
thing I could really come up with that

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.570 
thing I could really come up with that
might<00:04:32.670> work<00:04:33.000> well<00:04:33.270> for<00:04:33.570> this<00:04:33.780> would<00:04:34.410> be<00:04:34.620> the

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
might work well for this would be the

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.780 
might work well for this would be the
little<00:04:36.000> clear<00:04:36.780> clips<00:04:37.530> that<00:04:37.950> are<00:04:38.280> used<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.640> hold

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
little clear clips that are used to hold

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.000 
little clear clips that are used to hold
a<00:04:38.910> mirror<00:04:39.240> on<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.540> wall<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.440> you<00:04:40.710> can<00:04:40.890> get

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
a mirror on the wall and you can get

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.290 
a mirror on the wall and you can get
those<00:04:41.190> at<00:04:41.340> Lowe's<00:04:41.550> or<00:04:41.580> any<00:04:41.910> hardware<00:04:42.120> store

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
those at Lowe's or any hardware store

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.120 
those at Lowe's or any hardware store
usually<00:04:42.840> as<00:04:42.930> well<00:04:43.200> I<00:04:43.440> bought<00:04:43.860> those<00:04:44.010> little

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
usually as well I bought those little

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.600 
usually as well I bought those little
clips<00:04:44.550> at<00:04:44.700> Lowe's<00:04:44.940> by<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.300> way<00:04:45.570> but<00:04:46.460> you<00:04:47.460> can

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
clips at Lowe's by the way but you can

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.730 
clips at Lowe's by the way but you can
use<00:04:48.180> a<00:04:48.210> similar<00:04:48.630> concept<00:04:48.870> just<00:04:49.200> put<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.440> couple

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
use a similar concept just put a couple

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.460 
use a similar concept just put a couple
down<00:04:49.860> at<00:04:49.980> the<00:04:50.070> bottom<00:04:50.250> one<00:04:50.550> up<00:04:50.700> at<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:50.850> top<00:04:51.120> and

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
down at the bottom one up at the top and

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.870 
down at the bottom one up at the top and
maybe<00:04:52.470> put<00:04:52.740> a<00:04:52.770> little<00:04:52.830> breaths<00:04:53.220> shiny<00:04:53.640> brass

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
maybe put a little breaths shiny brass

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.400 
maybe put a little breaths shiny brass
screws<00:04:54.210> or<00:04:54.450> something<00:04:54.750> in<00:04:54.870> them<00:04:54.990> to<00:04:55.110> hold<00:04:55.260> them

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
screws or something in them to hold them

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.280 
screws or something in them to hold them
on<00:04:55.560> so<00:04:55.890> that<00:04:56.010> they<00:04:56.130> they<00:04:56.580> look<00:04:56.790> nice<00:04:57.030> so<00:04:57.360> if<00:04:58.200> you

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
on so that they they look nice so if you

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.600 
on so that they they look nice so if you
have<00:04:58.410> a<00:04:58.440> texture<00:04:58.770> ball<00:04:58.950> you<00:04:59.130> could<00:04:59.220> do<00:04:59.340> it<00:04:59.460> that

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
have a texture ball you could do it that

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.210 
have a texture ball you could do it that
way<00:04:59.820> so<00:05:00.510> hopefully<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.860> answers<00:05:02.160> that

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
way so hopefully that answers that

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.760 
way so hopefully that answers that
question<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:03.240> if<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.140> have<00:05:04.290> any<00:05:04.440> questions

as<00:05:06.780> happen<00:05:07.560> so<00:05:07.740> often<00:05:07.920> right<00:05:08.310> after<00:05:08.910> I<00:05:08.940> finish

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
as happen so often right after I finish

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.300 
as happen so often right after I finish
finished<00:05:09.930> filming<00:05:10.260> that<00:05:10.440> first<00:05:10.770> segment<00:05:11.040> of

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
finished filming that first segment of

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.100 
finished filming that first segment of
the<00:05:11.370> video<00:05:11.490> I<00:05:12.000> came<00:05:12.360> up<00:05:12.540> with<00:05:12.570> another<00:05:12.810> idea

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
the video I came up with another idea

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.260 
the video I came up with another idea
that<00:05:13.770> might<00:05:13.950> work<00:05:13.980> well<00:05:14.400> for<00:05:14.760> a<00:05:14.790> lot<00:05:14.940> of<00:05:15.060> people

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
that might work well for a lot of people

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.120 
that might work well for a lot of people
if<00:05:15.360> you<00:05:15.480> have<00:05:15.600> a<00:05:15.630> textured<00:05:16.140> wall<00:05:16.350> word<00:05:16.920> this

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
if you have a textured wall word this

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.680 
if you have a textured wall word this
just<00:05:17.370> might<00:05:17.520> be<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:17.760> preferred<00:05:18.090> way<00:05:18.240> to<00:05:18.270> do<00:05:18.540> it

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
just might be the preferred way to do it

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.520 
just might be the preferred way to do it
as<00:05:18.780> well<00:05:18.960> that<00:05:19.370> is<00:05:20.450> to<00:05:21.450> put<00:05:21.930> two<00:05:22.230> of<00:05:22.380> those

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
as well that is to put two of those

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.770 
as well that is to put two of those
smaller<00:05:22.980> hooks<00:05:23.370> on<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.970> back<00:05:24.180> of<00:05:24.450> it<00:05:24.570> like

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
smaller hooks on the back of it like

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.370 
smaller hooks on the back of it like
this<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:26.010> you<00:05:26.310> could<00:05:26.430> put<00:05:26.580> a<00:05:26.610> single<00:05:27.140> nail<00:05:28.140> or

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
this and you could put a single nail or

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.490 
this and you could put a single nail or
tack<00:05:28.590> in<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:28.860> wall<00:05:29.040> or<00:05:29.250> a<00:05:29.280> picture<00:05:29.490> hanger<00:05:29.970> and
