00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
so and now we have to create to spawn so

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.299 
so and now we have to create to spawn so
let's<00:00:34.829> climb<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.520> red<00:00:35.700> spot<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:37.010> do<00:00:38.010> the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
for such SB set the lobby and YouTube
further<00:01:12.119> separate<00:01:12.630> lobby<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:13.170> each<00:01:14.630> map<00:01:15.630> you

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
further separate lobby for each map you

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.070 
further separate lobby for each map you
great<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.799> let's<00:01:16.979> create<00:01:17.130> site<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.119> both<00:01:18.810> on

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
great now let's create site so both on

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.200 
great now let's create site so both on
the<00:01:19.170> first<00:01:19.320> line<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.950> square<00:01:20.640> brackets<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the first line and square brackets and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.510 
the first line and square brackets and
then<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.390> name<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.560> arena<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.189> second

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
then the name of the arena on the second

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.710 
then the name of the arena on the second
line<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.590> now<00:01:25.590> let's<00:01:26.250> create<00:01:26.790> an<00:01:27.240> ammo<00:01:29.720> sign

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
line and now let's create an ammo sign

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.780 
line and now let's create an ammo sign
in<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.229> middle<00:01:31.470> from<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> map<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.240> up<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:34.790> we

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
in the middle from the map so up here we

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.560 
in the middle from the map so up here we
create<00:01:36.450> an<00:01:37.020> ammo<00:01:37.500> sign<00:01:37.860> which<00:01:38.729> allows<00:01:39.210> players

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.700 
create an ammo sign which allows players
to<00:01:39.960> get<00:01:41.000> more<00:01:42.000> snowballs<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:43.170> they<00:01:43.350> get<00:01:43.530> if

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
to get more snowballs if they get if

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.170 
to get more snowballs if they get if

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
they breed to this far without being

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.109 
they breed to this far without being
