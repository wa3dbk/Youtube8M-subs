00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:16.189
 Carmen has always been an attractive and caring woman but at 45 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.529
 prematurely his face acquired an aging range that gave him a 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.609
 sadness that led him to say 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.220
 Marriage separations are situations that throw many women 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.739
 to surgery 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.449
 before he had done a facelift that face and neck that turned out too much 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.979
 traumatic and the worst thing is that it gave him bad results 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.130
 When I was two years old I felt like I had my face off and it did not look good 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.750
 and all that after the investment and the desire that he had to redo his 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.300
 Fortunately, he was lucky enough to find a doctor and a technician. 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.150
 who solved your problem 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.420
 I have an experience like dt 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.420
 that I would not repeat for me was a very traumatic experience 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.890
 I had a hard time 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.510
 and I did not have the results that I wanted to have at two years old and I was pretty 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.540
 worst 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.610
 for circumstances of my life 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.530
 in it he wanted to be well again 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.630
 I needed to be well inside 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.140
 I was a broken person I could not even look in a mirror 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.970
 and I met Dr. Ahmad at Marbella 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.110
 is a person who gave me a lot, helps me a lot in the technique that 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.780
 It is a technique 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.320
 of stem cells 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.810
 but stem cells that it extracts from your own body extend until the one that 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.810
 he removes from your body ii he replaces it 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.220
 so for me this has been an incredible experience has made me 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.680
 feel a phenomenal i am a different woman i have really had my 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.470
 face that was what I already had 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.470
 and this one part in turn gives me self-esteem 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.550
 Jaime has done is to recover many things in my life 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.280
 and at some point in life there are women if they want they may need 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.029
 feel safer I will go with him to overcome a difficult time 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:17.609
 as separations this topic to plastic surgery and this one can the given 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.780
 the ashton who is the best 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.259
 even percent 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.129
 and of course externally 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.789
 and to regain confidence 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:31.049
 It is important that the woman does not miss 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.400
 or obsess seek world 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.419
 more and more surgical solutions 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:43.939
 maybe a single thing well advised and accompanied by a change of attitude 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.430
 It's enough 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.940
 so that you feel comfortable again in front of the mirror
