00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.910
 Hello dear friends with you max and 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.809
 I'll show you one more small today 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.310
 such a tutorial chik opening easter eggs 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.260
 own export that watched the channel 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.760
 redcrafting and saw there bunnies but 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.010
 can not even imagine how they can 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.470
 I will show you a letter from Comrade 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.119
 Naturally the whole team to explain at once 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.189
 i won't show i only show you 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.070
 the essence we have to put the command block 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.780
 and enter into it just such a command now 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.149
 you and see in chat and so you her 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.469
 see in the description of the essence of the team in 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.239
 that we call two skeletons 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.340
 one skeleton ordinary another skeleton 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.440
 sitting on it but inverted upside 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.410
 kicking skeletons we dress 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.440
 Player head to here so here is anybody in 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.180
 he is such a face bunny and give in 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.850
 hand carrot and also do absolutely 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.469
 invisible and in the end it turns out this 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.940
 Here is an interesting picture that when we 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.859
 activate our command block we 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.350
 we get on it here such a bunny with 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.270
 Nick teller won as you see here is worth 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.610
 one skeleton with hands and holds in hands 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.260
 carrot and sits on top of another skeleton 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.659
 and twists here this his head 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.340
 back and forth it turns periodically 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.530
 hit the bunny and we can't because 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.790
 made him invulnerable and we 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.409
 it turns out such a nice one 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.869
 Easter bunny which can 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.759
 use in maps if we open 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.350
 our command block and change it here 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.000
 here is the team that changed after 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.610
 I clicked the record button 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.310
 if we change this last figure 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.060
 spacing ie invulnerability to effect 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.740
 0 and click this, and then run our 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.020
 the mechanism then we get this 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.329
 bunny who will just be vulnerable then 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.520
 there we can move it push like 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.270
 but actually we can have it 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.070
 also 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.040
 Attack 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.689
 here we can attack as you see here 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.299
 so here we are attacking a single skeleton 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.939
 and here so here if still sudarev and at me 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.350
 not working for anyone else 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.479
 right now after using diamond 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.549
 swords I 'll show you kill 1 mole 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.280
 skeleton and remains here such a bunny 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.280
 buck baths without guns 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.819
 without a calf just a skeleton with a head and 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.099
