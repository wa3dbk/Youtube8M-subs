00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.460
 at 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.260
 hello everyone that says we get 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.450
 found for our second video of 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.419
 this little series of how well 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.300
 equipped well this makes his character for 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.099
 their record help of croo pts so I 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.019
 explains character fear character 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.250
 how do you do that they are the 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.680
 best weapons the best 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.900
 equipment and how to set 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.330
 his doctrine for this hardcore raid you 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.530
 see that it's super great 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.019
 important because in this raid as you 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.640
 have been able to notice there is no 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.190
 light cut so there is no 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.260
 regeneration of your life points so 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.760
 we will be able to speak now about the titan 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.070
 and we will start in a first 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.809
 part talked about the equipment so for 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.369
 this titan there is only one 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.129
 unfortunately unlike the bow 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:02.080
 and east who owned him 3 so 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.420
 for the titan this is the helmet that 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.460
 is called the cranial fortress and 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.770
 when you own what is that 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.540
 you recover life points when 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.850
 you retrieve light orbs from 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.280
 your teammates so already it's a very 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.320
 good equipment that is absolutely necessary 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.390
 own for the hardcore raid 2 cropped 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.000
 then we'll be able to talk about 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.280
 the titan doctrine so by definition 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.630
 the two doctrines are equal since 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.189
 you will see it one and the other 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.869
 remains very interesting 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.850
 we will speak at first of the 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.310
 doctrine of the assailant who owns the 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.350
 transfusion capacity so who will you 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.479
 allow to recover points of 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.609
 city ​​when you go one shot is a 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.840
 enemy with your punch so the 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:41.469
 name of the punch that's the point of 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.700
 storm 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.549
 so that's the punch by 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.619
 definition of titan and so when you 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.469
 make this punch or a cost of 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.999
 poles you will be able to regenerate your 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.369
 points of life provided of course 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:55.990
 kill the enemy who is in front then well 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.630
 obviously regarding this punch 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.969
 I recommend you to associate it with the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.579
 capacity which is called unleashing which 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.740
 recover the ability to 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.110
 this punch faster so that 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.640
 significantly reduces the time 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.260
 recovery what can be very 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.630
 interesting is what will allow you 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.550
 to run through the raid by having 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.319
 a life almost enough to 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.670
 able to finish this final step of 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.560
 chrome time we now see talk 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.780
 of the second doctrine which she too 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.700
 is super interesting so after to you 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.580
 to choose according to your style of 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.380
 game on the defender doctrine you have 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.330
 what's called a bubble of protection 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.580
 so this protective bubble that carries 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.099
 the name of armor light weapons from 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.050
 light or blessing of light 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.569
 whatever you want as long as you 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.550
 launch your super so your bubble of 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.760
 protection you will automatically 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.500
 recover regeneration points from 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.420
 life so obviously it will take 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.950
 rely on your teammates so he 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.040
 you supply the orbs of light 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.510
 necessary for the complete regeneration of 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.350
 your super so that's the small 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.440
 counterpart 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.940
 nevertheless your super your turn is going 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.040
 to be able to serve them since you are going 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.080
 give them these light orbs and their 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.299
 also bring light weapons and 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.250
 other protections related to your bubble 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.260
 of titan so I think it's a 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.450
 doctrine that would be studied 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.069
 interesting for the hardcore raid for 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.680
 people who use the 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.420
 character of the titan obviously 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.819
 otherwise, do not hesitate to 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.980
 set the rest of your doctrine by 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.870
 example by leveraging resistance or 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.269
 recovery which can be 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.890
 very interesting abilities or even 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.930
 about certain abilities that you 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.540
 allow to generate more and more 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.420
 of light orb that can serve very 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.489
 helpful to your teammates and so for 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.010
 finish this third part of the 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.720
 video we will approach the weapons so I 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.910
 will you talk about the red death then 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.470
 as I said earlier this is 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.180
 of exotic weapons so you go 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.859
 take a location of exotic weapons 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.780
 in your stuff what can be 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.730
 penalizing if you play in particular 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.930
 young people with heavy weapons so in 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.209
 third 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.950
 if, however, you have such a character 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.590
 that titan I think that use 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.560
 of exotic weapons such as red death 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.819
 and lasours them they are not necessarily 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.799
 necessary but I give you 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.690
 the information anyway like that after 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.269
 it's up to you to choose how you prefer 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.370
 so equip you for these two weapons 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.769
 you have to know that the second half of 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.019
 charger especially for the sauce you 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.150
 allows you to recover life points if 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.100
 and only if you kill them deny 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.930
 completely with this weapon so that's 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.300
 a little bit to take it's not easy 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.039
 to manage at the beginning it is necessary to kill the enemy 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.240
 you and you alone that is he does not 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.190
 do not need one of your colleagues 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.840
 involved 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.730
 at that moment so you have to kill 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.710
 the enemy and this with the second half 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.000
 bullets from your loader but hey 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.440
 once you have taken the hit you 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.930
 are going to see that using this 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.280
 weapon can be very interesting 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.380
 and that's all for this little girl 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.150
 video on the titan I hope that you 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.660
 will be helpful that it will allow you to 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.060
 better 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.130
 set your character and better 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.020
 tackle this hardcore raid because it's 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.610
 true that it is much more difficult 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.280
 and all the better because seven goals that 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.540
 allows you to adapt a new 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.490
 style of play that gives you a little bit of 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.750
 chill in this game so much better 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.700
 I give you an appointment for the 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.800
 third video that will talk to compare 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.480
 of the hunter meanwhile I make you 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.840
 very very big kisses and I tell you to 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.840
 very soon
