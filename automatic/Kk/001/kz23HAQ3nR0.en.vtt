00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
got to be a little bit too one-sided

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.949 
got to be a little bit too one-sided
look<00:03:10.459> like<00:03:10.610> it<00:03:10.700> went<00:03:10.819> pretty<00:03:10.880> well<00:03:11.060> yeah<00:03:11.930> I

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
look like it went pretty well yeah I

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.390 
look like it went pretty well yeah I
mean<00:03:12.049> there's<00:03:12.440> a<00:03:12.530> scrum<00:03:12.799> I<00:03:12.830> just<00:03:13.100> came<00:03:13.250> in<00:03:13.280> to

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
mean there's a scrum I just came in to

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.770 
mean there's a scrum I just came in to
kind<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:13.790> break<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.120> up<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.239> someone<00:03:14.660> grabbed

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
kind of break it up and someone grabbed

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.050 
kind of break it up and someone grabbed
me<00:03:14.810> from<00:03:14.959> behind<00:03:15.049> so<00:03:15.440> just<00:03:16.400> I<00:03:16.610> guess<00:03:16.880> that

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
me from behind so just I guess that

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.180 
me from behind so just I guess that
escalated<00:03:17.450> quickly<00:03:17.510> yeah<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.530> know<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.950> all

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
escalated quickly yeah I know that all

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.890 
escalated quickly yeah I know that all
these<00:03:19.370> games<00:03:19.640> against<00:03:20.060> them<00:03:20.420> have<00:03:20.630> been

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
these games against them have been

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.590 
these games against them have been
really<00:03:21.200> physical<00:03:21.530> games<00:03:21.910> be<00:03:22.910> expecting<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.480> to

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
really physical games be expecting it to

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.050 
really physical games be expecting it to
get<00:03:23.780> worse<00:03:24.019> as<00:03:24.319> you<00:03:24.350> guys<00:03:24.560> take<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.860> room<00:03:25.060> who

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
get worse as you guys take the room who

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.580 
get worse as you guys take the room who
knows<00:03:26.269> it<00:03:26.420> could<00:03:26.450> go<00:03:26.690> either<00:03:26.720> way<00:03:27.200> if<00:03:27.350> they

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
knows it could go either way if they

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.530 
knows it could go either way if they
start<00:03:27.860> fighting<00:03:28.010> back<00:03:28.160> then<00:03:28.549> they<00:03:29.180> could<00:03:29.239> get

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
start fighting back then they could get

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.720 
start fighting back then they could get
a<00:03:29.569> little<00:03:29.750> rougher<00:03:30.080> but<00:03:30.260> they<00:03:31.040> back<00:03:31.220> down<00:03:31.250> then

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
a little rougher but they back down then

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.849 
a little rougher but they back down then
then<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.239> could<00:03:32.420> be<00:03:32.540> smooth<00:03:32.780> sailing<00:03:32.810> but<00:03:33.140> it's

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
then it could be smooth sailing but it's

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.680 
then it could be smooth sailing but it's
