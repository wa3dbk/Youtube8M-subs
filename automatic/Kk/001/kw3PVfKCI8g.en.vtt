00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:04.339 
audio file of reggae 80 drum loop and 80
alright<00:05:01.379> so<00:05:01.650> here<00:05:01.919> we<00:05:01.949> go<00:05:02.219> open<00:05:03.060> a<00:05:03.150> new<00:05:03.349> file

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
alright so here we go open a new file

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.330 
alright so here we go open a new file
we'll<00:05:05.250> call<00:05:05.550> that

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
we'll call that

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:15.050 
we'll call that
drum<00:05:08.930> import<00:05:11.360> create<00:05:12.360> and<00:05:12.719> here's<00:05:13.500> my<00:05:14.060> loop

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
drum import create and here's my loop

browser<00:05:15.389> already<00:05:15.870> open<00:05:16.740> now<00:05:17.460> here's<00:05:18.360> where<00:05:18.689> we

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
browser already open now here's where we

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.939 
browser already open now here's where we
need<00:05:18.930> that<00:05:19.500> 80<00:05:19.830> we<00:05:20.639> need<00:05:20.849> to<00:05:21.120> change<00:05:21.539> this<00:05:21.949> so

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
need that 80 we need to change this so

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.409 
need that 80 we need to change this so
that<00:05:23.430> we've<00:05:23.699> got<00:05:24.199> our<00:05:25.199> project<00:05:26.069> the<00:05:26.610> tempo<00:05:27.150> the

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
that we've got our project the tempo the

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.480 
that we've got our project the tempo the
default<00:05:27.870> tempo<00:05:28.319> is<00:05:28.469> 120

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
default tempo is 120

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.959 
default tempo is 120
but<00:05:30.000> our<00:05:30.120> loop<00:05:30.419> is<00:05:30.689> 80<00:05:31.229> so<00:05:32.129> we<00:05:32.310> need<00:05:32.490> to<00:05:32.639> change

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
but our loop is 80 so we need to change

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:36.890 
but our loop is 80 so we need to change
the<00:05:33.360> tempo<00:05:33.810> here<00:05:34.080> to<00:05:34.259> 80<00:05:34.849> otherwise<00:05:35.849> our<00:05:36.539> loops

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
the tempo here to 80 otherwise our loops

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.170 
the tempo here to 80 otherwise our loops
gonna<00:05:37.199> do<00:05:37.409> some<00:05:37.680> wacky<00:05:37.889> things<00:05:38.460> when<00:05:38.729> we<00:05:38.849> drag

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
gonna do some wacky things when we drag

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.540 
gonna do some wacky things when we drag
it<00:05:39.360> in<00:05:39.479> there<00:05:39.689> so<00:05:40.620> here's<00:05:40.949> our<00:05:41.159> loop<00:05:42.259> and<00:05:43.550> click

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
it in there so here's our loop and click

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.179 
it in there so here's our loop and click
the<00:05:44.669> play<00:05:44.849> button<00:05:48.199> wonderful<00:05:49.199> I<00:05:49.409> like<00:05:49.889> that<00:05:50.159> a

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:50.189 
the play button wonderful I like that a

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.689 
the play button wonderful I like that a
lot

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
lot

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.540 
lot
ok<00:05:51.060> so<00:05:51.659> we've<00:05:51.930> got<00:05:51.960> the<00:05:52.199> loop<00:05:52.560> we've<00:05:52.979> got<00:05:53.250> it<00:05:53.399> in

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
ok so we've got the loop we've got it in

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.450 
ok so we've got the loop we've got it in
our<00:05:53.729> GarageBand<00:05:54.539> project<00:05:54.629> and<00:05:55.589> we<00:05:56.069> can<00:05:56.250> use<00:05:56.430> it

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
our GarageBand project and we can use it

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.639 
our GarageBand project and we can use it
in<00:05:56.669> our<00:05:56.819> composition<00:05:57.270> but<00:05:58.110> if<00:05:58.259> we<00:05:58.409> want<00:05:58.589> to

00:05:58.639 --> 00:05:58.649 
in our composition but if we want to

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:00.889 
in our composition but if we want to
have<00:05:58.860> that<00:05:59.039> available<00:05:59.189> for<00:05:59.639> future<00:06:00.060> projects

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:00.899 
have that available for future projects

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:04.490 
have that available for future projects
we<00:06:01.439> need<00:06:01.469> to<00:06:01.800> move<00:06:02.009> that<00:06:02.069> into<00:06:02.969> the<00:06:03.210> library<00:06:03.810> so

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
we need to move that into the library so

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.189 
we need to move that into the library so
we<00:06:04.649> go<00:06:04.830> to<00:06:04.860> edit<00:06:05.270> add<00:06:06.270> to<00:06:07.259> loop<00:06:07.469> library<00:06:08.129> and

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
we go to edit add to loop library and

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.809 
we go to edit add to loop library and
here's<00:06:10.199> a<00:06:10.319> title<00:06:10.830> we<00:06:10.949> can<00:06:10.979> keep<00:06:11.370> the<00:06:11.580> same

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819 
here's a title we can keep the same

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:15.079 
here's a title we can keep the same
title<00:06:12.330> if<00:06:12.509> we<00:06:12.689> want<00:06:12.930> to<00:06:13.199> I<00:06:13.500> think<00:06:14.069> I'm<00:06:14.669> just

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:15.089 
title if we want to I think I'm just

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:20.059 
title if we want to I think I'm just
going<00:06:15.419> to<00:06:16.969> get<00:06:17.969> rid<00:06:18.120> of<00:06:18.300> the<00:06:18.419> e<00:06:18.649> I'm<00:06:19.649> going<00:06:20.009> to

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:20.069 
going to get rid of the e I'm going to

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.379 
going to get rid of the e I'm going to
capitalize<00:06:20.759> it<00:06:21.089> and<00:06:22.430> then<00:06:23.430> we<00:06:23.819> need<00:06:24.029> to<00:06:24.180> have

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:24.389 
capitalize it and then we need to have

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:28.670 
capitalize it and then we need to have
some<00:06:24.659> descriptors<00:06:25.370> scale<00:06:26.370> it's<00:06:27.210> not<00:06:28.050> in<00:06:28.529> any

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
some descriptors scale it's not in any

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:36.070 
some descriptors scale it's not in any
scale<00:06:29.069> and<00:06:29.839> genre<00:06:30.839> I<00:06:31.219> would<00:06:32.219> call<00:06:32.580> that<00:06:33.029> world

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.559 

and<00:06:36.169> then<00:06:36.680> we<00:06:37.460> look<00:06:37.699> at<00:06:37.819> the<00:06:37.970> instrument

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:38.569 
and then we look at the instrument

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.309 
and then we look at the instrument
descriptor<00:06:39.139> all<00:06:39.530> drums<00:06:40.069> it's<00:06:41.000> a<00:06:41.210> drum<00:06:41.509> kit<00:06:41.960> and

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 
descriptor all drums it's a drum kit and

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.779 
descriptor all drums it's a drum kit and
mood<00:06:43.099> descriptors<00:06:43.909> I<00:06:44.919> would<00:06:45.919> say<00:06:46.250> that's

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:46.789 
mood descriptors I would say that's

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:52.209 
mood descriptors I would say that's
clean<00:06:47.629> its<00:06:48.560> acoustic<00:06:49.389> it's<00:06:50.409> relaxed<00:06:51.409> its

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:52.219 
clean its acoustic it's relaxed its

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:54.429 
clean its acoustic it's relaxed its
grooving<00:06:52.969> the<00:06:53.509> more<00:06:53.719> different<00:06:54.080> descriptors

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:54.439 
grooving the more different descriptors

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:56.230 
grooving the more different descriptors
you<00:06:54.800> have<00:06:55.069> the<00:06:55.340> more<00:06:55.550> you<00:06:55.669> can<00:06:55.699> narrow<00:06:56.150> down

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 
you have the more you can narrow down

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.659 
you have the more you can narrow down
those<00:06:56.750> loops<00:06:57.560> when<00:06:57.860> you're<00:06:58.069> creating<00:06:58.310> a

00:06:58.659 --> 00:06:58.669 
those loops when you're creating a

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:04.260 
those loops when you're creating a
composition<00:06:59.289> so<00:07:00.289> we<00:07:00.530> do<00:07:00.740> create<00:07:02.439> there<00:07:03.439> it<00:07:03.560> is

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
composition so we do create there it is

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.740 
composition so we do create there it is
