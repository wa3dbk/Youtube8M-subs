00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.450
 hello game cowboys with this short video 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.580
 what I try to show is that game 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.470
 maker is powerful enough 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.730
 to create professional games 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.990
 let's qualify the term professionals 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.759
 obviously if you want to create a 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.189
 call of duty have you been wrong 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.200
 software most likely you have 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.899
 fallen from a very tall tree and you've 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.850
 hit in the head or that has you 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.410
 touched the lottery and are willing to 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.480
 invest the money in forming a team 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.540
 of 100 professionals and work during 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.030
 2 years to create your game there are many 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.280
 types of professionalism game maker is 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.289
 able to develop games for websites or 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.820
 mobile with enough quality I've been 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.440
 investigating and I have met with 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.539
 several of them that sell quite 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.850
 ok in google android play or in the 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.039
 apple story there are people that even 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.109
 is professionally dedicated to create 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.780
 games with game maker but not us 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.490
 let's go through the hills of Ubeda I know that 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.770
 many of you just want to create 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.630
 your games for pleasure what I want 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.970
 to remark is that if you get them to do 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.010
 well enough they could get to 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.850
 sell like I do not have a camera and I can not 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.189
 record on android 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.090
 I've decided to look for four examples of what 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.850
 that I consider that 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.119
 professional game maker games in 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.439
 this case are exported in html5 to 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.439
 be executed on the web 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.870
 that's why it's a kind of arkanoid 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.790
 mixed with angry birds we can catch 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.470
 this ball and we have to destroy 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.510
 this pileup up here avoiding 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.470
 that the balls those with bad milk we 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.100
 den we throw back and we load 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.100
 the pileup 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.420
 I do not have a ball 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.420
 I do not have balls 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.780
 to shine out there 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.780
 he killed me 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.810
 that gives points good as you see is a 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.580
 game with a pretty finish 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.680
 professional 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.829
 ej 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.709
 cartoon but with some graphics 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.900
 very careful this I already tell you what 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:30.829
 I consider professional let's try the 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.829
 next game that is skype driver 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.250
 here what we have to do is go 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:40.280
 dodging birds if they give us no fuss 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.330
 the parachute and take for ass we're going 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.280
 taking dots here 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.160
 as you see this type of games are usually 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.490
 have some fun graphics because if 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.380
 you can not compete in 3d graphics 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.700
 stories of these because the best is 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.860
 do something fun that he likes to 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.210
 people that are very addictive let's leave 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.210
 with haystack and all this is not fuck 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.400
 we enter terminal velocity 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.350
 now we have to see if there is any kind 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.600
 around here with a parachute to take it off 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.900
 and let him die violently here 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.360
 we have it 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.400
 goodbye friends 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.400
 poor thing to a helicopter 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.440
 and good as vice is a fun game 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.440
 simple and professional work 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.480
 let's see now on 20 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.959
 let's go to the world 1 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.120
 go if we have a little buff 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.549
 made a good 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.069
 oh what a cool guy you can go under 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.069
 of the squares but as a jump 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.720
 ostia 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.700
 we already have diamonds up here what 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.710
 cool I'm going to do good let's see how 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.710
 dies by taking by sack 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.440
 As you can see, it has a little bit of 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.349
 better paint this little game graphically 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.449
 but the truth is that it's so funny 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.250
 It is funny and quite original is not 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.280
 you will tell me that you have seen many games 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.690
 like this one to play on the phone 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.690
 It has to be pretty fun 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.680
 you have eaten me whole 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.680
 well finally let's try the frob 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.310
 that this one has some very graphic 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.260
 pimps to me I really like 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.940
 that goes from this little frog that has to go 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.680
 eating 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.810
 has to go eating bugs two bugs 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.210
 that are appearing here 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.850
 example now is this sometimes gets 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.970
 bad if you do not eat the right bug 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.639
 let's eat us because a 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.840

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.840
 another of these 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.800

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.390
 snails here 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.490
 and that as you see then 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.410
 usually the professional games of 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.670
 key maker are games with a finish 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.680
 graphic thank you syrian are two of 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.230
 addictive especially that are addictive 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.330
