00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.929
 nevertheless, they are rarely encountered in Germany 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.349
 the over 25 meter long precipitation Leader Lyon or Dortmund Â»/ fax like her 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.349
 to be named 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:23.529
 and walls were or are tentatively alone with a derogation 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.529
 on specially approved routes on the way 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.390
 between to the centers on well-developed country roads 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.740
 and of course on the highway 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.740
 unnoticed by the public 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.110
 through inner cities or residential areas may the giant truck in Germany 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.460
 not yet available 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.800
 a freight forwarder the winner logo station wagon because it just has to be such an argument 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.729
 freight forwarders 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.189
 of 3 500 million cargo space makes one inspired and thus for deep rings 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.670
 but true is the opposite 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.060
 Huge trucks would be even more long haul transports by rail 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.770
 shift to the street 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.000
 the environmentally friendly engines in Germany are even more behind 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.310
 even new representations in the new industrial area were already possible 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.380
 as part of the test drives ca Riesenbecker as deliver 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.520
 while the actually perfect siding remains unused 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.220
 the test drives of some large German forwarding agencies are only the beginning 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.900
 his 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.700
 nor does the legal situation prohibit the regular use of the roads 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.650
 Behemoths in Germany 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.710
 But politics is under pressure from big companies 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.710
 as the car 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.860
 Therefore, the federal government again wants vices in the future on many highways 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.030
 and drive on country roads 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.409
 and if Germany tilts as a central transit country, the Cooper 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.510
 have far consequences 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.860
 For years, strong forces in Brussels have been working on Driessen trucks throughout 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.339
 To allow Europe 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:16.209
 What that was like in our cities we once had in Sweden 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.209
 viewed 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.969
 Giant trucks signify a significant leap 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.269
 Instead of mass market 18 meters and 40 tons, they should be up to 25 meters long 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.269
 be and weigh up to 60 tons 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:42.499
 the Swedes include such precipitation already everyday Thies 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:46.149
 Climate are there under still secret burden than so far with us in 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:49.009
 Germany 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.569
 our roads are at an extra charge of 60 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.569
 Tons not set 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:01.129
 Roads and bridges serve and their weight is broken even faster 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.250
 already 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.250
 of course, all at the expense of German taxpayers 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:15.639
 Roundabouts are not exhausted for 25 meters long 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:19.199
 with the 14th 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.590
 Parking spaces need to be specific to freeways Red too short 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.590
 so that the trailer would carry dangerously on the road 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.479
 on slopes, the extra weight would be fully effective 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.340
 Result snail pace with all risky and he has honest consequences 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.839
 Our Tony would have to, according to a study of the Federal Highway Research Institute 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:48.839
 Millions of taxpayers' money to be converted 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.429
 to consider their fire load of giant trucks 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.430
 Dieter Bohlen is especially on the highways never saw murder and 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.300
 dangerous 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.960
 because the driver needs even longer than service companies in every respect 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.799
 if I put the money in the corridors highway construction 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:13.029
 SID 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:17.030
 we need to study the no guides to an expert 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.029
 would be able to raise about heavy trucks 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.030
 on slippery roads such a giant is even more difficult to control 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.729
 to keep as already 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.479
 This happened in this fatal accident for the driver in Sweden 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.599
 The smallest mistake of the driver can have disastrous consequences 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.150
 Not a few change after a short time back to the usual trucks 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.150
 because they can not stand the stress in the cab 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:54.779
 Final madness would be huge trucks in the cities when crossing animals 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.919
 currently stuck, for example, in the middle of a railroad crossing 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.919
 could 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.960
 placed a small unforeseen obstacle 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.599
 Three-quarters of Germans do not want to have such scenes with us 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.240
 but the danger is growing 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.330
 The giant truck is to come 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.409
 also with us in Germany
