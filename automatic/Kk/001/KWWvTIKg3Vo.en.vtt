00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.900 

it's<00:00:11.769> something<00:00:12.160> you<00:00:12.219> find<00:00:12.459> about<00:00:12.549> that<00:00:12.789> is

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:12.910 
it's something you find about that is

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.119 
it's something you find about that is
way<00:00:13.240> harder<00:00:13.509> to<00:00:14.259> keep<00:00:14.440> you<00:00:14.589> control<00:00:14.949> when

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
way harder to keep you control when

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.640 
way harder to keep you control when
you're<00:00:15.219> coming<00:00:15.400> down<00:00:16.230> because<00:00:17.230> you<00:00:17.320> try<00:00:17.500> to<00:00:17.530> do

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
you're coming down because you try to do

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.990 
you're coming down because you try to do
two<00:00:17.800> things<00:00:18.039> at<00:00:18.220> once<00:00:18.400> you<00:00:18.519> trying<00:00:18.730> to<00:00:18.759> release

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
two things at once you trying to release

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.640 
two things at once you trying to release
the<00:00:19.210> bend<00:00:19.420> like<00:00:19.869> you're<00:00:19.990> still<00:00:20.199> bending<00:00:20.410> the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
the bend like you're still bending the

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.630 
the bend like you're still bending the
string<00:00:20.710> so<00:00:21.099> you're<00:00:21.189> going<00:00:21.310> to<00:00:21.339> let<00:00:21.460> the<00:00:21.609> string

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
string so you're going to let the string

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.880 
string so you're going to let the string
down<00:00:22.119> pushing<00:00:23.050> it<00:00:23.259> off<00:00:23.410> otherwise<00:00:23.949> you<00:00:24.220> go

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
down pushing it off otherwise you go

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.230 
down pushing it off otherwise you go
so<00:00:26.890> devalue<00:00:29.369> string<00:00:30.369> wants<00:00:30.580> to<00:00:30.640> come<00:00:30.820> down<00:00:30.849> too

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
so devalue string wants to come down too

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:41.280 
so devalue string wants to come down too
far

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.870 

so<00:00:42.290> messing<00:00:42.980> around<00:00:43.070> with<00:00:43.220> that<00:00:43.280> is<00:00:43.520> good<00:00:43.700> for

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
so messing around with that is good for

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.970 
so messing around with that is good for
you<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:44.030> one<00:00:44.870> moment<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.320> best<00:00:45.470> thing<00:00:45.830> in<00:00:45.950> the

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
you and one moment the best thing in the

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.280 
you and one moment the best thing in the
world<00:00:46.040> I<00:00:46.489> think<00:00:46.700> this<00:00:47.090> is<00:00:47.239> where<00:00:47.420> it<00:00:47.780> starts<00:00:48.230> to

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
world I think this is where it starts to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.530 
world I think this is where it starts to
get<00:00:48.440> trickier<00:00:48.860> with<00:00:49.400> chromatic<00:00:49.910> scale<00:00:50.120> how<00:00:50.390> in

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
get trickier with chromatic scale how in

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.510 
get trickier with chromatic scale how in
tune<00:00:50.750> can<00:00:51.020> you<00:00:51.110> bend<00:00:51.290> several<00:00:51.680> less<00:00:51.860> dramatic

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
tune can you bend several less dramatic

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:14.180 
tune can you bend several less dramatic
scale

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.469 

how<00:01:15.190> single<00:01:16.060> if<00:01:16.119> you<00:01:16.240> make<00:01:16.360> that<00:01:16.509> sound<00:01:18.479> what's

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
how single if you make that sound what's

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.240 
how single if you make that sound what's
the<00:01:19.600> real<00:01:19.780> test<00:01:20.080> is<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.320> pick<00:01:20.590> every<00:01:21.009> one<00:01:21.159> of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
the real test is to pick every one of

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:32.510 
the real test is to pick every one of
those

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.109 

experimenting<00:01:33.520> with<00:01:33.640> stuff<00:01:33.789> like<00:01:33.820> that<00:01:33.969> just

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
experimenting with stuff like that just

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.810 
experimenting with stuff like that just
be<00:01:34.420> honest<00:01:34.750> with<00:01:34.840> yourself<00:01:35.289> how<00:01:36.280> it<00:01:36.460> changes

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
be honest with yourself how it changes

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.399 
be honest with yourself how it changes
it<00:01:36.969> sound<00:01:37.210> would<00:01:37.420> I<00:01:37.509> pay<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:37.840> hear<00:01:38.200> somebody

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
it sound would I pay to hear somebody

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.700 
it sound would I pay to hear somebody
else<00:01:38.590> do<00:01:38.979> this<00:01:40.289> that<00:01:41.289> last<00:01:41.500> one<00:01:41.680> was

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
else do this that last one was

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.730 
else do this that last one was
borderline<00:01:42.159> you<00:01:42.490> probably<00:01:42.759> wouldn't<00:01:43.119> like

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
borderline you probably wouldn't like

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.419 
borderline you probably wouldn't like
this<00:01:44.740> by<00:01:44.979> you<00:01:45.039> how<00:01:45.520> did<00:01:45.789> you<00:01:45.820> use<00:01:46.149> to<00:01:46.479> neurosis

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
this by you how did you use to neurosis

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.710 
this by you how did you use to neurosis
it's<00:01:48.429> a<00:01:48.520> lot<00:01:48.729> easier<00:01:48.909> actually<00:01:49.329> if<00:01:49.569> you've

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
it's a lot easier actually if you've

00:01:49.720 --> 00:02:12.479 
it's a lot easier actually if you've
gone<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:08.140> might<00:02:08.289> enjoy<00:02:08.500> that<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.890> concoct<00:02:12.220> and

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
gone you might enjoy that to concoct and

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.250 
gone you might enjoy that to concoct and
exercise<00:02:12.910> it's<00:02:13.090> on<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.269> verge<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.690> what<00:02:14.140> you

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
exercise it's on the verge of what you

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.800 
exercise it's on the verge of what you
consider<00:02:14.410> possible<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.340> really<00:02:16.269> hone<00:02:16.599> in<00:02:16.750> on

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
consider possible and really hone in on

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:25.080 
consider possible and really hone in on
the<00:02:17.500> churning<00:02:17.739> of<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:23.069> I'm<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:24.549> problem<00:02:24.910> people

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
the churning of it I'm a problem people

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.680 
the churning of it I'm a problem people
have<00:02:25.269> today<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.730> temptation<00:02:28.329> to<00:02:28.360> let<00:02:28.599> the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
have today the temptation to let the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.900 
have today the temptation to let the
note<00:02:28.870> fall<00:02:29.230> down<00:02:29.560> once<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.489> start<00:02:30.790> wobbling

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
note fall down once you start wobbling

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
note fall down once you start wobbling
what<00:02:33.910> are<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.090> actually<00:02:34.269> doing<00:02:34.480> that<00:02:34.870> you

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
what are you actually doing that you

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.770 
what are you actually doing that you
bend<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.290> note<00:02:35.410> up<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.650> pitch<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:37.480> then<00:02:37.660> when

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
bend a note up to pitch and then when

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.170 
bend a note up to pitch and then when
you<00:02:37.840> stop<00:02:38.079> wobbling<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:38.799> think<00:02:39.310> what<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.030> do<00:02:40.150> is

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
you stop wobbling I think what you do is

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.370 
you stop wobbling I think what you do is
bending<00:02:40.690> slightly<00:02:40.810> sharp<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.660> then<00:02:44.140> doing

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
bending slightly sharp and then doing

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.759 
bending slightly sharp and then doing
this<00:02:44.560> rocking<00:02:45.010> motion<00:02:45.430> with<00:02:45.639> your<00:02:45.670> hands<00:02:46.769> if

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
this rocking motion with your hands if

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.349 
this rocking motion with your hands if
you<00:02:47.859> just<00:02:48.010> leave<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.340> bed<00:02:48.519> where<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.760> was<00:02:49.000> and

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
you just leave the bed where it was and

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.190 
you just leave the bed where it was and
start<00:02:49.569> rocking

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:06.770 

sound<00:02:53.010> as<00:02:53.160> if<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.400> going<00:02:53.550> flat

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.020 

I<00:03:07.340> kind<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.370> think<00:03:08.490> that<00:03:08.610> if<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.820> ought<00:03:08.910> to

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
I kind of think that if you ought to

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.940 
I kind of think that if you ought to
keep<00:03:09.270> it<00:03:09.540> sounding<00:03:10.440> in<00:03:10.530> tune

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
keep it sounding in tune

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.710 
keep it sounding in tune
yeah<00:03:11.070> just<00:03:11.250> overcompensate<00:03:12.060> slightly<00:03:12.510> and

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
yeah just overcompensate slightly and

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.890 
yeah just overcompensate slightly and
then<00:03:12.990> when<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.320> let<00:03:13.500> them<00:03:13.650> live<00:03:14.610> abroad<00:03:14.900> sorry

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
then when you let them live abroad sorry

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.570 
then when you let them live abroad sorry
when<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.170> let<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.380> vibrato<00:03:16.620> motion<00:03:16.860> kick<00:03:17.370> in

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
when you let the vibrato motion kick in

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.200 
when you let the vibrato motion kick in
you<00:03:18.360> should<00:03:18.650> retain<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:20.370> semblance<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.940> pitch

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
you should retain the semblance of pitch

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.840 
you should retain the semblance of pitch
and<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:22.830> really<00:03:23.040> can<00:03:23.160> play<00:03:23.280> tricks<00:03:23.340> on<00:03:23.700> you

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
and you really can play tricks on you

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.130 
and you really can play tricks on you
like<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.120> if<00:03:24.300> I<00:03:24.420> think<00:03:24.480> if<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.750> add<00:03:24.870> vibrato

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
like this if I think if you add vibrato

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.490 
like this if I think if you add vibrato

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
no really though that note is actually

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:43.100 
no really though that note is actually
makes<00:03:36.030> me<00:03:36.240> that<00:03:36.420> if<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.630> slow<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.870> down<00:03:42.110> it's

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
makes me that if you slow it down it's

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.250 
makes me that if you slow it down it's
really<00:03:43.260> not<00:03:43.500> my<00:03:43.680> home<00:03:43.980> anymore

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
really not my home anymore

intrigued<00:03:59.010> by<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.310> other<00:03:59.610> way<00:03:59.970> by<00:04:00.150> adding

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
intrigued by the other way by adding

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.120 
intrigued by the other way by adding
adding<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.720> bra<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:01.080> it's<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.320> bit<00:04:01.500> more<00:04:01.620> vocal<00:04:01.800> a

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
adding a bra so it's a bit more vocal a

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.070 
adding a bra so it's a bit more vocal a
bit<00:04:02.400> more<00:04:02.520> violin<00:04:02.910> like<00:04:03.150> anything<00:04:04.050> that

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
bit more violin like anything that

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:14.770 
bit more violin like anything that
doesn't<00:04:04.350> have<00:04:04.590> friends

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.449 

hmm<00:04:15.780> sounds<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.620> little<00:04:16.770> sweeter<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.370> little

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
hmm sounds a little sweeter a little

Brian<00:04:18.000> May<00:04:18.270> I<00:04:18.600> think<00:04:18.690> rather

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.420 

if<00:04:29.689> you<00:04:29.960> can<00:04:30.110> prebend<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.830> notice<00:04:31.159> a<00:04:31.280> little

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
if you can prebend the notice a little

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.670 
if you can prebend the notice a little
and<00:04:31.610> then<00:04:31.810> wobble<00:04:32.810> it<00:04:32.930> from<00:04:33.080> there<00:04:33.289> then<00:04:33.590> you

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
and then wobble it from there then you

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.230 
and then wobble it from there then you
have<00:04:33.710> more<00:04:33.949> freedom<00:04:34.250> to<00:04:34.280> go<00:04:34.490> both<00:04:34.699> up<00:04:34.909> and<00:04:35.120> down

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
have more freedom to go both up and down

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.309 
have more freedom to go both up and down
in<00:04:35.629> pitch<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:37.449> maybe<00:04:38.449> we<00:04:38.689> do<00:04:38.840> need<00:04:39.020> four

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
in pitch and maybe we do need four

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.659 
in pitch and maybe we do need four
things<00:04:39.349> you'll<00:04:39.830> be<00:04:39.860> able<00:04:39.979> to<00:04:40.159> make<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.520> little

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
things you'll be able to make a little

00:04:40.669 --> 00:05:18.620 
things you'll be able to make a little
bit<00:04:40.789> more<00:04:59.349> easy

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.310 

oh<00:05:20.150> and<00:05:21.150> I<00:05:21.360> guess<00:05:21.450> the<00:05:21.630> next<00:05:21.660> thing<00:05:22.020> we<00:05:22.170> could

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
oh and I guess the next thing we could

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.130 
oh and I guess the next thing we could
try<00:05:22.350> and<00:05:22.530> work<00:05:22.740> out<00:05:22.950> how<00:05:23.160> you<00:05:23.190> can<00:05:23.840> bring<00:05:24.840> bends

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
try and work out how you can bring bends

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.800 
try and work out how you can bring bends
into<00:05:25.470> your<00:05:25.770> phrasing<00:05:26.550> and<00:05:26.730> what<00:05:27.450> can<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:27.690> do

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
into your phrasing and what can you do

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.030 
into your phrasing and what can you do
