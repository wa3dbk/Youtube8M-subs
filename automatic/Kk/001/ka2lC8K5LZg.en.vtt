00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello and welcome to hardware advice 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.429
 this video the update of the 1800 euro 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.599
 gaming computers january 2014 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.420
 as a processor came the intel core i7 4770 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.800
 with 4 times 3 5 gigahertz he has a goal 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.100
 day of 3 9 ghz 84 watt tdp one 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.240
 integrated graphics unit the intel hd 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.010
 4600 is quite handy for 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.449
 video editing or if you have one 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.490

 he took a came that means 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.960
 So he has a free multiplier 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.239
 Freis overclocked half a trading 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.370
 means anyone can has two threads as 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.140
 a theoretical eight core reached 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.510
 of course for all current games 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.129
 slack off and gamer he was the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.170
 next three to five years thick 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.329
 suffice if she gets too weak 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.640
 you can overclock it and yes as 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.980

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.210
 cooler and with him is quiet operate 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.199
 or overclocking possible then as 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.100
 mainboard the asz 87a with the intel z 87 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.580
 chips it has usb3 sata3 four ddr3 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.650
 ram banks pci express 3.0 a 10.1 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.979
 soundchip and ameropa ps 22 x usb2 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.200
 mini displayport hdmi vga and dvi for 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.950
 the integrated graphics unit four times 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.990
 usb 3 a lan socket and 6 3 5 mm 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.630
 Clinking and a casting for the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.500
 sound chip as memory 16 gb 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.040
 crucial ballistix port ddr3 1600 the 10th 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.759
 9 through it ddr3 1600 and soul 9 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.770
 quite fast 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.240
 it's a tool kit that means you 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.790
 can operate in the dual channel mode 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.899
 and 16 gigabytes in time for gamers 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.790
 and pretty over the top 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.590
 So with the pc you would not have to 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.329
 thoughts more about making room for the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.130
 next year and as ssd the 240 gb 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.680
 it 's one of the fastest ssds you can get 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.140
 can get on the market and 240 gb 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.509
 is sufficient for the operating system all 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.729
 programs and a few games and as 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.380

 seagate barracuda 7200 points 10 it is 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.400
 a faster than average hdd 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.110
 and a terabyte for most 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.960
 among you enough 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:21.150
 and as a graphics card the three gigabytes gb 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:23.100
 geforce gtx 87 ti oc the gtx 480 is the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.810
 fastest single gpu graphics card the 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.390
 you can just get on the market 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.490
 and additionally overclocked this again 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.010
 but thanks to tim info 3x cooler 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.140
 not too loud, of course you can

 as a power supply the 580 watt be quiet 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.300
 straight power e9 it is modular that 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.370
 means you can take off the cables 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.489
 you do not need 80 plus gold very much 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.830
 energy saving and 85 was more than enough 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.870
 for the pc and has so still something air 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.600
