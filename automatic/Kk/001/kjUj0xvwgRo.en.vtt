reading this year in 2014 and I decided

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.160 
reading this year in 2014 and I decided
I<00:00:52.920> would<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.250> pick<00:00:53.399> up<00:00:53.520> his<00:00:53.930> middle<00:00:54.930> grade

officially<00:01:01.649> middle<00:01:01.920> grade<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.250> might<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.579> wrong

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
officially middle grade I might be wrong

officially middle grade I might be wrong
but<00:01:02.760> let<00:01:03.120> me<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.449> comments<00:01:03.719> below<00:01:03.809> if

goes to this school and um I assume for
rithmatist<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.650> peers<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.829> his<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.159> students

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
at this school start disappearing and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.050 
at this school start disappearing and
leaving<00:01:37.290> trails<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.890> blood<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.579> he's<00:01:38.820> up<00:01:38.939> with

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
leaving trails of blood so he's up with

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.249 
leaving trails of blood so he's up with
a<00:01:39.090> friend<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.540> think<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.750> professor<00:01:40.110> that

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
a friend and I think a professor that

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.630 
a friend and I think a professor that
works<00:01:40.409> at<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> school<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.070> figure<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.490> all

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
works at the school to figure out all

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.620 
works at the school to figure out all
these<00:01:41.759> murders<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.090> figure<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.420> what's

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
these murders and figure out what's

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.149 
these murders and figure out what's
going<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:42.869> that's<00:01:43.500> all<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.680> really<00:01:43.890> know<00:01:44.130> about

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
going on that's all I really know about

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.310 
going on that's all I really know about
it<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:45.030> going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.299> be<00:01:45.420> epic<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.899> just

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
it it's going to be epic and just

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.050 
it it's going to be epic and just
because<00:01:46.619> Brandon<00:01:46.950> Sanderson<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.520> such<00:01:48.030> a

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
because Brandon Sanderson is such a

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.160 
because Brandon Sanderson is such a
well-known<00:01:48.270> author<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.689> think<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.020> will<00:01:49.110> just

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
well-known author I think it will just

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.810 
well-known author I think it will just
be<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> very<00:01:49.619> good<00:01:49.860> read<00:01:50.009> next<00:01:50.399> one<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.729> to

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
Fire or whatever so I definitely saw

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.190 
Fire or whatever so I definitely saw
parallels<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.570> I<00:03:30.600> was<00:03:30.750> interested

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
parallels to that and I was interested

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.350 
parallels to that and I was interested
to<00:03:31.230> read<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.740> story<00:03:31.950> because<00:03:32.220> I<00:03:32.340> think<00:03:32.580> that

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
to read the story because I think that

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.060 
to read the story because I think that
probably<00:03:33.540> inspired<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:34.500> don't<00:03:34.830> know<00:03:34.890> for

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
probably inspired it I don't know for

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.680 
probably inspired it I don't know for
sure<00:03:35.100> but<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.459> was<00:03:35.640> my<00:03:35.730> guess<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.240> it<00:03:36.510> just

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
sure but that was my guess and it just

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.060 
sure but that was my guess and it just
sounds<00:03:37.110> like<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.290> really<00:03:37.470> good<00:03:37.680> science

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
sounds like a really good science

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.740 
sounds like a really good science
fiction<00:03:38.100> middle<00:03:38.610> grade<00:03:38.760> story<00:03:39.030> I'm<00:03:39.209> really

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
really really excited to read this and I

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.790 
really really excited to read this and I
let<00:03:42.240> you<00:03:42.270> guys<00:03:42.450> know<00:03:42.630> what<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.780> think<00:03:43.050> also<00:03:43.440> I'm

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
let you guys know what I think also I'm

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.290

just so impressed by the quality of this

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.810 
just so impressed by the quality of this
because<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.660> lot<00:03:45.870> of<00:03:45.900> self-published<00:03:46.590> books

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
because a lot of self-published books

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.310 
because a lot of self-published books
it's<00:03:47.820> just<00:03:47.970> really<00:03:48.209> expensive<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:49.050> publish

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
it's just really expensive to publish

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.960 
it's just really expensive to publish
your<00:03:49.410> own<00:03:49.470> novels<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.490> just<00:03:50.640> looks<00:03:50.820> so

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
your own novels and it just looks so

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.630 
your own novels and it just looks so
professional<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.630> well<00:03:51.810> done<00:03:52.080> and<00:03:52.380> I'm<00:03:53.340> just

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
professional and well done and I'm just

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.640 
professional and well done and I'm just
really<00:03:54.390> excited<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:55.080> read<00:03:55.170> this<00:03:55.230> middle<00:03:55.500> grade
