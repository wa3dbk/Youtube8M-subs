00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
well in that game I just thought the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.080 
well in that game I just thought the
penalty<00:01:25.530> came<00:01:25.799> at<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> wrong<00:01:26.220> time<00:01:26.610> right<00:01:26.939> at

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
penalty came at the wrong time right at

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.210 
penalty came at the wrong time right at
the<00:01:27.240> start<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> game<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.890> know<00:01:29.040> it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
the start of the game and you know it

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.980 
the start of the game and you know it
was<00:01:29.400> disappointing<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.119> see<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.780> was<00:01:30.960> a

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
was disappointing to see and it was a

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.660 
was disappointing to see and it was a
penalty<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.799> know<00:01:31.920> I've<00:01:32.009> gotta<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.400> honest

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
penalty you know I've gotta be honest

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.770 
penalty you know I've gotta be honest
that<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> only<00:01:33.060> decision<00:01:33.329> my<00:01:33.540> thought

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that was the only decision my thought

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.990 
that was the only decision my thought
was<00:01:33.930> right<00:01:34.110> by<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.770> referee<00:01:35.189> rather<00:01:35.610> terrible

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
was right by the referee rather terrible

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.330 
was right by the referee rather terrible
game<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.479> me<00:01:36.600> yeah<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.350> thought<00:01:37.740> after<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
game for me yeah I thought after the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.550 
game for me yeah I thought after the
penalty<00:01:38.850> though<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.450> played<00:01:39.689> really<00:01:39.869> well<00:01:40.079> and

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
penalty though we played really well and

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.499 
penalty though we played really well and
I<00:01:40.860> definitely<00:01:41.070> think<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.670> second<00:01:42.060> part<00:01:42.270> we

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
I definitely think in the second part we

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.810 
I definitely think in the second part we
done<00:01:42.689> enough<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.770> not<00:01:43.890> only<00:01:44.009> draw<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.579> game

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
done enough to not only draw that game

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.690 
done enough to not only draw that game
but<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.149> actually<00:01:45.299> come<00:01:45.689> away<00:01:45.930> with<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.200> win

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
but to actually come away with the win

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.160 
but to actually come away with the win
definitely<00:01:47.700> yeah<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.210> know<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.689> thought<00:01:48.869> I

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
definitely yeah you know and I thought I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.450 
definitely yeah you know and I thought I
thought<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.590> playing<00:01:49.829> well<00:01:50.009> before<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
thought we playing well before the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.069 
thought we playing well before the
penalty<00:01:50.850> as<00:01:51.000> well<00:01:51.180> ya<00:01:51.509> know<00:01:51.720> there<00:01:51.930> was<00:01:52.049> a

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
it was something that champ probably

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.920 
it was something that champ probably
would<00:04:08.400> have<00:04:08.489> found<00:04:08.640> hard<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.090> avoid<00:04:09.390> because

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
would have found hard to avoid because

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.900 
would have found hard to avoid because
he<00:04:10.410> went<00:04:10.620> in<00:04:10.739> for<00:04:10.889> the<00:04:10.980> tackle<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.519> has<00:04:11.730> it

knocked<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.239> away<00:04:12.329> from<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:13.049> know<00:04:13.170> it's

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
knocked it away from and you know it's

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.840 
knocked it away from and you know it's
just<00:04:13.470> one<00:04:13.620> of<00:04:13.739> them<00:04:13.889> where<00:04:14.100> he<00:04:14.220> just<00:04:14.609> starts

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
just one of them where he just starts

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.509 
just one of them where he just starts
that<00:04:14.940> you<00:04:15.000> took<00:04:15.180> him<00:04:15.329> down<00:04:15.540> my<00:04:15.780> mistake<00:04:16.139> and

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
that you took him down my mistake and

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.490 
that you took him down my mistake and
I'm<00:04:17.519> hazard<00:04:18.299> well<00:04:18.510> class<00:04:18.840> so<00:04:19.079> don't<00:04:19.350> take

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
I'm hazard well class so don't take

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.680 
I'm hazard well class so don't take
nothing<00:04:19.829> away<00:04:19.859> from<00:04:19.979> Emory<00:04:20.430> chan<00:04:20.669> scale<00:04:21.389> had<00:04:21.660> a

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
nothing away from Emory chan scale had a

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.659 
nothing away from Emory chan scale had a
brilliant<00:04:21.989> game<00:04:22.440> I<00:04:22.710> think<00:04:23.010> he<00:04:23.099> made<00:04:23.250> some<00:04:23.430> key

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
brilliant game I think he made some key

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.510 
brilliant game I think he made some key
interception<00:04:24.150> some<00:04:24.539> kooky<00:04:25.080> tackles<00:04:25.650> yeah<00:04:26.310> and

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
interception some kooky tackles yeah and

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.770 
interception some kooky tackles yeah and
I<00:04:26.580> also<00:04:26.610> thought<00:04:27.240> that

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
I also thought that

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.260 
I also thought that
Lucas<00:04:28.080> it's<00:04:28.320> just<00:04:28.950> Bossin<00:04:29.670> that<00:04:29.940> that

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
Lucas it's just Bossin that that

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
held back game for us and then give us

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.870 
held back game for us and then give us
the<00:06:10.169> opportunity<00:06:10.229> to<00:06:10.860> get<00:06:11.100> some<00:06:11.160> chances<00:06:11.490> in

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
the opportunity to get some chances in

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.210 
the opportunity to get some chances in
it's<00:06:12.660> a<00:06:12.750> toss-up<00:06:13.110> between<00:06:13.260> Lucas<00:06:13.830> and<00:06:14.010> scale

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
it's a toss-up between Lucas and scale

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.600 
it's a toss-up between Lucas and scale
but<00:06:14.610> I'm<00:06:14.700> gonna<00:06:14.940> go<00:06:15.120> for<00:06:15.419> scale<00:06:15.810> again<00:06:16.610> because

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.640 
but I'm gonna go for scale again because
I<00:06:17.640> just<00:06:17.880> think<00:06:18.120> scale<00:06:18.720> done<00:06:18.990> such<00:06:19.260> a<00:06:19.289> good<00:06:19.590> job
