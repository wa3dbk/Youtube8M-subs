00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hi time for another new cooking video 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.759
 today and I have another whole 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.120
 easy for you today we go 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.950
 crosant me finds flavors and not just 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.660
 post on darlings not savory but 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.630
 triple chocolate 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.199
 crosant life super easy three 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.810
 Ingredients would rather need something more 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.730
 maybe not very much anymore 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.039
 but it certainly looks worth it 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.050
 OK these are the ingredients that I like 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.880
 go to use i have a look with here 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.949
 crispy dough I have mini pro signs one 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.500
 bag not very handy you can do better 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.270
 just take a look with 6 larger plots 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.620
 hands but good will be fine I do 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.899
 it in a different way 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.270
 I'm going to use nutella and pure 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.620
 chocolate and white chocolate but you can 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.960
 of course use any chocolate 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.969
 which you like you can like me already 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.620
 I said have a can with micro sand dough 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.550
 is not in itself bad but just something 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.379
 less easy 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.300
 I have four of those slices look like you 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.340
 it rolls out can see this is a spot 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.199
 for two crowns that I have on 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.440
 each other if you have a link with 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.850
 6% on the decor 6 pleasant then you have 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.129
 actually as a square around 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.170
 rectangle and what I am going to do is one 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.900
 diagonal cutters 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.790
 so better this I grab a knife and then 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.950
 I go the top of these triangles 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.100
 lubricate with nutella 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.320
 I just rub an entire top 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.830
 and I also drape a son's triangle 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.170
 a silicone mold oh this is it 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.909
 disadvantage of little ones care will be good 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.009
 flat 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.720
 this is how it looks now it is not there 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.189
 off course but that doesn't matter 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.439
 will soon be all right 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.520
 I now grab some white John Blue chip 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.950
 that okay and what the tube glitches and pure 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.700
 now i would like those edges that are here outside 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.229
 hang over the middle so you really have one 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.790
 close package is not necessary 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.380
 totally neat looks nice to us 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.960
 a bit messy is yo 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.759
 and that is now we complete this we fill 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.680
 for this we use all slices of curl 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.240
 Sunday we will bake them 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.579
 Barbie are stuffed in the oven 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.240
 preheated 180 degrees and now we go them 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.570
 to tackle 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.250
 around 15 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.710
 20 minutes in the middle of the oven or 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.410
 until the dough is nicely browned 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.170
 just put the muffins out of the oven and look like that 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.730
 they exhaust briefly cool before 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.920
 we are going to taste them from that chocolate 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.260
 it is naturally piping hot 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.540
 but now they look super cute in the 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.980
 triple chocolate class will be different 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.770
 ready and see how nice they look 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:37.630
 but it gets even better because look at it 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:41.800
 I happen to him open wide leaf 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.600
 heaven i think this is really crazy 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.489
 nice breakfast sheds and very much 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.880
 more time than making crowns 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.370
 with that constant dough it is not me 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.450
 go taste it and I'll be right back at it 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.330
 judgment 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.180
 oh moment I am recording this video 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.180
 actually has a really hard time outside 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.180
 look 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.900
 so if you can't stand me that well or 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.320
 noise heard in the background a 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.970
 bit what it is but i drum and i 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.160
 triple chocolate cross she finds another 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.650
 its really my sense it is real 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.210
 just a chocolate crown but then 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:25.390
 better with more chocolate say really lol 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.040
 really sure can try delicious 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.590
 on Sunday from biting pain extensive 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.150
 brunch or of course for the holidays 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.050
 but that will take a while 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.850
 if you didn't like chocolate, by the way 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.680
 holder can of course also be endless 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.170
 vary with these muffins and do the 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.670
 tasty onions and cheese become ham and cheese 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.260
 having it doesn't matter makes them tasty 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.910
 savory or sweet 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.150
 you can go in any direction with it, just like 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.200
 that you all with constant crowns 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.430
 can go either way 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.560
 if you have the hand of this is still 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.060
 even have questions quickly forget 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.890
