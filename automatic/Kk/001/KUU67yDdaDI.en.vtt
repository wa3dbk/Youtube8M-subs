00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:15.760
 The rest of the time when I always introduce that little star lens 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:19.720
 Is one of the auto-focus speed test of what I try to do always ne This is of 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:23.100
 I think it will be quite important, so please take a look 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:27.900
 8 Why do you do this? 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:33.120
 I softening Kedomo I think that many people wins torched in it is a professional person manual 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:36.989
 I am still an amateur, so I'm relying on autofocus 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:42.010
 So that I am particularly Tteyuu this 70,300 is 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:47.020
 It is an athletic meet in terms of purpose, and I say that after that 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:52.030
 Kedomo I it is sometimes to go to the shooting of Toka's Narita Airport Haneda Airport ChiYukiyoshi 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:56.710
 It is such a distant thing and I use it when I want to take it large 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:00.460
 8 athletic meet Kedomo is so me something even if you have something 8 children child's 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.890
 After that is a presentation of something 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:08.050
 As it becomes usable lens 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:11.350
 In particular, it is quick to think that it is good to take a plane but take a plane . 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:15.790
 The speed of autofocus is very important. 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.409
 There is a part that depends on the motor contained in the lens of the area by all means 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.890
 So that side is kinda 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:25.130
 I think that you see I am assuming 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:30.860
 Well Even if you're of my youtube videos 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.330
 It's four, but it's been a little longer, but it's d 800 that I'm introducing 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.290
 I will 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.290
 1 Start 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.130
 The lens cap was attached for a while, so remove the screw cap and put it on the subject actually 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.240
 The 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.240
 Peter is coming 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:08.429
 It is the last after having you see the Great Eastern Kasuko feed 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:11.880
 Weight with all of this equipment attached 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:18.630
 I want to introduce you to the present 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:23.220
 Supposed to say go you and about 745g in I catalog value'm home page catalog 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.860
 Because we have a filter that we can put out some weight error because that side 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.140
 I think that you will acknowledge 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.870
 Will strive towards the weight in a state where the wearing because I think that people often show through is more of filters 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.170
 I want to 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.170
 I will 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.040
 I would say to 35g 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.189
 Relatively in the zoom lens 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.420
 I think it may be about the middle stage weight 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.860
 Yes 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.860
 I will put the camera 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.200
 Here it's a little not a genuine strap 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:03.970
 I think that I want to put together 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:10.050
 But because it is 1894 g, it will be about 1.9 kg 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:14.220
 How was it now ? Fs nikkor 70300 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:19.620
 We introduced the g lens of 4.5 to 5.6 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:22.670
 I think this Benz will be a relatively older range 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.569
 First as I mentioned most 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.350
 As it is model, it is enough to use still more 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:34.540
 I think lens to the transfer 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.530
 If you like that Nikon camera, it will definitely be one of the lenses that you want to have 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.850
 I think so 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.470
 The say is that 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.160
 The price is about 47,000 yen 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.730
 I'm out 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.230
 It is said that it is wonderful to see this at this price 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.500
 Pretty 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:04:01.209
 It will be acclaimed lens from the main one 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:04.000
 When I photographed the child the other day in the park, I made a telephoto up to 300 mm and it is bust-up. 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:09.280
 I took from head to face though 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.910
 It's a bit misleading when compared to single focus, but it also gives a pretty good bokeh 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.220
 Good 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.080
 car 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.040
 Finished as a god It is good at this price 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:20.660
 To the physical is to for me 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:23.830
 I think there may not be a good lens . 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.789
 Yes to my single lens reflex shop 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:31.210
 There is also a case that it will be installed and killed. 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.610
 I think that it is best to get life to go with a card 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.039
 so 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.479
 If you want to take it the most, it will be 300 rather than having you shoot with 70mm 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:43.500
 Or 200 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:49.080
 I think that I want you to take an aperture open on the telephoto side 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:53.370
 After all I still think that it is best to enjoy the bokeh effect 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.760
 Well, it 's also good to have you focus and take a little clicky image . 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.330
 Also 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.879
 The aperture 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.880
 I hope you will enjoy English and have some fun with bokeh 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:08.510
 Yes 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:10.780
 Today we will introduce the afs Nicole 70304.55.6 g of Japan It Is 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.780
 Was 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.790
 me 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.790
 Hmm 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.790
 Hmm
