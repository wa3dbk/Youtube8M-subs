00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
back 1979 the Spyder 2000 went to a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.160 
back 1979 the Spyder 2000 went to a
different<00:00:50.910> system<00:00:51.240> but<00:00:51.780> these<00:00:51.900> use<00:00:52.140> a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
different system but these use a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.860 
different system but these use a
fastener<00:00:52.740> at<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.700> back<00:00:53.850> that's<00:00:54.060> actually<00:00:54.690> an

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
fastener at the back that's actually an

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.319 
fastener at the back that's actually an
aluminum<00:00:55.260> tube<00:00:55.500> its<00:00:56.130> knurled<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:56.940> one<00:00:57.150> end

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
aluminum tube its knurled on one end

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.150 
aluminum tube its knurled on one end
it's<00:00:57.750> threaded<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> other<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.860> what's

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
it's threaded on the other and what's

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.620 
it's threaded on the other and what's
very<00:00:59.190> important<00:00:59.700> is<00:00:59.880> the<00:01:00.000> fact<00:01:00.150> that<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.480> is

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
very important is the fact that it is

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.560 
very important is the fact that it is
hollow<00:01:01.010> now<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> problem<00:01:03.240> in<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
hollow now this is the problem in the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.810 
hollow now this is the problem in the
solution<00:01:04.019> with<00:01:04.229> these<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:05.070> problem<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.610> that

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
solution with these the problem is that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.940 
solution with these the problem is that
the<00:01:06.119> bolt<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.659> fastens<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.350> lens<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.770> is

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the bolt that fastens the lens in is

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.190 
the bolt that fastens the lens in is
actually<00:01:08.460> held<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.909> its<00:01:09.180> steel<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.079> can

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
actually held in its steel and you can

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.499 
actually held in its steel and you can
see<00:01:10.319> this<00:01:10.439> one's<00:01:10.619> pretty<00:01:10.799> corroded<00:01:11.009> in<00:01:11.340> this

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
see this one's pretty corroded in this

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.910 
see this one's pretty corroded in this
aluminum<00:01:12.509> fastener<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.200> going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> thread<00:01:13.770> on

aluminum fastener is going to thread on
that<00:01:14.100> well<00:01:14.280> because<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.819> aluminum<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
that well because this is aluminum and

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.389 
that well because this is aluminum and
this<00:01:15.899> is<00:01:16.020> steel<00:01:16.319> they're<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.069> to<00:01:17.130> set<00:01:17.280> up

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
this is steel they're going to set up

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:18.950 
this is steel they're going to set up

there's any moisture around at all these

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.709 
there's any moisture around at all these
are<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.729> sort<00:01:20.999> of<00:01:21.060> chemically<00:01:21.420> weld

themselves to each other so because of

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.910 
themselves to each other so because of
them<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.420> want<00:01:24.749> to<00:01:24.869> really<00:01:25.200> discourage<00:01:25.770> you

them I want to really discourage you
from<00:01:25.950> doing<00:01:26.159> something<00:01:26.429> like<00:01:26.759> applying<00:01:27.450> some

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
from doing something like applying some

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.599 
from doing something like applying some
locking<00:01:28.200> pliers<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.859> get<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.130> off<00:01:29.310> because

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
locking pliers to get this off because

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:31.069 
locking pliers to get this off because
you're<00:01:29.850> going<00:01:29.999> to<00:01:30.090> probably<00:01:30.509> break<00:01:30.749> the<00:01:30.899> lens

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
you're going to probably break the lens

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.349 
you're going to probably break the lens
instead<00:01:32.039> we're<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.549> use<00:01:32.639> the

exact<00:03:24.599> reverse<00:03:24.780> how<00:03:25.079> we<00:03:25.139> took<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.439> old<00:03:25.530> one

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
exact reverse how we took the old one

out<00:03:25.769> just<00:03:26.040> push<00:03:26.189> it<00:03:26.310> into<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.549> socket<00:03:26.759> and

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
out just push it into the socket and

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.699 
out just push it into the socket and
give<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.629> a<00:03:27.689> turn<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.139> it<00:03:28.259> will<00:03:28.409> lock<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.930> 1156

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
give it a turn and it will lock the 1156

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.559 
give it a turn and it will lock the 1156
bulb<00:03:31.919> will<00:03:32.040> not<00:03:32.250> fit<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.699> taillight<00:03:33.180> section

it's<00:03:33.750> much<00:03:33.930> shallower<00:03:34.199> in<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.590> reflector<00:03:35.069> so

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
it's much shallower in the reflector so

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.710 
it's much shallower in the reflector so
you'll<00:03:35.400> need<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.609> smaller<00:03:35.939> single<00:03:36.239> filament

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
you'll need a smaller single filament
