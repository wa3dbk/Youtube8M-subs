first day ever playing this Horner and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.029 
first day ever playing this Horner and
it<00:01:54.179> feels<00:01:54.659> comfortable<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.380> feels<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:55.829> my

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
it feels comfortable it feels like my

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.169 
it feels comfortable it feels like my
mark<00:01:56.310> six<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.079> plus<00:01:58.920> side<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.549> responds

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
mark six but on a plus side it responds

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:01.459 
mark six but on a plus side it responds
a<00:02:00.210> little<00:02:00.390> bit<00:02:00.479> more<00:02:00.600> quickly<00:02:00.899> than<00:02:01.109> my<00:02:01.259> mark

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
a little bit more quickly than my mark

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.899 
a little bit more quickly than my mark
60<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:03.060> also<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.479> think<00:02:03.569> it<00:02:03.780> has<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.929> bigger<00:02:04.319> a

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
60 and also I think it has a bigger a

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.289 
60 and also I think it has a bigger a
dynamic<00:02:05.909> range<00:02:06.270> um<00:02:07.429> it's<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:10.069> lower

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
dynamic range um it's the lower

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.100 
dynamic range um it's the lower
left-hand<00:02:12.299> keys<00:02:12.750> are<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:14.040> lot<00:02:14.430> easier<00:02:14.459> to

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
left-hand keys are a lot easier to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.650 
left-hand keys are a lot easier to
manipulate<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.739> move<00:02:16.920> around<00:02:17.099> with<00:02:17.660> the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
manipulate to move around with the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.839 
manipulate to move around with the
rollers<00:02:19.080> work<00:02:19.379> really<00:02:19.680> well<00:02:19.830> i<00:02:19.980> know<00:02:20.280> my<00:02:20.489> rose
