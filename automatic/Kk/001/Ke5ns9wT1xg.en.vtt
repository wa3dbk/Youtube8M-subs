is<00:03:01.310> usually<00:03:01.580> switched<00:03:02.060> upside-down<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:02.990> think

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
is usually switched upside-down I think

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.830 
is usually switched upside-down I think
it<00:03:03.890> actually<00:03:04.040> gives<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.460> a<00:03:04.550> nicer<00:03:04.760> ride<00:03:05.090> it's

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
it actually gives it a nicer ride it's

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.230 
it actually gives it a nicer ride it's
up<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:07.070> looks<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.370> lot<00:03:07.520> better<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:08.090> they

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
up and it looks a lot better to it they

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.730 
up and it looks a lot better to it they
split<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.660> show<00:03:08.870> but<00:03:09.080> I<00:03:09.170> think<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.440> gives<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:09.680> a

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
split the show but I think it gives it a

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.310 
split the show but I think it gives it a
nicer<00:03:09.920> ride<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.180> look<00:03:11.330> here<00:03:11.630> I<00:03:11.870> have<00:03:12.140> a

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
nicer ride and you look here I have a

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.070 
nicer ride and you look here I have a
switch<00:03:12.620> it<00:03:13.550> works<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.090> hydraulics<00:03:14.720> or<00:03:14.930> the

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
switch it works the hydraulics or the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.490 
switch it works the hydraulics or the
arrow<00:03:15.290> or<00:03:16.070> up<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:16.400> down<00:03:16.550> you<00:03:17.150> see<00:03:17.360> right<00:03:18.320> now

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
arrow or up and down you see right now

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.130
