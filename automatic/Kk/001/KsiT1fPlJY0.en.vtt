00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
double-a batteries so we're boosting

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.630 
double-a batteries so we're boosting
this<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.649> 12<00:00:58.920> volts<00:00:59.340> DC<00:00:59.579> I<00:01:01.340> didn't<00:01:02.340> want<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> go

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
this to 12 volts DC I didn't want to go

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.130 
this to 12 volts DC I didn't want to go
to<00:01:02.699> much<00:01:03.059> because<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.629> don't<00:01:03.660> want<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.960> burn<00:01:04.110> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
this battery pack fits in there like

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.970 
this battery pack fits in there like
this<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:20.030> there<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.060> have<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.560> went<00:02:22.560> from<00:02:22.680> 9

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
this and there you have it went from 9

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.009 
this and there you have it went from 9
volts<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.580> 12<00:02:23.849> volts<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.390> it's<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.569> lot<00:02:24.750> lighter

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
volts to 12 volts and it's a lot lighter

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.250 
volts to 12 volts and it's a lot lighter
so<00:02:25.950> let's<00:02:26.160> see<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.989> let's<00:02:27.989> see<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
so let's see the let's see the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.569 
so let's see the let's see the
difference<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.739> makes<00:02:29.840> here's<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.019> stock<00:02:31.579> 6d

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
difference it makes here's the stock 6d

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:48.319 
difference it makes here's the stock 6d
batteries<00:02:39.500> see<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.650> rate<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:41.040> fire<00:02:47.060> take<00:02:48.060> that

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
batteries see the rate of fire take that

00:02:48.329 --> 00:03:03.040 
batteries see the rate of fire take that
one<00:02:48.569> out<00:02:50.329> let's<00:02:51.329> put<00:02:51.599> our<00:02:51.720> mod<00:02:51.989> in

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.240 

it's<00:03:04.050> not<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.200> whole<00:03:04.440> bunch<00:03:04.680> more<00:03:04.770> but<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.220> is

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
it's not a whole bunch more but it is

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:32.840 
it's not a whole bunch more but it is
definitely<00:03:05.610> noticeable<00:03:31.550> well<00:03:32.550> there<00:03:32.760> you

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
definitely noticeable well there you
