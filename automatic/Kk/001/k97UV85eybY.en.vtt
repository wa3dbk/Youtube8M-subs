Apple yeah I understand it's made by

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.840 
Apple yeah I understand it's made by
Apple<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.590> would<00:00:40.739> be<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> Mac<00:00:41.070> if<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.550> hadn't

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
Apple that would be a Mac if you hadn't

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.569 
Apple that would be a Mac if you hadn't
serial<00:00:42.239> number<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:42.930> no<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:44.040> think<00:00:44.190> you're

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
serial number for one no I think you're

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.790 
serial number for one no I think you're
misunderstanding<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.480> problem<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.410> actual

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
misunderstanding the problem the actual

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.889 
misunderstanding the problem the actual
problem<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.670> fact<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.570> Mac

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
problem is the fact that it is Mac

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.100 
problem is the fact that it is Mac
itself<00:00:49.530> ok<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.090> your<00:00:51.300> choice<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.930> if

itself ok that is your choice if you if

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.750 
itself ok that is your choice if you if
you<00:00:52.170> don't<00:00:52.289> allow<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:52.829> those<00:00:52.949> funds<00:00:53.219> whatever

different<00:01:12.000> computer<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:13.020> well<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
different computer for this one well the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.320 
different computer for this one well the
only<00:01:13.619> only<00:01:13.950> solution<00:01:14.640> would<00:01:14.760> probably<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.210> to

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
only only solution would probably be to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.359 
only only solution would probably be to
break<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.840> ok<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.680> then<00:01:16.860> you're<00:01:16.979> gonna<00:01:17.130> have

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
break it ok and then you're gonna have

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.789 
break it ok and then you're gonna have
no<00:01:17.430> computer<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.259> not<00:01:19.380> gonna<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.650> coming

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
no computer and it's not gonna be coming

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.890 
no computer and it's not gonna be coming
under<00:01:19.950> warranty<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.549> breaking<00:01:20.939> no<00:01:21.330> computer

under warranty be breaking no computer

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.359 
under warranty be breaking no computer
is<00:01:21.960> probably<00:01:22.110> better<00:01:22.409> than<00:01:22.560> having<00:01:22.979> an<00:01:23.070> Apple

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
is probably better than having an Apple

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.160 
is probably better than having an Apple
product<00:01:23.700> ok<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.600> if<00:01:24.659> that's<00:01:24.840> your<00:01:24.960> opinion

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
product ok and if that's your opinion

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.929 
product ok and if that's your opinion
that's<00:01:25.380> fine<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:26.189> go<00:01:26.340> purchase<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
that's fine you can go purchase a

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.969 
that's fine you can go purchase a
different<00:01:27.390> product<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:28.200> don't<00:01:28.530> think<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.829> an

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
different product I don't think it's an

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.310 
different product I don't think it's an
opinion<00:01:29.250> PC<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.180> factually<00:01:30.840> better<00:01:31.049> than<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
opinion PC is factually better than a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.249 
opinion PC is factually better than a
Mac<00:01:31.590> Apple<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.369> terrible<00:01:32.970> ok<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:33.930> fine

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
Mac Apple is terrible ok and that's fine

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.749 
Mac Apple is terrible ok and that's fine
if<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.500> cheat<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.890> space<00:01:35.159> that's<00:01:35.400> completely

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
if you cheat you space that's completely
