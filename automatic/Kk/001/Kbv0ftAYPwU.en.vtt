matches look they're building a

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.330 
matches look they're building a
laboratory<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.210> cure<00:00:39.480> cancer<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
laboratory to cure cancer I have a

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.369 
laboratory to cure cancer I have a
feeling<00:00:41.640> that's<00:00:42.180> gonna<00:00:42.360> fall<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.960> little<00:00:43.230> short

Hey<00:00:49.440> look<00:00:49.520> they're<00:00:50.520> building<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.120> modular

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
Hey look they're building a modular

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.200 
Hey look they're building a modular
satellite<00:00:52.199> home<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:52.980> they<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.579> orbit

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
satellite home so that they can orbit

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.930 
satellite home so that they can orbit
into<00:00:54.480> space<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.989> live<00:00:55.260> out<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.620> space<00:00:55.940> that

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
into space and live out in space that

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.709 
into space and live out in space that
looks<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> really<00:00:57.690> sad<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.680> tuna<00:00:59.719> it

girls<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.260> build<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.500> modular<00:01:01.859> space<00:01:02.100> home<00:01:02.340> you

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
girls can build a modular space home you

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.039 
girls can build a modular space home you
can<00:01:02.699> use<00:01:02.879> your<00:01:02.969> imagination<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> little<00:01:03.719> bit

entrepreneurs how are they going to
build<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.869> space<00:01:10.140> home<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.850> no<00:01:11.850> wonder<00:01:12.030> it

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
build a space home on that no wonder it

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.060 
build a space home on that no wonder it
looks<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.840> tuna<00:01:15.049> 9<00:01:16.049> listen<00:01:16.770> we've

looks like a can of tuna 9 listen we've
got<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.369> big<00:01:17.759> problem<00:01:24.140> we<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.290> make<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.619> of

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
got a big problem we can make one of

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.399 
got a big problem we can make one of
those<00:01:25.830> if<00:01:26.040> we<00:01:26.159> had<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.549> money<00:01:26.900> it's<00:01:27.900> her<00:01:28.080> kind

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
those if we had that money it's her kind

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.990 
those if we had that money it's her kind
of<00:01:28.530> money<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:29.159> could<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.549> global<00:01:29.970> warming

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
of money we could and global warming

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.850 
of money we could and global warming
someone<00:01:30.570> wouldn't<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.290> live<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.560> space

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
someone wouldn't have to live in space

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.460 
someone wouldn't have to live in space
or<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:33.000> could<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.210> make<00:01:33.570> real<00:01:33.810> animation

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
or we could just make real animation

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.289 
or we could just make real animation
instead<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.979> screwing<00:01:35.250> around<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:35.820> nuts<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
instead of screwing around with nuts and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.899 
instead of screwing around with nuts and
bolts<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.049> washers<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> couple<00:01:38.729> of

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
bolts and washers I have a couple of

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:48.620 
bolts and washers I have a couple of
washers<00:01:39.270> here

so no big surprise but after 20 years in

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.890 
so no big surprise but after 20 years in
high<00:01:51.640> tech<00:01:51.880> we're<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.270> little<00:01:52.390> bit<00:01:52.600> sick<00:01:52.780> of

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
high tech we're a little bit sick of

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.080 
high tech we're a little bit sick of
being<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.140> only<00:01:53.170> women<00:01:53.500> in<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.800> boardroom<00:01:54.159> um
