00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.010
 hello together now it's about the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.460
 but first a look back 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.529
 Last year we have the among others 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.400
 also planted in the beet as you can see here 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.250
 able to see 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.960
 but that was not so successful 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.000
 like cultivation in the barrel 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.640
 Here you can also see the casting on 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.760
 aforementioned potatoes and the same 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.710
 the increased so we have this 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.710
 year for barrel and sacks decided 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.160
 We start with the tons 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.410
 First and foremost we have our ten 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.600
 tons positioned that sufficient 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.600
 get sun and that far enough 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.489
 stand off the tomatoes so we can 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.550
 Also not such a herb brown rot 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.280
 We 're getting problems now 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.129
 very first about 10 15 centimeters 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.739
 Measure purely as a layer afterwards 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.690
 comes earth purely then the potatoes 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.930
 and they will be back on earth as well 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:15.540
 Covered can be cast clearly 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:18.070
 so see the follow came from potatoes 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.700
 the potatoes were so far for 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:27.040
 advantage in a cool place and indeed 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:29.020
 also bright on the windowsill this 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.369
 tonne are now combed four to 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.369
 potatoes gloria 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.509
 because the potato is not here now 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.799
 be set low comes right back 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.799
 a layer of earth over it 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.250
 if the potatoes go through this 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.580
 soil layer are grown high 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.470
 to dug her again 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.810
 until the ton is full then that is allowed 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.170
 grow green and we look forward to one 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.420
 rich harvest our katachel can have 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.850
 we built from an old swimming pool 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.400
 the stand was already on the site as 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.170
 we took that over 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.140
 Last year we have two potatoes 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.720
 had tons and we have per ton 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.520
 5 had harvested over five kilo this 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.100
 year there are ten potato tons 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.280
 city â€‹â€‹map the diameter of one like that 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.290
 a potato ton is about 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.860
 60 centimeters already 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.370
 filled 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.650
 this one is still empty we are only 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.470
 in mid april the first potatoes 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.810
 so we hopefully use one 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.810
 have delayed harvesting 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.400
 and finally the turn 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.400
 Naturally strong 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.130
 our potatoes are now full with 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.270
 the gloria with this potato 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.560
 however, we still have a few over 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.360
 As you can see here 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.150
 and then we thought about what to do 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.460
 we use it as inspiration from the channel 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.100
 new country from the one we found quite good 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.190
 Do it with the potatoes in the bag 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.060
 we now too 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.940
 Now we have the individual 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.800
 components we have planted 70 liters 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.810
 bags will be the same with the holes 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.270
 stocked then we have in the green 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.520
 says there are leaves in it and in the 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.520
 we have earth and electricity in both schukies 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.459
 The coffin is supposed to have a lot of holes 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:07.660
 get and so a small pitchfork 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.660
 makes it all a bit faster 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.890
 these four heaps are now with 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:19.100
 system fills the front so this 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.989
 and these both get prozac 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.700
 only two potatoes in each 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.050
 come back three each 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.030
 pure potatoes 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.010
 the difference is still here 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.990
 the left side will be the ones with earth and 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.690
 populated with leaves and here on the 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:37.390
 on the right side comes straw and wood coal 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.390
 and wood ash pure and this one here 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.410
 and the straw 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.100
 and here you can see the leaves 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.100
 under the earth 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.590
 he says it's filled with straw now 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.570
 then the coal comes to it and 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.290
 then took the potatoes 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.290
 is poured 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:15.290
 and now that the potatoes are set 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.290
 comes like the straw on it 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.770
 to subsequently harvest 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.480
 to determine how the now 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.750
 difference was with the bags of two 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:41.780
 We now label three potatoes 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:44.120
 These sacks will still be when the 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.430
 plants are grown out with straw 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.960
 continue to accumulate but now get 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.960
 First of all, a proper shower 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.940
 these potato sacks are now 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.220
 filled as follows only comes believe 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:09.250
 purely then he comes in there 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.250
 then potatoes or earth again 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:43.530
 Now comes earth back on it get 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.530
 your place and also a rain shower 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:32.979
 and so are our potato sacks off 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.569
 and behind it are the first godparents 

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:37.250
 we hope you liked the video 

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:37.970
 and maybe you are just as excited 

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.680
 as we 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.599
 how it goes now with ours 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.199
 potatoes in sack and cask 

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:44.199
 bye
