00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.870
 the specifics of american logic need it 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.509
 understand what they called glasses systems 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.010
 in general, their strength in the system is how not strength 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.380
 the Germans were fine why are they 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.690
 defeated warriors is the power of the Americans in 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.830
 system, they debugged the collection system and 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.430
 processing information 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.710
 These here are all the same, we see not hear 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.680
 how to be random things they are not random 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.690
 here for example built next to 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.390
 washington 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.930
 data center powerful storage center 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.630
 information 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.090
 the volume of the center is greater than the entire memory of the whole 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.020
 planets of all countries all your computers 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.500
 your laptops are supercomputers that 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.900
 us in this sarf sarov is 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.750
 German super for all that's less 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.320
 than one city there is 130 in my building 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.140
 Americans then such a huge flash drive with 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.239
 flash drive city at all you did not think about why 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:01.120
 he is going to write to write all why 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.310
 control why or why 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.280
 management see what is more than 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.890
 all the memory of the planet of all other countries 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.290
 This means that in principle he is not so much 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.990
 no information is gained except from where 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.870
 From these countries, that is, this flash drive should 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.479
 be more in million flash drives in all 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.930
 the world so then whence information 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.120
 So much to take only from these flash drives 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.840
 your from your computer from your 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.400
 phone from swedish from german from 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.130
 Angel Merkel phone 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.450
 from dutch from just from 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.200
 so much information to 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.030
 load otherwise stupid work 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.729
 yes, they don't talk about it either, but here it is 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.530
 logic means they know this information 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.970
 how to get from you up accordingly 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.280
 the very existence of this city means 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.340
 that all the information of the world is different there 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.650
 there is no sense such a city to do and for what 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.080
 this city this city flash drive for the servants 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.250
 for president information center 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.229
 united states of america and 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.689
 american state which 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.650
 processes all information from around 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:09.579
 of the world and now this is his external 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.859
 external disk the size of a city with 130 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.629
 the facilities this is brand new 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.319
 methods of state building 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.540
 So 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.459
 there is here it is an element of state construction 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.920
 system of a unipolar world ie they 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.260
 process logic in technology so 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.999
 they are calculating 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.879
 options 1000 options a billion without 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.359
 differences in computers most powerful spheres 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.790
 calculate options 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:33.280
 based on information based on your height 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.700
 what do you want and this information which 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.019
 they count give out for adoption 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.900
 decide option such option such 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:44.319
 option in a practical way they 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.760
 don't make a choice know his creative 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.639
 as we have made, do not just say 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.439
 option number six is ​​all clear option 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:54.419
 6 calculated in such houses by computer 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.419
 That is the logic of their decision
