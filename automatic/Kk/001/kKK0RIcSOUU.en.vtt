00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.210
 welcome to life here I bring you the 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.210
 How to remove the chrome skin tutorial 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.980
 for the lancer this was a memory 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.530
 taking out the achievement of not messing with the 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.900
 player of ya software 1 many people I 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.400
 has said that these achievements should 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.500
 get out before the launch of gears 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.390
 of war 3 for this to work but 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.749
 here I bring you this this tutorial for 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.130
 deny it and as you are going to see I have the 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.950
 achievement of not getting involved with the player 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.220
 taken on the 28th of the 4th of 2012 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.840
 a few days ago here I am going to 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.400
 teach 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.400
 let's go to the achievements part 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.100
 and there you are going to see, do not mess with the 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.960
 player on 28 of 4 of 2012 with this os 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.510
 I wanted to teach that you can still get out 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.150
 this achievement and get this skin on its own 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.160
 you have not yet had it, you can ask for the 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.800
 and software one to a friend or to do it 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.870
 with him or if you already have him there in 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.350
 some shelf and good what you 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.450
 I recommend is that 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.030
 instead of joining a quick game 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.590
 As you can see there, try to be 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.170
 host of one of the games 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.270
 matched if you can do it with two or 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.530
 three friends what I would recommend is that 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.500
 you join a team and 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.540
 your friends to another team to the other 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.640
 equipment so that they can be left 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.380
 kill and even if there are other people 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.280
 playing in the same game always 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.290
 have the highest score 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.140
 so well this is my recommendation 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.940
 to remove it very very easy you 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.500
 I remember that six people are missing 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.990
 to start the game is what 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.630
 only bad but there are still people pulling 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.400
 achievements and playing a little jazz 1 like this 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.030
 that maybe you are lucky and there are people 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.979
 and well here I will teach you as if 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.899
 I already have the skin of software 3 although the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.760
 achievement is from recently as I have already 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.250
 saying 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.150
 and well there you are going to be able to see now 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.550
 same there we have it throw the chrome 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.620
 I also have to tell you that although 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.260
 that which is the achievement is not immediate, 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.990
 they give you the skin at the moment or if 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.270
 you get in 1 and you go to 3 do not go 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.190
 to have to wait a couple of days 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.780
 it takes me a couple of days I think so 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.810
 I took it out on a Friday and on Sunday 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.270
 I had the skin and well there are simply 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.950
 to be expected but the skin does jump 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.890
 and yes that works as you have seen 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.510
 right now so good I just wanted 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.580
 bring this tutorial so it says the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.730
 people and so you see that if you can take out 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.580
 still and well I hope you liked it 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.440
 the tutorial that can serve you and not you 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.320
 forget a like and suv for more 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.470
 videos so nothing a little health and up 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.470
