00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.290 
and Scott we were able to determine very
quickly<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.800> best<00:02:18.040> position<00:02:18.280> front<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.060> back

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
quickly the best position front to back

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.790 
quickly the best position front to back
on<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.780> boards<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.290> have<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.590> cleanest

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
on the boards I have the cleanest

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.160 
on the boards I have the cleanest
release<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.430> detail<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.060> board<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:23.020> at

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
release of detail on the board and at

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.510 
release of detail on the board and at
that<00:02:23.200> point<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.620> had<00:02:23.680> just<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:24.010> little<00:02:24.040> water

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
that point it had just a little water

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.960 
that point it had just a little water
rapping<00:02:25.030> over<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.360> ball<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.580> quick<00:02:27.760> 30

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
rapping over the ball and in a quick 30

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.210 
rapping over the ball and in a quick 30
second<00:02:28.480> sprint<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.900> fastest<00:02:29.380> speed<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.100> I

amazing<00:02:40.420> glide<00:02:41.110> it's<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:41.470> good<00:02:41.770> glide<00:02:42.150> but

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
amazing glide it's a good glide but

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.670 
amazing glide it's a good glide but
there's<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.420> few<00:02:43.660> other<00:02:43.690> boards<00:02:44.110> i<00:02:44.200> paddle<00:02:44.530> but

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
there's a few other boards i paddle but

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.860 
there's a few other boards i paddle but
I<00:02:44.739> felt<00:02:44.980> if<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.250> was<00:02:45.370> just<00:02:45.550> cruisin<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.660> when<00:02:46.780> I

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
I felt if I was just cruisin that when I

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.170 
I felt if I was just cruisin that when I
got<00:02:47.020> off<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.440> power<00:02:47.620> would<00:02:47.950> holders<00:02:51.060> hi<00:02:52.060> I'm

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
got off the power would holders hi I'm

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.940 
got off the power would holders hi I'm
Scott<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.630> this<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.110> first<00:02:53.290> day<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.650> got<00:02:53.920> a

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
Scott and this is the first day I got a

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.729 
Scott and this is the first day I got a
chance<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.370> paddle<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.850> new<00:02:55.030> 40<00:02:55.330> for<00:02:55.739> my

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
chance to paddle the new 40 for my

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.470 
chance to paddle the new 40 for my
initial<00:02:57.130> reaction<00:02:57.250> was<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.880> really<00:02:58.150> liked<00:02:58.330> the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
initial reaction was I really liked the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.080 
initial reaction was I really liked the
stability<00:02:59.020> I'm<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.260> little<00:02:59.590> bit<00:02:59.709> bigger

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
stability I'm a little bit bigger

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.330 
stability I'm a little bit bigger
paddler<00:03:01.090> than<00:03:01.300> Gary<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:01.780> Chris<00:03:02.020> I<00:03:02.340> weighed

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
paddler than Gary and Chris I weighed

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.229 
paddler than Gary and Chris I weighed
220<00:03:04.120> pounds<00:03:04.480> about<00:03:05.020> six<00:03:05.350> foot<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:06.239> so

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
220 pounds about six foot and so

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.910 
220 pounds about six foot and so
initially<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.780> stability<00:03:08.260> was<00:03:08.410> really<00:03:08.680> great

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
initially the stability was really great

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.979 
initially the stability was really great
it's<00:03:09.880> something<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:10.300> I<00:03:10.330> look<00:03:10.570> for<00:03:10.810> in<00:03:10.900> a

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
it's something that I look for in a

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.320 
it's something that I look for in a
board<00:03:11.230> as<00:03:11.830> far<00:03:12.160> as<00:03:12.340> pulling<00:03:13.060> through<00:03:13.269> the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
board as far as pulling through the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330 
board as far as pulling through the
water<00:03:13.570> at<00:03:13.780> speed<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.380> felt<00:03:14.709> like<00:03:14.800> I<00:03:14.950> was<00:03:15.070> pushing

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
water at speed I felt like I was pushing

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.490 
water at speed I felt like I was pushing
quite<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:15.910> bit<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.180> water<00:03:16.360> and<00:03:16.600> it<00:03:17.050> was<00:03:17.230> tiring

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
quite a bit of water and it was tiring

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.820 
quite a bit of water and it was tiring
out<00:03:17.739> of<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:17.980> but<00:03:18.540> looking<00:03:19.540> at<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.720> GPS<00:03:20.170> I<00:03:20.380> was

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
out of it but looking at the GPS I was

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.790 
out of it but looking at the GPS I was
just<00:03:21.010> as<00:03:21.160> fast<00:03:21.430> as<00:03:21.640> on<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.360> hobie<00:03:22.660> Borg<00:03:22.900> so<00:03:23.260> it

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
just as fast as on the hobie Borg so it

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.180 
just as fast as on the hobie Borg so it
might<00:03:23.980> just<00:03:24.100> be<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:25.230> little<00:03:26.230> illusion<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.860> I

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
might just be a little illusion that I

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.830 
might just be a little illusion that I
don't<00:03:27.459> feel<00:03:27.670> like<00:03:27.820> I'm<00:03:28.000> going<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.330> fast<00:03:28.570> but

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
don't feel like I'm going that fast but

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.030 
don't feel like I'm going that fast but
I<00:03:28.930> really<00:03:29.470> am<00:03:30.150> overall<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:31.180> like<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.230> feel<00:03:33.010> of

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
I really am overall I like the feel of

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.120 
I really am overall I like the feel of
the<00:03:33.220> board<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:34.420> stability<00:03:34.769> I'm<00:03:35.769> still<00:03:36.100> a

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
the board and the stability I'm still a

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.850 
the board and the stability I'm still a
little<00:03:36.220> favor<00:03:36.910> of<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.239> bark<00:03:37.450> myself<00:03:37.900> but<00:03:38.230> I

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
little favor of the bark myself but I

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.440 
little favor of the bark myself but I
think<00:03:39.280> this<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.519> a<00:03:39.550> great<00:03:39.730> board<00:03:40.030> for<00:03:40.060> someone

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
think this is a great board for someone

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.190 
think this is a great board for someone
who's<00:03:40.600> a<00:03:40.630> little

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
when we were when I was paddling it was
