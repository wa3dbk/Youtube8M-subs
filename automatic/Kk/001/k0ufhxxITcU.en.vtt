00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
call a Rapid Recap they license it from

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.790 
call a Rapid Recap they license it from
a<00:02:22.050> company<00:02:22.530> called<00:02:22.560> brief<00:02:23.220> cam<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:25.470> it's<00:02:25.680> a

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
a company called brief cam so it's a

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.770 
a company called brief cam so it's a
really<00:02:25.950> clever<00:02:26.310> trick<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.120> allows<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.750> to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
really clever trick that allows you to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.410 
really clever trick that allows you to
condense<00:02:28.320> up<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.830> eight<00:02:29.040> hours<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.490> video<00:02:29.880> down

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
condense up to eight hours of video down

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.330 
condense up to eight hours of video down
to<00:02:30.600> just<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.930> minute<00:02:31.200> or<00:02:31.320> two<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.470> video<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.250> you

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
to just a minute or two a video that you

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.850 
to just a minute or two a video that you
can<00:02:32.520> quickly<00:02:32.760> review<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:34.260> uses<00:02:34.710> those

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
can quickly review it uses those

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.820 
can quickly review it uses those
floating<00:02:35.390> timestamps<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.660> follow<00:02:37.470> each

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
floating timestamps to follow each

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.890 
floating timestamps to follow each
person<00:02:38.370> around<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.120> same<00:02:39.330> person<00:02:39.690> shows

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
person around so the same person shows

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.440 
person around so the same person shows
up<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.260> multiple<00:02:40.410> places<00:02:40.770> but<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.580> timestamp

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
up in multiple places but a timestamp

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.110 
up in multiple places but a timestamp
allows<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.440> see<00:02:43.590> which<00:02:43.740> activity<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.790> of

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
allows you to see which activity is of

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.960 
allows you to see which activity is of
interest<00:02:45.420> then<00:02:45.960> you<00:02:45.990> can<00:02:46.320> use<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:47.850> go

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
interest then you can use that to go

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.700 
interest then you can use that to go
back<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.450> original<00:02:48.510> video<00:02:49.050> clips<00:02:49.380> which

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
back to the original video clips which

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.440 
back to the original video clips which
are<00:02:49.830> stored<00:02:50.160> up<00:02:50.280> in<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.490> cloud<00:02:50.700> as<00:02:50.880> well<00:02:51.060> and

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
are stored up in the cloud as well and

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.590 
are stored up in the cloud as well and
see<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.380> in<00:02:52.770> more<00:02:52.950> detail<00:02:53.340> it's<00:02:54.300> really

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
see that in more detail it's really

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.400 
see that in more detail it's really
clever<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.320> lot<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.680> fun<00:02:57.230> check<00:02:58.230> out<00:02:58.380> that

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
clever and a lot of fun check out that

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.980 
clever and a lot of fun check out that
spider<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.220> lower<00:02:59.400> left<00:02:59.730> head<00:03:00.450> infrared

spider in the lower left head infrared

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.930 
spider in the lower left head infrared
is<00:03:01.170> really<00:03:01.440> really<00:03:01.980> effective<00:03:02.490> so<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.760> can

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
is really really effective so you can

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.280 
is really really effective so you can
see<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.180> cat<00:03:03.390> wandering<00:03:03.870> around<00:03:03.930> at<00:03:04.260> various

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
see the cat wandering around at various

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.250 
see the cat wandering around at various
times<00:03:05.220> throughout<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.730> night<00:03:05.990> except<00:03:06.990> when

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
times throughout the night except when

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.820 
times throughout the night except when
the<00:03:07.350> raccoons<00:03:07.830> show<00:03:08.010> up<00:03:08.130> about<00:03:08.490> 4:55<00:03:09.330> a.m.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
the raccoons show up about 4:55 a.m.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.530 
the raccoons show up about 4:55 a.m.
there's<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.860> husband-and-wife<00:03:11.340> racoon<00:03:12.150> team

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
there's a husband-and-wife racoon team

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.190 
there's a husband-and-wife racoon team
there<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.550> husband<00:03:14.550> is<00:03:14.870> just<00:03:15.870> tall

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
there and the husband is just tall

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.890 
there and the husband is just tall
enough<00:03:16.500> that<00:03:16.770> he<00:03:17.730> wreaks<00:03:18.150> havoc<00:03:18.269> on<00:03:18.720> the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
enough that he wreaks havoc on the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.600 
enough that he wreaks havoc on the
original<00:03:19.230> version<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:19.769> platform<00:03:20.070> now

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
original version of this platform now

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.370 
original version of this platform now
I've<00:03:20.940> switched<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.959> detailed

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
I've switched to the the detailed

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.229 
I've switched to the the detailed
version<00:03:22.800> of<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.950> original<00:03:23.310> video<00:03:23.550> clip<00:03:23.880> and

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
version of the original video clip and

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.050 
version of the original video clip and
you<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:25.050> see<00:03:25.320> it's<00:03:26.250> interesting<00:03:26.550> that<00:03:26.910> when

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
you can see it's interesting that when

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.040 
you can see it's interesting that when
that<00:03:27.180> light<00:03:27.390> comes<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:28.680> motion<00:03:29.040> detection

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
that light comes on the motion detection

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.540 
that light comes on the motion detection
enabled<00:03:31.050> white<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.950> raccoons<00:03:32.370> don't

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
enabled white the the raccoons don't

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.949 
enabled white the the raccoons don't
even<00:03:32.760> flinch<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.480> thought<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.900> would

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
even flinch and I thought that would

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.870 
even flinch and I thought that would
scare<00:03:34.230> them<00:03:34.350> away<00:03:34.620> but<00:03:34.680> they<00:03:35.250> don't<00:03:35.459> care

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
scare them away but they don't care

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.900 
scare them away but they don't care
so<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:36.870> raccoons<00:03:37.410> tall<00:03:37.769> enough<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.459> he<00:03:38.730> can

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
so this raccoons tall enough that he can

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.570 
so this raccoons tall enough that he can
just<00:03:39.150> reach<00:03:39.510> up<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:39.959> food<00:03:40.709> in<00:03:40.830> his<00:03:40.950> paw<00:03:41.220> his

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
just reach up to the food in his paw his

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.350 
just reach up to the food in his paw his
Papa<00:03:42.570> food<00:03:42.900> out<00:03:43.080> but<00:03:43.440> he's<00:03:44.280> more<00:03:44.519> ambitious<00:03:45.000> he

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
Papa food out but he's more ambitious he

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.390 
Papa food out but he's more ambitious he
wants<00:03:45.690> more<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.260> he's<00:03:46.500> trying<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.040> get<00:03:47.190> that

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
wants more so he's trying to get that

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.300 
wants more so he's trying to get that
right<00:03:47.700> hind<00:03:48.120> leg<00:03:48.239> up<00:03:48.780> on<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.019> platform<00:03:49.320> so

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
right hind leg up on the platform so

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.490 
right hind leg up on the platform so
that<00:03:50.489> he<00:03:50.610> can<00:03:50.760> go<00:03:50.910> up<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.209> own<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.630> food<00:03:51.810> and

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
that he can go up and own the food and

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.650 
that he can go up and own the food and
after<00:03:53.100> about<00:03:53.250> an<00:03:53.430> hour<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.670> trying<00:03:54.120> he

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
after about an hour of trying he

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.310 
after about an hour of trying he
actually<00:03:55.590> does<00:03:55.800> that<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.430> he<00:03:57.180> gets<00:03:57.900> up<00:03:58.110> there

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
actually does that and he gets up there

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.360 
actually does that and he gets up there
and<00:03:58.380> he<00:03:58.530> gobbles<00:03:59.100> up<00:03:59.220> all<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.640> food<00:03:59.820> so<00:04:01.190> we<00:04:02.190> had

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
and he gobbles up all the food so we had

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.220 
and he gobbles up all the food so we had
to<00:04:02.459> do<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.610> change<00:04:03.000> so<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.420> next<00:04:03.690> night<00:04:03.900> I

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
to do a change so the next night I

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.729 
to do a change so the next night I
raised<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.280> platform<00:04:05.760> up<00:04:05.970> four<00:04:06.810> inches<00:04:07.200> it's

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
raised the platform up four inches it's

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.970 
raised the platform up four inches it's
a<00:04:07.950> total<00:04:08.280> height<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.640> 25<00:04:09.209> inches<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:10.470> put

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
a total height of 25 inches and I put

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.370 
a total height of 25 inches and I put
the<00:04:11.370> food<00:04:12.000> bin<00:04:12.900> up<00:04:13.200> on<00:04:13.500> like<00:04:13.920> a<00:04:13.950> seven<00:04:14.790> inch

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
the food bin up on like a seven inch

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.590 
the food bin up on like a seven inch
plastic<00:04:16.380> bucket<00:04:16.950> so<00:04:17.280> now<00:04:18.090> he's<00:04:18.359> totally
