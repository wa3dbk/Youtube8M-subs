00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 ea and aluar +1 pj responds is the 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:15.860
 number 20 with the participation 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:15.860
 very special of the pilot 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.370
 we are here in the studio of the bassaki games 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.620
 game place Also Known As 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.900
 Mariana you saw by this brush that 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.780
 is on the floor because the first question 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.600
 Today's young wife is Jonathan's 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.000
 martins because the consoles games 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.040
 digitally sold are no longer 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.089
 games sold in media 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.390
 physics 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:59.100
 who will answer this question is the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.559
 gabriel bakri el gato helseth beautiful 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.440
 boy then respond by jonathan for 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.509
 Please gabriel then it is before responding 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.130
 I want to thank sister could say hello 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.600
 because he asked the question directly 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.880
 for me on twitter he sent it to me 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.130
 This is not enough games, I told you. 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.899
 coordination to record the number 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.420
 it is up to us today to give 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.460
 one researched here and discovered the 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.720
 following the count was thought in the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.429
 games are tabulated right 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.429
 for example a game of physical and 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:29.259
 lobsters won for $ 59 and a game 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.800
 also for the same price 59 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.450
 dollars 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.369
 so why is it priced even if at 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.709
 physical media we have the expenses with 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.920
 print with all of you 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:41.259
 the publication itself and the digital media 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.240
 theoretically it is a digital file in this 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.619
 something is there but it is not quite like this 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.479
 just as we have the expenses in 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.420
 part that is part of the manual 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.039
 of kash and this has also many thanks to 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.489
 digital part because for example 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.380
 host a gta game and it's 18 days right? 

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:59.679
 so you have to have a powerful server on 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.209
 have a direct maintenance or not to 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.160
 give no problem to run out of 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:05.560
 risk of losing the 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.270
 download take the psn game then you have 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.369
 enough maintenance too and has 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.380
 enough it is very kind of course also 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.060
 digital part right people do not see but 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.010
 a whole structure behind that ends 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.500
 being as expensive as you make the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.300
 game there in print a manual do 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.440
 think of everything but that's why 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.629
 they have the same price they do not have a 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.330
 price discount was in the manual that 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:28.060
 this is not giving a product that does not 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.500
 had a structure behind it then it is 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.349
 that the same solution has the same 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.849
 both digital media and 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.980
 physical media and the price tag is that the 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.200
 We have variants there is the question 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.959
 There are games that come out in Brazil for a 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.219
 price in the physical media and nothing in the 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.310
 digital is cheaper but there is a 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.650
 different issue 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.140
 theo opposite but when it is tabulated this 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.970
 It's the great wonder 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.910
 Thank you, Gabriel. And now I'm going to send the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.470
 ball to Mariana she's going to send it to 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.370
 Next question and answer someone 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.739
 reply 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.920
 mari with whom you're living here then 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:06.019
 with gustavo our content director 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.580
 and I already have two prete ghosn questions 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.090
 let's go to the first one 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.160
 the first one is by michel xavier 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.100
 bj how do you buy these products and 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.350
 analysis that do not exist in Brazil speaks 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.850
 michel then won on these products that 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.260
 does not exist in brazil we buy from 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.660
 mainly in the states 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.580
 united for example this week was 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.250
 going to the already lg 2 that the 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.190
 Samsung's top-of-the-line smartphone and 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.410
 two iphones the iphone 5 cm was 5 s 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.930
 and as we do it is usually us 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.060
 we always have some correspondent ours 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.959
 our reporter traveling and events in 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.370
 U.S 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.640
 so they enjoy shopping outlets 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.560
 bought today that uses amazon ebay new 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.780
 follow other sites like this and we buy 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.900
 we sent to the editor's hotel and actor 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.630
 Bring us it 's easier and younger. 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.660
 bet has second that then that is of 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.430
 mano léo dj what do you think about 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.170
 historical games based on real events 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.280
 like games about the two great wars 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.319
 for example 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.170
 this game can still be released the 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.090
 games tend to focus on another aspect 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.769
 may actually what happened is that in the 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.209
 genre of fps 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.100
 this was a little overwhelming that 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.280
 had a lot of games 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.680
 happening exactly at that time you are 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.980
 catch up in general terms 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.490
 you prefer 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.490
 the school 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.570
 the organ 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.350
 Few aspects of the domain was 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.260
 even so do not 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.990
 the bank instincts so we have 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.790
 several games that are historical 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.890
 they see in vain what happened is that 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.840
 in terms of fps war 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.120
 this has diminished but there are other areas there 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.720
 that there is passenger is fashionable right passes a 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.700
 time 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.190
 soon to have a game of 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.340
 Second war of life and paint around 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:06.300
 Thank you goes this was love's galera of 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.760
 to repair now in mariana I have with 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.970
 vinícius carazinho ski because it goes 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.870
 to answer our next question she is 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.660
 bruno igor bj with abusive prices 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.150
 of the new generation of consoles would not be 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.280
 more advantageous to build a good PC than 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.030
 invest in a console, what is your 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.090
 View Vinicius Xbox will arrive 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.920
 costing 2 200 playstation 4 should arrive 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.190
 in this same range if we consider 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.320
 that a pc gamer is between 2,500 and 3,000 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.920
 and throw a game launched 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:44.520
 recently for pc costs on average 81 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.620
 for long- term 160 islands with 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.650
 pc games you will end up having a 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.410
 economy is itaú has a whole style in the 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.030
 oshima reference yes the steam brings 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.500
 many games many cheap very cheap 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.510
 promotions always possible then 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.330
 find releases that neither tomb 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:06.210
 raider that was recently released by 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.420
 prices of 20 reais while the 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.350
 console costs 160 so if this should be 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.750
 taken in consideration 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.550
 That's cool, there are advantages and 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.670
 any choice you make 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.290
 brazil mpc console accounts exactly 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.970
 has many advantages and disadvantages of 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.760
 consoles have the advantage of exclusive 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.600
 right u usually do not have much 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.880
 in this area 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.510
 and has the question of longevity a 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.340
 console his life is more or less 68 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.220
 maybe 10 years as they are already 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.010
 designing for this generation a pc should 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.750
 four to five years until 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.000
 he starts to be out of time and you 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.640
 need to change 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.760
 video card, for example , cool 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.760
 Mariana, you're with someone else. 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.760
 not 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:17.920
 I'll be right here with the biggest bug 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:23.800
 So that 's where the guy came from there. 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:27.080
 No further questions. pj answers to 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.750
 the fool has already tried to let me sleep my flight 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.140
 The team attacks let it sleep here for love. 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.140
 God's 

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.910
 ae 

00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:56.949
 today the program
