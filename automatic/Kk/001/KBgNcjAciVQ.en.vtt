00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.700
 friends eros center good morning let's go 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.910
 here today is a small explanation to a 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.200
 attempt of what seems to me to be 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.820
 happening in today's sky even though it's 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.870
 a pity that today swum to catch by 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.580
 here when the real show 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.150
 it's on the other side that the sun is 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.800
 coming out and it looks more and more clear 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.950
 moment what we have to start with 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.350
 here the trail is a cut 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.350
 from there to there they unify a 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.290
 perfect straight line all this for the 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.200
 other side if they are fumigated and makes a 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.760
 At the moment you could see an airplane 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.220
 last has to be the last one that 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.140
 he falls asleep and has left late 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.760
 also from here I would like to launch a 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.860
 thanks to the companion at 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.170
 companions of both racing and libya to 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.910
 dorian gray henning skywalker so many that 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.250
 they are filming the sky and more and more 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.860
 no and now let's move on to what they 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.470
 they wanted to teach you to look at everything 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.170
 we have there from if ross stratocumulus 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:05.100
 forming and as I said to you on the other 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.780
 side we have a cumulus clouds nimbos 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.580
 anvil that are you already know that by the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.160
 North have given water and those are the clouds 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.130
 that precede water well 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.470
 prepared because I've seen the past 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.530
 look there 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.020
 as tear 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.900
 and all this I do because in the past 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.670
 I already talked about the wait your wave your voucher 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.710
 which is a bushy layer that is going to see 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.479
 over the sky in a few years there you are 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.520
 watching I do not know if you can appreciate a 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.270
 more time with the mobile the patterns 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.100
 radiated the patina but where it was 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.259
 your gondola you will see heaven as 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.659
 a piece of fat layer is worth that 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.470
 fat layer is coming out of nowhere I 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.200
 cago in the ma 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.899
 that will be layer on layer on layer 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.430
 they must have managed to invent some 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.429
 type of product that remains 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.789
 very much all that beret that you are 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.920
 seeing to my understanding are the layers of 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.750
 moisture that would be forming and portrayed 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.869
 the lenticular the kind of cloud that was 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.759
 but it is going agglutinating and toxic 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.610
 conforms around low humidity 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.830
 that manages to form a cloud shape 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.690
 this beret that looks like a beret 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.330
 humidity but it's just toxic 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.060
 colorado by water in suspension is worth 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.350
 and that in turn mixes with the little 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.750
 cloud that has managed to form 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.760
 preventing it is like when we have a 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.630
 sick family and we miss this holy 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.570
 in the liquid 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.840
 if you add more liquid to despres before 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.120
 It will also be expressed because that is water 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.640
 let's say contaminated surrounding all 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.920
 this coil to the few clouds at 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.920
 fat moisture masses that get 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.360
 get to form a cloud is worth and the 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.090
 clouds that have managed to form are 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.790
 well away on the other side of the city 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.270
 type cumulonimbo nimbo stratum in short 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.430
 juncker clouds and here the sheep are already 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.560
 seeing the contrast as well I tell you of 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.950
 the mass that has managed to form something of 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.160
 cloud that looks gray gray from the water that 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.710
 however manages to absorb this that 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.170
 it's toxic that is floating on top of it 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.450
 get together nothing gray is all white 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.820
 the mobile does not capture it but it is a target 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.100
 nuclear that flashes like that and the 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.050
 sun is down on the other side that is 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.780
 be that for me to explain a little 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.500
 the configuration and now all these 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.810
 meteorologists students of I do not know how 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.060
 it was aeronautics that they get to say to 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.430
 all of you who know if you young 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.650
 that citizens start talking to 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.239
 property and under his knowledge 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.760
 criteria of what they are seeing in the 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.610
 sky we took a little finger got a whistle 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.860
 link in the ass and we make a straw in 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.420
 manabi sons of bitches sheep that you 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.220
 you believe that you have the power to speak 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.610
 about what's in heaven what 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.900
 you're wrong for all 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.329
 the comrades much encouragement and confidence 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.750
 this is what I see today in heaven of 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:56.950
 CÃ¡diz we keep playing gentlemen to 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.950
 that they are few and cowardly
