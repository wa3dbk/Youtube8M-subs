00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:10.309
 Hello and welcome I'm 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.469
 the people with the ninth episode of the road 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.780
 to recovery and today we try that 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.060
 copa américa many as a tournament too 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.700
 win where a team also something from 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.109
 argentina and chile players 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.890
 that yes the two teams in the 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.359
 final stand 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.730
 we also see our team shortly 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.130
 The Maria have the center as the spot 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.269
 I change in the game with Sanchez left 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.980
 we have done and in midfield Jacob 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.019
 perez and let me think briefly who 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.989
 play right at her a bit 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.870
 on the other left is palace in the middle 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.710
 is korea and right of the jakob and also 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.540
 I still have them in the game 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.790
 have changed namely jacob then to 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.070
 zdm where he really really good 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.199
 So it was a place where you actually 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.580
 much expected but the extremely good 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.930
 played then really well and 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.269
 I will not even do that 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.170
 exchange or so and yes the team is 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.309
 nothing special in the 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.369
 We also had internal defense 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.110
 rock or roger or whatever his name is and am 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:05.269
 college in ecology is never actually 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.939
 not one of them is not that right 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.409
 fast but he is damn good i 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.060
 do not know why he feels it 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.920
 as if he had an extremely good marketing 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.710
 or marketing is what is in the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.810
 defensive is the positioning and he is 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.250
 horny somehow I have no idea I man 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.840
 of course, there too and at the end of the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.579
 but can put down an example 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.249
 coloccini has the club he plays 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.890
 really good and will be 

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:29.030
 first game won so now 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.189
 then we flew out at once 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.670
 and now we look at the years and 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.439
 yes, what should this progress be? 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.179
 We have to cancel again from scratch 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.560
 So what is of course extremely annoying 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.729
 especially not always has so much time 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.409
 like me at the moment 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.520
 then of course it will be difficult otherwise 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.289
 rather by playing if you just 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.299
 flies out again and the enemy here 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.859
 with a 4-4-2 we play here 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.270
 directly the first chance to fit out there 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.469
 come over there are relatively happy 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.240
 back to the ball with Jacob 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.310
 under the push then only once again 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.049
 yes, that was a relatively happy goal 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.549
 we find at 10 which is good, of course 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.200
 Again, Jacob is right for you 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.119
 nice pass over to delight 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.350
 but has since then still problems to 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.929
 ball into the gate because he 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.119
 directly next to the goalkeeper shoots 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.470
 scene runs over the maria nicely with the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.970
 Unfortunately, the ball will then exceed the ball 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.130
 but lost the fight and still aim 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.990
 Play back the ball with Peres 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.170
 back to the maria the box is there 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.450
 somehow through and yes 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.680
 shut the ball nicely into the gate 2 0 so the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.239
 Guidance and I think that's how the game works 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.739
 also to the end it is the maria and 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.690
 so Jacob with the gates 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.370
 and so we move to the quarterfinals 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.690
 and yes that's pretty good this time 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.239
 because this time we did not fly out 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.920
 Which of course is better and the opponent 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.020
 again with the 4 2 against the wm 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.280
 quarterfinal play aguero tevez in 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.130
 storm that is of course a strong one 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.130
 Storm the defense and so on 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.090
 like almost every opponent you play this 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.200
 So the teams are not like that now 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.940
 variable also so I can do that too 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.160
 Of course, what would you say? 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.040
 I can use many more players 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.790
 I just used sanchez now 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.709
 because because the others are easy 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.150
 hard to install but is vidal 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.290
 really hard to install then it has to 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.600
 man like dell and fernandes 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.040
 probably still set up and me 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.959
 I'm more of the type of player then 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.120
 not necessarily the most creative team builds 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.530
 but rather team builds what is 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.580
 really play well and do that 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.019
 I generally like that when I enter 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.640
 creative team building then i look for myself 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.840
 from the leagues the good players from the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.610
 so that really adds value 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.080
 That's what I 'm looking for then me 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.340
 take 34 and take it 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.630
 but then also the best players because 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.450
 otherwise it makes me so creative 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.470
 team vaud plug and are and that's why 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.760
 I am here now 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.200
 actually decided a classic 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.980
 argentina team to play 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.480
 + Sanchez next to it as the right wing 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.180
 because it is easy to install 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.290
 the whole traveling argentina 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.480
 player here free kick of 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.280
 sanchez bench near the just inside 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.650
 moved nicely over the wall of the goalkeeper 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.530
 just not at all 20 so that 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.730
 leadership for us was this game 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.000
 I'm not sure but I believe that 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.220
 was my best fifa 15 game was 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.290
 you will be seated at half past time 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.299
 30 still see the guidance 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.400
 I had such a dominance so good 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.260
 Passes played and so good combination 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.260
 So I was really in top form 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.430
 this game plays the team plays 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.350
 but also good for me 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.850
 So I have to honestly say I had 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.989
 I would not have expected so but with 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.250
 I think the team is right and 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.500
 also has to cling a bit to it 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.819
 say the enemy was not the one now 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.530
 best not so well defended now 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.810
 but here we see the stats 29 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.850
 percent fitting accuracy 61 percent 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.530
 four possession only the leadership so 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.329
 you can believe games much more dominant 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.430
 I do not even shape until 1 8 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.900
 percent fitting accuracy but he is just 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.700
 not as good as me 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.289
 There are 819 coins here now 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.260
 because the opponent is then in the second 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.240
 half 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.410
 yes just gone away fkg jan has not 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.780
 more played and then I have 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.360
 I thought then I put the controller 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.560
 then it can take another half an hour 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.620
 but not learn ten minutes or so 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.950
 is the game over and yes then 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.800
 This happened for the second time 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.110
 So our progress has been erased 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.640
 of course annoying but somehow 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.780
 where I moment I do not have 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.640
 really excited because I just like that 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.840
 I was flashed by one in the game before that 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.170
 was so happy that I played so well 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.190
 have been really happy 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.450
 and yes of course we have to go back 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.530
 We will start into the 8th 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.300
 now, of course, not a complete one 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.040
 he would take one in this follow create 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.470
 So, game still comes because I want to 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.000
 of course you here with one with one 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.570
 another game and with a new one 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.920
 Start the tournament in the year 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.750
 and then of course it will follow next 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.110
 Keep going because this tournament is on 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.910
 also relatively long and yes there you can 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.890
 then definitely the review of 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.030
 a team, for I have looked for 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.770
 next time a bit 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.910
 gain brought agüero I have 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.540
 brought and lavezzi done for and me 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.220
 think good 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.540
 this will be a really nice team 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.070
 I'll try that, of course 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.680
 the tournament here win the scene 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.030
 was quite interesting because I have it 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.890
 when offside 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.970
 I then pulled that away with 2 r2 and 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.170
 the opponent is not clear 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.130
 come because he somehow thought yes 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.510
 okay it is offside 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.920
 and then he has to go back to the goalkeeper 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.720
 just kind of waited a while and fit 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.550
 yes I could with di maria the ball into 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.750
 So tor device which is really just a 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.190
 thing that you use again and again 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.860
 that may work in part 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.080
 here the tanker with the hoe unfortunately 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.660
 next to 2 0 so the leadership continues 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.760
 for us and a very small thing I do 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.050
 to say it briefly during grad 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.850
 Thursday at this video comes on 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.080
 Thursday that means it's just nine 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.120
 watch the video in the morning 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.310
 however, just stood up for 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.260
 Benny did not have any video for today 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.320
 and there is in fact recently a 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.350
 been commented that my videos are 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.000
 yes not cool so say yes is some 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.620
 I can understand is all right 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.420
 has a different taste but me 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.460
 I know that there are people 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.990
 also find videos good and that's why 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.240
 you do not understand if the people 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.740
 Write does not make videos anymore because 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.970
 then every day comes a video of tests 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.680
 that's just not true 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.000
 does not work because today would be then 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.400
 For example, no video I come 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.290
 I am today 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.030
 So I know exactly how 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.620
 has a bigger fan base than me 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.460
 Everyone here knows that knows that 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.900
 Everyone really knows 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.350
 you can see that on the blues alone 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.120
 but still there are just days where 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.070
 then maybe a video of me whole 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.210
 good variety brings in and if you 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.979
 if you do not like my videos 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.270
 please do not look at it 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:00.680
 but I know that there are people 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.360
 they like can then 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.410
 also watch 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.600
 yes I want to say again briefly just 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.220
 So much now we follow this 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.960
 So they won the last game 3 0 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.360
 have not lost a game anyway 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.770
 2010 became 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.990
 relatively weird but it goes so's so 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:19.729
 Next episode continues to skin pure people 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:22.270
 it does not look so much already 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:22.270
 with the shit
