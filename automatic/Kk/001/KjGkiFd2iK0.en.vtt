00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
platypus bottles so far looks alright I

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.800 
platypus bottles so far looks alright I
can<00:03:45.040> squeeze<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.580> no<00:03:45.850> water's<00:03:46.150> coming<00:03:46.450> out

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
can squeeze it no water's coming out

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.440 
can squeeze it no water's coming out
although<00:03:47.650> upon<00:03:48.220> closer<00:03:48.520> inspection<00:03:48.730> we<00:03:49.180> can

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
although upon closer inspection we can

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.420 
although upon closer inspection we can
see<00:03:49.630> there's<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.870> small<00:03:50.140> crack<00:03:50.680> right<00:03:50.980> there

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
see there's a small crack right there

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.520 
see there's a small crack right there
every<00:03:52.150> now<00:03:52.300> and<00:03:52.510> then<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.660> drop<00:03:52.960> of<00:03:52.990> water<00:03:53.200> will

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
every now and then a drop of water will

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.140 
every now and then a drop of water will
get<00:03:53.770> out<00:03:53.890> through<00:03:54.070> that<00:03:54.130> trap<00:03:54.550> let's<00:03:54.910> do<00:03:55.030> that

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
get out through that trap let's do that

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.850 
get out through that trap let's do that
crack<00:03:55.480> but<00:03:56.550> not<00:03:57.550> very<00:03:57.670> much<00:03:58.560> now<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.590> might<00:03:59.830> be

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
crack but not very much now you might be

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.060 
crack but not very much now you might be
thinking<00:04:00.010> sure<00:04:00.520> it<00:04:00.640> can<00:04:00.790> survive<00:04:01.120> a<00:04:01.510> fall<00:04:02.070> but

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
thinking sure it can survive a fall but

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.040 
thinking sure it can survive a fall but
what<00:04:03.190> if<00:04:03.280> it<00:04:03.400> gets<00:04:03.490> punctured<00:04:03.910> what<00:04:04.390> if<00:04:04.480> it's<00:04:04.870> a

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
what if it gets punctured what if it's a

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.620 
what if it gets punctured what if it's a
whip<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.770> drop<00:04:05.980> it<00:04:06.130> on<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.250> stick<00:04:06.640> or<00:04:06.850> what<00:04:07.540> if

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
whip you drop it on a stick or what if

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.449 
whip you drop it on a stick or what if
they<00:04:07.780> some<00:04:08.200> with<00:04:08.440> something<00:04:08.920> sharp<00:04:09.160> in<00:04:09.310> your

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
they some with something sharp in your

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.920 
they some with something sharp in your
backpack<00:04:09.910> or<00:04:10.120> something<00:04:10.209> like<00:04:10.480> that<00:04:10.540> so

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:41.860 

I've<00:04:15.439> got<00:04:15.650> nail<00:04:15.950> and<00:04:16.699> I've<00:04:16.820> got<00:04:17.030> board

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.300 

so<00:04:42.870> let's<00:04:43.080> try<00:04:43.230> something<00:04:43.560> I<00:04:46.100> don't<00:04:47.100> know<00:04:47.220> if

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
so let's try something I don't know if

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.220 
so let's try something I don't know if
this<00:04:47.460> is<00:04:47.490> gonna<00:04:47.730> survive<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.120> single<00:04:48.600> drop<00:04:48.870> so

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
this is gonna survive a single drop so

00:04:49.230 --> 00:05:07.570 
this is gonna survive a single drop so
let's<00:04:49.440> start<00:04:49.740> love<00:04:50.010> two<00:04:50.430> inches

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.790 

now<00:05:08.120> leaking

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:21.610 

three<00:05:14.490> inches

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:41.260 

still<00:05:22.160> not<00:05:22.340> leaking

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:52.150 

four<00:05:42.270> inches

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.120 

still<00:05:52.730> not<00:05:52.880> leak<00:05:53.350> you<00:05:54.350> can<00:05:54.530> see<00:05:54.710> a<00:05:54.740> left<00:05:54.980> of

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
still not leak you can see a left of

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.810 
still not leak you can see a left of
March<00:05:56.590> and<00:05:57.590> it<00:05:57.710> seems<00:05:58.010> like<00:05:58.250> it<00:05:58.370> almost<00:05:58.490> went

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
March and it seems like it almost went

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:22.320 
March and it seems like it almost went
through<00:05:59.060> but<00:05:59.300> it's<00:05:59.420> not<00:05:59.600> leak<00:06:17.830> five<00:06:18.830> inches

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.520 

that<00:06:23.330> did<00:06:23.570> it<00:06:25.150> survived<00:06:26.150> a<00:06:26.300> five<00:06:26.780> inch<00:06:27.140> drop

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
that did it survived a five inch drop

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.360 
that did it survived a five inch drop
from<00:06:27.950> a<00:06:28.070> hammer<00:06:28.340> onto<00:06:28.850> a<00:06:29.120> nail<00:06:29.890> all<00:06:30.890> the<00:06:31.130> force
