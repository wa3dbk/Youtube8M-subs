00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.960
 dear friends, hello to us today 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:24.589
 again the boat don't call she shaw gmo 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:28.159
 so may hose let's say so pretty 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:29.599
 good size boat model 7012 y 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:32.689
 us light blue 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:36.829
 there is probably still red 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:40.059
 I chose the blue in the set instruction is not 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.820
 I will get there in the distance we have 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.570
 so what drove drove what 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.489
 first he has advantages 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.010
 equipment 2 and 4 certainly does not look 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.549
 very but 2 and 4 gigahertz is good 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:02.390
 plastic wheel trimmer steering pans and 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:07.039
 All plus is that 24 stand principle 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.700
 familiar already active worse krone it 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:09.700
 for equipment 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:26.750
 battery charging is 84 volts 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:28.960
 then 7 and 2 so for such a husband, and so here 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.330
 podvodchki you pathetic need to pick up 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.090
 cool cool body interesting 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.979
 size size shorter roughly 00 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.759
 ninth shaft ie 912 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.800
 same size sit tyk tyk tyk 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.200
 tyk 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:50.810
 let's see she has a seal here but 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.759
 I wonder how much is involved but 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.929
 I think he is not so serious 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.280
 there are up to 0 0 9 our boats and far to him 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:02.179
 I'm afraid it will still be possible 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.539
 penetrate but how is it so our receiver with 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.819
 the regulator in one box is 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.860
 battery here with us 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:13.849
 attached you look ka they him 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.370
 attached that it can not be removed but not 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.500
 I know how this solution plus or minus on 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.090
 me so it's minus us ladies have 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.470
 haul the boat but just have a snack 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.410
 nippers maybe it's for 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.180
 transportation they though here is this compartment 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.040
 much more than a battery and he 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.950
 will hang out really that is something 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.650
 I didn't know it here 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.190
 servo motor collector steering wheel 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.989
 which person well and everything in boats all 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.120
 just that is nothing like that here in them 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.740
 no, everything is standard for everyone 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.970
 the location of the motors is changing with us 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.150
 regulators 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.030
 everything is empty in front 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.460
 7012 mind nothing, let's get right away 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.570
 try to run it suddenly not 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.570
 working now a second 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.159
 so we will see if it will be better though 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.519
 be at least 00 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.959
 912 that is, that is here until the 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.969
 Today, for me, even though I am 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.650
 few boats to such budget 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:19.079
 drove them really not much there 0 0 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:26.280
 9 still for me so the most thoughtful 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:29.459
 the boat is going fast 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:34.379
 excellent insulation 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:38.689
 compartment so here we all caught fire 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:42.959
 tyn melon melon plus or minus 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:46.379
 so the power button, I understand the buttons 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:54.389
 inclusions here we do not exist here 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:58.500
 we do not connect we cut them down I even 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:04:00.260
 here it is written he could anyone see here he 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.870
 of 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:08.459
 but there's nothing there so see see here 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.169
 here we have a connection most likely 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.659
 will be with water and only then she us 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:15.569
 Thatâ€™s why sheâ€™s not working yet. 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:18.239
 everything works then we do a trial 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.130

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.479
