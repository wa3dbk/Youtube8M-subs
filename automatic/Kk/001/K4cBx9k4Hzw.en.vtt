00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
right there Stegosaurus right there I

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.339 
right there Stegosaurus right there I
guess<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.150> loan<00:02:23.270> was<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.390> brontosaurus<00:02:24.080> I

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
guess the loan was a brontosaurus I

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.710 
guess the loan was a brontosaurus I
believe<00:02:24.670> is<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.849> love<00:02:26.000> dinosaurs<00:02:26.180> when<00:02:26.599> I<00:02:26.630> was

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
believe is the love dinosaurs when I was

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.360 
believe is the love dinosaurs when I was
younger<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.140> there's<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.410> film<00:02:27.920> strip<00:02:28.190> piece
