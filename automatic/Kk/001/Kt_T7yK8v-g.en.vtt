group<00:00:58.570> of<00:00:58.720> trees<00:00:58.930> like<00:00:59.170> this<00:00:59.410> and<00:00:59.890> we'll<00:01:00.010> pick

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
group of trees like this and we'll pick

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.979 
group of trees like this and we'll pick
out<00:01:00.399> our<00:01:00.579> prime<00:01:00.850> trees<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.630> we'll<00:01:01.750> slowly

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
out our prime trees and we'll slowly

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.439 
out our prime trees and we'll slowly
motor<00:01:02.320> our<00:01:02.530> way<00:01:02.710> through<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:04.180> good<00:01:04.299> to<00:01:04.390> have

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
motor our way through it's good to have

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.210 
motor our way through it's good to have
a<00:01:04.600> little<00:01:05.110> rope<00:01:05.350> tied<00:01:05.620> up<00:01:05.770> to<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:05.979> front<00:01:06.159> of

a little rope tied up to the front of
your<00:01:06.280> boat<00:01:06.460> too<00:01:06.760> so<00:01:07.120> if<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.270> find<00:01:07.630> a<00:01:07.750> good<00:01:07.900> tree

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
your boat too so if you find a good tree

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.930 
your boat too so if you find a good tree
and<00:01:08.409> pick<00:01:08.620> up<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:08.860> few<00:01:09.040> fish<00:01:09.220> on<00:01:09.370> it<00:01:09.520> we<00:01:09.670> might<00:01:09.790> be

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
and pick up a few fish on it we might be

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.399 
and pick up a few fish on it we might be
able<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.180> just<00:01:10.360> wrap<00:01:10.510> the<00:01:10.659> rope<00:01:10.990> around<00:01:11.140> the

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
able to just wrap the rope around the

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.020 
able to just wrap the rope around the
tree<00:01:11.530> and<00:01:11.800> put<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:12.100> few<00:01:12.250> more<00:01:12.310> drops<00:01:12.610> in<00:01:12.850> and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
tree and put a few more drops in and

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.410 
tree and put a few more drops in and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
got a slow-rolling

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.850 
got a slow-rolling
gulps<00:01:22.090> or<00:01:22.240> plastics<00:01:22.659> up<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.930> side<00:01:23.140> of<00:01:23.290> trees<00:01:23.500> a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
gulps or plastics up the side of trees a

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.539 
gulps or plastics up the side of trees a
lot<00:01:24.610> of<00:01:24.700> times<00:01:24.909> as<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.450> water<00:01:25.750> gets<00:01:25.960> cooler

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
lot of times as the water gets cooler

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.710 
lot of times as the water gets cooler
the<00:01:27.549> yellow-belly<00:01:27.940> like<00:01:28.150> to<00:01:28.270> be<00:01:28.360> hard<00:01:28.600> up

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
the yellow-belly like to be hard up

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.300 
the yellow-belly like to be hard up
against<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.170> tree<00:01:29.380> chasing<00:01:29.860> that<00:01:29.979> that's

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
against the tree chasing that that's

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.850 
against the tree chasing that that's
shrimp<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:30.760> that<00:01:30.850> sort<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.119> thing<00:01:31.740> we've<00:01:32.740> got

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
shrimp and that sort of thing we've got

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.370 
shrimp and that sort of thing we've got
here<00:01:33.010> we've<00:01:33.040> got<00:01:33.220> a<00:01:33.280> best<00:01:33.520> man<00:01:33.729> she<00:01:34.150> could<00:01:34.380> read

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
here we've got a best man she could read

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.100 
here we've got a best man she could read
with<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.560> gulp<00:01:35.799> when<00:01:36.220> a<00:01:36.250> quarry<00:01:36.490> appeared<00:01:37.110> we

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
with a gulp when a quarry appeared we

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.630 
with a gulp when a quarry appeared we
just<00:01:38.260> hit<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.380> drop<00:01:38.560> it<00:01:38.680> down<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.250> side<00:01:39.460> of<00:01:39.580> the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
just hit a drop it down the side of the

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.420 
just hit a drop it down the side of the
tree<00:01:39.909> and<00:01:41.490> then<00:01:43.560> all<00:01:44.560> we<00:01:44.680> do<00:01:44.830> it's<00:01:44.979> just<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.280> nice

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
tree and then all we do it's just a nice

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.030 
tree and then all we do it's just a nice
slow<00:01:45.820> roll<00:01:46.229> roll<00:01:47.229> up<00:01:47.409> so<00:01:47.590> we<00:01:47.680> let<00:01:47.830> it<00:01:47.920> hit<00:01:48.010> the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
slow roll roll up so we let it hit the

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.970 
slow roll roll up so we let it hit the
bottom

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
bottom

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.030 
bottom
I<00:01:50.150> know<00:01:51.150> it's<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.480> the<00:01:51.570> bottom<00:01:51.720> there<00:01:51.960> now<00:01:52.350> you

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
I know it's on the bottom there now you

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.950 
I know it's on the bottom there now you
know<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.190> sit<00:01:53.400> close<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.910> tree<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.840> just

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
know I sit close to the tree and just

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:06.800 
know I sit close to the tree and just
didn't<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.260> a<00:01:55.290> nice<00:01:55.560> slow<00:01:56.450> roll<00:02:05.810> basically

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
didn't like a nice slow roll basically

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.600 
didn't like a nice slow roll basically
what<00:02:06.990> we<00:02:07.110> want<00:02:07.260> to<00:02:07.350> do<00:02:07.470> is<00:02:07.740> when<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.280> get<00:02:08.430> to<00:02:08.580> a

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
what we want to do is when we get to a

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.280 
what we want to do is when we get to a
tree<00:02:08.880> like<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.330> we<00:02:09.540> want<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.750> suss<00:02:09.960> out<00:02:10.140> what

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
tree like this we want to suss out what

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.570 
tree like this we want to suss out what
depth<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.740> is<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.040> we<00:02:11.130> have<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.280> look<00:02:11.430> at<00:02:11.490> our

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
depth it is so we have a look at our

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.700 
depth it is so we have a look at our
depth<00:02:11.850> sounder<00:02:12.270> we've<00:02:12.810> run<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.050> few<00:02:13.260> drops<00:02:13.500> down

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
depth sounder we've run a few drops down

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
depth sounder we've run a few drops down
and<00:02:13.980> see<00:02:14.730> what<00:02:14.940> what's<00:02:15.450> down<00:02:15.660> underneath<00:02:15.990> and

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
and see what what's down underneath and

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.550 
and see what what's down underneath and
if<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:18.120> get<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.300> few<00:02:18.480> bites<00:02:18.720> or<00:02:18.990> we<00:02:19.080> find<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.410> few

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
if we get a few bites or we find a few

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.470 
if we get a few bites or we find a few
fish<00:02:19.770> there<00:02:19.980> we<00:02:20.130> mark<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.580> depth<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.270> make

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
fish there we mark that depth and make

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.970 
fish there we mark that depth and make
sure<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.840> we<00:02:21.990> keep<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.530> mind<00:02:22.740> for<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
sure that we keep that in mind for the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.280 
sure that we keep that in mind for the
next<00:02:23.190> few<00:02:23.310> trees<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:23.850> find<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:25.020> find

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
next few trees that we find and we find

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.640 
next few trees that we find and we find
that<00:02:25.470> moving<00:02:26.040> consistently<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:27.440> really<00:02:28.440> key

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
that moving consistently is really key

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.860 
that moving consistently is really key
into<00:02:28.950> finding<00:02:29.310> larger<00:02:30.180> numbers<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.630> fish

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
into finding larger numbers of fish

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.900 
into finding larger numbers of fish
quite<00:02:31.530> often<00:02:31.740> you'll<00:02:32.040> move<00:02:32.280> from<00:02:32.580> tree<00:02:32.790> to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
quite often you'll move from tree to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.340 
quite often you'll move from tree to
tree<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.360> might<00:02:33.510> pull<00:02:33.720> one<00:02:33.930> fish<00:02:34.170> off

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
tree and you might pull one fish off

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.230 
tree and you might pull one fish off
here<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.740> one<00:02:34.890> fish<00:02:35.070> off<00:02:35.250> there<00:02:35.460> but<00:02:35.700> there's

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
here and one fish off there but there's

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.330 
here and one fish off there but there's
always<00:02:36.450> gonna<00:02:36.780> be<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.320> one<00:02:37.710> tree<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.040> holds

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
always gonna be that one tree that holds

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.770 
always gonna be that one tree that holds
a<00:02:38.520> few<00:02:38.700> more<00:02:38.850> fish<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.240> might<00:02:39.390> be<00:02:39.510> able<00:02:39.630> to

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
a few more fish you might be able to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.840 
a few more fish you might be able to
turn<00:02:40.200> those<00:02:40.380> bites<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:41.300> consistently<00:02:43.700> at<00:02:44.700> the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
turn those bites in consistently at the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.640 
turn those bites in consistently at the
moment<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:45.240> found<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.690> pretty<00:02:46.230> good<00:02:46.410> train

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
moment we found a pretty good train

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.140 
moment we found a pretty good train
about<00:02:46.890> thirty-five<00:02:47.370> foot<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.670> water<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.090> we

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
about thirty-five foot of water and we

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.490 
about thirty-five foot of water and we
found<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.420> fish<00:02:48.570> before<00:02:48.750> but<00:02:49.200> they're<00:02:49.410> not

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
found a fish before but they're not

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.290 
found a fish before but they're not
really<00:02:49.680> happening<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:50.190> we're<00:02:51.000> just<00:02:51.030> going<00:02:51.210> to

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
really happening so we're just going to

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.420 
really happening so we're just going to
keep<00:02:51.450> moving<00:02:51.630> our<00:02:51.990> way<00:02:52.140> through<00:02:52.410> putting<00:02:53.280> a

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
keep moving our way through putting a

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.340 
keep moving our way through putting a
drop<00:02:53.610> down<00:02:53.820> one<00:02:54.090> side<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.540> stump<00:02:54.840> two<00:02:55.230> or

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
drop down one side of the stump two or

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.780 
drop down one side of the stump two or
three<00:02:55.560> drops<00:02:55.770> down<00:02:55.950> one<00:02:56.190> side<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.580> stuff

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
three drops down one side of the stuff

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.640 
three drops down one side of the stuff
maybe<00:02:57.000> popping<00:02:57.900> around<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.260> other<00:02:58.410> side

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
maybe popping around to the other side

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.290 
maybe popping around to the other side
of<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.830> tree<00:02:59.070> or<00:02:59.310> putting<00:02:59.700> our<00:02:59.880> rods<00:03:00.120> through

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
of the tree or putting our rods through

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.580 
of the tree or putting our rods through
the<00:03:00.450> gaps<00:03:00.660> in<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.930> tree<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.170> dropping<00:03:01.440> it

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
the gaps in the tree and dropping it

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.690 
the gaps in the tree and dropping it
down<00:03:01.740> on<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.950> other<00:03:01.980> side<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.490> stuff<00:03:02.670> just

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
down on the other side of the stuff just

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:13.180 
down on the other side of the stuff just
so<00:03:03.000> we<00:03:03.120> cover<00:03:03.330> as<00:03:03.480> much<00:03:03.600> ground<00:03:03.660> as<00:03:04.050> possible

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.460 

there<00:03:14.190> we<00:03:14.280> have<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.580> nice<00:03:15.330> coq10<00:03:15.780> golden<00:03:16.170> first

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
there we have it nice coq10 golden first

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.550 
there we have it nice coq10 golden first
one<00:03:16.710> for<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:16.980> trip<00:03:17.750> I'll<00:03:18.750> be<00:03:18.840> about<00:03:18.990> 45

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
one for the trip I'll be about 45

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.940 
one for the trip I'll be about 45
centimeters<00:03:20.190> on<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.990> fast<00:03:21.990> man<00:03:22.260> painted<00:03:22.740> cheek

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
centimeters on a fast man painted cheek

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.790 
centimeters on a fast man painted cheek
head<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.630> little<00:03:24.630> grub<00:03:24.870> plastic<00:03:25.380> just

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
head and a little grub plastic just

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.770 
head and a little grub plastic just
rolling<00:03:26.130> through<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.460> trees<00:03:26.730> here<00:03:26.940> we

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
rolling through the trees here we

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.150 
rolling through the trees here we
actually<00:03:27.960> just<00:03:28.320> said<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:28.620> this<00:03:28.740> tree<00:03:29.010> would

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
actually just said that this tree would

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.970 
actually just said that this tree would
be<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.370> one<00:03:29.520> so<00:03:30.080> pretty<00:03:31.080> happy<00:03:31.470> with<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.740> I

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
be the one so pretty happy with that I

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.620 
be the one so pretty happy with that I
think<00:03:32.160> we'll<00:03:32.400> probably<00:03:32.880> stick<00:03:33.240> it<00:03:33.330> out<00:03:33.450> for<00:03:33.480> a

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
think we'll probably stick it out for a

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.210 
think we'll probably stick it out for a
bit<00:03:33.750> longer<00:03:33.960> and<00:03:34.230> hopefully<00:03:34.890> we<00:03:34.980> can<00:03:35.100> get<00:03:35.160> a

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
bit longer and hopefully we can get a

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.580 
bit longer and hopefully we can get a
few<00:03:35.430> more
