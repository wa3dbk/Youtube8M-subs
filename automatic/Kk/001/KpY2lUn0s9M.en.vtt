Minecraft and I'm flying a plane as you
guys<00:00:19.140> can<00:00:19.410> see<00:00:19.470> I'm<00:00:20.039> playing<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.550> flying<00:00:21.029> a

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
guys can see I'm playing it flying a

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.400 
guys can see I'm playing it flying a
biplane<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.250> I<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.789> tested<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.330> out<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.779> it

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
biplane and I just tested it out and it

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.220 
biplane and I just tested it out and it
is<00:00:25.529> really<00:00:26.070> awesome<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.570> as<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:27.930> see<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
is really awesome but as you can see the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.429 
is really awesome but as you can see the
camera<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> little<00:00:29.340> bit<00:00:29.490> buggy<00:00:29.990> you<00:00:30.990> can<00:00:31.199> see

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
camera is a little bit buggy you can see

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.870 
camera is a little bit buggy you can see
the<00:00:31.619> propeller<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.309> working<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:34.880> hopefully

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the propeller is working and hopefully

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.000 
the propeller is working and hopefully
we<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.510> land<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.200> I'll<00:00:37.380> guys<00:00:37.649> show<00:00:37.950> you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
we can land it and I'll guys show you

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.590 
we can land it and I'll guys show you
how<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> fly<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.300> plane<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:41.600> hopefully

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
how to fly this plane and hopefully

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.440 
how to fly this plane and hopefully
Camtasia<00:00:43.170> will<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.040> program<00:00:44.700> i<00:00:44.910> used<00:00:45.270> to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
Camtasia will be the program i used to

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.060 
Camtasia will be the program i used to
record<00:00:45.780> from<00:00:45.989> now<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:47.149> or<00:00:48.149> fraps<00:00:49.070> hopefully

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
record from now on or fraps hopefully

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.340 
record from now on or fraps hopefully
Camtasia<00:00:50.550> makes<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.059> file<00:00:51.390> sizes<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.899> lot

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
Camtasia makes the file sizes a lot

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.689 
Camtasia makes the file sizes a lot
smaller<00:00:53.059> because<00:00:54.059> fraps<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:55.160> way<00:00:56.160> too<00:00:56.219> big<00:00:56.670> for

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
smaller because fraps is way too big for

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.240 
smaller because fraps is way too big for
me<00:00:58.129> alright<00:00:59.129> we're<00:00:59.370> slowing<00:00:59.879> down<00:01:00.090> now<00:01:00.149> oh

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
me alright we're slowing down now oh

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
dear we're not going to make it to our

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.210 
dear we're not going to make it to our
chest<00:01:03.840> oh<00:01:04.400> dear<00:01:05.400> we're<00:01:05.939> not<00:01:06.090> going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.330> make<00:01:06.450> it

place that one over there alright so we
have<00:02:14.170> our<00:02:14.200> biplane<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.070> we<00:02:15.160> can<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.520> can<00:02:15.670> just

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
have our biplane and we can you can just

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.120 
have our biplane and we can you can just
spawn<00:02:16.209> one<00:02:16.420> by<00:02:16.810> placing<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.500> down<00:02:17.620> like<00:02:17.890> that
