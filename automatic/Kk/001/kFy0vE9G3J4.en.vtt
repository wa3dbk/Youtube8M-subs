00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello, I'll show you my today 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.910
 of course, the smallest steamboat itself 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.469
 tinkered so much fun then show it then 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.730
 I'll show you how it works and 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.260
 it just becomes the little spirit 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.920
 burner lit and after a while 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.920
 it starts then 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.629
 that works well it's easy 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.180
 finally a normal rattle 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.680
 Boat as you toy as a bathtub 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.740
 knows and yes the little spirit burner 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.660
 so here just a small box with 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.790
 a bit of wadding in it heats that up 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.350
 water in this spiral here where the 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.940
 To lead horrendous out to the back and 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.700
 the water starts to boil naturally 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.229
 and whistles neatly out the back and 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.690
 also a bit with the steam and if 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.550
 the steam in the cold area of ​​the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.229
 pipes he condenses through it 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.600
 creates a vacuum and the whole 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.680
 sucks again full of water and then 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.710
 goes the whole is more yes rebuild 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.990
 It's easy to just pay attention 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.960
 that the diameter of the pipe between 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.240
 2 and 3 should be 5 mm so the 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.850
 outside diameter that it is a very good one 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.800
 that it is reasonably reliable 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.429
 the small part works here 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.390
 soldered out of biscuit tin so it has 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:06.250
 nothing tasted or so who something 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.580
 that can be done easier too 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.990
 so join in with a wood basic form 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.670
 You can do a bit of styrofoam dream 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.890
 wonderful with a tealight heat 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.530
 and here is the spiral also different 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.450
 bent that bends better because 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.099
 you have a bigger video radios there 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.670
 there is no danger of it 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.950
 kinks and now three millimeters tube 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.430
 installed and that works completely 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.290
 Well 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.750
 at such a great radius recommends 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.090
 However, that still with aluminum foil 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.520
 to wrap up the heat from the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.989
 do not just candle up with it 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.590
 by whistling but that's me 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.120
 reasonably well distributed on the tube if you 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.670
 ask to have the whole story 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.250
 then she just writes in the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.200
 Comments 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.800
 otherwise I say goodbye to the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.800
 next video
