00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
time so they thought hey while making

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.470 
time so they thought hey while making
this<00:02:11.450> let's<00:02:11.720> make<00:02:11.900> one<00:02:12.110> red<00:02:12.440> guy<00:02:12.650> here<00:02:13.480> like

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
this let's make one red guy here like

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.089 
this let's make one red guy here like
let<00:02:14.690> me<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.840> sprite<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.410> was<00:02:15.530> unused<00:02:15.950> or

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
something the rest of the game so I

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.550

know wraps his talons around it makes
his<00:02:38.900> eyes<00:02:39.049> glow<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.650> steps<00:02:40.069> onto<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.430> spikes

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
his eyes glow and steps onto the spikes

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.229 
his eyes glow and steps onto the spikes
steps<00:02:42.319> through<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.680> spikes<00:02:42.980> actually<00:02:43.910> I

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
steps through the spikes actually I

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.000 
steps through the spikes actually I
thought<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:44.629> was<00:02:44.780> weird<00:02:45.079> because<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.560> chozo

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
thought this was weird because the chozo

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.370 
thought this was weird because the chozo
seems<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.459> be<00:02:46.549> in<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.790> foreground<00:02:47.239> why<00:02:48.139> can't

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
seems to be in the foreground why can't

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.809 
seems to be in the foreground why can't
I<00:02:48.470> walk<00:02:48.650> in<00:02:48.829> the<00:02:48.950> foreground<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.519> completely

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
I walk in the foreground and completely

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.150 
I walk in the foreground and completely
avoid<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.239> spikes<00:02:50.540> are<00:02:50.780> they<00:02:51.470> Izzy<00:02:51.799> stepping

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
avoid the spikes are they Izzy stepping

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.319 
avoid the spikes are they Izzy stepping
on<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.370> spikes<00:02:52.579> because<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:53.030> doesn't<00:02:53.180> make

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
on the spikes because that doesn't make

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.900 
on the spikes because that doesn't make
much<00:02:53.510> sense<00:02:53.569> from<00:02:54.019> a<00:02:54.370> from<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.519> physics

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
much sense from a from a physics

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
much sense from a from a physics
standpoint<00:02:56.120> because<00:02:56.859> like<00:02:57.859> when<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.370> spikes

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
standpoint because like when the spikes

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.970 
standpoint because like when the spikes
break<00:02:59.930> or<00:03:00.109> they<00:03:00.200> have<00:03:00.319> some<00:03:00.470> kind<00:03:00.560> of<00:03:00.680> dust

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
break or they have some kind of dust

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.940 
break or they have some kind of dust

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
this gravity suit water poses no threat

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.749 
this gravity suit water poses no threat
to<00:04:24.460> me<00:04:25.139> for<00:04:26.139> I<00:04:26.169> am<00:04:27.210> waterproof<00:04:28.210> cemiss<00:04:29.759> yeah
