00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.310
 nice all boy i am jade here we are 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.080
 with the eighth episode of the broken glory 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.990
 will be a shorter episode than the 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.049
 others however we will always see the usual two 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.330
 games I do n't think any new purchases 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.780
 if yes a few, however, this episode 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:25.370
 still enough intermezzo why 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:28.220
 because however you will see many purchases and 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.130
 goal more goals 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.710
 in short, in the next few episodes the fact is 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.280
 recorded until the episode for now 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.040
 until episode 13 it seems to me and is 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.680
 going well you'll also see a little in 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.180
 future is a bit of the twists that there 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.340
 they will be 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.570
 I also recorded a couple of 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.070
 unfortunately, paco opening is not live 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.690
 already initially recorded it in live 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.370
 but then I don't know why not 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.930
 it didn't save me the audio tracks that 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.899
 I had done the live so it 's not good enough 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.190
 bad I don't advance you anything however if you 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.479
 I only say that I did these little things 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.119
 opening and today's matches will go me 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.460
 both seem as good as you see the 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.700
 new zuniga purchase immediately finds a 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.880
 good goal I also bought de jong 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.670
 as cdc since my parents don't know why 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.799
 they get very tired I don't know if even i 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.920
 your cdc if you have a team of 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.960
 I generally don't know a team with 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.750
 he decides I don't know why my parents do 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.090
 tire immediately you will also see in the future 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.429
 the ones I will buy where I always do them 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.170
 turn because I do not know lose 7 8 of 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.409
 form at a time then after two games 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.830
 already I have to run them I saw many 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.440
 comments regarding the next ones 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.310
 to these that I could do many that me 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.630
 advised players like jovetic and 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.720
 right now in attack I don't 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.740
 but I remember jovetic well 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.140
 jovetic is a player that to me 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.009
 personally don't like it very much not 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.200
 I know well why it seems to me 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.700
 physically too weak then I am 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.550
 opinions as you see this opponent 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.050
 however disconnects it seems to me for 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.890
 this lasted for a short while because it can 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.870
 sixtieth you are disconnected and stay 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.970
 then the comments above all 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.819
 concerning vidal to take it not to take it 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.720
 then I go well of course I already have 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.860
 registered I tell you I bought both him 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.540
 what a marchisio and I must say that I am 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.400
 both good and stronger players more 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.410
 marchisio 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.620
 I must say that I vidal but marked a 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.830
 beautiful long shot for episode 12 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.300
 I therefore believe it is still missing a lot 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.830
 I must say that they are both excellent 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.080
 players and I know I'm doing very well in 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.840
 these in these matches the team me 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.950
 like a lot opens with a tell you 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.930
 other 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.269
 as you see the first the first game 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.760
 I won 3 1 this second game 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.160
 it was already more difficult since I met 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.800
 however the Brazilian team 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.200
 412 well put he practically marks me 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:13.110
 immediately it seems to me a goal 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:15.630
 quite ascetic and nothing I thought that 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.630
 I would have lost this game and with 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.150
 the opponent seemed strong enough and 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.330
 but I can't do it practically anyway 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.360
 immediately to straighten the game with a 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.700
 ogbonna's beautiful goal on a pattern with 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.430
 maxi morales who gives him the ball and then he 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.470
 find the goal really happy because 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.120
 at the beginning I wanted to shoot with maxi 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.610
 morales pro said let's try to score 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:45.270
 so maybe it's okay indeed 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:51.450
 hormonal goals then here is the usual can 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:54.110
 say goal also quite sculato if 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.460
 so it's ok to say of thiago ribeiro 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.500
 tiago ribeiro which I am no longer anyway 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.650
 making me play so much because I am 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.340
 noticed that going up in this way of division 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:09.209
 I can no longer use it so well 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.160
 you show a little you can see a little 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.080
 the limits that to this player e 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.720
 I prefer matter he matri who 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.750
 I'm really enjoying it a lot 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.040
 tell me if you want that with first trifi 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.400
 because anyway in the following episodes 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:27.300
 you will see fulcrums opening so credits there 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.890
 are and the themes precisely if you want that with 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.090
 primate also refused to keep that 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.970
 normal 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.130
 to me honestly nothing changes for 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.860
 now until episode 12 13 I'm holding 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.720
 normal matri and I'm normal marks 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.220
 really scoring so much 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.430
 so guys the episode is 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.780
 practically to end 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.000
 I thank you again for all the 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.430
 views then put a nice me 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.070
 like it is a commentary of themes precisely if 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.710
 buy but 3 or less for a good while 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.490
 of episodes and see you at the next 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.490
 nice video
