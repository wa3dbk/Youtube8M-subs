just poured the we and the cabbage juice

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.830 
just poured the we and the cabbage juice
into<00:03:07.709> this<00:03:07.829> glass<00:03:08.130> here<00:03:08.579> and<00:03:08.610> it's<00:03:09.000> showing<00:03:09.569> a

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
into this glass here and it's showing a

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.539 
into this glass here and it's showing a
really<00:03:10.110> different<00:03:10.319> color<00:03:10.709> it<00:03:11.010> looks<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.400> lot

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
really different color it looks a lot

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.780 
really different color it looks a lot
more<00:03:11.610> purple<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:13.079> let's<00:03:13.890> pinky<00:03:14.370> then<00:03:14.549> this

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
more purple and let's pinky then this

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.330 
more purple and let's pinky then this
one's<00:03:15.030> from<00:03:15.299> this<00:03:15.510> Cup

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
one's from this Cup

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.660 
one's from this Cup
so<00:03:17.630> that's<00:03:18.630> weird<00:03:18.930> how<00:03:19.079> it's<00:03:19.260> changed<00:03:20.100> color

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
so that's weird how it's changed color

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.030 
so that's weird how it's changed color
if<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.569> hold<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.900> up<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.170> light<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.769> still

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
if I hold it up to the light it still

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.809 
if I hold it up to the light it still
looks<00:03:23.250> quite<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.519> purple<00:03:25.370> so<00:03:26.370> it's<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.639> bit<00:03:26.790> more

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
looks quite a purple so it's a bit more

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.360 
looks quite a purple so it's a bit more
dark<00:03:27.380> darker<00:03:28.380> than<00:03:28.530> what<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:28.889> looked<00:03:29.069> like<00:03:29.130> in

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
dark darker than what it looked like in

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.530 
dark darker than what it looked like in
the<00:03:29.430> plastic<00:03:29.819> cup<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:31.040> that's<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.940> top<00:03:33.150> view

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
the plastic cup and that's the top view

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.319 
the plastic cup and that's the top view
so<00:03:36.799> that<00:03:37.799> looks<00:03:38.040> more<00:03:38.310> like<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.489> girl<00:03:38.790> result

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
so that looks more like a girl result

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:46.090 
so that looks more like a girl result
from<00:03:39.660> there

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.610 

okay<00:03:47.100> we<00:03:47.220> just<00:03:47.250> did<00:03:47.550> a<00:03:47.580> test<00:03:47.850> with<00:03:48.540> baking<00:03:49.320> soda

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
okay we just did a test with baking soda

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.160 
okay we just did a test with baking soda
in<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.040> red<00:03:50.190> cabbage<00:03:50.550> water<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:52.110> is

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
in the red cabbage water and this is

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.890 
in the red cabbage water and this is
what<00:03:52.500> we<00:03:52.620> came<00:03:52.860> up<00:03:52.920> with<00:03:53.250> it<00:03:53.490> came<00:03:54.300> out<00:03:54.510> really

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
what we came up with it came out really

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.220 
what we came up with it came out really
kind<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.620> greeny<00:03:55.980> blue<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:57.690> looks<00:03:57.750> greener

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
kind of greeny blue it looks greener

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.190 
kind of greeny blue it looks greener
than<00:03:58.500> it<00:03:58.650> does<00:03:58.800> on<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.950> camera<00:03:59.340> but<00:04:00.200> yes

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
than it does on the camera but yes

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.090 
than it does on the camera but yes
that's<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.920> baking<00:04:02.340> soda<00:04:03.320> let's<00:04:04.320> see<00:04:04.530> I'm<00:04:04.920> in

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
that's the baking soda let's see I'm in

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.020 
that's the baking soda let's see I'm in
here

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
here

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.180 
here
it<00:04:06.780> looks<00:04:07.020> more<00:04:07.230> blue<00:04:07.410> on<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.740> camera<00:04:08.040> but

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
it looks more blue on the camera but

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.620 
it looks more blue on the camera but
it's<00:04:08.600> locked<00:04:09.600> greener<00:04:10.700> in<00:04:11.700> real<00:04:11.940> life<00:04:12.150> and

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
it's locked greener in real life and

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.760 
it's locked greener in real life and
then<00:04:12.900> this<00:04:13.110> was<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:14.060> vinegar<00:04:15.739> and<00:04:16.739> red

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
then this was the vinegar and red

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.040 
then this was the vinegar and red
cabbage<00:04:17.250> water<00:04:17.730> I'm<00:04:18.239> going<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.510> pull<00:04:18.720> this<00:04:18.840> in

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050 
cabbage water I'm going to pull this in

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.000 
cabbage water I'm going to pull this in
context

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
context

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.310 
context
no<00:04:20.300> ostentatious<00:04:21.300> and<00:04:21.480> then<00:04:21.750> this<00:04:21.900> is<00:04:22.110> our

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
no ostentatious and then this is our

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.590 
no ostentatious and then this is our
result<00:04:24.380> so<00:04:25.700> compared<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:26.760> those<00:04:27.000> three<00:04:27.480> it

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
result so compared to those three it

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.330 
result so compared to those three it
looks<00:04:27.630> a<00:04:27.900> lot<00:04:28.020> more<00:04:28.760> acidic<00:04:29.990> below<00:04:31.190> but<00:04:32.190> then

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
looks a lot more acidic below but then

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.100 
looks a lot more acidic below but then
it's<00:04:32.520> kind<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.760> in<00:04:32.880> between<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.390> two<00:04:33.630> so<00:04:33.930> it's

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
it's kind of in between the two so it's

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.830 
it's kind of in between the two so it's
hard<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.620> tell
