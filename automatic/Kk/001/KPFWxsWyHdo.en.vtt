00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.530
 hello that such changos 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.689
 this video is dedicated to bolivia that demands the sovereign exit to the sea and 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.850
 recover is a must for all 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.779
 that includes for you 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:14.190
 the other day I was listening to news and what you hear these two geli cocks 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.310
 talking about silala and the sovereign exit of bolivia 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.589
 half anger listen to these faithful shit 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.189
 they said the following 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.490
 Mónica zalaquett official deputy declared yesterday that the 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.839
 Bolivian claim that Chile pays a supposed historical claim 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:33.339
 It seems simply ridiculous while his colleague Senator Jaime Orpis Uudi 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:37.050
 He said that if he intends to enable Bolivia a port in the cove of 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.839
 pisagua the highland country must first renounce its historical 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:43.350
 aspiration of a sovereign exit to the sea 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.500
 Both statements were made 48 hours after the day of 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.640
 maritime claim convened by the government of evo morals for tomorrow 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.330
 Friday 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.090
 Bolivia is going to claim rights over six islets in the Pacific Ocean 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.190
 located between parallels 23 and 24 which were not part of the treaty of 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.510
 1904 I do not see other agreements with Chile according to the researcher and academic 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.630
 Victor Hugo Chávez 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.640
 we have identified six islands and islets that are perfectly valid 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.400
 in bolivia we have a map of the last century where two islands are consigned but 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.740
 using current methodology and technology we have 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.760
 verified that they do not correspond to parallels 25 and 26 but those that 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.009
 they are in parallels 23 and 24 that are the good santamaría 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.090
 according to the researcher in addition to the exit with sovereignty that the country is looking for 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.980
 you should also think about recovering these six islets that were not yielded 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.710
 included in the agreements following the invasion of 1879 by 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.320
 part of chile 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.409
 the way to claim these islets also goes through arbitration the way 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.100
 to claim is arbitration before the permanent court of arbitration without 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.540
 greater interpretations the agreed documents that we have with chile sustain 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.629
 that the court is the instance to which we must appeal 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.779
 now Chileans of shit will have cutting-edge technology 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.239
 modern tanks but have no reason to justify before the international court
