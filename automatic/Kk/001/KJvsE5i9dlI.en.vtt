plastic<00:01:45.630> fill<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.780> mold<00:01:47.020> up<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.610> then<00:01:48.729> it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
plastic fill the mold up and then it

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.569 
plastic fill the mold up and then it
stays<00:01:49.060> closed<00:01:49.479> determine<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.979> determines

how<00:01:51.759> long<00:01:51.789> if<00:01:52.450> say<00:01:52.630> clothes<00:01:52.990> is<00:01:53.259> your<00:01:53.409> time

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.539 

then<00:02:02.799> it<00:02:02.920> will<00:02:03.009> open

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
then it will open

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.249 
then it will open
take<00:02:04.509> your<00:02:04.659> baits<00:02:04.840> out<00:02:05.189> hang<00:02:06.189> them<00:02:07.080> do<00:02:08.080> the

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
take your baits out hang them do the

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.440 
take your baits out hang them do the
same<00:02:08.500> process<00:02:08.769> again<00:02:12.150> really<00:02:13.150> simple

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
same process again really simple

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.289 
same process again really simple
machines<00:02:13.810> have<00:02:14.230> been<00:02:14.349> around<00:02:14.410> since<00:02:14.980> the

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
machines have been around since the

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.470 
machines have been around since the
seventies<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:18.400> find<00:02:18.670> movements<00:02:19.030> around<00:02:19.209> for

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
seventies to find movements around for

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.210 
seventies to find movements around for
you<00:02:22.799> here's<00:02:23.799> your<00:02:23.980> plastic<00:02:25.830> you're<00:02:26.830> pumped

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
you here's your plastic you're pumped

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.610 
you here's your plastic you're pumped
underneath<00:02:27.700> like<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:28.329> said<00:02:28.540> you're<00:02:28.690> cold<00:02:31.620> have

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.900 

you<00:02:40.630> see<00:02:41.700> there's<00:02:42.700> your<00:02:42.850> cavities<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:45.519> inject

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
you see there's your cavities and inject

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
you see there's your cavities and inject
here<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.489> smaller<00:02:48.970> mode<00:02:49.269> we<00:02:49.510> have<00:02:49.540> much

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
here this is a smaller mode we have much

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.150 
here this is a smaller mode we have much
bigger<00:02:50.170> ones<00:02:52.319> well<00:02:53.319> that's<00:02:53.500> about<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.739> for<00:02:53.859> now

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
bigger ones well that's about it for now

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.140 
bigger ones well that's about it for now
