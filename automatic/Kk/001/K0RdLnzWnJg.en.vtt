00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.830
 hello everyone today i will show how i am doing 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.490
 mask at home for growth 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.219
 hair 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.910
 so you see I already cooked one 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.700
 yolk 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:21.900
 him I will add 2 tablespoons 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:25.140
 honey in general the yolk is very rich in vitamins 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.320
 mineral complex honey in its essence 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.099
 also rich in vitamins so in order 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.280
 so that our hair is nourished in order 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.300
 so that they have good potential to 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.020
 you need to use growth 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.200
 such pure vitamins that I think 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:53.390
 very easily absorbed by the body 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:53.390
 which are very helpful so here are some 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.270
 so I melted a little bit because he 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.579
 so pretty gustovat therefore to his 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.180
 it was easier then add stir and 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.310
 He has a little warmer and so on in this 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:15.869
 the mixture we add about 3 canteens 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:18.470
 tablespoons of brandy, I'll pour it on the eye 3 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.470
 tablespoons 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:27.350
 Here is such a mixture we continue 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.390
 here I will add oil 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.990
 juniper broom knives too 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.110
 and this essential essential oil 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.490
 for some reason I don't have the essential oil focus 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.970
 to strengthen hair 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.960
 Now I will show on the box 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.590
 box be better seen because oil 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.590
 juniper 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:59.670
 and we will dig about 10 like 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.600
 so I in my kapnul more at all 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.819
 pure essential oils undesirable 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:15.150
 use in large quantities 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:18.420
 but I in this case added 9 drops 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.989
 That is, 9 droplets such a maximum 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.910
 let's say under soda because it's 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.769
 100% essential oil is desirable 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.349
 add it to this mask 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.230
 vegetable oil is also in this mask 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.580
 it was possible to add vitamin and that is, he 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.690
 sold in capsules 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:44.190
 the form of butter is literally there too 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.519
 about 10-20 drops that is to your 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:52.430
 discretion so i mix this 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.430
 a mixture of this 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.450
 brownish on camera she 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:04.459
 it seems red in fact she is so 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:12.900
 the reason is I so we are good 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:17.640
 stir not so this mixture is applied 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:22.980
 about 30-60 minutes that is, how do you 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.989
 more convenient means applying it only 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.150
 on the hair in no case on the skin 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.299
 heads just this we do for hair 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.940
 therefore applied to the hair then 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.560
 we dress a cellophane shower cap and 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.540
 wrapped in a warm terry towel and 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.200
 walk for thirty but i usually 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:47.700
 I do strokes for 40 minutes it can be worn 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.190
 30 to 60 minutes is basically all 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.950
 Thank you all for your attention 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:58.130

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.130
