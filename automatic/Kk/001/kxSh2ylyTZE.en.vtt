00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.679
 Thank you 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:41.160

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.710
 questions to increase well be me and the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.210
 perfect condition at night I could not 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.730

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.320
 with words is a ball does not continue 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.040
 like sleeping with all the videos of 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:58.699
 terror that you have near like a baby 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.699
 how to sleep well if it costs you a lot 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:11.220
 how we talk about the themes of the videos 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.360
 that helps what people sometimes give you 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.240
 He says 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.400
 I am a geek of these themes and mental 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.940
 always he fascinated me about the terror 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.800
 mystery of the weird things and I had 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.960
 a lot of topics in mind but 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.300
 It was with a shotgun and I'm leaving 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.640
 finishing and today the people kindly 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.590
 I recommended topics 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.270
 I end up doing the videos there is one time 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.250
 you hit some insult like that in your house 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.590
 or somewhere with something that you spend 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.909
 for I'm going to cut to make videos of 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.039
 terror because this 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:50.210
 unfortunately because one day will happen to me 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:57.909
 what happened was that the feeling of 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:02:01.899
 It hurts because I box you and if one day 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.899
 quite disturbing of that 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:19.990
 and it's a person who goes to the door of the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.540
 car and it was counted there was an area of ​​the area 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.820
 it was like this against the most final videos of 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.890
 this week how it was and what was it 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.390
 motivated to make such a radical change in 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.580
 your channel because before it was in a way 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.420
 of hug because this part of 6 others 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.310
 good look 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.440
 I have a saying that you have to 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.840
 reinvent yourself or die and it's also the 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.750
 need to show the public that 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.170
 a dog of a single trick that one can 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.750
 do many things 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.970
 I think if I stay in before 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.300
 I'm going to finish this enchant as when 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.910
 blogs 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.550
 I believe that by being true to myself by 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.000
 follow that instinct to always put me 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.740
 as a goal to do what I like to be 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.300
 satisfied me with my work because if 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.510
 I am not satisfied as adapting 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.459
 people 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.250
 and I think I was well rewarded for 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.250
 it with one with quite large sounds 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.610
 ruled out evolving through a 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.239
 future I have to sit down myself 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.239
 paint your light 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:27.030
 this always and always says the 718 does not 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.130
 It will be a 4 because always 7 like you 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.150
 call and substantiate the seven questions 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.150
 more disturbing 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.000
 look and see seven because there are quite 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.040
 reasons as very special but 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:57.470
 lately because I think it's 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:57.470
 they made top 15 too long 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.700
 miserable santa 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:16.760
 777 this reason does not have to lend your 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.470
 life that does not exist until now know 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.359
 endow the videos that we have seen other 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.310
 interviews I want you to tell me your 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.510
 life on the internet as it has been like 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:32.860
 think of yourself as the constants as it was 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.860
 in such a way that you want to good 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.979

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.500
 I was I participated a lot in the 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.430
 forms of video games and there I started my 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.440
 first blog was in the year 98 in 2005 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.540

 and then in 2008 for 2009 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.449
 final natural evolution occurred 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.810
 what it is to start making videos on youtube 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:15.510

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.090
 playing to life and good the rest 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.340
