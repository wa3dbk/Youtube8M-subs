00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.679 
I we pick this up in a supply job now is
this<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.560> best<00:00:19.770> sniper<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.939> game<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.600> my

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
this the best sniper in the game in my

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.779 
this the best sniper in the game in my
opinion<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:22.320> think<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:22.949> absolutely<00:00:23.279> amazing

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
opinion I think it's absolutely amazing

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.150 
opinion I think it's absolutely amazing
ass<00:00:24.090> still<00:00:24.300> got<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.480> highest<00:00:24.660> rate<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.260> damage

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
ass still got the highest rate of damage

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.509 
ass still got the highest rate of damage
even<00:00:26.939> though<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:28.039> variation<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.340> gun

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
even though this variation of the gun

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.160 
even though this variation of the gun
actually<00:00:29.939> reduces<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.539> damage<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.869> think<00:00:31.050> by

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
actually reduces the damage I think by

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.660 
actually reduces the damage I think by
four<00:00:31.560> from<00:00:32.540> 9022<00:00:33.540> 16<00:00:34.170> not<00:00:34.770> too<00:00:34.920> sure<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
four from 9022 16 not too sure but the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.639 
four from 9022 16 not too sure but the
damage<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.090> considerably<00:00:36.809> lower<00:00:37.110> than<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
damage is considerably lower than the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.830 
damage is considerably lower than the
original<00:00:38.040> Atlas<00:00:38.430> gun<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:39.030> mobility<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.690> this

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
a two shot kill with the links is really

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.559 
a two shot kill with the links is really
really<00:02:07.799> not<00:02:08.129> like<00:02:08.250> good<00:02:08.459> on<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.970> damage<00:02:09.179> front

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:17.699 
mobility was real low but with this

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.210 
mobility was real low but with this
variation<00:03:18.209> is<00:03:18.329> absolutely<00:03:18.690> awesome<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.829> the
