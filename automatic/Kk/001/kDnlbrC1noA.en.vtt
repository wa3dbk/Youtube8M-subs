00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
pretty well brand new tires so let's see

pretty well brand new tires so let's see
if<00:01:40.380> she<00:01:40.530> runs

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.440 

we're<00:01:45.550> going<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.760> need<00:01:45.820> two<00:01:46.000> hands<00:01:46.210> for<00:01:46.330> this

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
we're going to need two hands for this

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.590 
we're going to need two hands for this
nope

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
nope

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.040 
nope
no<00:01:51.020> neutral<00:01:51.380> safety<00:01:51.500> switch<00:01:52.780> nice

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
no neutral safety switch nice

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.970 
no neutral safety switch nice
it<00:01:55.530> has<00:01:56.300> electric<00:01:57.300> fan

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.750 

which<00:02:01.070> turns<00:02:01.370> on<00:02:01.630> my<00:02:02.630> electric<00:02:02.960> switch<00:02:03.760> it's

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
which turns on my electric switch it's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.280 
which turns on my electric switch it's
still<00:02:05.120> too<00:02:05.300> cold<00:02:05.480> effort<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:05.990> get<00:02:06.110> up<00:02:06.170> to

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
still too cold effort to get up to

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.860 
still too cold effort to get up to
operating<00:02:06.590> temperature<00:02:07.120> otherwise<00:02:08.120> so<00:02:08.630> I

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:08.870 
operating temperature otherwise so I

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.480 
operating temperature otherwise so I
don't<00:02:09.500> know<00:02:09.590> if<00:02:09.680> it<00:02:09.800> actually<00:02:09.920> works<00:02:10.310> by

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
don't know if it actually works by

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.730 
don't know if it actually works by
itself<00:02:10.550> yet<00:02:12.040> it's<00:02:13.040> really<00:02:13.400> stable<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:15.620> was

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
itself yet it's really stable it was

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.820 
itself yet it's really stable it was
pretty<00:02:15.890> far<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.160> take<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.460> gas<00:02:17.260> pretty<00:02:18.260> fast<00:02:18.530> so

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
pretty far to take a gas pretty fast so

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.890 
pretty far to take a gas pretty fast so
for<00:02:19.130> our<00:02:19.220> festive<00:02:19.640> attitude<00:02:20.030> is

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.380

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
- 20s pretty high up there considering

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:41.059 
- 20s pretty high up there considering
it<00:02:28.260> says<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.860> runs<00:02:29.569> its<00:02:30.569> top<00:02:30.780> speed<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.400> 237

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.990 

it's<00:02:41.790> got<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> couple<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.330> rattles<00:02:42.690> but
