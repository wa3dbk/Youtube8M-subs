the<00:03:55.889> whole<00:03:56.040> entire<00:03:56.310> point<00:03:56.519> is<00:03:56.699> that<00:03:56.849> he

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:56.939 
the whole entire point is that he

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.699 
the whole entire point is that he
doesn't<00:03:57.150> understand<00:03:57.750> social<00:03:57.959> interactions

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709

he doesn't know what he's doing so

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.819 
he doesn't know what he's doing so
therefore<00:04:02.759> she's<00:04:03.299> good<00:04:03.509> is<00:04:03.780> teaching<00:04:04.439> him<00:04:04.620> how

problem with that argument is that you

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:09.920

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
job so she wouldn't be feeling romantic

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.289 
job so she wouldn't be feeling romantic
feelings<00:04:20.280> for<00:04:20.370> him<00:04:20.669> like<00:04:20.849> this<00:04:21.000> that'd<00:04:21.180> be

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
feelings for him like this that'd be

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.580 
feelings for him like this that'd be
just<00:04:21.479> kind<00:04:21.630> of<00:04:21.719> fucking<00:04:22.079> weird

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
just kind of fucking weird

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.320 
just kind of fucking weird
honestly<00:04:22.979> it<00:04:23.400> doesn't<00:04:23.849> make<00:04:23.940> a<00:04:23.969> whole<00:04:24.090> lot<00:04:24.150> of

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
honestly it doesn't make a whole lot of

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.029 
honestly it doesn't make a whole lot of
sense<00:04:24.510> but<00:04:25.320> you<00:04:25.440> know<00:04:25.560> what<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.740> worst<00:04:25.919> part

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
sense but you know what the worst part

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:26.990 
sense but you know what the worst part
is

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
is

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.540 
is
I<00:04:27.060> can<00:04:27.540> actually<00:04:27.780> see<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.440> I<00:04:28.770> can<00:04:29.130> see<00:04:29.400> the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
I can actually see it I can see the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.860 
I can actually see it I can see the
relationship<00:04:30.150> between<00:04:30.330> these<00:04:30.630> coupe

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
relationship between these coupe

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.870 
relationship between these coupe
characters<00:04:31.320> actually<00:04:31.530> happening<00:04:32.520> the

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
characters actually happening the

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.610 
characters actually happening the
problem<00:04:33.390> is<00:04:33.510> that<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.780> connecting<00:04:34.230> threads

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
problem is that the connecting threads

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.530 
problem is that the connecting threads
whenever<00:04:34.950> there's<00:04:35.160> a<00:04:35.220> problem<00:04:35.640> is<00:04:36.090> just<00:04:36.420> a

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
whenever there's a problem is just a

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.850 
whenever there's a problem is just a
complete<00:04:36.900> plot<00:04:37.140> device<00:04:37.380> that<00:04:37.560> comes<00:04:37.650> out<00:04:37.830> of

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
complete plot device that comes out of

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.370 
complete plot device that comes out of
fucking<00:04:38.340> nowhere<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:39.000> resolve<00:04:39.360> problems<00:04:39.630> like

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
fucking nowhere to resolve problems like

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.470 
fucking nowhere to resolve problems like
the<00:04:40.500> example<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:40.920> gave<00:04:40.980> before<00:04:41.130> when<00:04:41.910> Harv's

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
the example I gave before when Harv's

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.880 
the example I gave before when Harv's
orders<00:04:42.720> of<00:04:42.840> violence<00:04:43.170> and<00:04:43.320> gave<00:04:43.500> shoes<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.770> go

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
orders of violence and gave shoes to go

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.950 
orders of violence and gave shoes to go
bloody<00:04:44.070> nose<00:04:44.370> she<00:04:45.210> coming<00:04:45.450> you<00:04:45.540> know<00:04:45.630> shunt

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
bloody nose she coming you know shunt

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.540 
bloody nose she coming you know shunt
him<00:04:46.110> off<00:04:46.290> and<00:04:46.560> did<00:04:46.680> her<00:04:46.770> own<00:04:46.830> thing<00:04:47.190> with<00:04:47.400> their

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
him off and did her own thing with their

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.460 
him off and did her own thing with their
studying<00:04:48.030> for<00:04:48.240> a<00:04:48.270> while<00:04:48.480> but<00:04:49.320> then<00:04:49.440> the

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
studying for a while but then the

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.200 
studying for a while but then the
problem<00:04:49.800> is<00:04:49.830> she<00:04:50.040> went<00:04:50.250> back<00:04:50.670> to<00:04:50.730> him<00:04:51.060> and

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
problem is she went back to him and

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.610 
problem is she went back to him and
saying<00:04:51.420> that<00:04:51.570> she<00:04:51.720> didn't<00:04:52.020> hate<00:04:52.230> him<00:04:52.380> that

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
saying that she didn't hate him that

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.190 
saying that she didn't hate him that
doesn't<00:04:53.340> make<00:04:53.400> any<00:04:53.550> sense<00:04:53.850> because<00:04:54.390> there's

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
doesn't make any sense because there's

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.620 
doesn't make any sense because there's
nothing<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:55.530> warrant<00:04:56.160> that<00:04:56.220> feeling<00:04:56.790> of<00:04:57.060> not

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
nothing to warrant that feeling of not

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.390 
nothing to warrant that feeling of not
hating<00:04:58.080> him<00:04:58.200> after<00:04:58.440> what<00:04:58.620> he<00:04:58.740> just<00:04:58.770> did<00:04:59.160> it

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
hating him after what he just did it

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.280 
hating him after what he just did it
doesn't<00:04:59.910> work<00:05:00.120> it<00:05:00.330> doesn't<00:05:00.360> make<00:05:00.690> sense<00:05:00.720> why

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
doesn't work it doesn't make sense why

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.930 
doesn't work it doesn't make sense why
would<00:05:01.620> someone<00:05:01.890> do<00:05:02.100> that<00:05:02.130> logically<00:05:02.700> in<00:05:02.880> the

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
would someone do that logically in the

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.880 
would someone do that logically in the
reward<00:05:03.210> no<00:05:03.419> one<00:05:03.570> would<00:05:03.690> do<00:05:03.840> that<00:05:03.870> but<00:05:04.320> it<00:05:04.710> just

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
reward no one would do that but it just

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.159 
reward no one would do that but it just
doesn't<00:05:05.130> happen<00:05:05.310> that's<00:05:06.060> not<00:05:06.240> how<00:05:06.360> it<00:05:06.510> works

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
doesn't happen that's not how it works

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.460 
doesn't happen that's not how it works
it<00:05:07.470> doesn't<00:05:07.770> feel<00:05:08.010> real<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:08.790> feels<00:05:08.970> so<00:05:09.510> forced

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
it doesn't feel real it feels so forced

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.440 
it doesn't feel real it feels so forced
is<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:10.980> problem<00:05:11.400> and<00:05:11.610> that's<00:05:11.970> really<00:05:12.180> how<00:05:12.419> I

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
is the problem and that's really how I

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.030 
is the problem and that's really how I
could<00:05:12.750> sum<00:05:12.960> up<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.260> show<00:05:13.440> how<00:05:13.620> it<00:05:13.740> was<00:05:13.830> for<00:05:14.010> me

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
could sum up the show how it was for me

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.770 
could sum up the show how it was for me
for<00:05:14.280> three<00:05:14.430> episodes<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:15.120> connections<00:05:15.630> that

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
for three episodes the connections that

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.330 
for three episodes the connections that
the<00:05:15.930> characters<00:05:16.380> were<00:05:16.530> you<00:05:16.919> know<00:05:17.070> we're

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
the characters were you know we're

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.280 
the characters were you know we're
trying<00:05:17.520> to<00:05:17.760> make<00:05:17.850> the<00:05:18.240> author<00:05:18.419> was<00:05:18.660> doing<00:05:18.990> it

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
trying to make the author was doing it

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.040 
trying to make the author was doing it
just<00:05:19.500> felt<00:05:19.890> forced<00:05:20.669> if<00:05:21.270> it<00:05:21.419> wasn't<00:05:21.720> for<00:05:21.930> these

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
just felt forced if it wasn't for these

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.020 
just felt forced if it wasn't for these
characters<00:05:22.410> completely<00:05:22.590> chewing<00:05:23.130> a<00:05:23.220> 180<00:05:23.700> on

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
characters completely chewing a 180 on

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.390 
characters completely chewing a 180 on
what<00:05:24.270> they<00:05:24.390> should<00:05:24.419> logically<00:05:25.230> feel<00:05:25.590> I<00:05:25.860> feel

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
what they should logically feel I feel

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.920 
what they should logically feel I feel
like<00:05:26.550> I'd<00:05:26.669> actually<00:05:26.970> like<00:05:27.270> this<00:05:27.540> kind<00:05:27.870> of

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
like I'd actually like this kind of

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.840 
like I'd actually like this kind of
thing<00:05:28.169> you<00:05:28.410> know<00:05:28.530> this<00:05:29.160> relationship<00:05:29.640> like<00:05:29.730> I

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
thing you know this relationship like I

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.850 
thing you know this relationship like I
said<00:05:30.000> I<00:05:30.030> could<00:05:30.210> see<00:05:30.450> this<00:05:30.690> working<00:05:31.020> the

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
said I could see this working the

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.590 
said I could see this working the
problem<00:05:32.220> is<00:05:32.340> that<00:05:32.520> the<00:05:32.970> connecting<00:05:33.300> dashes

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
problem is that the connecting dashes

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.990 
problem is that the connecting dashes
don't<00:05:33.840> work<00:05:34.080> it<00:05:34.440> doesn't<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:35.340> needs<00:05:35.669> to<00:05:35.880> be

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
don't work it doesn't it needs to be

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.150 
don't work it doesn't it needs to be
done<00:05:36.300> more<00:05:36.660> naturally<00:05:37.440> this<00:05:37.620> isn't<00:05:37.950> a<00:05:38.010> very

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
done more naturally this isn't a very

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.920 
done more naturally this isn't a very
natural<00:05:38.640> relationship<00:05:39.180> right<00:05:39.360> now<00:05:39.419> it's<00:05:39.780> just

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
natural relationship right now it's just

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.590 
natural relationship right now it's just
fucking<00:05:40.410> forced<00:05:41.040> as<00:05:41.190> hell<00:05:41.490> it's<00:05:42.120> just<00:05:42.300> how<00:05:42.450> it
