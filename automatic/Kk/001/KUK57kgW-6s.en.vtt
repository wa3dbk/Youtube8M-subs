00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:21.530
 more tips and tricks video today 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.730
 again for the galaxy note 2 what 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.060
 probably this week one more 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.570
 a few will happen a few times 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.680
 features that I show you today 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:35.239
 work of my knowledge also at 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:38.000
 the galaxy s3 and that is what we want today 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.920
 a total knows just times 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.510
 I know I already have it in that 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.989
 Last tips and tricks videos said 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.120
 with the multi windows function though 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.000
 take a look at what I show now 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.620
 sit here nicely in a conference and 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.370
 talk to each other easily 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.989
 our galaxy note 2 is on the 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.129
 desk or on the 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.270
 meeting table 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.829
 and I just want to know without 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.350
 to have to pick up the phone 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.280
 how latest do I have any 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.969
 get calls or is the fat fat 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.069
 Battery is slow in the end and what am I doing 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:20.359
 Just swivel your hand 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:23.259
 look over it and see what happens 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:27.350
 that's cool 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.979
 So that's just great and the thing 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.679
 is called faster look 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:37.009
 that is so with the light and 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.270
 shows us here the missing caller ob 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.099
 the mails got what the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.429
 Battery status is and the time 

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:45.429
 so I'll show you how to activate it 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:58.020
 By simply clicking on settings 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:00.270
 go and our system and move the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.869
 of course have to move so his 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.720
 has movements and there it is 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.580
 immediately the upper quick look hook 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.360
 pure and already does this 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.940
 ingenious function so I find it easy 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.610
 Absolutely I said cool but 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.290
 I can not liberate another word like that 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.530
 that this was now a little bit 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.480
 for m 1 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.360
 I would like to give you tips and tricks video 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.830
 a few other things say 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.620
 For example, you have seen here 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.709
 Android TV now with before 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.860
 that means on the lock screen 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.470
 I have an information and where we have the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.790
 can enter or change 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.620
 I show you now also on the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:52.170
 fast and we go for it 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:55.980
 turn on settings and this time 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.720
 we'll take that lock screen here 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.170
 above 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.720
 and there is the info about the owner 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.290
 So you see android tv now in 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.680
 forum or now with forum that change 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.680
 has been 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:27.890
 new forum and now that too 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.390
 be changed 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:35.480
 there android tv now with new forums like that 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.120
 So we have a quicker look we have 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.450
 lock screen on the lock screen 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.220
 the info line changes info 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.590
 about owners it says here at the 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.829
 Samsung smartphone and I'll show you 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.170
 one more thing and if we already 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:54.319
 right now on the lock screen are 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.150
 you see the four specially here you 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.359
 Of course, you can arrange yourself 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.090
 So with the one theoretically right in 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:06.379
 the app can go and this one can 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:14.180
 So edit accordingly and 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:17.810
 While you do that na come on makes 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:21.500
 you can also do that under settings and 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.250
 turn off the lock screen and under there 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.360
 options and here again 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.270
 fast access must be accordingly 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.780
 to be a failure 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:35.030
 and there you can then according to the 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.280
 choose apps so we have now 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.180
 each plus one can have a maximum of five apps 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.960
 represent 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.849
 the high one here any arbitrary 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.289
 and we want to be at tutu 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.050
 an important thing that you also 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:52.020
 we should have fun home screen 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:55.659
 can also do that accordingly 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.550
 Arrange the we want to have them there 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.919
 Let's say that's what it's now 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.039
 we like 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:05.919
 and now gloves should be appropriate 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.809
 here in front of the lock screen as 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.089
 fast train be present 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:12.219
 another option I still have 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:14.409
 want to show is also on the 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:16.539
 lock screen and although there is a 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:19.449
 funny feature how to get into the instant 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.009
 camera comes in the case namely times 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.159
 short in the hand to show you 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:28.210
 we have to go with the thumb 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:31.689
 use and turn the phone and already 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.779
 So the camera is a funnier 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:41.199
 funny gimmick is set that 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:42.879
 whole again under the knowledge of my knowledge 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.949
 under the lock screen I look 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:48.430
 again just lock screen and 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.360
 options 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.449
 and then it should and how camera 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:58.209
 quicklaunch be had here so 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:00.580
 camera quick access and then you go 

00:05:58.209 --> 00:06:01.839
 this funny gimmick if you like 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.110
 pushes it with the thumb and that 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:07.509
 phone turns because the camera immediately 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.490
 is set is of course not 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.740
 mandatory if I already have an app here 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.749
 on it but absolutely necessary but it 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.539
 is a fun gimmick and I wanted 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:20.409
 it has shown you just anyway the 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:22.990
 were so rough in a few extra 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:25.629
 tips and tricks for the galaxy note 2 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:29.709
 of my knowledge works for that, too 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:32.409
 galaxy s3 this function with the 

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:34.949
 quick access and the lock screen 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:37.180
 info parts 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:39.009
 that should have been first to 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.349
 this place with the tips and tricks 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.120
 videos of me with jackson for android 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:45.159
 tv see you soon in one 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.529
 another 17 ticks video because I think 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:49.569
 for the galaxy note 2 there we still have 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:50.889
 some things in your stock 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:54.030
 until then 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.030
 until the next video 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.210
 but
