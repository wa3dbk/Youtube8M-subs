detail on how we get this thing
assembled<00:01:24.650> in<00:01:25.650> our<00:01:26.189> high<00:01:26.369> plank<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:28.380> have

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
assembled in our high plank you have

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.700 
assembled in our high plank you have
this<00:01:28.710> nice<00:01:28.920> channel<00:01:29.430> here<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.530> run<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
this nice channel here you can run a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.929 
this nice channel here you can run a
carriage<00:01:32.070> bolt<00:01:32.310> three-eighths<00:01:32.700> inch

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
carriage bolt three-eighths inch

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.240 
carriage bolt three-eighths inch
carriage<00:01:33.869> bolt<00:01:33.960> down<00:01:35.060> this

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.560 

so<00:01:40.250> they<00:01:40.490> line<00:01:40.670> up<00:01:40.850> with<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.030> holes<00:01:41.150> in<00:01:41.510> the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
so they line up with the holes in the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.610 
so they line up with the holes in the
steel<00:01:41.930> well<00:01:42.170> in<00:01:42.380> here<00:01:43.900> and<00:01:44.900> I<00:01:44.990> got<00:01:45.200> one<00:01:45.440> that

Yang's there that it hits the covers the
T<00:03:39.930> channels<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:41.640> high<00:03:41.790> plank<00:03:42.290> so<00:03:43.290> that

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
T channels and the high plank so that

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.000 
T channels and the high plank so that
the<00:03:44.660> armor<00:03:45.660> grinding<00:03:46.020> can't<00:03:46.620> slide<00:03:46.980> up<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:49.010> give

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.540 

I<00:04:02.599> had<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:03.290> outside<00:04:03.650> just<00:04:03.920> a<00:04:04.040> few<00:04:04.190> minutes<00:04:04.430> ago

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
I had it outside just a few minutes ago

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.089 
I had it outside just a few minutes ago
I<00:04:04.700> was<00:04:04.790> taking<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.120> picture<00:04:05.360> in<00:04:05.629> the<00:04:05.720> snow

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
I was taking a picture in the snow

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:28.250 
I was taking a picture in the snow
swiping<00:04:07.099> it<00:04:07.190> off<00:04:07.310> at<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.610> paper<00:04:07.790> towel

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.940 

all<00:04:28.710> of<00:04:28.980> our<00:04:29.100> leg<00:04:29.250> assemblies<00:04:29.940> are<00:04:30.560> TIG<00:04:31.560> welded

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
all of our leg assemblies are TIG welded

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:39.890 
all of our leg assemblies are TIG welded
so<00:04:32.160> it<00:04:32.460> has<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.790> real<00:04:33.090> nice<00:04:33.360> look<00:04:33.720> in<00:04:33.840> weld<00:04:38.900> very

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
so it has a real nice look in weld very

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.730 
so it has a real nice look in weld very
strong<00:04:40.200> too

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.159 

now<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.830> boxcar<00:04:48.340> is<00:04:48.550> 96<00:04:49.360> inches<00:04:49.630> long<00:04:49.840> 8<00:04:50.139> feet

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
now the boxcar is 96 inches long 8 feet

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:58.439 
now the boxcar is 96 inches long 8 feet
and<00:04:52.199> the<00:04:53.199> top<00:04:53.470> on<00:04:53.800> it<00:04:53.830> is<00:04:56.069> 12<00:04:57.069> inches<00:04:57.160> wide<00:04:57.580> with

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
and the top on it is 12 inches wide with

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.559 
and the top on it is 12 inches wide with
the<00:04:58.630> copings<00:04:59.110> it<00:04:59.919> comes<00:05:00.160> out<00:05:00.340> to<00:05:00.520> be<00:05:00.669> between

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
the copings it comes out to be between

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:03.689 
the copings it comes out to be between
15<00:05:02.020> and<00:05:02.050> 16<00:05:02.560> inches<00:05:02.860> i<00:05:02.979> think<00:05:03.190> it's<00:05:03.310> closer<00:05:03.550> to

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
15 and 16 inches i think it's closer to

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:10.070 
15 and 16 inches i think it's closer to
15<00:05:04.180> arm<00:05:05.009> and<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:07.240> end<00:05:07.360> plates<00:05:07.630> we<00:05:07.900> waterjet

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
15 arm and the end plates we waterjet

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:17.390 
15 arm and the end plates we waterjet
get<00:05:11.080> a<00:05:11.110> little<00:05:11.289> nice<00:05:11.410> contour<00:05:11.979> look<00:05:12.220> in<00:05:12.340> there

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.039 

and<00:05:18.400> there<00:05:18.550> you<00:05:18.639> have<00:05:18.699> it<00:05:19.530> that's<00:05:20.530> our<00:05:20.710> boxcar
