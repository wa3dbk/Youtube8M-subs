00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.340
 portal glass and finger all mobile 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.700
 entertainment on glafi.com question about 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.700
 rub 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:26.720
 so hello everyone with you yes eye 73 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.050
 and today we look at the British 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.510
 heavy tank level 6 churchill 7 this 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.280
 the tank has one of the lowest silhouettes 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.520
 what in the def allows you to hide behind 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.230
 small stones at home or cars also he 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.080
 has enough strength 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.420
 as much as one thousand one hundred points and his frontal 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.489
 armor is 152 millimeters 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.100
 which means that when properly dorothy and 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.750
 it is quite difficult to break in the same 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.670
 I want to talk about his main 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.620
 features this quick-fire gun 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.260
 which allows you to keep your 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.089
 opponents on the harp while on the help 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.070
 only repair kit can come 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.960
 thanks to his rate of fire and 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.210
 small caliber he can criticize 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.000
 modules to break both the tower and the gun 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.310
 set fire and so on with little to 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.170
 love he has a huge ammunition 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.000
 which allows you to carry land mines 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.100
 for enemy harps and under and 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.049
 shoot opponents perfectly when 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.740
 this is not stint on the shells out 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.420
 equipment 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.049
 I chose the medium gunner 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.270
 caliber reinforced aiming drives and 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:31.460
 ventilation but we'll talk about the rest 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.930
 in battle this tank is very slow him 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.450
 maximum speed is about 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.430
 twenty kilometers per hour with this player 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.229
 should immediately predict the likelihood 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.509
 direction of the enemy and meet him 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.810
 crashing so how to maneuver from the flank to 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.880
 flank we just won't have time it 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.799
 long building and tower location 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.409
 the center plays deadly for him 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.780
 consequences when leaving the sides as when 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.179
 This glows half corners corners 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.829
 vertical hovering are just awful 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.780
 because sometimes you have to shine 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.689
 half body when shooting from a hill 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.700
 or when entering the hill with the best 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.850
 surface of the battle for churchill 7 is 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.009
 plain small damage shoes 160 units 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.320
 allows you to fire only in one 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.180
 sequences in fire modules 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.270
 the enemy as if dismantling the tank 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.530
 also he is well criticized in pieces 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.200
 stern and in board 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.450
 there he is n and the way not 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.370
 it is worth substituting your engine and 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.610
 ammunition becomes local places 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.190
 for the opponent 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.290
 tactics are different it all depends on 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.430
 teams from which place 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.070
 are you 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.700
 and generally from the situation in the game first 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.490
 tactics 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.980
 this defense tactic start every fight 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.920
 from this tactic choose one of 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.410
 possible directions the second tactic is 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.360
 pushing one of the flanks of this 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.820
 tactics should be used when you 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.830
 hit the top of the list choose any of 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.530
 flanks on which you can go and 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.680
 gradually move tactically 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.660
 firing all support tactics then 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.570
 used only when you 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.270
 you are at the bottom of the list then you 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.760
 should go along with tanks 8 and 7 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.690
 level and help them harbor the enemy and 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.520
 shoot him 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.040
 its main feature is 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.020
 surely rate of fire you can 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.360
 disassemble virtually any tank of the sixth 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.790
 level in a duel some even sometimes 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.520
 four shots are enough even 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.300
 others need two three shots 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.489
 then you order in 5 6 but it happens 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.580
 faster with your rate of fire 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:36.570
 in general if you plan on playing on 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.150
 churchill 7 your main game is df you 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.370
 can disassemble your opponent without 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.519
 problems, let's consider all the advantages 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.390
 and cons of this car to the pros you can 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.060
 carry 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.940
 very tight and the reservation is very 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.220
 large amount of hp high damage in 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.860
 minute to minus slow speed 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.019
 wide body poor turning 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.690
 terrible declination angle of the gun 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.820
 but on this I say goodbye to you all 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.560
