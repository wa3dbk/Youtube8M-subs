00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.640 
usually as far as hooks go and then
usually<00:03:02.269> I<00:03:02.299> also<00:03:02.510> put<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.840> bobber<00:03:03.079> on<00:03:03.319> the<00:03:03.409> top

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
usually I also put a bobber on the top

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.500 
usually I also put a bobber on the top
now<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.519> don't<00:03:04.760> always<00:03:04.970> have<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.269> use<00:03:05.480> a

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
now you don't always have to use a

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.349 
now you don't always have to use a
bobber<00:03:05.840> when<00:03:06.079> you're<00:03:06.170> fishing<00:03:06.439> for<00:03:06.470> panfish<00:03:06.829> I

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
bobber when you're fishing for panfish I

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.300 
bobber when you're fishing for panfish I
like<00:03:08.359> doing<00:03:08.659> it<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:09.290> begin<00:03:09.469> with<00:03:09.650> because<00:03:10.189> I

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
like doing it to begin with because I

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.099 
like doing it to begin with because I
can<00:03:10.459> see<00:03:10.609> where<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.819> fish<00:03:10.969> are<00:03:11.120> located<00:03:11.689> I<00:03:11.840> can

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
can see where the fish are located I can

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.890 
can see where the fish are located I can
let<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.409> bobber<00:03:12.620> drift<00:03:13.519> downstream<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.389> once

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
let the bobber drift downstream and once

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.849 
let the bobber drift downstream and once
I<00:03:15.079> get<00:03:15.319> it

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
I get it

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.770 
I get it
pinpointed<00:03:16.670> where<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.909> fish<00:03:17.120> are<00:03:17.299> then<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.629> can

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
pinpointed where the fish are then I can

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.240 
pinpointed where the fish are then I can
take<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.079> bobber<00:03:18.290> off<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.769> fish<00:03:18.889> a<00:03:18.919> little

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
take the bobber off and fish a little

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.390 
take the bobber off and fish a little
closer<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.359> bottom<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.980> problem<00:03:22.310> with

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
closer to the bottom the problem with

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.559 
closer to the bottom the problem with
that<00:03:22.430> of<00:03:22.519> course<00:03:22.639> is<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.090> get<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.239> few<00:03:23.450> more

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
that of course is you get a few more

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.659 
that of course is you get a few more
snags<00:03:23.959> but<00:03:24.169> it<00:03:24.530> can<00:03:24.650> actually<00:03:24.769> pay<00:03:25.129> off<00:03:25.340> and

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
snags but it can actually pay off and

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:36.410 
snags but it can actually pay off and
you<00:03:26.120> can<00:03:26.239> take<00:03:26.389> home<00:03:26.569> more<00:03:26.750> fish

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.170

and put them in the bucket and then I'll
see<00:03:44.850> if<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:45.030> can<00:03:45.240> fill<00:03:45.420> it<00:03:45.510> up<00:03:45.569> again<00:03:45.750> I'm
