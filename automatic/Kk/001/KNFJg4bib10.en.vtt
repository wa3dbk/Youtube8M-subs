00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.449 
pressing don't continue to increase your
pressure<00:04:01.049> on<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.290> brake<00:04:01.469> keep<00:04:02.069> it<00:04:02.219> where<00:04:02.370> that

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
pressure on the brake keep it where that

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.759 
pressure on the brake keep it where that
because<00:04:03.030> eventually<00:04:03.959> you'll<00:04:04.379> get<00:04:04.499> to<00:04:04.650> where

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
because eventually you'll get to where

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.369 
because eventually you'll get to where
you<00:04:04.859> can<00:04:05.040> judge<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:06.120> know<00:04:06.269> this<00:04:06.989> amount<00:04:07.349> of

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
you can judge you know this amount of

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.020 
you can judge you know this amount of
brake<00:04:07.590> is<00:04:07.859> going<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.129> get<00:04:08.250> me<00:04:08.340> stopped<00:04:08.639> by<00:04:08.969> this

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
brake is going to get me stopped by this

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.080 
brake is going to get me stopped by this
point<00:04:09.500> okay<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.680> then<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:11.549> can<00:04:11.730> make<00:04:11.849> the

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
point okay and then you can make the

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.240 
point okay and then you can make the
judgment<00:04:12.599> you<00:04:13.079> know<00:04:13.379> do<00:04:13.650> I<00:04:13.680> need<00:04:13.829> more<00:04:13.980> brake

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
judgment you know do I need more brake

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.670 
judgment you know do I need more brake
or<00:04:14.400> less<00:04:14.549> brake<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.930> part<00:04:16.289> of<00:04:16.349> the<00:04:16.410> reason<00:04:16.590> you

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
or less brake and part of the reason you

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.240 
or less brake and part of the reason you
don't<00:04:16.799> pulse

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
don't pulse

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.110 
don't pulse

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
you don't push down push down it's hard

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.600 
you don't push down push down it's hard
