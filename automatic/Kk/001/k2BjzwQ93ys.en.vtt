00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.919
 very fresh with the Peruvian ceviche the 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:28.569
 course this grilled chick that 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.550
 let's prepare with a marinade 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.569
 very good and very simple if you want to 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.280
 look like we 're going straight to the 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:36.010
 ingredients for you at home 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.850
 take note for this marinated chicken let's go 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.690
 to need 12 pieces of chicken half 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.079
 cup of soy sauce a can of beer 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.140
 dark half cup of mashed sugar 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.899
 a lemon just the zest an orange 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.449
 just the zest two teaspoons of 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.499
 chopped ginger 2 cloves of garlic 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:02.110
 crushed a lemon just the juice two 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:05.680
 chopped jalapeño peppers 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.320
 salt to taste and well then if they want 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.900
 accompany with some rich tea this rich 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.760
 chick can be with white rice and that 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.110
 the truth is that this chick to me 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.110
 like it a lot because it's pretty 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.760
 light and with a lot of flavor like that is 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.070
 Well, well let's start with 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.290
 prepare our marinade that good then 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.550
 As you know, it will only be integrated 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.340
 all the ingredients 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.080
 this way has a lot of favor if not 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.990
 has for example some people with the 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.460
 ginger that later do not put it if 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.869
 They try to put all our the 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.580
 ingredients although definitions of that 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.619
 I tell myself that it gives a very 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.780
 special the way to look great 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.979
 so it's worth the soy sauce the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.280
 we put here 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.040
 the dark beer we are also going to 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.220
 add the purchase just a few cans 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.050
 one or two cans there is a supermarket 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.030
 dark beer for this marinade and 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.100
 then get good sugar 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.450
 The finished sugar is mashed 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.170
 we put in addition that he will give you a 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.890
 little flavor goes 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.720
 that caramelized color to the chick that goes 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.119
 to look great and it's going to be like a lot 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.640
 higher jable important points for 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.569
 the grill is good because the main thing is 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.689
 that we avoid 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.420
 that we bite the meat many times what 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.010
 What we do is chop the meat trying 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.620
 to absorb a little more the marinade 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.540
 upside down instead of absorbing the 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.420
 marinated the only thing we do is make 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.549
 is play then let's avoid please the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.379
 be chopping the meat even if it's the 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.810
 chicken even if it's beef whatever 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:38.290
 try not to do it and something also 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.620
 very important is to place the 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.329
 grilled pieces little by little and good 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.480
 Well, the first ones you have to cook 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:49.359
 is the pork meat the chicken and the meat 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.329
 of beef and of course and then later 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:55.510
 They may be the last of things like 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.159
 chorizo sausage or things 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.379
 cook much faster because 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.329
 put them to the last and well then 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:05.349
 of course something very important in the 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:07.329
 part of the chicken is that the flattened chicken 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.650
 works very well on chicken breast 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.439
 flattening works very well for 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.030
 grilled if we have the pieces of 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.919
 chicken how are we going to do here in the 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.239
 program today is maybe going 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:18.520
 to take a little bit cooking 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.830
 inside then we have to the best 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.260
 do it inside the house in a pan 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.870
 where we can cover it so that it 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.000
 Concentrate heat and cook well 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.310
 well inside especially when they are 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.680
 pretty thick pieces and you're like 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.330
 suddenly the breast that is a bit thick 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.130
 or the bust a bit successful 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.560
 suddenly we can take us so it's that 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.120
 eye nothing else with that if they are going to do it 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.400
 the garden on the grid after 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.980
 do it with flattened breast we're going to 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.840
 put a little salt just now 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.240
 we have here our mixture of the 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.820
 marinated ideally of course is 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.900
 put chicken pieces or breasts 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.900
 to flat 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.069
 for about half an hour 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.379
 let's go varnished with the marinade 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.360
 little by little our chicken and this is going 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.390
 help also to give it enough heat and 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.150
 of color of course not heat color and 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.209
 Well, let's go here to put a 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.440
 little bit of oil in this game and 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.819
 is doing us inside the house 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.340
 inside the house can be perfect 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:22.780
 lady and nothing else here a little 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.750
 of oil and we're going to put our 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.450
 pieces over medium heat if they are 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.340
 doing here in the kitchen and they are not going to 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.130
 cover over medium heat please 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.530
 so that it is finished cooking inside 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.560
 especially the chicken let's go 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.919
 putting nothing else with a brush 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.229
 let's try to continually put a little 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.270
 more of the marinade but with a brush 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.760
 nothing more with a 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.480
 with a spoon I'm putting a little 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.480
 more of the marinade 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.980
 in addition that it is impregnated 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.110
 little bit more and it will also be 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.420
 good color and good taste 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.190
 let's wait a few minutes and then 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.710
 what do you think if we hope here that 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.630
 our chick is well well golden 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.550
 on one side and then turn it over 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.170
 next and good then while we 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.330
 we go all the tenth a commercial cut 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.030
 New lady deserves to be done because no 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.190
 We are with this chicken poultry and 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.390
 of course with that pineapple country that does not 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.650
 can be lost so we're going a 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.650
 cut we go back 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.639
 step by step chicken marina grid 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.740
 in the chicken pieces with all the 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.480
 Ingredients for 30 minutes heated 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.950
 a grill or pan type grill and 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.810
 place the pieces varnishing 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.370
 constantly with the marinade and giving 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.380
 turns cooking until the pieces 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.220
 they are cooked served by accompanying 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.220
 white rice
