pedals and stuff and getting my legs

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.410 
pedals and stuff and getting my legs
around<00:06:47.550> the<00:06:47.760> steering<00:06:47.970> wheel<00:06:48.180> would<00:06:48.270> be<00:06:48.390> a

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420 
around the steering wheel would be a

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.470 
around the steering wheel would be a
little<00:06:48.660> a<00:06:49.190> little<00:06:50.190> shaky<00:06:50.700> but<00:06:50.730> we'll<00:06:51.270> see<00:06:51.450> how

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480 
little a little shaky but we'll see how

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.950 
little a little shaky but we'll see how
big<00:06:52.140> it<00:06:52.230> looks<00:06:52.410> you<00:06:52.500> can<00:06:52.650> kind<00:06:52.860> of<00:06:52.920> see<00:06:53.100> there

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
big it looks you can kind of see there

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.910 
big it looks you can kind of see there
compared<00:06:54.960> to<00:06:55.050> the<00:06:55.170> engine<00:06:55.410> anyway<00:06:55.620> so<00:06:56.000> but<00:06:57.000> man

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:57.920 
compared to the engine anyway so but man

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.530 
compared to the engine anyway so but man
can't<00:06:58.920> go<00:06:59.070> wrong<00:06:59.250> so<00:06:59.640> I<00:06:59.670> mean<00:06:59.940> it's<00:07:00.150> just<00:07:00.240> I

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.540 
can't go wrong so I mean it's just I

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.030 
can't go wrong so I mean it's just I
don't<00:07:00.630> know<00:07:00.780> what<00:07:01.020> kind<00:07:01.260> of<00:07:01.320> go<00:07:01.440> kart<00:07:01.710> it<00:07:01.800> is<00:07:01.920> I

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.040 
don't know what kind of go kart it is I

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.980 
don't know what kind of go kart it is I
don't<00:07:02.100> know<00:07:02.280> if<00:07:02.400> somebody<00:07:02.810> hacked<00:07:03.810> it

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
don't know if somebody hacked it

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.570 
don't know if somebody hacked it
together<00:07:04.290> or<00:07:04.530> what<00:07:04.710> but<00:07:04.890> I<00:07:04.950> mean<00:07:05.130> it<00:07:05.250> looks<00:07:05.430> all

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
together or what but I mean it looks all

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.240 
together or what but I mean it looks all
pretty<00:07:06.140> it's<00:07:07.140> got<00:07:07.290> the<00:07:07.410> factory<00:07:07.740> mount<00:07:07.980> plant

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
pretty it's got the factory mount plant

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.860 
pretty it's got the factory mount plant
plate<00:07:08.760> back<00:07:08.940> there<00:07:09.120> so<00:07:09.300> I<00:07:09.330> mean<00:07:09.510> it's<00:07:09.630> got<00:07:09.780> to

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:09.870 
plate back there so I mean it's got to

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.600 
plate back there so I mean it's got to
be<00:07:09.960> some<00:07:10.140> kind<00:07:10.290> of<00:07:10.410> maybe<00:07:10.910> 80<00:07:11.910> s<00:07:12.090> go<00:07:12.300> kart<00:07:13.610> maybe

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
be some kind of maybe 80 s go kart maybe

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.200 
be some kind of maybe 80 s go kart maybe
early<00:07:14.970> 90s<00:07:15.360> who<00:07:15.450> knows<00:07:15.660> so<00:07:16.610> anyways<00:07:17.610> I've<00:07:18.030> got

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.210 
early 90s who knows so anyways I've got

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.970 
early 90s who knows so anyways I've got
some<00:07:18.360> projects<00:07:18.840> now<00:07:19.020> I'll<00:07:19.230> get<00:07:19.380> her<00:07:19.500> get<00:07:19.890> it

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:19.980 
some projects now I'll get her get it

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.430 
some projects now I'll get her get it
going<00:07:20.250> and<00:07:20.510> this<00:07:21.510> sucker<00:07:21.750> ought<00:07:22.020> to<00:07:22.110> be<00:07:22.200> fast

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 
going and this sucker ought to be fast

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.500 
going and this sucker ought to be fast
it's<00:07:22.680> a<00:07:22.740> lot<00:07:22.920> I<00:07:23.250> got<00:07:23.730> a<00:07:23.760> two-seater<00:07:24.240> and<00:07:24.420> it's

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:24.510 
it's a lot I got a two-seater and it's

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.090 
it's a lot I got a two-seater and it's
this<00:07:24.750> is<00:07:24.930> a<00:07:24.960> lot<00:07:25.200> less<00:07:25.410> wide<00:07:25.650> so<00:07:25.890> it'll<00:07:26.070> be

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.100 
this is a lot less wide so it'll be

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.790 
this is a lot less wide so it'll be
easier<00:07:26.460> to<00:07:26.490> to<00:07:27.480> go<00:07:27.630> I<00:07:27.660> think<00:07:27.870> between<00:07:28.320> all<00:07:28.530> the

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 
easier to to go I think between all the

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.380 
easier to to go I think between all the
stuff<00:07:29.010> for<00:07:29.160> Herod<00:07:29.730> I<00:07:29.790> mean<00:07:29.910> I<00:07:29.970> got<00:07:30.120> a<00:07:30.150> pretty

stuff for Herod I mean I got a pretty
big<00:07:30.570> guard<00:07:30.810> here<00:07:31.020> you<00:07:31.080> can<00:07:31.230> see<00:07:31.410> goes<00:07:31.590> all<00:07:31.770> the

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 
big guard here you can see goes all the

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.220 
big guard here you can see goes all the
way<00:07:31.920> back<00:07:31.950> there<00:07:32.310> so<00:07:32.720> plenty<00:07:33.720> of<00:07:33.780> room<00:07:33.930> to<00:07:33.960> ride

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.230 
way back there so plenty of room to ride

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.200 
way back there so plenty of room to ride
it<00:07:34.410> I<00:07:34.590> just<00:07:35.250> I<00:07:35.370> don't<00:07:35.430> want<00:07:35.670> to<00:07:35.730> turn<00:07:35.820> my<00:07:36.000> yard
