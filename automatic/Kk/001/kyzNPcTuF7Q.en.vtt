other<00:01:42.759> thing<00:01:42.940> is<00:01:43.060> very<00:01:43.270> important<00:01:43.780> with

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
other thing is very important with

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.660 
other thing is very important with
spinning<00:01:44.440> wheels<00:01:44.649> on<00:01:44.830> large<00:01:45.039> fish<00:01:45.340> is<00:01:45.520> that

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
spinning wheels on large fish is that

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.180 
spinning wheels on large fish is that
use<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.300> belt<00:01:46.690> with<00:01:47.020> a<00:01:47.320> gimbal<00:01:47.619> so<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:47.979> rod

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
use a belt with a gimbal so the rod

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.010 
use a belt with a gimbal so the rod
needs<00:01:48.399> to<00:01:48.550> have<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:48.729> gimbal<00:01:49.060> otherwise<00:01:49.690> the

having a gimbal on the rod and a belt

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.219 
having a gimbal on the rod and a belt
you're<00:01:55.869> able<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.259> hold<00:01:57.160> it<00:01:57.340> solid<00:01:58.050> not<00:01:59.050> have

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
you're able to hold it solid not have

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.310 
you're able to hold it solid not have
that<00:01:59.380> real<00:02:00.130> flipping<00:02:00.640> back<00:02:00.819> and<00:02:00.849> forth<00:02:01.060> on

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.570 

very<00:02:06.320> important<00:02:06.800> thing<00:02:06.950> with<00:02:07.100> spinning<00:02:07.400> reels

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
very important thing with spinning reels

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.210 
very important thing with spinning reels
is<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.940> line<00:02:08.210> lines<00:02:08.899> level<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:09.710> when<00:02:10.070> we're

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
is the line lines level and when we're

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.699 
is the line lines level and when we're
fishing<00:02:10.580> there<00:02:10.670> is<00:02:10.759> 80<00:02:11.000> pound<00:02:11.470> super<00:02:12.470> braid

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
fishing there is 80 pound super braid

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.610 
fishing there is 80 pound super braid
Spector<00:02:13.340> line<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:14.020> we<00:02:15.020> found<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.440> the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
Spector line and we found that the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.050 
Spector line and we found that the
spectrum<00:02:16.040> line<00:02:16.220> is<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.400> beautiful<00:02:16.850> thing<00:02:16.880> to

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
spectrum line is a beautiful thing to

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.820
