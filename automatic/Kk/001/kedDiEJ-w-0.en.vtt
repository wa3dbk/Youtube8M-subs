00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
here that was sagging like that and I

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.800 
here that was sagging like that and I
cut<00:01:15.720> him<00:01:15.810> short<00:01:16.159> because<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.610> know<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.600> thing

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
I was worried about was these little

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.649 
I was worried about was these little
birds<00:01:20.250> they're<00:01:20.490> gonna<00:01:20.610> crawl<00:01:21.150> through<00:01:21.390> here

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
birds they're gonna crawl through here

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.270 
birds they're gonna crawl through here
the<00:01:21.780> wrong<00:01:21.930> way<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.350> fall<00:01:22.619> into<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> loop<00:01:23.130> and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the wrong way and fall into the loop and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.980 
the wrong way and fall into the loop and
die<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.820> stink<00:01:24.150> up<00:01:24.270> my<00:01:24.420> house<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.869> whatever

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
die and stink up my house and whatever

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.070 
die and stink up my house and whatever
so<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:26.150> bought<00:01:27.150> these<00:01:27.360> things<00:01:27.659> which<00:01:27.840> I'm<00:01:27.960> gonna

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
so I bought these things which I'm gonna

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.719 
so I bought these things which I'm gonna
put<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> outside<00:01:28.770> later<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:29.579> I

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
put on the outside later but for now I

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.810 
put on the outside later but for now I
figured<00:01:30.509> I'd<00:01:30.600> shove<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.110> there<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:32.670> keep

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
figured I'd shove it in there to keep

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.460 
figured I'd shove it in there to keep
the<00:01:32.970> birds<00:01:33.180> from<00:01:33.299> coming<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.810> way<00:01:36.380> get<00:01:37.380> up
