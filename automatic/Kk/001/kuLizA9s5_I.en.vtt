00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
going to add half of my cooked haddock

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.880 
going to add half of my cooked haddock
that's<00:01:50.159> now<00:01:50.369> cut<00:01:50.670> into<00:01:51.060> flaky<00:01:51.450> pieces<00:01:51.899> so

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
that's now cut into flaky pieces so

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.969 
that's now cut into flaky pieces so
that's<00:01:53.070> going<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.369> go<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.520> next<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.860> then<00:01:55.860> i'm

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
that's going to go in next and then i'm

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.709 
that's going to go in next and then i'm
going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.340> wait<00:01:56.549> for<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:56.969> come<00:01:57.240> up

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
going to just wait for that to come up

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:06.380 
going to just wait for that to come up
to<00:01:58.049> simmering<00:01:58.469> point<00:02:04.939> just<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.119> allow<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
to simmering point just to allow the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.639 
to simmering point just to allow the
thickening<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.469> do<00:02:08.429> its<00:02:08.580> work<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.060> then<00:02:09.649> just

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
thickening to do its work and then just

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.290 
thickening to do its work and then just
let<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.950> come<00:02:11.190> up<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> gentle<00:02:11.879> simmering

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
let that come up to a gentle simmering

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.330 
let that come up to a gentle simmering
point<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.900> turn

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
point in turn

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.100 
point in turn
heat<00:02:13.550> off<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:13.790> that's<00:02:14.120> going<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.390> now<00:02:14.599> go<00:02:14.870> into

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
heat off and that's going to now go into

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.860 
heat off and that's going to now go into
a<00:02:15.260> blender<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.950> be<00:02:16.849> blended<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.450> smooth

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
a blender and be blended to a smooth

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.809 
a blender and be blended to a smooth
puree<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:18.530> we'll<00:02:18.890> just<00:02:18.920> pop<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.310> into<00:02:19.640> the

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
puree so we'll just pop that into the

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:27.130 
puree so we'll just pop that into the
blender<00:02:19.970> now<00:02:25.120> stand<00:02:26.120> well<00:02:26.330> back<00:02:26.360> case<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.019> get

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
blender now stand well back case you get

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.339 
blender now stand well back case you get
splashed<00:02:27.470> that's<00:02:28.069> it<00:02:28.420> lid<00:02:29.420> on<00:02:29.629> and<00:02:29.840> then<00:02:30.200> we'll

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
splashed that's it lid on and then we'll

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:41.250 
splashed that's it lid on and then we'll
just<00:02:30.530> blend<00:02:30.739> it

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.960 

now<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.410> should<00:02:42.560> be<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.710> nice<00:02:42.920> smooth<00:02:43.550> puree

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
now that should be a nice smooth puree

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.350 
now that should be a nice smooth puree
I'll<00:02:44.450> pop<00:02:44.960> it<00:02:45.080> back<00:02:45.110> into<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.740> saucepan<00:02:46.360> and

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
I'll pop it back into the saucepan and

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.530 
I'll pop it back into the saucepan and
at<00:02:48.080> this<00:02:48.170> stage<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.500> need<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.040> taste<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.610> to

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
at this stage you need to taste it to

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.040 
at this stage you need to taste it to
check<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.930> seasoning<00:02:52.180> it's<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.270> nice<00:02:53.420> smooth

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
check the seasoning it's a nice smooth

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.460 
check the seasoning it's a nice smooth
puree<00:02:54.470> there<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.460> I<00:02:56.270> think<00:02:56.360> that<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.410> is

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
puree there and I think that this is

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.290 
puree there and I think that this is
nice<00:02:57.770> if<00:02:58.070> it's<00:02:58.310> enhanced<00:02:58.910> with<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.060> bit<00:02:59.180> of

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
nice if it's enhanced with a bit of

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.230 
nice if it's enhanced with a bit of
lemon<00:02:59.570> juice<00:02:59.600> about<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.730> dessert<00:03:01.730> spoon<00:03:02.030> full

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
lemon juice about a dessert spoon full

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.730 
lemon juice about a dessert spoon full
of<00:03:02.270> lemon<00:03:02.660> juice<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:05.020> then<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.170> rest<00:03:06.350> of<00:03:06.650> the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
of lemon juice and then the rest of the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.320 
of lemon juice and then the rest of the
smoked<00:03:07.010> haddock<00:03:07.280> goes<00:03:07.760> in<00:03:07.970> in<00:03:08.120> nice<00:03:08.300> little

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
smoked haddock goes in in nice little

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:17.620 
smoked haddock goes in in nice little
chunks<00:03:09.080> like<00:03:09.290> this<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:15.790> then<00:03:16.790> just<00:03:17.030> breed<00:03:17.330> up

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
chunks like this and then just breed up

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.560 
chunks like this and then just breed up
to<00:03:18.020> a<00:03:18.200> gentle<00:03:18.770> simmer<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:19.970> reason<00:03:20.390> that<00:03:20.420> I

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
to a gentle simmer and the reason that I

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.260 
to a gentle simmer and the reason that I
want<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:20.960> to<00:03:20.990> be<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.410> gentle<00:03:22.010> simmer<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.580> because

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
want it to be a gentle simmer is because

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.600 
want it to be a gentle simmer is because
the<00:03:23.450> next<00:03:23.660> ingredient<00:03:23.990> is<00:03:24.860> going<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.310> be<00:03:25.430> an

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
the next ingredient is going to be an

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.120 
the next ingredient is going to be an
egg<00:03:25.880> this<00:03:26.180> is<00:03:26.330> smoked<00:03:26.900> haddock<00:03:27.290> chowder<00:03:27.410> with

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
egg this is smoked haddock chowder with

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.400 
egg this is smoked haddock chowder with
a<00:03:28.160> poached<00:03:28.520> egg<00:03:28.690> now<00:03:29.690> if<00:03:29.930> you're<00:03:30.110> not<00:03:30.230> familiar

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
a poached egg now if you're not familiar

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.860 
a poached egg now if you're not familiar
with<00:03:30.890> poaching<00:03:31.160> eggs<00:03:31.490> by<00:03:31.760> just<00:03:32.060> flopping<00:03:32.570> them

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
with poaching eggs by just flopping them

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.510 
with poaching eggs by just flopping them
straight<00:03:33.200> into<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.590> liquid<00:03:33.830> which<00:03:34.130> I<00:03:34.250> think's

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
straight into the liquid which I think's

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.700 
straight into the liquid which I think's
the<00:03:34.550> best<00:03:34.790> way<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.480> poach<00:03:35.660> them<00:03:35.990> don't<00:03:36.560> worry

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 
the best way to poach them don't worry

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.800 
the best way to poach them don't worry
about<00:03:36.860> it<00:03:37.280> it's<00:03:37.490> quite<00:03:37.820> easy<00:03:37.850> but<00:03:38.660> there<00:03:38.780> is

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
about it it's quite easy but there is

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.660 
about it it's quite easy but there is
one<00:03:39.020> important<00:03:39.470> thing<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.680> remember<00:03:39.800> and<00:03:40.370> that

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
one important thing to remember and that

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.400 
one important thing to remember and that
is<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.000> liquid<00:03:41.210> must<00:03:41.630> only<00:03:41.840> come<00:03:42.170> up<00:03:42.290> to

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
is the liquid must only come up to

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.050 
is the liquid must only come up to
simmering<00:03:42.800> point<00:03:43.070> now<00:03:43.550> if<00:03:43.610> you<00:03:43.700> have<00:03:43.820> it<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.030> a

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
simmering point now if you have it to a

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.210 
simmering point now if you have it to a
strong<00:03:44.480> rolling<00:03:44.900> boil<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:45.530> you<00:03:45.770> pop<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.100> egg

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
strong rolling boil and you pop the egg

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.130 
strong rolling boil and you pop the egg
into<00:03:46.459> that<00:03:46.790> it'll<00:03:47.120> just<00:03:47.300> disintegrate<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.020> go

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
into that it'll just disintegrate and go

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.480 
into that it'll just disintegrate and go
over<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.440> place<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:49.010> don't<00:03:49.160> want<00:03:49.280> that<00:03:49.340> to

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
over the place you don't want that to

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.970 
over the place you don't want that to
happen<00:03:49.520> so<00:03:50.300> just<00:03:50.330> up<00:03:50.720> to<00:03:50.990> a<00:03:51.020> gentle<00:03:51.500> simmer<00:03:51.709> and

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
happen so just up to a gentle simmer and

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.370 
happen so just up to a gentle simmer and
slip<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.850> egg<00:03:52.970> in<00:03:53.209> and<00:03:53.420> then<00:03:53.780> it'll<00:03:53.930> just<00:03:54.200> cook

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
slip the egg in and then it'll just cook

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.770 
slip the egg in and then it'll just cook
very<00:03:54.650> gently<00:03:55.040> and<00:03:55.310> come<00:03:55.700> out<00:03:55.850> a<00:03:55.880> nice<00:03:56.240> compact

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
very gently and come out a nice compact

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.140 
very gently and come out a nice compact
shape
