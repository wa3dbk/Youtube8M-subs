red<00:03:09.690> completely<00:03:10.530> on<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.770> one<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.930> if

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
red completely on that one and that if

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.870 
red completely on that one and that if
it<00:03:13.200> really<00:03:13.560> takes<00:03:13.830> form<00:03:14.160> really<00:03:14.370> quickly<00:03:14.790> I'd

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
it really takes form really quickly I'd

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.400 
it really takes form really quickly I'd
say<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.209> is<00:03:15.270> probably<00:03:15.600> my<00:03:15.750> best<00:03:16.110> one

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
say this is probably my best one

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.979 
say this is probably my best one
actually<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.010> on<00:03:17.820> hand<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.570> see<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.840> little

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
actually and on hand you see the little

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.870 
actually and on hand you see the little
cuffs<00:03:19.260> around<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.769> tops<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.190> gloves<00:03:20.400> just

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
cuffs around the tops of the gloves just

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.850 
cuffs around the tops of the gloves just
make<00:03:21.150> them<00:03:21.390> yellow<00:03:21.750> until<00:03:22.410> you've<00:03:22.560> got<00:03:22.739> them

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
make them yellow until you've got them

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.500 
make them yellow until you've got them
yellow<00:03:23.220> then<00:03:23.549> you're<00:03:23.760> pretty<00:03:24.030> much<00:03:24.120> right<00:03:24.390> to

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
yellow then you're pretty much right to

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.780 
yellow then you're pretty much right to
the<00:03:24.540> point<00:03:24.720> one<00:03:24.930> be<00:03:25.080> yellow<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.400> looks

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
the point one be yellow so that looks

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.110 
the point one be yellow so that looks
all<00:03:26.940> right<00:03:26.970> now<00:03:28.549> and<00:03:29.549> then<00:03:29.730> what<00:03:29.910> you're<00:03:30.030> going

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
to want to do then is go for waste now

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.800 
to want to do then is go for waste now
add<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.400> bit<00:03:32.549> of<00:03:32.640> problems<00:03:33.000> with<00:03:33.209> this<00:03:33.269> belk<00:03:33.690> I

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
add a bit of problems with this belk I

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.270 
add a bit of problems with this belk I
didn't<00:03:34.019> know<00:03:34.080> what<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.350> make<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:34.650> shiny<00:03:34.980> bit

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
didn't know what to make that shiny bit

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.210 
didn't know what to make that shiny bit
red<00:03:35.640> or<00:03:35.880> yellow<00:03:36.080> because<00:03:37.080> both<00:03:37.350> of<00:03:37.530> them<00:03:37.650> are

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
red or yellow because both of them are

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.640 
red or yellow because both of them are
really<00:03:38.430> bright<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.120> mean<00:03:39.480> look<00:03:39.600> at<00:03:39.720> this<00:03:39.870> it

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
really bright so I mean look at this it

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.930 
really bright so I mean look at this it
looks<00:03:40.830> alright<00:03:41.070> but<00:03:41.130> it's<00:03:41.430> probably<00:03:41.670> going<00:03:41.850> to

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
looks alright but it's probably going to

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.490 
looks alright but it's probably going to
be<00:03:42.060> better<00:03:42.269> yellow<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:42.930> just<00:03:43.140> wanted<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.440> to

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
be better yellow I just wanted it to

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.020 
be better yellow I just wanted it to
look<00:03:43.739> like<00:03:43.769> that<00:03:44.040> sort<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.280> fun<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.760> stripe

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
look like that sort of fun the stripe

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.120 
look like that sort of fun the stripe
thing<00:03:45.360> that<00:03:45.870> funderbolt<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.650> lightning<00:03:46.950> bolt

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
thing that funderbolt the lightning bolt

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.090 
thing that funderbolt the lightning bolt
sorry<00:03:47.370> but<00:03:48.360> it<00:03:48.480> just<00:03:48.690> looks<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:49.049> bit<00:03:49.080> odd<00:03:49.320> you

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
sorry but it just looks a bit odd you

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.100 
sorry but it just looks a bit odd you
know<00:03:50.130> so<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.459> don't<00:03:50.670> know<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.450> entirely<00:03:51.870> up

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
know so I don't know is it entirely up

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.570 
know so I don't know is it entirely up
to<00:03:52.140> you<00:03:52.320> what<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.500> want<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:52.799> use<00:03:52.950> but<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.370> just

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
to you what you want to use but it just

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.250 
to you what you want to use but it just
looks<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.880> bit<00:03:53.910> too<00:03:54.180> bright<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:54.510> it's<00:03:54.930> probably

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
looks a bit too bright so it's probably

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.479 
looks a bit too bright so it's probably
best<00:03:55.470> if<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:55.830> go<00:03:55.980> for<00:03:56.220> it

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
best if you go for it

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.880 
best if you go for it
yellow<00:03:57.090> really<00:03:57.420> it's<00:03:58.230> pretty<00:03:58.410> much<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.860> only

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
yellow really it's pretty much the only

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.250 
yellow really it's pretty much the only
one<00:03:59.100> you<00:03:59.250> can<00:03:59.489> use<00:03:59.549> something<00:04:00.360> that<00:04:00.570> slightly

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
one you can use something that slightly

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.440 
one you can use something that slightly
resembles<00:04:01.890> lightning<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.610> want<00:04:02.850> them<00:04:03.000> jagged

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
resembles lightning you want them jagged

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.530 
resembles lightning you want them jagged
edges<00:04:03.570> on<00:04:03.810> their<00:04:03.930> briefing<00:04:04.880> but<00:04:05.880> again<00:04:06.390> it

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
edges on their briefing but again it

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.030 
edges on their briefing but again it
kept<00:04:06.720> making<00:04:06.989> me<00:04:07.080> change<00:04:07.320> my<00:04:07.500> mind<00:04:07.739> I<00:04:07.890> didn't

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
kept making me change my mind I didn't

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.380 
kept making me change my mind I didn't
know<00:04:08.130> what<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.400> do<00:04:08.519> so<00:04:08.730> eventually<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.180> just

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
know what to do so eventually I just

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.759 
know what to do so eventually I just
went<00:04:09.540> with<00:04:09.690> yellow<00:04:10.019> it's<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.350> only<00:04:10.530> one<00:04:10.650> that

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
went with yellow it's the only one that

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.650 
went with yellow it's the only one that
looks<00:04:10.920> semi<00:04:11.250> decent<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:11.940> just<00:04:12.150> leave<00:04:12.360> it<00:04:12.540> that

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
looks semi decent so just leave it that

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.810 
looks semi decent so just leave it that
way<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.019> then<00:04:13.470> when<00:04:13.920> you<00:04:14.040> go<00:04:14.190> to<00:04:14.220> legs<00:04:14.610> you're

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
way and then when you go to legs you're

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.130 
way and then when you go to legs you're
just<00:04:15.000> going<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.150> want<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.360> make<00:04:15.540> them<00:04:15.780> red

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
just going to want to make them red

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.050 
just going to want to make them red
that's<00:04:16.769> it<00:04:17.010> that's<00:04:17.100> all<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.400> need<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:17.700> do<00:04:17.850> for

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
that's it that's all you need to do for

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.780 
that's it that's all you need to do for
that<00:04:18.180> because<00:04:18.329> it's<00:04:18.479> one<00:04:18.810> color

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
that because it's one color

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.580 
that because it's one color
and<00:04:19.880> there's<00:04:20.540> no<00:04:20.660> other<00:04:20.780> pans<00:04:21.110> on<00:04:21.350> there<00:04:21.500> as

and there's no other pans on there as

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.350 
and there's no other pans on there as
well<00:04:21.770> and<00:04:22.040> on<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.490> boots<00:04:22.730> you're<00:04:23.030> just<00:04:23.210> going

well and on the boots you're just going

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.180 
well and on the boots you're just going
to<00:04:23.390> want<00:04:23.510> to<00:04:23.630> make<00:04:23.750> them<00:04:23.960> yellow<00:04:24.410> again<00:04:24.890> with

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
to want to make them yellow again with

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.250 
to want to make them yellow again with
your<00:04:25.310> pallet<00:04:25.670> that's<00:04:26.240> already<00:04:26.480> made<00:04:26.720> just<00:04:27.110> go

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
your pallet that's already made just go

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.840 
your pallet that's already made just go
along<00:04:27.530> to<00:04:27.710> them<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.100> make<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:28.280> yellow<00:04:28.700> and

along to them and make it yellow and

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.300 
along to them and make it yellow and
then<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:30.140> don't<00:04:30.320> need<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.590> make<00:04:30.920> any<00:04:30.980> more

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
then you don't need to make any more

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.900 
then you don't need to make any more
changes<00:04:31.730> to<00:04:31.790> that<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:32.920> there<00:04:33.920> you<00:04:34.040> go<00:04:34.220> that's

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
changes to that and there you go that's

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.570 
changes to that and there you go that's
the<00:04:35.180> flash<00:04:35.420> again<00:04:36.410> like<00:04:36.650> I<00:04:36.770> said<00:04:36.830> this<00:04:37.280> is<00:04:37.430> my

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
the flash again like I said this is my

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
style go into gear in style and you can

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.140 
style go into gear in style and you can
remove<00:05:12.500> them<00:05:12.800> blades<00:05:13.100> so<00:05:13.520> you<00:05:13.550> don't<00:05:13.910> have
