axle carrier and as you can see the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.260 
axle carrier and as you can see the
design<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.649> nearly<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.579> same<00:01:50.790> as<00:01:50.850> just

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
design is nearly the same as just

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.160 
design is nearly the same as just
materials<00:01:51.869> different<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.560> much<00:01:53.340> stronger<00:01:54.170> so

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
materials different and much stronger so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.389 
materials different and much stronger so

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.060 
installing the bearings into the axle
carriers<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.600> me<00:02:00.719> since<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.619> there<00:02:01.950> my

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
carriers for me since I do have there my

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.800 
carriers for me since I do have there my
piece<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.759> insert<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.270> piece<00:02:03.570> in

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
piece I have to insert this piece in

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.370 
piece I have to insert this piece in
between<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.380> bearings<00:02:04.710> now<00:02:05.930> put<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.079> as<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
between the bearings now put it as the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.979 
between the bearings now put it as the
other<00:02:07.970> bearing<00:02:08.970> make<00:02:09.209> sure<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.509> goes<00:02:09.660> all<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
other bearing make sure it goes all the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.000 
other bearing make sure it goes all the
way<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.500> there<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:11.580> go

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
way in there we go

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.100 
way in there we go
and<00:02:12.280> now<00:02:12.640> there's<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.150> couple<00:02:13.420> ways<00:02:13.570> I<00:02:13.930> can

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
and now there's a couple ways I can

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.110 
and now there's a couple ways I can
install<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.770> they<00:02:15.430> do<00:02:15.490> include<00:02:16.090> some

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
install this they do include some

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.020 
install this they do include some
kingpins<00:02:16.960> and<00:02:17.560> some<00:02:17.950> grub<00:02:18.250> screws<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.850> might

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
kingpins and some grub screws you might

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.520 
kingpins and some grub screws you might
be<00:02:19.150> wondering<00:02:19.330> what<00:02:19.630> those<00:02:19.780> grub<00:02:20.050> screws<00:02:20.350> are

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
be wondering what those grub screws are

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.590 
be wondering what those grub screws are
for<00:02:20.740> well<00:02:21.310> when<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:21.520> slide<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.910> kingpin<00:02:22.390> in

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
for well when you slide the kingpin in

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.600 
for well when you slide the kingpin in
through<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.470> want<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.740> go<00:02:23.830> ahead<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.220> insert

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
through you want to go ahead and insert

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.730 
through you want to go ahead and insert
that<00:02:24.910> grub<00:02:25.450> screw<00:02:25.780> right<00:02:25.960> there<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.560> it's

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
that grub screw right there and it's

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.800 
that grub screw right there and it's
gonna<00:02:26.830> hold<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.340> kingpin<00:02:27.850> in<00:02:28.000> place<00:02:28.270> in<00:02:28.600> case

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
gonna hold that kingpin in place in case

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.110 
gonna hold that kingpin in place in case
one<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.200> eat<00:02:29.380> Clips<00:02:29.650> pop<00:02:29.950> off<00:02:30.190> but<00:02:30.790> for<00:02:30.820> me

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
one of the eat Clips pop off but for me

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.280 
one of the eat Clips pop off but for me
I<00:02:31.300> think<00:02:31.600> I'm<00:02:31.690> just<00:02:31.810> gonna<00:02:31.990> go<00:02:32.140> ahead<00:02:32.200> and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
I think I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.350 
I think I'm just gonna go ahead and
stick<00:02:32.530> with<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.770> original<00:02:32.860> pin<00:02:33.460> so<00:02:34.060> now<00:02:34.210> it's

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
stick with the original pin so now it's

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.000 
stick with the original pin so now it's
time<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.630> go<00:02:34.750> ahead<00:02:34.960> and<00:02:35.050> install<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.470> all<00:02:35.950> I

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
time to go ahead and install it all I

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.470 
time to go ahead and install it all I
have<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.280> do<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.520> slide<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.820> axle<00:02:37.090> right

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
have to do is slide the axle right

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.630 
have to do is slide the axle right
through<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.900> bearings<00:02:38.260> line<00:02:38.890> up<00:02:39.130> as<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.340> hole

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
through the bearings line up as a hole

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.150 
through the bearings line up as a hole
on<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.090> bottom<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.660> then<00:02:41.140> slide<00:02:41.500> as<00:02:41.800> a<00:02:41.830> pin

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
on the bottom and then slide as a pin

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.520 
on the bottom and then slide as a pin
right<00:02:42.190> on<00:02:42.490> through<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.210> tighten<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:43.690> down<00:02:43.750> all

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
right on through and tighten it down all

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.860 
right on through and tighten it down all
right<00:02:44.590> now<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:45.610> won't<00:02:45.850> be<00:02:45.970> able<00:02:46.210> to<00:02:46.300> install<00:02:46.570> the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
right now I won't be able to install the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.270 
right now I won't be able to install the
grub<00:02:47.080> screw<00:02:47.140> that<00:02:47.590> holds<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.920> pin<00:02:48.100> in<00:02:48.250> place

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
grub screw that holds the pin in place

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.970 
grub screw that holds the pin in place
mainly<00:02:49.240> do<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.570> fact<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.200> pin<00:02:50.680> is

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
mainly do the fact that this pin is

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.310 
mainly do the fact that this pin is
stationary<00:02:51.790> so<00:02:52.030> if<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.480> put<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.720> grub<00:02:53.050> screw

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
stationary so if I put that grub screw

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.170 
stationary so if I put that grub screw
in<00:02:53.470> there<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.040> axle<00:02:54.400> carry<00:02:54.610> won't<00:02:54.820> be<00:02:54.940> able<00:02:55.030> to

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
in there the axle carry won't be able to

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.030 
in there the axle carry won't be able to
rock<00:02:55.300> back<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:55.630> forth<00:02:55.990> that<00:02:56.500> would<00:02:56.620> not<00:02:56.860> be<00:02:57.010> a

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
rock back and forth that would not be a

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.790 
rock back and forth that would not be a
good<00:02:57.250> thing<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.240> I'm<00:02:58.600> not<00:02:58.780> gonna<00:02:58.959> be<00:02:59.110> using<00:02:59.590> the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
good thing so I'm not gonna be using the

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.280 
good thing so I'm not gonna be using the
steel<00:03:00.040> screws<00:03:00.430> included<00:03:01.209> in<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.720> kit<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.170> as

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
steel screws included in the kit and as

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.080 
steel screws included in the kit and as
you<00:03:02.410> can<00:03:02.560> see<00:03:02.770> there<00:03:03.070> is<00:03:03.220> some<00:03:03.459> Loctite<00:03:03.700> in

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
you can see there is some Loctite in

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.150 
you can see there is some Loctite in
there<00:03:04.300> since<00:03:05.020> it's<00:03:05.230> gonna<00:03:05.320> be<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.590> metal<00:03:05.890> screw

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
there since it's gonna be a metal screw

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.580 
there since it's gonna be a metal screw
inside<00:03:06.340> aluminum<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.270> can<00:03:07.600> come<00:03:07.959> undone<00:03:08.260> very

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
inside aluminum it can come undone very

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.160 
inside aluminum it can come undone very
easily<00:03:08.860> what<00:03:09.790> I'm<00:03:09.940> gonna<00:03:10.120> do<00:03:10.390> is<00:03:10.810> I'm<00:03:11.080> gonna

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
easily what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.010 
easily what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
use<00:03:11.290> an<00:03:11.800> elongated<00:03:12.640> stainless<00:03:13.270> steel<00:03:13.570> screw

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
use an elongated stainless steel screw

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.590 
use an elongated stainless steel screw
with<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.250> three<00:03:15.550> millimeter<00:03:15.970> nut<00:03:16.209> on<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.570> other

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
with a three millimeter nut on the other

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.170 
with a three millimeter nut on the other
side<00:03:17.080> that's<00:03:17.769> gonna<00:03:17.950> hold<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.370> in<00:03:18.400> place<00:03:18.640> that

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
side that's gonna hold it in place that

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.030 
side that's gonna hold it in place that
way<00:03:19.360> that<00:03:19.630> camber<00:03:20.050> link<00:03:20.230> will<00:03:20.470> always<00:03:20.830> stay

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
way that camber link will always stay

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.190 
way that camber link will always stay
connected<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.700> axle<00:03:22.090> carrier<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.630> there

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
connected to the axle carrier and there

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.050 
connected to the axle carrier and there
you<00:03:23.350> go<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.220> kept<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.670> screw<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:24.940> little

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
you go so I kept the screw a little

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.330 
you go so I kept the screw a little
loose<00:03:25.480> on<00:03:25.690> this<00:03:25.930> side<00:03:26.200> but<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.620> did<00:03:26.950> tighten

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
loose on this side but I did tighten

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.970 
loose on this side but I did tighten
this<00:03:27.430> nut<00:03:27.730> all<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.209> way<00:03:28.360> down<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.769> screw

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
this nut all the way down and the screw

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.860 
this nut all the way down and the screw
was<00:03:30.220> long<00:03:30.459> enough<00:03:30.610> for<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.330> to<00:03:31.360> reach<00:03:31.630> through

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
was long enough for it to reach through

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.660 
was long enough for it to reach through
the<00:03:31.959> plastic<00:03:32.200> seal<00:03:32.620> so<00:03:32.860> that<00:03:33.010> nut<00:03:33.310> is<00:03:33.489> not

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
the plastic seal so that nut is not
