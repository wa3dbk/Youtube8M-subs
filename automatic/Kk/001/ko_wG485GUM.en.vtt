00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.080
 Hmm 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.520
 me 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:24.660
 It was recording and live, because there were so many things to do live on the fly 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:29.510
 One person can use it live 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.510
 I went digital but the sound is so much for me 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.150
 Not like 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.430
 I used this 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.030
 This is really 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.260
 What I thought I wanted 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:49.140
 It It was amazing good because I was such form 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.140
 Say-burning is such loop in the circuit of analog 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.850
 I'm using this alone now 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.050
 that 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:05.620
 Backing to the backing lead the idea that the loop is formed here 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:10.230
 What's only, but this is an ensemble in the FTC rail and the band 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:15.330
 This is already a great possibility coming out 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:18.660
 Until now I've released the backing here, for example, looping only one phrase of the lead 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.390
 I want to match it with a drummer 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.200
 Conversely there 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.780
 I 'm mixing the backing here 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.860
 Something is after 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:33.970
 If I put a small exchange on the slide and put it on a loop with this 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.970
 Watery 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.409
 I already want to do something 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.679
 The possibility is there more and more Yappa 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.679
 Yup 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.220
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.820
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.820

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.620
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.650
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.430
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.430
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.450
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.450
 Oh 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.450
 Hmm 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.450
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.450
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.329
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.329
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.280
 rar 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.280
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.130
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.910
 Oh 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.150
 Oh 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.450
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.319
 me 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.170
 Hmm 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.280
 Ah ah ah 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.349
 Oh
