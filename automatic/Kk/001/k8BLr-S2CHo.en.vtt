00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 you case grand prix second first places 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.849
 respectively at these stages in which 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.820
 Liza spoke and she spoke quite a while 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.650
 but in tournaments of series b did not forget 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.969
 appear when there were no stages 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.869
 Grand Prix and so Elizabeth Tuktamysheva 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.380
 the most serving athlete 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.529
 this season and its interpretation 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.710
 Kovalevsky 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:30.380
 bolero and my look is another gorgeous 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.380
 current program short 7 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.510
 Lisa, unlike Julia, did not see 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.010
 arrest did not put triple lutz 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.899
 which we are in this season in her 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.180
 performance in the cascade is not seen and not 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.109
 seen confined with a cascade of two 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.109
 double sheepskin coats 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.909
 and here is the loot but unfortunately 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.909
 with not very clean landing 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.370
 good good of course somehow came out as 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.200
 speak even though what a loser 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.290
 the bitrate will be three types because of minus 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.400
 1 to -2 but in terms of 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.470
 edges nasty when repulsive 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.200
 tuktamysheva never had this 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.329
 the slightest problem and now very much 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.750
 will depend on component ratings 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:40.460
 or he doesn't have it 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.460
 Well, not so much not to suffer
