00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:03.850
 iberia have washed their hands 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.340
 Now I would like to know if you meet the requirements to pass the exam and the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.229
 first test 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:10.519
 that is the trust 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.529
 because we want to become a hunter 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.769
 his state is common sense 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.090
 that's why I want to become a cajaol and the last 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.890
 Clan survivor comments 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.119
 speaking me 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.519
 it's not that simple 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.339
 I want to catch 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.369
 for blacklist hunters, whatever the cost 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.920
 my family was murdered four years ago by thieves was a sleeve of 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.120
 the specters but also all my life 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.960
 allowed to catch them and that's why 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.370
 you want to become a house in favor 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.290
 the band of the specters belongs to the class to neither the best hunters that 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.460
 glory 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.580
 It is too risky an adventure for someone inexperienced like you 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.120
 I do not mind dying 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.370
 I am determined to take my chances, I will end all the anger I have in me 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.340
 inside 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.450
 you will need to do a lot of gymnastics to get it I would think 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.070
 seeking revenge is not a good reason to become a hunter 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.550
 the world there are more important reasons than money 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.660
 of not converting mind in favor 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.660
 the series that I carry inside prevents me from thinking 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.830
 that's why I will train and audio 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.900
 I told him to call me Mr. 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.080
 pitu reason teach him orio 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.270
 scripts 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.990
 days although there is one in particular the most obvious answer said before 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.720
 He mentioned that the suspects 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.440
 who are the things he always wanted 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.000
 it's a luxurious mansion its cars 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 happiness girl or girls of the criminal 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.570
 courts can not combine the treasury 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.010
 this is the third 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.180
 let's finish with this let's see if it is true that the blood of the currutaco clan 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.459
 he reported his grief 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.340
 the team to face if those words already sr. orio 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.629
 let's go out if you want it 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:20.599
 return 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:21.929
 It is not over yet 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:24.879
 talk to you 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.169
 it is better to leave them 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.459
 if it was better to let them do what they want if you want to know well there 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.169
 who begins to find what makes them more curious is a phrase that 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.169
 I like it and my aunt always tells me 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.599
 now he has good reason to be angry it will be a good opportunity 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.019
 so that they begin to know each other better is not convenient 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.019
 pipes now 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.259
 each one less 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:02.789
 you are on time 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.629
 pure life I do not think 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.680
 but that explain to me why it gets stuck in the vacuum for 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.020
 I heard that I had also pulled out I do 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.839
 bottom of the sea 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:38.839
 You took me freedom 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:45.089
 since I saw the fight 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.180
 the truth is that I do not remember 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.440
 I feel what happened has been foolish I think I owe you an apology 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.319
 Lion 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:57.789
 or what happened fixed cure john clelland 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.830
 then it will be enough 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.830
 it's really me who should apologize 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.719
 can be traced to the iss will pass the exam 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:14.809
 seriously 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:17.879
 I agree that having done is more important than any 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:21.289
 who knows 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.009
 something that nobody thought would be like that 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.009
 much more difficult 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.219
 in a next episode 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:45.479
 my walk with the disease has started very well 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:48.499
 between the dead there are two modalities 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:50.770
 in new adventures months of the year 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.229
 I'm already looking forward to 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:55.229
 design 

00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:00.809
 one
