00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.719
 already doing these dubbing and I 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.180
 I think even they did it 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.699
 this app will be just over 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.890

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.180

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.720

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.110

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.630
 globe 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.869

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.460
 to redouble the voices that have the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.220

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.459

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.330

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.910

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:04.430
 I was 13 years old and did not even talk in the van. 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:07.190
