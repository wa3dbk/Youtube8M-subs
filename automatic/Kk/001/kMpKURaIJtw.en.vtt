very small ripple but the snubber
capacitor<00:01:51.880> seemed<00:01:52.180> to<00:01:52.330> have<00:01:52.509> cleaned<00:01:52.930> up<00:01:53.640> some

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
capacitor seemed to have cleaned up some

a<00:02:05.840> little<00:02:06.590> little<00:02:07.130> bump<00:02:07.430> right<00:02:07.670> there<00:02:08.350> where

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.070 

power<00:02:13.760> is<00:02:13.910> flowing<00:02:14.180> in<00:02:15.730> okay<00:02:16.730> next<00:02:17.180> up<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.930> have

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
power is flowing in okay next up to have

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.380 
power is flowing in okay next up to have
a<00:02:18.230> look<00:02:18.490> it's<00:02:19.490> yep<00:02:19.880> put<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.540> first<00:02:20.810> stage

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
a look it's yep put of the first stage

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.100 
a look it's yep put of the first stage
first<00:02:23.390> two<00:02:23.980> input<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.250> shorted<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.120> ground

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:37.960 

yeah<00:02:30.110> first<00:02:30.980> thing<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:32.260> notice<00:02:33.260> here<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:36.970> spikes

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
yeah first thing I notice here is spikes

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.160 
yeah first thing I notice here is spikes
are<00:02:38.180> gone<00:02:38.350> at<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:40.430> off<00:02:40.610> switching<00:02:41.210> transient

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
are gone at the off switching transient

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.370 
are gone at the off switching transient
plenty<00:02:42.610> no<00:02:43.610> spike<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.810> only<00:02:44.990> thing<00:02:45.200> that's

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
plenty no spike the only thing that's

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.900 
plenty no spike the only thing that's
left<00:02:45.470> is<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:47.390> little<00:02:48.070> 120<00:02:49.070> Hertz<00:02:50.590> ripple<00:02:51.590> and

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
left is a little 120 Hertz ripple and

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:59.320 
left is a little 120 Hertz ripple and
noise<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:55.610> that's<00:02:55.790> an<00:02:55.970> improvement<00:02:57.190> okay<00:02:58.330> next

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
noise so that's an improvement okay next

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:14.450 
noise so that's an improvement okay next
up<00:02:59.720> of<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.140> second<00:03:00.590> gain<00:03:01.130> stage

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.370 

basically<00:03:15.460> amplified<00:03:16.120> version<00:03:16.390> of<00:03:16.840> what<00:03:17.260> we

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
basically amplified version of what we

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.400 
basically amplified version of what we
just<00:03:17.590> saw<00:03:18.210> but<00:03:19.210> again<00:03:19.650> there's<00:03:20.650> no<00:03:20.770> spikes

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
just saw but again there's no spikes

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.280 
just saw but again there's no spikes
anywhere<00:03:23.410> at<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.890> off<00:03:24.070> switching<00:03:24.640> points<00:03:25.290> so

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
anywhere at the off switching points so

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.660 
anywhere at the off switching points so
the<00:03:26.320> snubber<00:03:26.830> seem<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.310> I've<00:03:27.460> gotten<00:03:27.850> rid<00:03:28.030> of

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
the snubber seem that I've gotten rid of

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.750 
the snubber seem that I've gotten rid of
spike<00:03:30.670> transient<00:03:31.390> so<00:03:31.570> we're<00:03:31.750> showing<00:03:32.020> up<00:03:32.760> yeah

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
spike transient so we're showing up yeah

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.070 
spike transient so we're showing up yeah
putting<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.240> tubes<00:03:36.090> alright<00:03:37.090> moving<00:03:37.360> on<00:03:37.630> to

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
putting the tubes alright moving on to

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:48.480 
putting the tubes alright moving on to
the<00:03:40.110> signal<00:03:41.110> at<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.350> master<00:03:42.010> volume<00:03:47.490> tapping

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
the signal at the master volume tapping

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.820 
the signal at the master volume tapping
the<00:03:48.580> signal<00:03:49.060> at<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:50.850> high<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:53.200> first<00:03:53.470> love

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
the signal at the high the first love

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.470 
the signal at the high the first love
that's<00:03:54.160> taking<00:03:54.580> a<00:03:54.670> signal<00:03:55.030> from<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.270> tone

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
that's taking a signal from the tone

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.790 
that's taking a signal from the tone
stack<00:03:58.740> and

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.190 

now<00:04:03.370> no<00:04:03.930> no<00:04:04.930> spikes<00:04:06.330> this<00:04:07.330> appears<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:07.870> be<00:04:08.020> more

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
now no no spikes this appears to be more

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.290 
now no no spikes this appears to be more
granular<00:04:08.800> because<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.370> think<00:04:09.430> it's<00:04:09.790> lost<00:04:10.030> some

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.500 
granular because I think it's lost some

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
staff that was there not here we can see

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.950 
staff that was there not here we can see
something<00:04:20.140> a<00:04:20.459> little

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.219 

a<00:04:26.020> little<00:04:27.300> persistent<00:04:28.300> jump<00:04:30.479> why<00:04:31.479> I<00:04:31.509> say<00:04:32.199> it's

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
a little persistent jump why I say it's

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:39.530 
a little persistent jump why I say it's
much<00:04:33.100> better<00:04:33.400> than<00:04:33.699> what<00:04:33.850> it<00:04:34.000> was

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.430 

just<00:04:40.380> a<00:04:40.530> little<00:04:40.880> little<00:04:41.880> bump<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:42.900> was<00:04:43.140> five

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
just a little little bump that was five

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.870 
just a little little bump that was five
minute<00:04:44.630> it's<00:04:45.630> mostly<00:04:46.200> even<00:04:47.100> you<00:04:47.460> could<00:04:47.640> say

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
minute it's mostly even you could say

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.900 
minute it's mostly even you could say
it's<00:04:48.150> mostly<00:04:48.980> contained<00:04:49.980> within<00:04:50.280> that<00:04:50.430> the

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
it's mostly contained within that the

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:57.040 
it's mostly contained within that the
range<00:04:51.870> of<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.380> noise<00:04:53.000> so<00:04:54.000> it's<00:04:54.150> been<00:04:54.360> reduced

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.300 

go<00:04:58.050> about<00:04:58.230> the<00:04:58.410> same<00:04:58.650> level<00:04:58.890> as<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.400> noise

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
go about the same level as the noise

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:11.420 
go about the same level as the noise
okay<00:05:02.310> one<00:05:02.880> last<00:05:02.910> look<00:05:03.480> here<00:05:03.930> at<00:05:07.460> goober<00:05:10.430> after

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
okay one last look here at goober after

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.120 
okay one last look here at goober after

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130

resistor

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.129 

let<00:05:25.470> me<00:05:25.620> set<00:05:25.919> up<00:05:26.009> upcoming<00:05:26.759> sections<00:05:27.060> of<00:05:27.750> the

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
let me set up upcoming sections of the

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:35.330 
let me set up upcoming sections of the
hunt<00:05:28.380> here<00:05:28.680> I<00:05:29.060> have<00:05:30.060> acquired<00:05:30.479> a<00:05:32.600> choke<00:05:33.600> and<00:05:34.340> a

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
hunt here I have acquired a choke and a

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.379 
hunt here I have acquired a choke and a
separate<00:05:36.830> heater<00:05:37.830> transformer<00:05:38.639> so<00:05:39.090> we'll<00:05:39.240> be

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
separate heater transformer so we'll be

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.490 
separate heater transformer so we'll be
looking<00:05:39.419> at<00:05:39.840> that<00:05:40.080> too<00:05:40.680> that<00:05:42.259> here's<00:05:43.259> the

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
looking at that too that here's the

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.969 
looking at that too that here's the
output<00:05:43.949> that<00:05:44.190> power<00:05:44.699> resistor<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:48.650> it<00:05:49.650> looks

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
output that power resistor and it looks

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:57.370 
output that power resistor and it looks
just<00:05:51.229> like<00:05:52.229> the<00:05:52.380> 120<00:05:53.250> Hertz<00:05:53.460> ripple<00:05:54.350> with

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.740 

noise

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.520 

I<00:06:01.840> did<00:06:02.470> a<00:06:02.500> spectrum<00:06:02.980> analysis<00:06:03.520> of<00:06:03.730> this<00:06:03.850> to

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
I did a spectrum analysis of this to

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.400 
I did a spectrum analysis of this to
these<00:06:05.530> spectral<00:06:05.980> analysis<00:06:06.600> take<00:06:07.600> 40<00:06:08.380> minutes

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
these spectral analysis take 40 minutes

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.070 
these spectral analysis take 40 minutes
to<00:06:08.830> run<00:06:09.070> I<00:06:09.340> run<00:06:10.210> them<00:06:10.600> at<00:06:10.720> the<00:06:10.840> highest

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
to run I run them at the highest

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.760 
to run I run them at the highest
resolution<00:06:12.010> that's<00:06:12.820> at<00:06:15.300> 33<00:06:16.300> cycle<00:06:16.770> resolution

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
resolution that's at 33 cycle resolution

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.400 
resolution that's at 33 cycle resolution
and<00:06:19.080> spectrum<00:06:20.080> analysis<00:06:20.620> turns<00:06:20.890> out<00:06:21.160> to<00:06:21.940> be

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
and spectrum analysis turns out to be

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.870 
and spectrum analysis turns out to be
essentially<00:06:23.410> the<00:06:23.530> same<00:06:23.770> as<00:06:26.880> spectrum

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
essentially the same as spectrum

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.600 
essentially the same as spectrum
analysis<00:06:28.420> without<00:06:28.630> the<00:06:28.960> snubber<00:06:30.390> so<00:06:31.390> whatever

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
analysis without the snubber so whatever

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.530 
analysis without the snubber so whatever
this<00:06:33.610> numbers<00:06:34.120> take<00:06:34.450> out<00:06:35.910> the<00:06:36.910> frequency<00:06:37.480> is

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
this numbers take out the frequency is

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.520 
this numbers take out the frequency is
higher<00:06:37.780> than<00:06:38.550> 1,000<00:06:39.550> hearts<00:06:39.870> because<00:06:40.870> the<00:06:41.080> 60

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
higher than 1,000 hearts because the 60

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.250 
higher than 1,000 hearts because the 60
cycle<00:06:42.010> on<00:06:42.100> 120<00:06:42.910> cycle<00:06:43.419> and<00:06:43.720> the<00:06:43.780> rest<00:06:44.080> of

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
cycle on 120 cycle and the rest of

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.760 
cycle on 120 cycle and the rest of
harmonic<00:06:44.830> spikes<00:06:45.550> are<00:06:46.470> essentially<00:06:47.470> as<00:06:47.560> soon

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
harmonic spikes are essentially as soon

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.080 
harmonic spikes are essentially as soon
as<00:06:47.950> they<00:06:48.130> were<00:06:48.190> put<00:06:48.700> at<00:06:48.730> it<00:06:49.320> the<00:06:50.320> snubber

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
as they were put at it the snubber

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.820 
as they were put at it the snubber
already<00:06:52.090> that<00:06:52.330> wraps<00:06:52.630> up<00:06:52.840> this<00:06:53.020> section
