00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.459
 a very warm welcome to 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:17.650
 twentieth tutorial follow round op 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:19.360
 Today I want to show you how it works 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.980
 stuck with info actually works 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.740
 because the question often comes to me 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.110
 was received and therefore would like 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.060
 I grab that up today because 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.540
 this question certainly occupied some people 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.430
 of you may not have much because 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.829
 Aviation does not have that either 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.899
 common but I think it can be 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.960
 but realize it very well with something like that 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.390
 Everything is there that the example 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.530
 is yes for where but main airport 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.739
 I'm just punching the fourth 56 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.940
 no idea once again build 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.129
 the circuit is now 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.010
 completely out of her completely new klo 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.079
 built up to bake the bread because 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.399
 I would like to show you this now but 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.859
 you can not look at me 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.379
 He is going to my pictures 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:09.250
 come now you have that again 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.840
 usual screen in front of you looks like this 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.050
 the control for the prospectus process 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.290
 from her you all know when he has the 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.550
 My club opened in 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.600
 airport in virtual version 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.000
 Please do not get in touch now that her 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.920
 nothing is because I have the plane 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.390
 the airport is completely new 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.490
 no plane is now called 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.010
 more on it is no tax in it 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 nothing on this prospect 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.490
 process 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.180
 you see her most first 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.740
 contact the bremer of course that 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.120
 plane here in the whole of thuringia 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.160
 then it starts 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.200
 as the first signal contact point of the 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.720
 puts the first signals on halt that 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.540
 normal contact point, so to speak 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.360
 they have long since you can see that 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.300
 vehicle contact point of this pile 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.850
 Responsible to reverse the plane 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.020
 that is, give him one 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.420
 Cruise speed in negative 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.619
 direction backwards but that 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.830
 plane still rolls in the 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.010
 signal range purely then you can still see 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.219
 three signals in one heap 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.540
 contact points a heap first 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:22.299
 signal contact point is for that 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.930
 responsible that they make behind to 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.359
 So that's her 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.189
 times for the flight tug and one 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.840
 vehicle contact point of vehicle paint 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.579
 punkt gives the flight tug just because 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.290
 now the command to drive backwards 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.530
 but he still drives a signal 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.099
 area is the third contact point 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.530
 is more exactly s.der hand direction 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.349
 and he has the following function if 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.459
 the club is standing in reverse 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.109
 sometime arrived at the point against 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.450
 the book is in here in this area 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:53.980
 is where it really is 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.750
 belongs but coupling tugs 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.840
 and airplane not at me but 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.280
 they fall very close together 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.019
 The thing is a signal contact point 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.829
 the signal for the plane 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.239
 set up and thus flight tug and 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.159
 plane very close together 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.510
 drive 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:13.500
 but it still looks like that 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.430
 plane is more restrained in flight 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.930
 Let's see a soft one next 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.430
 contact point of the rear around 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.930
 so does the plane really 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.340
 backwards on the box comes, so to speak 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.940
 then we have many more up here 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.949
 contact points number one is next 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.060
 contact for the return that is 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:33.280
 the flight tractor he must again 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.349
 to the terminal and the plane should yes 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.079
 go straight 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:40.239
 Next is a point of contact 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.139
 responsible for the black box 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.120
 to turn back 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.310
 that is , learns to the end with the 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.069
 aircraft and then forward again his 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.220
 position next a signal 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.329
 contact point this signal represents and 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.099
 a reversal point of contact for the 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.639
 plane with it then the airplane too 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.139
 really fights forward again 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:01.239
 now here is one contact point left 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.759
 the return tug has operated in 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.019
 this direction and creates the 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.629
 Signal then back on a ride 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.540
 certain time 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:12.069
 he is not in this control and yes 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.599
 We were then one with the coupling 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.829
 a little too cumbersome because I that 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.810
 somebody can do it 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.310
 but I think the solution here is too 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.139
 passable there were a few problems with 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.550
 the circuit which has since been removed 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.780
 have and there is a possibility you 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.449
 Of course you can do it differently 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:33.720
 but even so you can the prospectus 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:36.690
 we always create 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.690
 yes that was already for this twentieth 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.610
 I always thank you for tutorial 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.190
 your attention for your interest 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:50.900
 the tutorials and how someone with me 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.900
 reach in the forum by mail or wiki
