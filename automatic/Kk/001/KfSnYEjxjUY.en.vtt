00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.859
 Good afternoon. It's time for authority . 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.470
 I'm Kim Boon who is in charge of lecture . 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:26.349
 What you will learn today is Paradise 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:30.910
 Paradis were once friends sseobol stroke Stroke is one burn rudiments 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:34.300
 There are four types of paradises , the first of which you will learn 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:39.730
 rlr pattern 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:44.519
 Below is a double stroke behind a single stroke. 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.519
 Let's play all the same century without accents. 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.920
 te 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.320
 U 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.379
 on 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.760
 100 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.530
 Since the stroke tw once entering the hand to lead every time to hit the spirals 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:15.500
 It changes. 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:21.020
 This time we will change the position of the double soak rlr pattern line third 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:28.570
 If a double stroke is entered, this time, double strokes flow to the second note 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.570
 So let's put this in rlrl. 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.990
 U 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:56.390
 5 Let's put him in the first note this time. 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.390
 rrlrl All 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.850
 The app 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.829
 Oh 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.829
 Ah 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.380
 U 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:30.459
 Finally, let's put the w stroke in the fourth note. 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:35.519
 rlrl and lr rlrl 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.519
 This will be the stroke that will take place over the next beat. 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.300
 100 5 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.930
 Ah 100a 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.370
 Ah 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.840
 So now mastered doesyeoteumyeon Ona also to raise the tempo, 10 kinds of letting a little practice 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.660
 See you. 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:14.340
 When raise the tempo, there will be a point where not so good than the tempo 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.170
 Just a little lower . Practice six, then raise the tempo again. 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:22.370
 You'll find it helpful . 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.370
 So now I 'm going to do it with the 16th note, not the 8th note . 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.900
 U 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.930
