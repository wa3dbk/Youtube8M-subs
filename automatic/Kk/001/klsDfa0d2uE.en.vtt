00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.490
 very good evening evenings friends of the 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.460
 whole world with you the kingfisher 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:55.460
 perfect for your account with jim aktual 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.460
 I am in these moments in front of 5 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.720
 We will hear 4 copies because it has 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:07.310
 brought duplicate four copies of 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:09.830
 four exuberant plants 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.100
 I do not know what term to use but the four 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.940
 plants are of them of more no 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.300
 power then there are three gross plants and 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.220
 there is a cactus that could not stop 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.280
 present it because it is a very plant 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.050
 pretty let's start now from the center that is 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.509
 the queen that 's why I've put two 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.380
 examples of saccades side considering 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:36.510
 that are his his real guard by the hand and 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.180
 I'm in front of a plant 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.800
 that it's called 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.170
 and fill in victory is written I do not believe 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.420
 victoria regia pronounced does 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.250
 well its pronunciation but it is a plant 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.280
 beautiful where you look if the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.070
 look from above it looks beautiful if you 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.110
 They look sideways witnesses in front 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.940
 It also looks pretty if you look at it from 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.840
 side is also beautiful I'm 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:08.459
 referring to a plant that is family 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.250
 of the empty ones already belongs to the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.370
 genre excuse me see agaves 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.770
 if I'm wrong but good belongs to 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.280
 group of the base saga and it is a plant 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:24.690
 very strong and very hard and there is is 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.430
 originally from mexico a cannon that we 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.920
 remember these moments but it is 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.100
 originally from mexico then look is 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.459
 it lasts hard and you touch it and it feels 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.110
 the plant lasts as it has a very root 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.090
 deep why I've put a 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.269
 high pot 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.550
 then this is your characteristic to say 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.769
 How nice and redundant friends would be 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.590
 the stories reflection to the plant that 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.959
 I always admired and I want to share 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.459
 with you now these moments looking 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.560
 the plant on all sides the 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.810
 people who collect for cactus or 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.910
 Crassas plants that's a must 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.489
 moral and civic of having this plant 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:09.920
 because it is very representative of the genre 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:14.599
 of the gender pardons of the group of 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:19.610
 fat plants since another reference of 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:21.890
 puebla let's see this plant that is 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.470
 it seems that's why I brought it because he 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.959
 It usually seems like it's pretty 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.100
 common lie that originates from 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.140
 South Africa is called alum before and 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.300
 you have a soybean input belongs to 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.480
 the family of the avalanches because they are not 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.489
 speaking and in our country in Peru what 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.680
 call Family eagles will 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.739
 they say xavi lagoon they say teeth of 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.989
 index shark that serves little to 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.540
 counteract the bad vibes of the 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.350
 bad that if it's not like that heard about 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.940
 your comments 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.850
 then you need to be able to 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.680
 information that is also native to 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.859
 South Africa 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:05.090
 and tell her how pretty she is too 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:08.150
 redundant with the 200 has to cost 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.049
 here we have a cactus 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:18.289
 a cactus that already talk about it too 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:21.820
 it would be like it would be redundant but it's the 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:24.110
 famous the equine captured without 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.610
 possibly Brazilian airline that what 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.699
 studied because it seems that is the last name 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.000
 of the Italian character I do not have many 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.680
 references about this plant but only 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.110
 I know it 's very beautiful and in many 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.360
 Sometimes I have affirmations to see if 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.690
 I show you an affirmation of a plant 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.449
 that I knew 25 years old a huge seat 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.150
 of mother-in-law they call it this plant 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:50.249
 has more the bad press says that the 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.429
 seat in the good area 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:55.499
 let's move from leaving for the last to 

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:59.609
 these are small because despite being 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:05:02.249
 little girls have their charm these 

00:04:59.609 --> 00:05:03.539
 plants I found out because I presented it 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:06.269
 long ago and did not know the name 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:11.429
 botanist only knew that he was 

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:13.919
 they said spider plant but a user 

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:18.179
 very local this gave me the information of 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:21.479
 that is called is called stretch of has said 

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:24.460
 the day of macri 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:27.160
 dense diadem 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.160
 happen because of the dangers they have 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.310
 they I knew him with the name of 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.979
 spider plantite whether spider plant it 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.889
 here and last year I had it very nice 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:42.849
 to which the son crimes of product and 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:46.500
 reproduce I think 453 son crimes and say 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:49.720
 the plant so that it keeps growing 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.819
 when it gives me a surprise that I like the 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.800
 three months that a moment of others 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.680
 begin to look at the little plant had 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.280
 had put the same plant like this 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:03.099
 I was surprised that there was 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.509
 had multiplied as it is here 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:06.759
 this is the plant I'm just 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.500
 showing a plant that curiously 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:10.300
 this plant of the year 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.690
 chicho serna dense that is also 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.190
 originally from South Africa had 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.540
 multiplied 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:22.420
 very curious the plant that was like that the 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.910
 movement has been transformed like that 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.850
 the plant has diversified into 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.040
 little plants that covered that form 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:33.520
 to multiply good friends of the rector 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.320
 I think I hope it served you something 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.600
 the information and friends 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.180

 reference of the succulent plants and I will be 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.790
