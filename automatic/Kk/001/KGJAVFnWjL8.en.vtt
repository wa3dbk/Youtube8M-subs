00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello all yourself hunter is this me 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.180
 tell you about the graphite block from home 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.340
 the big reactor and also show how it 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.780
 do and how to use so for 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.740
 start you need to craft 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.110
 graphite blog 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.540
 you can make it out of nine graphite 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.949
 ingots to get 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.130
 graphite ingot needed 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.550
 use either charcoal or wood 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.430
 coal 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.410
 process them in any furnace and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.560
 complete the process get graphite 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.579
 ingot one any coal one graphite 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.960
 sledak so let's get those charcoal 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.399
 best of course process 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.680
 charcoal so how to get it 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.540
 very simple unlike ordinary coal 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.140
 the more usually coal can still 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.550
 diverges for another craft and since 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.219
 only you get certain 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.829
 the number of graphite blocks you need 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.530
 they must be placed in the reactor 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.750
 for cooling and so here i have 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.010
 the rector works without cooling and we 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.719
 see the temperature 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.589
 how much energy does it produce and 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.589
 how many consumes fuel off and 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:19.590
 let's install these graphite ones 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:21.080
 blocks they are needed for cooling here 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:32.670
 set 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:35.750
 close and turn on again we see that 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.280
 the temperature first became lower 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.369
 the amount of energy that he developed 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.680
 the amount of fuel that has become higher 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.060
 it consumes has also become lower that is 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.780
 efficiency of this reactor 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.020
 increased and it's pretty and 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.790
 optimal parameters for these reactors 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.920
 in principle, you can instead of these 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.170
 graphite ingots more precisely blocks 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.990
 use other items for 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.640
 cooling for example from other mods here 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.490
 this liquid here is two sadists 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.890
 requisitioned red stone but by 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.330
 efficiency to be honest is not very 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.170
 much inferior 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.599
 ordinary graphite block but that 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.459
 the reactor produces a little more energy and 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.430
 consume again a little more 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.860
 fuel that is, if you bring the same 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.530
 Fuel consumption for the parameters 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.620
 energy will turn out the same thing all the more 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.340
 our graphite it cools the reactor better 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.940
 not much better but we are fine 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.730
 see also I tried with others 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.470
 thermal expansion fluids 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.989
 cool these reactors but nothing 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.480
 more efficient and better graphite block i 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.550
 I did not find that there is a graphite block 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.269
 first very simple craft second 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.940
 very effective work at least 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.670
 on this version of this mod as on 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.379
 previous honestly I do not know the version 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.050
 you can find out in the description for this 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.090
 video and put it on like 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.390
 subscribe to my channel and see you soon 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.390
 meeting
