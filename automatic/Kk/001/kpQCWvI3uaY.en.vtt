TEDDY: Performing in an arena in front of
20,000 people, it's like being in front of

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.879
the ocean. It's like being on top of a mountain.
My name is Teddy Forance. I'm from South Hampton,

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.180
Massachusetts. I realized I wanted to be a
professional when I won this competition called

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.199
Dance Masters of America. I was about ten
years old. And that just kind of gave you

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.519
a moment of, "Wow people recognize that I
love this so much. I can't wait to share it

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:34.940
with the world." It's deep in my blood and
it went all the way back to my great grandfather.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.870
In 1934 he opened up a studio and passed it
down to his daughter and then to my mom and

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:47.150
my aunt. I trained in ballet, in jazz, in
tap, in hip hop, in contemporary. My mom was

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.210
my dance teacher growing up. We have an amazing
connection and artistry together that when

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.780
we enter the studio we just go into this creative
zone. Being an artist is just culminating

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.030
all of your ideas and your experiences into what
is going to make you the best artist. I was

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.259
on the Cirque du Soleil tour so I would always
be surrounded by these extreme, extreme artistic

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:14.259
people that would take their movement and
their ideas to another whole dimension.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.330
It wasn't just about the steps. It wasn't about
the dance. It was about creating my atmosphere

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.730
and creating my essence fully and being my
own entity. When I'm on stage in front of

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.350
a bunch of people I close my eyes and bring
myself into this other realm. Artists go to

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.659
those deep places and sometimes it's hard
to stand for abstract movement like how do

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.729
you draw in a normal person to what you're
doing? My father is not a dancer and he always

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.070
says, "Teddy, if you can take me away in your 
movement, in your dance then you've been successful."
