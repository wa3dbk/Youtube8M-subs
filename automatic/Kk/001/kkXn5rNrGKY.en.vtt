00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.410
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.540
 problem 1 point 7.10 called steven 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.220
 universe and work works accordingly 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.290
 that I'm not going to download and install it and 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.060
 guys is a way also of steven 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.029
 universe like the one I brought you about 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.010
 days that had gems and which then 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.560
 alternate in the hand gave us powers and 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.660
 otherwise in this case it is a way that 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.430
 does just the opposite is true in the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.150
 previous case he asked me is that we had 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.010
 when I did not have them and in this case what 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.010
 I think the mods but the gems do not 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.200
 they work then well what was said what 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.480
 brings is all this worth we have here a 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.930
 lots of mods witnesses we have steven 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:55.000
 we have garnett to this bon and amet island 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:58.270
 me with and universe peridot but frei box 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.579
 a fire Jaspersen tapita this for example 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.100
 you never saw any chapter 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.320
 crystal lapis lazuli swing with wings and the 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.369
 tilde normal and good pile well guys 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.080
 dedicated of them 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.690
 when he dies he will give us the object that 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.580
 had just over it is worth for example 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.840
 steven gives us the burning of steven club and 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.670
 burning ruby 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.740
 ruby ruby gem 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.259
 this beautiful tau book written like 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.330
 what with and after we have friendship that 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.640
 gives us the gem of you got the me that we 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.770
 gives this kind of laser gun can 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.799
 be but good that does not work 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.810
 neither for example does he want us 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.090
 gives a series of cooked pork orders we 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.479
 gives the gem but he also 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.789
 frei cousin for example that was the 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.039
 this potato's pet that he's 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.810
 I put a gem that gave life I do not know if 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.670
 you remember an episode and that 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.560
 final have to beat him then the same 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.590
 It also appears and well 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.110
 basically some are allies other 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.060
 they are enemies and others are bosc d'en vale 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.950
 I will send each of them for the 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.470
 they gave the and apart as well as it is from 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.539
 life we ​​have good being in an order 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.700
 well, a little strange but good as 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.560
 I'm watching 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.069
 we also have the rous excavate that 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.539
 created with steven gem over a peak 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.670
 as you see you created as follows 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.980
 to 104 attack damage so I'm going to 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.110
 put here for example worth and 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.450
 then we also have the bag that in 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.300
 this case can not be eaten although in 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.750
 theory should be able to be the future worth 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.220
 with an egg and we would not get it 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.390
 can eat as I say it's worth it 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.790
 He warned I know I'm not going to even 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.010
 because it's useless then 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.070
 guys we have to start for example 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.450
 to see I'm going to put in his rival I hope not 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.280
 die, even if it moves a little 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.490
 we're going to nothing but here is for a point 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.180
 and other forms it is worth for a point 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.490
 ok ok now put garnett here 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.410
 that garnett is an offensive mode it's worth 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.150
 as having life for me but we're going with 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.520
 the sword is killing her quite 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.290
 quickly, as you can see, the gem gives me 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.720
 the gem is useless, not the 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.880
 we can place anywhere has not 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.460
 no craft is not created from any 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.980
 way and it does not give us any effect alters 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.360
 the hand then good because what was said 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.960
 it's just that the gems are not 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.970
 do they work 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.150
 we will dismiss the rose dig what are you 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.700
 seeing has 500 durability and 104 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.060
 attack damage as you see is a pass 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.560
 we have this bonus that that end is worth 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.180
 look at what is what happens they are very 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.820
 great for my taste you are worth as they are 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.010
 too big but good 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.780
 It's pretty cool, let's throw it away 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.290
 that you see that he gives us a written book if 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.090
 I'm not mistaken 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.620
 if it was a written book but it does not have 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.930
 nothing is worth the drawing if we give it as 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.510
 you see only looks blank and already 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.189
 we have to put that is also a way 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.900
 offensive much care with it's worth 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.519
 can kill her as you see or also the 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.620
 gem studying it very quickly 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.930
 because I have the sword but with a 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.120
 diamond sword you do not get it 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.129
 impossible is worth something else that is going 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.409
 forgetting is don moore appear by the 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.939
 night randomly as any 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.590
 another way as I'm seeing because 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.629
 it appears that I have a pettitte like you 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.549
 out there on that part and you have to put it 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.349
 in the dark or be very careful 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.489
 guys because the darkness appears to you 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.000
 the mods are worth we have adds universe is 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.799
 good 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.450
 directly is friendly has 5 life 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.510
 only when we kill him does he give us a 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.799
 cooked pork chop we have a year 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.310
 beware of the vale 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.009
 very well vote it dies dies ok goes 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.840
 perfect gives us this little thing that in this 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.909
 case then it should work 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.710
 I suppose I say the same if I put him 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.509
 arrows or the best that shoots arrows or 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.050
 something I will not get arrows in case 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:36.629
 the flies does not work not worth this 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.940
 it works for nothing so nothing you leave it 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.979
 over here and we already have a with and 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.440
 that that end we have here 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.789
 As you can see , a lot appears to those of the 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.340
 series that is super handsome as they have 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.770
 made the flame as you see me jump 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.690
 another book written also empty we have 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.879
 a pearl that is also a bit offensive 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.099
 very careful with it will kill her 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:58.139
 As you can see, it also gives us the gem that does not 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:00.750
 it serves for nothing we have peridot that 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.879
 it is also no longer we are offensive in a 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.129
 box is worth directly but good 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:08.310
 quickly with this sword has 90 of 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:10.740
 life after we have all this work 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.300
 here we will start by in this case 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.560
 steven who was the first one who wants 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.300
 take out but it has been the last one 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.639
 well steven that we are here as 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.000
 you are watching is a non-offensive mode is 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.340
 friendly 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.100
 he is very handsome uncle is very very cool 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.630
 but we're going to kill him and you're going to see 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.040
 that when we kill him he releases the one that 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.310
 is that the only one that is going to work already 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.540
 that when rummaging with a peak gives us the 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.180
 sword that is more important 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.890
 to kill in this case to be able to 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.410
 get the piece of sword we have 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.080
 also to freebo that as you can see 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.760
 life and life for us but good 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.800
 neither does life have only what 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.900
 we kill fast and he gives us a feint macri 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.690
 I'm going to leave is here we go to 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.330
 sapphire which is a non-offensive mode of 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:55.000
 friendly is worth it if we kill him 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.520
 will also loose his pearl we have 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.310
 kasper who is clear yes that is a very 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.990
 offensive is more is a boss and if I kill him 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.020
 as you see has in him 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:09.770
 the bed to hit them down here is worth 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:12.140
 because he gives us also his gem not 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.880
 we have make this peter is a way 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.980
 aggressive we find it also in the 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.810
 darkness has 10 life and well then 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.060
 he also kills him by way this way to 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.790
 crystal cream that is a kind of 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.340
 let's say schindler's list of glass or 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.410
 something like that and when we kill him he gives us a 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.080
 emerald is not bad weather we have 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.990
 to the pile of a liquor wings is a monkey 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.150
 offensive and good I can kill for 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.530
 get the gem since the turin stack 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.390
 normal that comes out with nothing in this case 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.520
 have a little more life if we kill her 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:44.060
 it also gives us the gem and good guys 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.860
 with this we have already finished the good mod 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.420
 also as you are seeing I have a map 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.220
 m put on a map that is by steven 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.870
 universe if you want to charge it I'm going to 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.440
 leave also in the description so that 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:56.120
 you catch it and well look what's 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.210
 inside is not cool enough is 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.740
 very very cool and then with this I think 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.600
