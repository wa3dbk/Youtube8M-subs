bit<00:00:31.000> of<00:00:31.119> a<00:00:31.180> shock<00:00:31.419> to<00:00:31.450> me<00:00:31.809> it's<00:00:32.470> a<00:00:32.500> little

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
bit of a shock to me it's a little

bit of a shock to me it's a little
colder<00:00:33.040> than<00:00:33.190> I<00:00:33.280> thought<00:00:33.430> it<00:00:33.640> would<00:00:33.730> be<00:00:34.470> I've

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
colder than I thought it would be I've

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.250 
colder than I thought it would be I've
collected<00:00:35.920> a<00:00:36.220> lot<00:00:36.370> of<00:00:36.399> firewood<00:00:36.940> but

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
collected a lot of firewood but

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.290 
collected a lot of firewood but
unfortunately<00:00:38.699> it's<00:00:39.699> not<00:00:39.789> very<00:00:40.120> well

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
unfortunately it's not very well

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.650 
unfortunately it's not very well
seasoned<00:00:40.809> it's<00:00:41.140> what<00:00:41.320> they<00:00:41.469> call<00:00:41.500> green<00:00:42.100> wood

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
seasoned it's what they call green wood

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.150 
seasoned it's what they call green wood
so<00:00:43.660> it<00:00:43.750> doesn't<00:00:44.050> burn<00:00:44.199> as<00:00:44.469> well<00:00:44.500> as<00:00:44.829> I'd<00:00:44.980> like

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
so it doesn't burn as well as I'd like

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.610 
so it doesn't burn as well as I'd like
to<00:00:45.190> now<00:00:46.149> during<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.480> summer<00:00:46.690> I<00:00:47.050> can<00:00:47.440> make

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
to now during the summer I can make

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.189 
to now during the summer I can make
domestic<00:00:48.129> hot<00:00:48.280> water<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:49.390> these<00:00:49.570> collectors

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
domestic hot water with these collectors

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.319 
domestic hot water with these collectors
these<00:00:50.949> homemade<00:00:51.309> collectors<00:00:51.789> you<00:00:51.940> can<00:00:52.120> see

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
these homemade collectors you can see

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.680 
these homemade collectors you can see
mount<00:00:53.109> it<00:00:53.260> on<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.499> porch<00:00:53.769> roof<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:55.329> in<00:00:55.570> the

mount it on the porch roof but in the
winter<00:00:55.989> there's<00:00:56.230> not<00:00:56.469> quite<00:00:56.829> enough<00:00:57.100> sunlight

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
winter there's not quite enough sunlight

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:03.239 
winter there's not quite enough sunlight
to<00:00:57.999> make<00:00:58.230> domestic<00:00:59.230> hot<00:00:59.409> water<00:00:59.909> so<00:01:00.909> I<00:01:02.249> put

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:03.249 
to make domestic hot water so I put

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:05.670 
to make domestic hot water so I put
together<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.640> system<00:01:04.230> with<00:01:05.230> my<00:01:05.440> wood<00:01:05.650> stove

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
together a system with my wood stove

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.850 
together a system with my wood stove
that<00:01:06.480> it's<00:01:07.480> not<00:01:07.690> only<00:01:07.900> used<00:01:08.200> to<00:01:08.409> heat<00:01:08.680> the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
that it's not only used to heat the

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.969 
that it's not only used to heat the
house<00:01:09.040> but<00:01:10.000> it's<00:01:10.149> used<00:01:10.360> to<00:01:10.540> generate<00:01:10.979> domestic

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
house but it's used to generate domestic

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:28.980 
house but it's used to generate domestic
hot<00:01:12.159> water<00:01:12.189> I<00:01:12.820> should<00:01:13.360> really<00:01:13.659> get<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:27.990> little

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
hot water I should really get a little

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:38.609 
hot water I should really get a little
persuasion<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.710> rest<00:01:35.890> of<00:01:36.039> it<00:01:36.159> still<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.409> lot

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
persuasion the rest of it still do a lot

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:51.219 
persuasion the rest of it still do a lot
of<00:01:38.770> meat<00:01:38.920> all<00:01:39.070> this<00:01:39.280> wood

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:02:01.180 

alright<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.409> will<00:01:52.560> fit<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.010> wood<00:01:53.190> stove

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.760 

so<00:02:02.190> this<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:03.050> this<00:02:04.050> is<00:02:04.140> about<00:02:04.290> all<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.590> what<00:02:04.740> I

more inside ok let's go inside the house
and<00:02:13.830> see<00:02:14.010> where<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.310> heat<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.580> coming<00:02:15.030> from

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
and see where the heat is coming from

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.080 
and see where the heat is coming from
that's<00:02:16.290> not<00:02:16.530> only<00:02:16.680> used<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.520> heat<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.880> house

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
that's not only used to heat the house

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.210 
that's not only used to heat the house
but<00:02:18.510> also<00:02:18.720> feed<00:02:19.650> our<00:02:19.890> hot<00:02:20.280> water<00:02:21.709> ok<00:02:22.709> there's<00:02:23.130> a

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
but also feed our hot water ok there's a

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.550 
but also feed our hot water ok there's a
little<00:02:23.760> white<00:02:23.970> workshop<00:02:24.720> with<00:02:24.959> we<00:02:25.170> have<00:02:25.350> a

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
little white workshop with we have a

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.430 
little white workshop with we have a
little<00:02:26.340> extra<00:02:26.610> firewood<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.450> here<00:02:27.750> little<00:02:28.140> too

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
little extra firewood in here little too

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.440 
little extra firewood in here little too
much<00:02:28.620> extra<00:02:29.010> firewood<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.580> guess<00:02:32.720> anyway<00:02:35.450> so

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
much extra firewood I guess anyway so

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.930 
much extra firewood I guess anyway so
here's<00:02:36.959> here's<00:02:37.920> basically<00:02:38.430> where<00:02:38.580> our<00:02:38.730> heat

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
here's here's basically where our heat

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.259 
here's here's basically where our heat
is<00:02:39.060> coming<00:02:39.239> from<00:02:39.590> from<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:40.830> stash<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:42.030> wood

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
is coming from from this stash of wood

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:53.600 
is coming from from this stash of wood
and<00:02:45.530> from<00:02:46.530> our<00:02:46.739> wood<00:02:47.340> stove<00:02:48.200> but<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:52.610> stones

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
and from our wood stove but the stones

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.420 
and from our wood stove but the stones
that<00:02:54.060> are<00:02:54.630> used<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.170> line<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.410> wall<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
that are used to line the wall and the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.920 
that are used to line the wall and the
chimney<00:02:57.440> supply<00:02:58.440> thermal<00:02:59.400> mass<00:02:59.610> to<00:03:00.120> moderate

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
chimney supply thermal mass to moderate

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.130 
chimney supply thermal mass to moderate
the<00:03:01.079> temperature<00:03:01.610> inside<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:03.030> house<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.209> we

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
the temperature inside the house so we

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.069 
the temperature inside the house so we
don't<00:03:04.290> have<00:03:04.470> always<00:03:04.769> have<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.160> have<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.340> same

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
don't have always have to have the same

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.440 
don't have always have to have the same
amount<00:03:07.079> of<00:03:07.200> heat<00:03:07.620> being<00:03:08.280> generated<00:03:08.400> by<00:03:09.390> the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
amount of heat being generated by the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.370 
amount of heat being generated by the
wood<00:03:10.350> stove<00:03:11.540> but<00:03:12.540> inside<00:03:14.540> between<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:16.019> cement

and when we want to gather heat from the
chimney<00:03:30.750> water<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:31.470> circulated<00:03:32.100> through<00:03:32.130> the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
chimney water is circulated through the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.870 
chimney water is circulated through the
copper<00:03:32.609> tubes<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:34.130> then<00:03:35.130> back<00:03:35.370> into<00:03:35.640> the

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
copper tubes and then back into the

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.199 
copper tubes and then back into the
storage<00:03:36.120> tank<00:03:36.980> anyway<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.609> is<00:03:38.760> how<00:03:38.940> it's

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
storage tank anyway this is how it's

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.960 
storage tank anyway this is how it's
possible<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.870> combine<00:03:40.079> a<00:03:41.630> wood<00:03:42.630> heating

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
possible to combine a wood heating

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.729 
possible to combine a wood heating
system<00:03:44.970> with<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:46.170> hot<00:03:46.709> water<00:03:47.030> system<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.739> we're

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
system with a hot water system and we're

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:56.120 
system with a hot water system and we're
using<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.250> same<00:03:51.079> storage<00:03:52.079> tanks<00:03:54.320> that<00:03:55.320> we<00:03:55.859> use

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
using the same storage tanks that we use

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.810 
using the same storage tanks that we use
in<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.730> summer<00:03:57.769> to<00:03:58.769> store<00:03:59.070> solar<00:03:59.430> heated

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
in the summer to store solar heated

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.559 
in the summer to store solar heated
water

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
water

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.069 
water
that<00:04:00.959> we're<00:04:01.200> using<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:01.859> the<00:04:01.980> winter<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:03.329> store

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
that we're using in the winter to store

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.309 
that we're using in the winter to store
wood<00:04:04.829> heated<00:04:05.159> water<00:04:05.810> anyway<00:04:06.810> that's<00:04:07.170> just

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
wood heated water anyway that's just

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.390 
wood heated water anyway that's just
something<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:07.709> wanted<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.010> share<00:04:08.159> with<00:04:08.340> you

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
something I wanted to share with you

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.440 
something I wanted to share with you
it's<00:04:08.730> sort<00:04:08.849> of<00:04:08.939> a<00:04:09.090> combined<00:04:09.780> system<00:04:11.209> you<00:04:12.209> could

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
it's sort of a combined system you could

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.360 
it's sort of a combined system you could
call<00:04:12.719> it<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:12.959> hybrid<00:04:13.170> system<00:04:13.769> but<00:04:13.950> normally<00:04:14.340> a

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
call it a hybrid system but normally a

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.270 
call it a hybrid system but normally a
hybrid<00:04:14.790> system<00:04:14.969> is<00:04:15.450> a<00:04:15.840> system<00:04:16.500> that<00:04:16.889> combines

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
hybrid system is a system that combines

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.710 
hybrid system is a system that combines
photovoltaics<00:04:17.820> with<00:04:18.479> solar<00:04:18.810> heating<00:04:19.579> anyway

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
photovoltaics with solar heating anyway

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.230 
photovoltaics with solar heating anyway
this<00:04:21.720> is<00:04:21.840> what<00:04:21.989> I've<00:04:22.079> been<00:04:22.109> up<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:23.210> for<00:04:24.210> the

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
this is what I've been up to for the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.240 
this is what I've been up to for the
last<00:04:24.330> couple<00:04:24.720> of<00:04:24.900> months<00:04:25.199> and<00:04:25.440> seems<00:04:26.009> to<00:04:26.160> be

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
last couple of months and seems to be

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.100 
last couple of months and seems to be
working<00:04:26.580> pretty<00:04:26.699> good<00:04:26.820> thought<00:04:27.750> I'd<00:04:27.900> share

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
working pretty good thought I'd share

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:36.730 
working pretty good thought I'd share
that<00:04:28.169> with<00:04:28.470> you

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740
