00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.490
 look good you have in front of you for the world's best-selling roadster 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:17.220
 how did mazda mx5 conquer this glory title first thanks to a boil 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.220
 friendly he continues 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.009
 we are sure that we will be able soon 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.130
 thanks to a very reasonable price 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.550
 about the design you can discover for yourself the charm 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.630
 stating that it was a series 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.930
 goals 20th birthday that has three four 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.930
 like these specific tasks 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.940
 and finally 17 alloy wheels 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.430
 before leaving the weather we are able 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.880
 the fully manual maneuver for less than five seconds is done 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.580
 with disconcerting ease 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.760
 in the other direction 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.760
 the operation claims a little more tone but is rather serene 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.220
 from the first turns of the wheel the pleasure announcing itself more obvious 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.530
 simple because the habits engine are so will have to be a 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.960
 sports claim 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.960
 he nevertheless accepts 6500 francs all his weight 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.300
 obvious thanks to a box control 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.700
 rustic leader with very cool lever overruns 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.900
 they also because it's a relatively light propulsion that 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.610
 more is 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.210
 and thanks to a fairly direct direction that gives a feeling of agility 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.950
 but our mx has a step that you risked 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.600
 as soon as the successive steering wheel blows the car takes a red almost unexpected 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.420
 driving pleasure 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.460
 but all the more flexibility for the costs of the door that attack on 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.880
 the title 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.659
 it is the comfort that comes out winning in the passage more or less that of 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:36.550
 suspensions 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.550
 even if on the other hand the noise level was raised even 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.410
 safety and braking issue arises no problem with distances 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.130
 seems quite sufficient 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.130
 so you can not hurt is not too much my childhood dagache question 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.200
 is a fair bit 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.990
 the chest displays in 56 games of confidence 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.990
 it's less than any city-dweller's titles that make a lot of sense 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.660
 these are not the few extra storage spaces in the cabin that 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.060
 will change something 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.060
 we still take the volume of astrakhan trunk to decathlon 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.369
 last point interesting the budget 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.749
 this limited series is charged 24 of 350 euros 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:16.359
 we can choose a normal version to 3300 euros with wheels of 16 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.589
 inches and without metallic paint 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:21.949
 the equipment we were wearing the essentials in all cases as explained the 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:25.099
 manual air conditioning 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.039
 this price seems in any case very reasonable approval food 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:30.949
 it's even one of the highlights of the car that makes driving fun and 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:32.239
 buddy is perfectly aware
