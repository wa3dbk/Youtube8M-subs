00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
proteins and it increases hair follicle

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.319 
proteins and it increases hair follicle
strength<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:24.859> ultimately<00:01:25.189> it<00:01:25.700> promotes

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
strength so ultimately it promotes

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.929
