00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.200 
thanks to enhanced vendetta next up
it'll<00:01:43.170> use<00:01:43.350> vanish<00:01:43.740> into<00:01:43.950> DFA<00:01:44.399> but<00:01:44.999> one<00:01:45.090> thing

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
it'll use vanish into DFA but one thing

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.370 
it'll use vanish into DFA but one thing
I<00:01:45.299> should<00:01:45.359> note<00:01:45.479> here<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.079> need<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
I should note here is that you need the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.889 
I should note here is that you need the
PvP<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:47.159> set<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.549> order<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.210> get<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.630> five

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
PvP for set in order to get the five

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.870 
PvP for set in order to get the five
common<00:01:49.140> points<00:01:49.469> from<00:01:49.560> vanish<00:01:50.009> now<00:01:50.249> when<00:01:50.759> you

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
common points from vanish now when you

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.020 
common points from vanish now when you
vanish<00:01:51.149> into<00:01:51.329> DFA<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.499> fa<00:01:52.740> maintains<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.520> 50%

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
vanish into DFA the fa maintains the 50%

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.370 
vanish into DFA the fa maintains the 50%
damage<00:01:54.509> boosts<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.929> get<00:01:55.049> from<00:01:55.140> Night

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
damage boosts that you get from Night

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.880 
damage boosts that you get from Night
Stalker

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
Stalker

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.429 
Stalker
so<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:56.640> essentially<00:01:56.969> going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.179> be<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.450> 80%

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
so it's essentially going to be a 80%

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.130 
so it's essentially going to be a 80%
enhanced<00:01:59.249> DFA<00:01:59.819> with<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> guaranteed<00:02:00.749> crit

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
enhanced DFA with a guaranteed crit

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.599 
enhanced DFA with a guaranteed crit
which<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.679> lead<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.950> some<00:02:02.130> pretty<00:02:02.159> crazy

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
which can lead to some pretty crazy

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.459 
which can lead to some pretty crazy
numbers<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.600> where<00:02:03.749> a<00:02:03.780> big<00:02:03.929> chunk<00:02:04.409> of

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
numbers and this is where a big chunk of

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.480 
numbers and this is where a big chunk of
your<00:02:04.590> damage<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.920> gonna<00:02:05.069> come<00:02:05.249> from

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
your damage is gonna come from

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.580 
your damage is gonna come from
so<00:02:05.969> after<00:02:06.210> DFA<00:02:06.539> it's<00:02:06.689> set<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.869> spam<00:02:07.140> dispatch

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
so after DFA it's set to spam dispatch

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.380 
so after DFA it's set to spam dispatch
because<00:02:07.829> your<00:02:08.069> target<00:02:08.369> should<00:02:08.550> be<00:02:08.610> below<00:02:08.910> 35%

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
because your target should be below 35%

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.330 
because your target should be below 35%
at<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:09.960> point<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.319> that's<00:02:10.890> pretty<00:02:11.130> much<00:02:11.250> how

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
at this point and that's pretty much how

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.250 
at this point and that's pretty much how
the<00:02:11.490> macro<00:02:11.819> works<00:02:12.030> now<00:02:12.600> let's<00:02:12.780> go<00:02:12.900> ahead<00:02:12.960> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the macro works now let's go ahead and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:28.080 
the macro works now let's go ahead and
actually<00:02:13.530> test<00:02:13.770> this<00:02:13.890> out<00:02:14.010> on<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> target

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.820 

alright<00:02:29.090> guys<00:02:29.239> that's<00:02:29.420> pretty<00:02:29.510> much<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:30.110> put

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
alright guys that's pretty much it I put

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.289 
alright guys that's pretty much it I put
together<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:31.099> little<00:02:31.250> montage<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.879> demonstrate

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
together a little montage to demonstrate

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.300 
together a little montage to demonstrate
the<00:02:32.420> macro<00:02:32.659> and<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.810> few<00:02:32.959> PvP<00:02:33.319> scenarios<00:02:33.739> but

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
the macro and a few PvP scenarios but

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.500 
the macro and a few PvP scenarios but
before<00:02:34.549> I<00:02:34.580> let<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.819> play<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.060> want<00:02:35.269> to<00:02:35.360> just

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
before I let that play I want to just

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.420 
before I let that play I want to just
touch<00:02:35.599> on<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.810> few<00:02:35.870> things<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.709> first<00:02:36.739> is<00:02:37.129> this

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
touch on a few things the first is this

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.160 
touch on a few things the first is this
Mac<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.730> was<00:02:37.849> extremely<00:02:38.150> orangey<00:02:38.720> dependent

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
Mac it was extremely orangey dependent

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.000 
Mac it was extremely orangey dependent
there's<00:02:39.349> gonna<00:02:39.500> be<00:02:39.650> times<00:02:39.799> where<00:02:39.950> you're

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
there's gonna be times where you're

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.680 
there's gonna be times where you're
gonna<00:02:40.099> be<00:02:40.280> hitting<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.640> lot<00:02:40.849> harder<00:02:41.030> on<00:02:41.330> one

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
gonna be hitting a lot harder on one

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.180 
gonna be hitting a lot harder on one
target<00:02:41.840> than<00:02:42.110> you<00:02:42.170> would<00:02:42.349> on<00:02:42.530> another<00:02:42.860> target

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
target than you would on another target

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.430 
target than you would on another target
and<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:44.180> also<00:02:44.329> really<00:02:44.450> gear<00:02:44.870> dependent<00:02:45.290> if

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
and it's also really gear dependent if

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.360 
and it's also really gear dependent if
you<00:02:45.530> don't<00:02:45.650> have<00:02:45.769> gear<00:02:45.950> you're<00:02:46.069> not<00:02:46.159> gonna<00:02:46.250> be

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
you don't have gear you're not gonna be

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.770 
you don't have gear you're not gonna be
hitting<00:02:46.610> nearly<00:02:47.090> as<00:02:47.180> hard<00:02:47.299> as<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.540> would<00:02:47.690> if

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
hitting nearly as hard as you would if

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.690 
hitting nearly as hard as you would if
you<00:02:47.870> were<00:02:47.900> actually<00:02:48.110> geared<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.680> with<00:02:49.549> that

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
you were actually geared and with that

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.860 
you were actually geared and with that
I'm<00:02:49.849> gonna<00:02:49.940> go<00:02:50.120> ahead<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.299> let<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.540> montage

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
I'm gonna go ahead and let the montage

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.059 
I'm gonna go ahead and let the montage
play<00:02:51.079> if<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:51.200> have<00:02:51.290> any<00:02:51.409> questions<00:02:51.769> feel<00:02:51.980> free

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069
