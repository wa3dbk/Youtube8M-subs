I<00:00:00.060> have<00:00:00.480> started<00:00:01.700> to<00:00:02.700> discover<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.570> specific

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
I have started to discover a specific

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.160 
I have started to discover a specific
army<00:00:04.500> unit<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:05.100> Germany<00:00:05.490> where<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.600> soldiers

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
army unit and Germany where the soldiers

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.040 
army unit and Germany where the soldiers
are<00:00:07.730> researching<00:00:08.730> camouflage<00:00:09.420> technology

are researching camouflage technology

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.190 
are researching camouflage technology
and<00:00:10.380> they're<00:00:11.280> building<00:00:11.490> decoy<00:00:12.059> weapons<00:00:12.540> so

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
and they're building decoy weapons so

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.980 
and they're building decoy weapons so
that<00:00:13.380> means<00:00:13.620> they're<00:00:14.160> sort<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.630> from<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> very

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
that means they're sort of from a very

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.930 
that means they're sort of from a very
different<00:00:16.320> angle<00:00:16.710> than<00:00:17.160> an<00:00:17.310> artist<00:00:17.789> but

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
different angle than an artist but

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.429 
different angle than an artist but
they're<00:00:18.119> still<00:00:18.390> in<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.869> bill<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.320> the

they're still in the bill in the
business<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.070> creating<00:00:20.220> illusions<00:00:21.029> and

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
business of creating illusions and

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.420 
business of creating illusions and
that's<00:00:21.960> something<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.619> found<00:00:22.859> immensely

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.640 
that's something that I found immensely
interesting<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.150> that's<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:25.080> reason<00:00:25.439> why<00:00:25.619> I

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650

what<00:01:12.580> they<00:01:12.820> are<00:01:12.939> making<00:01:13.149> was<00:01:14.080> resembling<00:01:14.860> very

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
what they are making was resembling very

that<00:01:40.409> reflects<00:01:41.409> on<00:01:42.539> disguise<00:01:43.539> and<00:01:43.959> deception

00:01:44.839 --> 00:01:44.849 
that reflects on disguise and deception

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:47.790 
that reflects on disguise and deception
also<00:01:45.849> as<00:01:46.060> a<00:01:46.090> metaphor<00:01:46.599> for<00:01:46.660> photography<00:01:47.470> as

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
photography has proven to be an ideal

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.550 
photography has proven to be an ideal
instrument<00:01:51.069> to<00:01:52.000> create<00:01:52.720> disguising

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
instrument to create disguising

deception

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.890 

so<00:01:57.510> this<00:01:57.660> image<00:01:57.870> behind<00:01:58.350> me<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:59.690> sort<00:02:00.690> of<00:02:00.750> an

so this image behind me is sort of an
invisibility<00:02:01.410> cloak<00:02:01.920> for<00:02:02.580> a<00:02:02.970> vehicle<00:02:03.810> with<00:02:04.290> a

sort of shielding the heat of the motor
what<00:02:16.710> they<00:02:16.890> did<00:02:17.130> here<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:18.110> they've<00:02:19.110> been

these<00:02:24.030> do<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.300> they<00:02:24.480> collect<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.230> moisture<00:02:25.410> of

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
these do is they collect the moisture of

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.980 
these do is they collect the moisture of
the<00:02:25.980> air<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.640> code<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.150> as<00:02:27.630> Marshall

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
the air and the code and as Marshall

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.310 
the air and the code and as Marshall
crystallize<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.040> form<00:02:29.540> like<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.570> cold<00:02:30.930> shield

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
crystallize and form like a cold shield

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.750 
crystallize and form like a cold shield
so<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.590> cannot<00:02:31.920> see<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.250> warmth<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:32.700> the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
so you cannot see the warmth of the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.240 
so you cannot see the warmth of the
motor<00:02:33.090> underneath<00:02:33.660> with<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.230> thermal<00:02:34.650> camera

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
motor underneath with the thermal camera

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.700 
motor underneath with the thermal camera
because<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.880> lot<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.420> things<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.990> lot<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.620> the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
because a lot of the things a lot of the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.920 
because a lot of the things a lot of the
decoys<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.730> crafting<00:02:39.180> are<00:02:39.300> actually<00:02:39.720> not

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
decoys the crafting are actually not

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.370 
decoys the crafting are actually not
that<00:02:40.230> much<00:02:41.100> for<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.550> for<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.880> human<00:02:42.150> eye<00:02:42.380> but

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
that much for the for the human eye but

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.400 
that much for the for the human eye but
for<00:02:43.800> sort<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.520> multi-sensory<00:02:45.230> system<00:02:46.230> as

for sort of the multi-sensory system as

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.410 
for sort of the multi-sensory system as
they<00:02:46.590> described<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.490> for<00:02:47.730> infrared

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
they described it it's for infrared

the<00:02:57.510> reason<00:02:57.930> why<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.980> chose<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.820> combine<00:03:00.630> my<00:03:00.989> own

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
the reason why I chose to combine my own

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.370 
the reason why I chose to combine my own
work<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.739> his<00:03:01.890> show<00:03:02.130> with<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.570> work<00:03:03.810> that's

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
work in his show with the work that's

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.290 
work in his show with the work that's
been<00:03:04.650> like<00:03:05.040> images<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.820> work<00:03:06.000> that's<00:03:06.209> been

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
been like images of the work that's been

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.770 
been like images of the work that's been
produced<00:03:06.870> at<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.380> Army<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.940> this<00:03:09.630> is

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
produced at the Army is that this is

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.530 
produced at the Army is that this is
also<00:03:09.989> how<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.800> contact<00:03:11.340> first<00:03:11.670> came<00:03:12.390> to

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
also how the contact first came to

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.260 
also how the contact first came to
happen<00:03:13.520> these<00:03:14.520> technicians<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:15.209> I

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
happen these technicians that I

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.550 
happen these technicians that I
interviewed<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.140> soldiers<00:03:16.440> we

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
interviewed and the soldiers we

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.910 
interviewed and the soldiers we
connected<00:03:17.040> very<00:03:17.310> much<00:03:17.570> about<00:03:18.590> using<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.709> same

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
connected very much about using the same

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.510 
connected very much about using the same
materials<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:21.060> using<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.230> same<00:03:22.489> sort<00:03:23.489> of

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
materials and using the same sort of

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.449 
materials and using the same sort of
crafting<00:03:24.420> processes<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:26.010> was<00:03:26.130> extremely

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
crafting processes and I was extremely

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.820 
crafting processes and I was extremely
interesting<00:03:27.150> for<00:03:27.390> me<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.510> see<00:03:27.660> how<00:03:28.320> art<00:03:28.590> can

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
interesting for me to see how art can

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.030 
interesting for me to see how art can
actually<00:03:29.520> build<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.060> bridge<00:03:30.300> between<00:03:30.690> people

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
actually build a bridge between people

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.650 
actually build a bridge between people
to<00:03:32.040> talk<00:03:32.250> about<00:03:32.280> something<00:03:32.790> who<00:03:33.480> actually
