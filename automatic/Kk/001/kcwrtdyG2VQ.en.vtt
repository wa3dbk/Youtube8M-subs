00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.300
 Toriyama begins to have a 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.320
 participation in the films designing

 as it has the characteristic of having a 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.800
 very sensitive ear and with a capacity 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.200
 auditory superior to that of humans 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.970
 but this implies a weakness for 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.590
 piccolo before high noise 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.990

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.030
 which includes that villain look of the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.580
 fourth movie is an idea of ​​toriyama 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.650
 it was Toriyama's idea that the mediums 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.260
 had weakness to loud noises 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.270

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.000
 the idea of portraying goku occurred 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.610
 pseudo super saiyan in this movie with 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.040
 a hairstyle like the ssj parrado that more 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.800
 forward it was revealed in the manga that is 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.080
 the 4th movie of de bz was designed by 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.300
 toy animation to portray the legend 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.700
 of the ssj in an alternate way to the 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.470
 told in the manga not in a fight with 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.570
 an intergalactic emperor in another 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.280
 planet but a simpler story 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.710

 ssj or something like wind and without many 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.460
 ideas consult toriyama and he mentions 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.680
 that could be a little with the hair 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.560
 parrado so to speak the hairstyle of 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.910
 pre ssj is design of toriyama while 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.280
 that the rest is the work of tui 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.380
 also the villain of this movie was 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.750
 designed by toriyama in its two forms 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.140
 before and after being rejuvenated by 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.140

 totally different design used by 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.000
 everything and in the pre ssj here it is imposed that 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.069
 in this part of the anime despite being 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.989
 a movie you use the same model already 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.900
 unfounded in the manga during the battle 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.790
 with frezer holler toriyama contributes 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.790

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.620
 of the main wrathful villain cental and 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.250
 Toriyama not only brings the design 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.820
 decoder but that of his henchmen 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.220

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.410
 original form and its transformation the 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.480
 androids 14 and 15 and once again toriyama 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.370
 he also designed the other enemies to 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.160
 fight as seen in the sketch 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.470
 original toriyama appointed the android 15 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.270
 like the giant and the little one like 14 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.910
 but in the anime there was an error and 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.970
 they put the names upside down movie 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.860

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.450
 sizes the characteristics of brolin 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.820
 as the fact of not carrying any 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.950
 armor sayayin since it never worked 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.680

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.900
 design for its legendary ssj shape with 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.120
 a remarkable musculature and a tail in the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.010
 design of broli element omitted in the 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.430
 adaptation to anime due to issues of 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.430
 libretto 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.970
 movie 9 the galaxy runs danger I'm going 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.190
 Once again Toriyama elaborates 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.440
 charismatic designs of the antagonists 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.510
 for this movie and they could not miss 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.510
 the henchmen illustrated by toriyama 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.919
 movie 13 the dragon attack for the 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.199
 movie toriyama did not work in the 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.300
 design of some enemy but he designed 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.669
 exclusive guest characters for 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.590
 this movie toriyama designed this 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.750
 great warrior and during the whole process 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.000
 and animation considered calling it tapioca 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.729
 but thanks to toriyama's suggestion his 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.949
 name ended up being tapial wines no longer 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:52.300
 it was also the design of toriyama but 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.300
 also his brother my girlfriend 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.490
 the dragon movie box the green box of 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.289
 the movies contains a pencil drawing 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.910
 of cookie on a yellow paper 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.800
 illustrated by Akira himself 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.830
 toriyama leaving his opinion in general 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.080
 of all the movies my most sincere 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.720
 thanks to all those who 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.180
 they bought the dragon ball movie box with 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.789
 these movies the dragon series 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.949
 box finally come to an end in the 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.960
 most of the cases with the movies the 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.699
 screenwriters used their techniques 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.370
 wonderful to write a story 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:28.669
 novel based on my work 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.919
 original is to say the manga the work 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.840
 original is developed in such a way that 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.849
 it is difficult to reach stories 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.250
 secondary so I think that really 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:40.009
 with the movies he made a good 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.530
 work I was very busy during the 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.870
 serialization so I could not help 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.940
 but from time to time the producer 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.220
 I was asking to design a character 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.870
 original enemy for the cinema so that 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.080
 it was the only time that he collaborated with me 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.210
 them a little bit but boy was it hard to 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.250
 Although he had all the characters 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.390
 of strong appearance that appear in the 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.790
 manga is already 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.100
 in my material limit but still 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.950
 I had to think about stronger designs 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.810
 for the movies they are all really 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.360
 as a strong working group that 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.420
 elaborates with a lot of pressure however 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.680
 this allowed them to make the movies 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.770
 incredible that are so powerful and 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.630
 effective so that I complain as the 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.850
 creator of dragon ball I am 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.310
 fully aware of what they are 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.410
 good stories based on the manga and 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.600
 these stories are blessed by their 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.640
 fans and anime producers 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.730
 TV specials on dragon ball 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.830
 z of bz special 1 nac atsur cat 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.750
 tsuyoshi made the original designs of 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.390
 bard and his squad however 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.190
 toriyama modified them later 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:45.350
 bardot the final model of bard by 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.360
 toriyama also the final models 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.760
 for the bard squadron along with their 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.830
 names were the work of toriyama at the end 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.340
 Bards would become a character 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.340
 of the manga 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.009
 I say goodbye people until next time
