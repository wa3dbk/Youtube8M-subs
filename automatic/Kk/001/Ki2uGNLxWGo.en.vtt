00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:06.240
 The number of contracts has exceeded 100 million and has penetrated the world of children 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.870
 Mobile phones become more convenient while children are involved in crime 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.000
 In mobile phone companies that cases are increasing 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.180
 Restrict access to dating sites and other harmful sites 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.180
 Provided a filtering service 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.949
 On January 1st, the Youth Net Regulation Act came into effect 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.670
 Filtering service has become incumbent 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.710
 Mr. Endo is a mobile phone with a child 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.100
 There is also an opinion that you should not wait in the first place 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.700
 Some parents want to keep you on the safe side of going to school 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.760
 Well, just the mobile phone has become so familiar 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.269
 I from 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.819
 Well there is also a thing that I will not hold it from now on 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:52.819
 It may be, but what should I do 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.720
 That is to say, mobile phone companies access harmful sites 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.400
 Make a service called limiting filtering 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.860
 I'm doing to 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.390
 For the mobile phone used by under 18 years old by this law 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.930
 It can not be removed without the parental consent for filtering 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.970
 It has become 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.340
 You were obligated to the principle 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.260
 At Famitsu.com, that access in advance 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.359
 We have collected categories to prohibit 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:26.740
 Specifically targeted for categories that were cashed or debited 

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:27.470
 To do 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.660
 Internet information site called US and net star 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.190
 There are separate singers to collect 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.210
 According to the survey data 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.290
 Do you want to prohibit writing that restricts access 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.500
 I'm sorry 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.090
 For those underage use 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.100
 From last summer 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.960
 I opened a misunderstanding at the main store with direct mail 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.310
 In principle, we have restricted access 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.150
 Uneasy sailing 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.910
 It is this December, but 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.250
 Especially that access restriction 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.300
 Japanese 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.440
 If I didn't even know that 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.590
 It is said that the first fire starts automatically 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.840
 It corresponded by the ground 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.989
 Other markers 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.980
 Upload site to the Gimpo site is also an issue 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.320
 Physically, to the year issue 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.669
 Self-introduction 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.069
 Various personal information is exchanged 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.450
 There is a risk that it will be involved in bullying and crimes 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.879
 It is called 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.340
 I'm being swayed, what a merchant site 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.000
 That's 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.810
 There is something that is suitable for minors in the US 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.639
 is not it 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.689
 So-called advanced communication site 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.749
 How is it really pointed out that 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:38.119
 I do not think that Takada Shigeru is 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:39.079
 In that 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.879
 I also think that it will be out of the filtering list of s 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:42.939
 You can 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.010
 In principle, the governor of Osaka Prefecture is banned from bringing in cell phones. 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.659
 ing 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.369
 It is one of the major causes 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:53.019
 But what should I do at the meeting? 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.310
 It is reference making of rule of cell-phone at home clearly 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.579
 I have an intention to feed 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.469
 It is also a check sheet of the result 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:02.459
 ing 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.449
 Do not make a book in Mt. Takano etc 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.209
 Be concrete 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.420
 The reason why this is good is why you should not 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.880
 Aoto can see this and explain appropriately to children 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.919
 Right 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:18.899
 There are no difficult items to explain in the world 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:23.359
 The power of children to use information properly in this law 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.259
 It is that Mayama information literacy improves 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:28.999
 You are touching me a lot 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:32.159
 Not only children but also teachers 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.829
 And 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.439
 US parents too 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.670
 After that, the fall in the market price where the ability to utilize US information should increase 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:38.649
 doing 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.559
 First of all, it doesn't go first 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:42.899
 Teacher or 

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:44.729
 Parents too 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.369
 I'm still studying with my cell phone and information literacy 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:48.220
 is not it 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.589
 That's about it 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:53.079
 It became like this time, but it is still reviewed 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.679
 I wonder if it makes me feel like it will 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:56.829
 I think so
