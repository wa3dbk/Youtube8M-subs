you<00:01:40.770> buy<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.009> close<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.729> don't<00:01:41.909> discover

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
you buy it close and you don't discover

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.539 
you buy it close and you don't discover
till<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.810> get<00:01:42.869> home<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.110> your<00:01:43.530> brush<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.430> all

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
till you get home that your brush is all

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.929 
till you get home that your brush is all
messed<00:01:44.759> up<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.630> yeah<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.740> I'll<00:01:46.860> show<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
messed up but yeah so I'll show you the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.109 
messed up but yeah so I'll show you the
comparison<00:01:48.420> between<00:01:48.689> brush<00:01:49.140> size<00:01:49.909> so<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.000> can

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
comparison between brush size so you can

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.300 
comparison between brush size so you can
see<00:01:51.270> quite<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.720> big<00:01:52.020> difference<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.649> size<00:01:52.860> here

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
see quite a big difference in size here

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.420 
see quite a big difference in size here
the<00:01:53.520> pink<00:01:53.850> one<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.210> much<00:01:54.360> flatter<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.990> wider

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
the pink one is much flatter and wider

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.249 
the pink one is much flatter and wider
whereas<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.850> green<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.420> very<00:01:57.600> thin<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
whereas the green one is very thin and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.560 
whereas the green one is very thin and
small<00:01:58.850> definitely<00:01:59.850> not<00:02:00.000> an<00:02:00.090> OPI<00:02:00.420> brush<00:02:02.570> what

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
small definitely not an OPI brush what

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.420 
small definitely not an OPI brush what
you<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.719> also<00:02:03.869> do<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.320> wipe<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.860> polish<00:02:05.219> off

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
you can also do is wipe the polish off

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.479 
you can also do is wipe the polish off
of<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.880> wand<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.450> check<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.930> see<00:02:06.960> if<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.979> OPI

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
of the wand and check to see if the OPI

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.999 
of the wand and check to see if the OPI
name<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.090> printed<00:02:09.539> at<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.690> top<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.649> I'll<00:02:10.830> show

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
name is printed at the top so I'll show

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.610 
name is printed at the top so I'll show
that<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.430> if<00:02:11.489> my<00:02:11.520> autofocus<00:02:12.180> will<00:02:12.360> let

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.390 

so<00:02:15.620> I'm<00:02:15.680> not<00:02:15.799> sure<00:02:15.860> if<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.430> can<00:02:16.549> see<00:02:16.909> that<00:02:18.400> you

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
so I'm not sure if you can see that you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.820 
so I'm not sure if you can see that you
see<00:02:19.579> like<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.849> O<00:02:19.879> and<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.239> PE<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.569> think

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.530 

yeah<00:02:27.490> so<00:02:27.670> those<00:02:27.760> are<00:02:27.940> three<00:02:28.090> things<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.360> can

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
yeah so those are three things you can

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.440 
yeah so those are three things you can
check<00:02:28.720> for<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.200> then<00:02:29.830> also<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.760> might<00:02:31.090> be<00:02:31.270> wise

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
check for and then also it might be wise

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.750 
check for and then also it might be wise
to<00:02:31.480> look<00:02:31.900> at<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.470> serial<00:02:33.220> number<00:02:33.280> if<00:02:33.640> your

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
to look at a serial number if your

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.640 
to look at a serial number if your
borrows<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.030> serial<00:02:34.330> number<00:02:34.360> then<00:02:34.780> it's<00:02:35.290> likely

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
borrows a serial number then it's likely

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.890 
borrows a serial number then it's likely
that<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:35.980> also<00:02:36.460> real<00:02:36.670> this<00:02:36.910> one<00:02:37.090> has<00:02:37.720> it

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
that it is also real this one has it

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.640 
that it is also real this one has it
printed<00:02:38.230> right<00:02:38.350> here<00:02:40.140> I'm<00:02:41.140> not<00:02:41.230> sure<00:02:41.380> if<00:02:41.560> you

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
printed right here I'm not sure if you

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.670 
printed right here I'm not sure if you
can<00:02:41.800> tell<00:02:42.930> there's<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.020> steel<00:02:44.200> number<00:02:44.500> right

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
can tell there's a steel number right

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.630 
can tell there's a steel number right
along<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.040> bottom<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:47.710> then<00:02:47.860> this<00:02:47.980> one<00:02:48.250> has

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
along the bottom and then this one has

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.040 
along the bottom and then this one has
absolutely<00:02:49.120> no<00:02:49.270> sign<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.690> serial<00:02:50.020> number

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
absolutely no sign of a serial number

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.700 
absolutely no sign of a serial number
like<00:02:50.440> anywhere<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:53.880> yeah<00:02:55.410> but<00:02:56.410> other<00:02:56.530> than

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
like anywhere so yeah but other than

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.550 
like anywhere so yeah but other than
those<00:02:56.890> few<00:02:57.310> main<00:02:57.670> things<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.840> jump<00:02:59.290> out<00:02:59.410> at

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
those few main things that jump out at

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.170 
those few main things that jump out at
me<00:02:59.590> there's<00:03:00.190> also<00:03:00.370> like<00:03:00.640> some<00:03:00.880> smaller

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
me there's also like some smaller

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.510 
me there's also like some smaller
details<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.870> can<00:03:02.110> maybe<00:03:02.500> pinpoint<00:03:03.100> if<00:03:03.280> you

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
details you can maybe pinpoint if you

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.670 
details you can maybe pinpoint if you
used<00:03:04.240> a<00:03:04.450> lot<00:03:04.630> of<00:03:04.720> OPI<00:03:05.020> and<00:03:05.200> you're<00:03:05.320> really<00:03:05.500> used

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
used a lot of OPI and you're really used

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.870 
used a lot of OPI and you're really used
to<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:05.890> brand<00:03:06.130> like<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.550> could<00:03:06.730> tell<00:03:06.850> right

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
to the brand like I could tell right

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.430 
to the brand like I could tell right
away<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.390> smell<00:03:07.630> was<00:03:07.810> different

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
away the smell was different

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.990 
away the smell was different
don't<00:03:08.890> go<00:03:08.980> smelling<00:03:09.280> nail<00:03:09.400> polish<00:03:09.670> of<00:03:09.760> course

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
don't go smelling nail polish of course

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.940 
don't go smelling nail polish of course
but<00:03:10.240> there's<00:03:11.050> smells<00:03:11.230> definitely<00:03:11.620> different

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
but there's smells definitely different

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.980 
but there's smells definitely different
and<00:03:12.070> then<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.520> formula<00:03:13.000> was<00:03:13.180> way<00:03:13.420> off<00:03:13.630> it<00:03:13.870> was

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
and then the formula was way off it was

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.870 
and then the formula was way off it was
so<00:03:14.230> much<00:03:14.380> thinner<00:03:14.710> and<00:03:14.950> funnier<00:03:15.280> than<00:03:15.460> an<00:03:15.610> OPI

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
so much thinner and funnier than an OPI

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.000 
so much thinner and funnier than an OPI
nail<00:03:16.000> polish<00:03:16.240> would<00:03:16.450> be<00:03:16.570> so<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:17.650> can<00:03:17.770> look<00:03:17.830> for

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
nail polish would be so you can look for

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.140 
nail polish would be so you can look for
clues<00:03:18.160> like<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.400> as<00:03:18.520> well<00:03:18.550> but<00:03:18.880> I<00:03:18.940> mean

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
clues like that as well but I mean

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.930 
clues like that as well but I mean
there's<00:03:19.780> definitely<00:03:20.200> some<00:03:20.440> big<00:03:20.940> pointers

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
there's definitely some big pointers

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.300 
there's definitely some big pointers
here<00:03:22.120> that<00:03:22.560> prove<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.680> me<00:03:23.770> that<00:03:23.800> this<00:03:24.100> one's

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
here that prove to me that this one's

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.850 
here that prove to me that this one's
fake<00:03:24.520> so<00:03:24.820> overall<00:03:25.780> though<00:03:25.990> they've<00:03:26.680> done<00:03:26.830> a

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
fake so overall though they've done a

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.520 
fake so overall though they've done a
pretty<00:03:27.070> good<00:03:27.190> job<00:03:27.310> you<00:03:27.640> can<00:03:27.760> see<00:03:28.110> it's<00:03:29.110> almost

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
pretty good job you can see it's almost

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.699 
pretty good job you can see it's almost
identical<00:03:29.980> however<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:31.300> brush<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:32.110> mean<00:03:32.530> the

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
identical however the brush I mean the

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.070 
identical however the brush I mean the
lid<00:03:33.010> is<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.640> lot<00:03:33.910> shinier<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.450> lot<00:03:34.600> blacker<00:03:34.930> I

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
lid is a lot shinier a lot blacker I

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.390 
lid is a lot shinier a lot blacker I
don't<00:03:35.320> know<00:03:35.410> if<00:03:35.620> it's<00:03:35.830> showing<00:03:36.190> up<00:03:36.250> on<00:03:36.370> camera

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
don't know if it's showing up on camera

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
this of course but I mean this one is a

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.400 
this of course but I mean this one is a
case<00:04:07.390> where<00:04:07.630> it's<00:04:07.750> pretty<00:04:07.930> obvious<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:08.350> know

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
case where it's pretty obvious I know

case where it's pretty obvious I know
that<00:04:08.770> people<00:04:09.070> sometimes<00:04:09.700> do<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.060> lot<00:04:10.270> better<00:04:11.130> at

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300
