nowadays<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.560> even<00:02:22.770> higher<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.580> according

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
nowadays and even higher but according

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.630 
nowadays and even higher but according
to<00:02:24.150> Apple<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.900> human<00:02:25.350> eye<00:02:25.470> can't<00:02:26.070> see<00:02:26.160> beyond

to Apple the human eye can't see beyond

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.990 
to Apple the human eye can't see beyond
the<00:02:27.650> 323<00:02:28.650> which<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.160> retina<00:02:29.430> resolution

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
the 323 which is the retina resolution

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000 
the 323 which is the retina resolution
and<00:02:30.150> Apple<00:02:30.960> has<00:02:31.110> actually<00:02:31.440> added<00:02:31.710> a<00:02:31.800> few<00:02:31.950> more

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
and Apple has actually added a few more

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.700 
and Apple has actually added a few more
so<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.880> pixel<00:02:33.090> per<00:02:33.330> inch<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.630> actually<00:02:34.020> enough

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
so the pixel per inch is actually enough

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.770 
so the pixel per inch is actually enough
for<00:02:35.130> watching<00:02:35.520> videos<00:02:35.910> playing<00:02:35.940> games<00:02:36.540> and
