after<00:04:45.509> about<00:04:45.629> six<00:04:45.960> months<00:04:46.020> of<00:04:46.289> eating<00:04:46.560> these

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
after about six months of eating these

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.790 
after about six months of eating these
it's<00:04:48.510> really<00:04:48.720> not<00:04:48.840> a<00:04:48.900> bad<00:04:49.110> way<00:04:49.260> to<00:04:49.320> go

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.410 

I<00:04:54.830> think<00:04:55.550> I<00:04:55.610> would<00:04:55.790> have<00:04:55.850> preferred<00:04:56.210> it<00:04:56.330> if

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.640 
I think I would have preferred it if
there<00:04:56.600> was<00:04:56.690> a<00:04:56.720> little<00:04:56.870> more<00:04:57.050> chocolate<00:04:57.440> sauce
