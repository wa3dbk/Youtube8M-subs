00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
salute cartridge on the cricket and she

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.060 
salute cartridge on the cricket and she
actually<00:00:53.469> did<00:00:53.800> a<00:00:53.829> really<00:00:54.129> cool<00:00:55.710> texture<00:00:56.710> on

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
actually did a really cool texture on

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.470 
actually did a really cool texture on
the<00:00:57.760> front<00:00:58.059> of<00:00:58.269> her<00:00:58.600> of<00:00:58.899> her<00:00:59.620> suitcase<00:01:00.339> but<00:01:01.210> I

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
the front of her of her suitcase but I

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.840 
the front of her of her suitcase but I
didn't<00:01:01.899> because<00:01:02.710> I<00:01:02.949> was<00:01:03.069> doing<00:01:03.309> four<00:01:03.519> of<00:01:03.670> them

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
didn't because I was doing four of them

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.850 
didn't because I was doing four of them
I<00:01:04.150> decided<00:01:04.750> I<00:01:04.989> would<00:01:05.050> just<00:01:05.320> try<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.530> find<00:01:05.770> a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
I decided I would just try to find a

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.290 
I decided I would just try to find a
paper<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.280> actually<00:01:06.610> did<00:01:06.790> find<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.150> really

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
paper and actually did find a really

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.950 
paper and actually did find a really
cool<00:01:07.890> paper<00:01:08.890> that<00:01:09.280> has<00:01:09.550> a<00:01:09.580> leather<00:01:10.060> texture<00:01:10.600> to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
cool paper that has a leather texture to

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.200 
cool paper that has a leather texture to
it<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.380> it<00:01:11.920> actually<00:01:12.070> feels<00:01:12.370> like<00:01:12.580> leather<00:01:12.790> so

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
it and it actually feels like leather so

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.600 
it and it actually feels like leather so
that<00:01:14.200> was<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.350> little<00:01:14.440> bit<00:01:14.650> easier<00:01:15.010> than<00:01:15.370> trying

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
that was a little bit easier than trying

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.590 
that was a little bit easier than trying
to<00:01:15.820> do<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.860> technique<00:01:17.860> on<00:01:18.159> all<00:01:19.030> four<00:01:19.390> of<00:01:19.420> the

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
and then i kept these really simple

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.710 
and then i kept these really simple
because<00:02:39.920> i<00:02:40.159> was<00:02:40.310> making<00:02:40.640> four<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:41.150> them<00:02:41.360> i

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
because i was making four of them i

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.490 
because i was making four of them i
decided<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.970> keep<00:02:44.090> them<00:02:44.329> just<00:02:44.840> simple<00:02:45.200> and

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
decided to keep them just simple and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.710 
decided to keep them just simple and
straightforward<00:02:45.769> so<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:46.579> did<00:02:47.329> out<00:02:47.480> all<00:02:47.599> the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
straightforward so I did out all the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.869 
straightforward so I did out all the
pictures<00:02:48.079> because<00:02:48.590> none<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.340> families

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
pictures because none of the families

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.140 
pictures because none of the families
none<00:02:50.180> of<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.709> none<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:51.829> them<00:02:51.980> scrapbook<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:53.120> I

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
none of the none of them scrapbook so I

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.400 
none of the none of them scrapbook so I
thought<00:02:53.359> it<00:02:53.480> would<00:02:53.569> be<00:02:53.629> easier<00:02:53.930> for<00:02:53.989> me<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.260> add

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
thought it would be easier for me to add

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.869 
thought it would be easier for me to add
the<00:02:54.560> pictures<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.250> then<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.459> put<00:02:55.700> in

the pictures and then I put in
journaling<00:02:56.720> spots<00:02:57.049> where<00:02:57.290> they<00:02:57.409> can<00:02:57.620> fill<00:02:57.920> in

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
journaling spots where they can fill in

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.530 
journaling spots where they can fill in
where<00:02:58.730> they<00:02:58.849> were<00:02:58.909> in<00:02:59.150> what<00:02:59.269> they<00:02:59.390> were<00:02:59.420> doing

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
where they were in what they were doing
