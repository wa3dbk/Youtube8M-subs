00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.210 
tutorial my name is Ben Chan today we're
doing<00:00:06.420> logic<00:00:06.870> circuits<00:00:07.200> again<00:00:07.440> in<00:00:07.830> this

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
doing logic circuits again in this

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.650 
doing logic circuits again in this
tutorial<00:00:08.490> we're<00:00:08.940> going<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.210> be<00:00:09.330> building

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
tutorial we're going to be building

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.910 
tutorial we're going to be building
ourselves<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.559> nice<00:00:11.160> big<00:00:11.639> display<00:00:12.650> that<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:13.769> can

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
ourselves a nice big display that we can

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.860 
ourselves a nice big display that we can
put<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.280> command<00:00:14.670> center<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.240> our<00:00:15.420> ship<00:00:15.509> and

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
put in a command center in our ship and

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.930 
put in a command center in our ship and
actually<00:00:16.350> have<00:00:16.590> damage<00:00:17.100> indicators<00:00:17.699> showing

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
actually have damage indicators showing

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.200 
actually have damage indicators showing
where<00:00:18.240> damaged<00:00:18.840> parts<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.380> ships<00:00:19.650> are<00:00:20.210> so

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
where damaged parts of the ships are so

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.359 
where damaged parts of the ships are so
you'll<00:00:21.539> see<00:00:21.750> here<00:00:22.080> I've<00:00:22.289> got<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.500> basic<00:00:23.010> basic

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
you'll see here I've got a basic basic

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.060 
you'll see here I've got a basic basic
ship<00:00:23.910> layout<00:00:24.359> here<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> ground<00:00:25.170> with<00:00:25.890> all

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
ship layout here on the ground with all

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.769 
ship layout here on the ground with all
these<00:00:26.279> lights<00:00:26.699> indicating<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.449> different

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
these lights indicating the different

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:28.939 
these lights indicating the different
points<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.170> these<00:00:28.289> will<00:00:28.410> be<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.619> different

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
points and these will be the different

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.620 
points and these will be the different
points<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.640> get<00:00:29.789> indications<00:00:30.390> from

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
points that we can get indications from

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.450 
points that we can get indications from
them<00:00:30.750> then<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:30.990> have<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> little<00:00:31.740> staircase<00:00:32.099> up

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
them then we have a little staircase up

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.090 
them then we have a little staircase up
so<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.850> see<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> bit<00:00:33.510> more<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.050> view<00:00:34.100> from

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
so we can see a bit more of a view from

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.630 
so we can see a bit more of a view from
the<00:00:35.219> top<00:00:35.399> now<00:00:36.620> this<00:00:37.620> ship<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.010> pretty<00:00:38.250> small

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
the top now this ship is pretty small

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.090 
the top now this ship is pretty small
it's<00:00:39.270> basically<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.260> room<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.829> some

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
it's basically just that room and some

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.920 
it's basically just that room and some
laid<00:00:41.579> out<00:00:41.760> stuffed<00:00:42.059> baked<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.540> gives<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
laid out stuffed baked it gives the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.750 
laid out stuffed baked it gives the
general<00:00:43.230> idea<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.920> we'll<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.370> able<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.579> show

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
general idea and we'll be able to show

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.479 
general idea and we'll be able to show
how<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.180> all<00:00:45.360> works<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.079> for<00:00:46.890> starters<00:00:47.309> we're

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
how this all works so for starters we're

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.150 
how this all works so for starters we're
going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.910> build<00:00:48.149> ourselves<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:49.160> clock

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
going to have to build ourselves a clock

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.930 
going to have to build ourselves a clock
so<00:00:50.730> we're<00:00:50.879> gonna<00:00:51.000> do<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.449> underneath<00:00:52.940> we'll

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
so we're gonna do that underneath we'll

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.490 
so we're gonna do that underneath we'll
just<00:00:54.239> drop<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.980> delay<00:00:55.980> blending<00:00:56.699> not<00:00:57.230> all<00:00:58.230> feed

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
just drop a delay blending not all feed

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.540 
just drop a delay blending not all feed
one<00:00:58.680> didn't<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> other<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.520> other

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
one didn't to the other of the other

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.540 
one didn't to the other of the other
into<00:00:59.940> the<00:00:59.969> other<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.539> we'll<00:01:00.719> start<00:01:01.020> out<00:01:01.199> going

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
into the other and we'll start out going

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.149 
into the other and we'll start out going
and<00:01:02.550> sweet<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.059> we've<00:01:03.180> got<00:01:03.329> our<00:01:03.420> clock<00:01:03.629> set<00:01:04.159> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
and sweet so we've got our clock set the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.580 
and sweet so we've got our clock set the
next<00:01:05.400> thing<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.640> need<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.850> do<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:07.170> each<00:01:07.409> of

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
next thing we need to do is on each of

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.109 
next thing we need to do is on each of
these<00:01:08.510> we<00:01:09.510> need<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.840> actually<00:01:10.790> knock<00:01:11.790> out<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
these we need to actually knock out the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.170 
these we need to actually knock out the
block<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.630> add<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.140> or<00:01:14.070> gate<00:01:14.130> underneath<00:01:14.939> them

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
block and add a or gate underneath them

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.450 
block and add a or gate underneath them
having<00:01:15.570> more<00:01:15.689> hits<00:01:15.869> see<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:17.159> grab

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
having more hits see on that and grab

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.210 
having more hits see on that and grab
our<00:01:17.610> light<00:01:17.850> again<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.590> these<00:01:19.590> all<00:01:19.830> gates<00:01:20.100> are

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
our light again and these all gates are

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.780 
our light again and these all gates are
going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> feed<00:01:20.640> into<00:01:20.850> each<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.270> our<00:01:21.360> lives<00:01:22.790> so

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
going to feed into each of our lives so

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.590 
going to feed into each of our lives so
we'll<00:01:23.939> do<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.570> each<00:01:27.259> like<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.600> so

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
we'll do that for each like so and so

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.460 
we'll do that for each like so and so
what<00:01:30.810> we're<00:01:30.990> going<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.290> end<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.829> with<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:33.470> if

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
what we're going to end up with is if

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.260 
what we're going to end up with is if
everything's<00:01:35.009> fine<00:01:35.310> with<00:01:35.700> wherever<00:01:36.119> that

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
everything's fine with wherever that

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.149 
everything's fine with wherever that
block<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:38.090> then<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.360> will<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.869> normal<00:01:40.350> static

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
block is then it will be a normal static

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.030 
block is then it will be a normal static
light<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:42.060> won't<00:01:42.270> blink<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.899> then<00:01:43.229> once

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
light it won't blink and then once

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.580 
light it won't blink and then once
there's<00:01:44.340> an<00:01:44.490> issue<00:01:44.640> with<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.210> or<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.259> area

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
there's an issue with it or if that area

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.469 
there's an issue with it or if that area
has<00:01:46.680> been<00:01:46.860> damaged<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:48.149> we'll<00:01:48.299> get<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
has been damaged then we'll get a

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.660 
has been damaged then we'll get a
flashing<00:01:48.930> light<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.680> we<00:01:49.799> get<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.220> alert

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
flashing light so we get the alert

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.530 
flashing light so we get the alert
saying<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.930> area<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.590> actually

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
saying this is this area but actually

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.520 
saying this is this area but actually
needing<00:01:54.540> your<00:01:54.750> attention<00:01:57.200> okay<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.380> we'll

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
needing your attention okay and we'll

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.209 
needing your attention okay and we'll
just<00:01:58.740> fix<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.490> section<00:02:00.770> on<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.920> side

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
just fix up that section on the side

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.830 
just fix up that section on the side
there<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.479> last<00:02:03.719> one<00:02:04.969> like<00:02:05.969> so

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
there and the last one like so

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.710 
there and the last one like so
sweet<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:09.740> now<00:02:09.860> we've<00:02:10.010> got<00:02:10.250> all<00:02:11.090> our<00:02:11.120> sections

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
sweet so now we've got all our sections

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.680 
sweet so now we've got all our sections
set<00:02:12.350> up<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:13.280> then<00:02:13.520> what<00:02:13.670> we<00:02:13.790> can<00:02:13.970> do<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.390> we<00:02:14.540> can

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
set up and then what we can do is we can

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:27.040 
set up and then what we can do is we can
feed<00:02:15.020> our<00:02:15.490> delay<00:02:16.490> into<00:02:17.030> each<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.570> these<00:02:26.050> and

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
feed our delay into each of these and

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.300 
feed our delay into each of these and
you'll<00:02:27.260> see<00:02:27.410> they're<00:02:27.590> all<00:02:27.680> flashing<00:02:28.130> now<00:02:30.310> and

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
you'll see they're all flashing now and

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.590 
you'll see they're all flashing now and
then<00:02:31.550> what<00:02:31.730> we're<00:02:31.880> going<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.120> do<00:02:32.270> is<00:02:32.420> we're

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
then what we're going to do is we're

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.770 
then what we're going to do is we're
just<00:02:32.630> going<00:02:32.990> to<00:02:33.050> set<00:02:33.290> up<00:02:33.440> our<00:02:33.650> actual<00:02:34.400> blocks

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
just going to set up our actual blocks

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.970 
just going to set up our actual blocks
that<00:02:35.780> will<00:02:36.050> indicate<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:38.320> so<00:02:39.320> we'll<00:02:39.470> go<00:02:39.680> here

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
that will indicate that so we'll go here

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.400 
that will indicate that so we'll go here
into<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.460> front<00:02:40.930> both<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:43.610> how

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
into the front both of the the how

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.020 
into the front both of the the how
usually<00:02:45.410> it's<00:02:45.590> good<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.370> kind<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.730> have<00:02:46.880> these

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
usually it's good to kind of have these

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.100 
usually it's good to kind of have these
blocks<00:02:47.390> for<00:02:48.260> this<00:02:48.440> particular<00:02:48.740> circuit<00:02:49.460> on

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
blocks for this particular circuit on

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.080 
blocks for this particular circuit on
there<00:02:51.110> on<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:52.040> same<00:02:52.250> level<00:02:52.610> as<00:02:52.700> everything

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
there on the same level as everything

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.610 
there on the same level as everything
else<00:02:53.300> I've<00:02:53.480> always<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.840> start<00:02:54.140> getting<00:02:54.380> pipes

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
else I've always you start getting pipes

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.130 
else I've always you start getting pipes
going<00:02:54.890> through<00:02:55.450> but<00:02:56.450> for<00:02:56.660> this<00:02:56.840> demonstration

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
going through but for this demonstration

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.230 
going through but for this demonstration
we<00:02:58.130> won't<00:02:58.370> worry<00:02:58.490> about<00:02:58.880> that<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.820> it<00:03:01.970> can<00:03:02.180> be

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
we won't worry about that and it can be

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.820 
we won't worry about that and it can be
a<00:03:02.420> little<00:03:02.630> finicky<00:03:02.870> when<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.380> start<00:03:03.650> doing

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
a little finicky when you start doing

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.480 
a little finicky when you start doing
sections<00:03:04.370> like<00:03:04.610> out<00:03:04.850> here<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:07.010> might<00:03:07.250> need

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
sections like out here you might need

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.900 
sections like out here you might need
your<00:03:07.640> additional<00:03:08.570> clocks<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:10.190> help<00:03:10.430> with<00:03:10.670> that

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
your additional clocks to help with that

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.040 
your additional clocks to help with that
because<00:03:11.800> the<00:03:13.240> activation<00:03:14.240> modules<00:03:14.780> being

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
because the activation modules being

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
because the activation modules being
destroyed<00:03:16.030> won't<00:03:17.030> actually<00:03:17.620> indicate<00:03:18.620> for<00:03:18.920> us

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
destroyed won't actually indicate for us

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:26.229 
destroyed won't actually indicate for us
properly<00:03:20.890> so<00:03:21.890> what<00:03:22.160> we<00:03:22.280> need<00:03:22.520> to<00:03:22.700> do<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:25.239> update

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
properly so what we need to do is update

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.290 
properly so what we need to do is update
or<00:03:26.989> force<00:03:27.380> an<00:03:27.560> update<00:03:27.739> for<00:03:28.640> this<00:03:28.820> block<00:03:29.090> so

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
or force an update for this block so

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.870 
or force an update for this block so
that's<00:03:29.450> why<00:03:29.600> we<00:03:29.870> have<00:03:30.050> a<00:03:30.080> clock<00:03:30.700> as<00:03:31.700> well<00:03:33.880> put

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
that's why we have a clock as well put

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:44.430 
that's why we have a clock as well put
some<00:03:35.120> here<00:03:35.630> in<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.959> back<00:03:42.880> hopefully<00:03:43.880> there

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
some here in the back hopefully there

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.180 
some here in the back hopefully there
a simpler<00:03:44.830> way<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.570> force<00:03:46.570> these<00:03:46.810> updates<00:03:47.230> for

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
a simpler way to force these updates for

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.380 
a simpler way to force these updates for
it<00:03:48.370> but<00:03:48.580> at<00:03:48.700> them<00:03:48.900> meantime<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.140> is<00:03:50.200> a<00:03:50.380> pretty

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
it but at them meantime this is a pretty

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.610 
it but at them meantime this is a pretty
easy<00:03:52.390> way<00:03:52.830> to<00:03:53.830> get<00:03:53.980> some<00:03:54.160> indications<00:03:54.880> on<00:03:55.150> the

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
easy way to get some indications on the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.420 
easy way to get some indications on the
status<00:03:56.620> of<00:03:56.770> different<00:03:57.100> parts<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.370> your<00:03:57.490> ship

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
status of different parts of your ship

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.850 
status of different parts of your ship
look<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.730> one<00:04:00.910> up<00:04:04.080> have<00:04:05.080> we<00:04:05.140> done<00:04:05.350> to<00:04:05.530> it<00:04:05.620> in

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
look that one up have we done to it in

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.750 
look that one up have we done to it in
doing<00:04:06.130> that<00:04:06.640> I<00:04:06.940> think<00:04:07.030> we<00:04:07.210> have<00:04:07.570> here<00:04:09.270> there<00:04:11.760> to

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
doing that I think we have here there to

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.979 
doing that I think we have here there to
the<00:04:12.880> side<00:04:14.550> and<00:04:15.550> we<00:04:15.700> haven't<00:04:15.970> done<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.209> Corbitt

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
the side and we haven't done to Corbitt

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.340 
the side and we haven't done to Corbitt
I<00:04:17.200> justice<00:04:17.830> been<00:04:18.040> in<00:04:18.190> here<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.870> we<00:04:19.989> can<00:04:20.019> just

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
I justice been in here so we can just

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.690 
I justice been in here so we can just
drop<00:04:20.590> one<00:04:20.830> down<00:04:20.980> there

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
drop one down there

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.150 
drop one down there
oh<00:04:23.430> no<00:04:24.430> sorry<00:04:24.700> that's<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.180> back<00:04:25.390> here<00:04:25.950> which<00:04:26.950> I

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
oh no sorry that's the back here which I

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.660 
oh no sorry that's the back here which I
do<00:04:27.220> have<00:04:27.520> one<00:04:28.200> grab<00:04:29.200> that<00:04:29.470> knock<00:04:30.340> it<00:04:30.520> up<00:04:30.610> -

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
do have one grab that knock it up -

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.930 
do have one grab that knock it up -
there<00:04:33.670> we<00:04:33.790> go

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
there we go

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.450 
there we go
so<00:04:34.090> we've<00:04:34.210> got<00:04:34.300> our<00:04:34.420> clock<00:04:34.660> going<00:04:35.070> if<00:04:36.070> we<00:04:36.250> turn

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
so we've got our clock going if we turn

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.700 
so we've got our clock going if we turn
today<00:04:37.090> we<00:04:37.300> can<00:04:37.480> see<00:04:37.660> everything<00:04:38.140> is<00:04:38.380> all<00:04:38.500> good

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
today we can see everything is all good

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.610 
today we can see everything is all good
and<00:04:41.940> now<00:04:42.940> that<00:04:43.120> we<00:04:43.240> can<00:04:43.420> do<00:04:43.570> is<00:04:43.840> jump<00:04:44.110> out<00:04:44.320> and

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
and now that we can do is jump out and

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.130 
and now that we can do is jump out and
we'll<00:04:44.830> test<00:04:45.100> what<00:04:45.580> happens<00:04:45.610> when<00:04:46.240> those<00:04:46.810> get

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
we'll test what happens when those get

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.460 
we'll test what happens when those get
destroyed<00:04:48.419> okay<00:04:49.419> so<00:04:49.480> we're<00:04:49.990> here<00:04:50.020> in<00:04:50.350> a

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
destroyed okay so we're here in a

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.870 
destroyed okay so we're here in a
different<00:04:50.770> sector<00:04:51.040> so<00:04:51.190> we<00:04:51.280> can<00:04:51.400> actually<00:04:51.700> do

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
different sector so we can actually do

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.420 
different sector so we can actually do
some<00:04:52.090> damage<00:04:52.450> to<00:04:52.480> these<00:04:52.810> things<00:04:53.110> if<00:04:53.919> I<00:04:54.130> fly

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
some damage to these things if I fly

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.480 
some damage to these things if I fly
forward<00:04:55.120> you<00:04:55.690> should<00:04:55.840> turn<00:04:56.770> these<00:04:57.010> mirroring

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
forward you should turn these mirroring

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.090 
forward you should turn these mirroring
off<00:04:57.750> you'll<00:04:58.750> see<00:04:58.780> there<00:04:59.260> everything<00:04:59.770> is<00:04:59.830> still

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
off you'll see there everything is still

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.150 
off you'll see there everything is still
on<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:01.230> we'll<00:05:02.230> see<00:05:02.380> what<00:05:02.560> happens<00:05:02.890> if<00:05:03.010> we

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
on and we'll see what happens if we

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.310 
on and we'll see what happens if we
shoot<00:05:03.370> where<00:05:04.030> some<00:05:04.330> of<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.510> pieces<00:05:04.750> are<00:05:05.050> so<00:05:05.290> I

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
shoot where some of the pieces are so I

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.140 
shoot where some of the pieces are so I
think<00:05:05.410> one<00:05:05.710> of<00:05:05.740> them<00:05:05.919> sections<00:05:06.640> is<00:05:06.820> here<00:05:07.090> at

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
think one of them sections is here at

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.640 
think one of them sections is here at
the<00:05:07.270> back<00:05:07.510> so<00:05:07.840> nice<00:05:08.050> shooting<00:05:08.410> here<00:05:09.030> bang<00:05:10.030> oh

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
the back so nice shooting here bang oh

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.230 
the back so nice shooting here bang oh
we<00:05:11.650> knock<00:05:11.830> down<00:05:11.860> some<00:05:12.070> lights<00:05:12.520> and<00:05:12.790> stuff<00:05:12.970> all

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
we knock down some lights and stuff all

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.590 
we knock down some lights and stuff all
right<00:05:13.360> now<00:05:13.600> let's<00:05:13.840> resume<00:05:14.140> well<00:05:15.450> there's<00:05:16.450> a

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
right now let's resume well there's a

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.430 
right now let's resume well there's a
zoom<00:05:16.870> in<00:05:17.050> and<00:05:17.530> Z<00:05:17.919> it's<00:05:18.850> indicating<00:05:19.419> yeah<00:05:20.110> it's

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
zoom in and Z it's indicating yeah it's

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.290 
zoom in and Z it's indicating yeah it's
indicating<00:05:20.950> that<00:05:20.980> that<00:05:21.130> section<00:05:21.490> was<00:05:21.850> hit<00:05:22.090> I

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
indicating that that section was hit I

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.180 
indicating that that section was hit I
think<00:05:22.870> we<00:05:22.960> also<00:05:23.140> hit<00:05:23.320> this<00:05:23.470> other<00:05:23.680> section<00:05:23.919> as

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
think we also hit this other section as

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.030 
think we also hit this other section as
well<00:05:24.400> so<00:05:25.240> we<00:05:25.390> must<00:05:25.630> have<00:05:25.780> done<00:05:25.930> a<00:05:26.260> decent

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
well so we must have done a decent

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.340 
well so we must have done a decent
amount<00:05:27.100> of<00:05:27.280> damage<00:05:27.370> there<00:05:27.880> let's<00:05:28.840> try<00:05:29.110> again

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
amount of damage there let's try again

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.510 
amount of damage there let's try again
we'll<00:05:29.560> shoot<00:05:29.770> at<00:05:29.980> this<00:05:30.250> side<00:05:30.550> of<00:05:30.700> a<00:05:30.820> wing<00:05:32.520> we

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
we'll shoot at this side of a wing we

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.070 
we'll shoot at this side of a wing we
knocked<00:05:33.760> down<00:05:33.910> the<00:05:34.120> activation<00:05:34.690> modules

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
knocked down the activation modules

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.460 
knocked down the activation modules
there<00:05:35.320> fly<00:05:36.010> for<00:05:36.310> again<00:05:36.610> you<00:05:37.450> can<00:05:37.630> see<00:05:37.870> there<00:05:38.350> we

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
there fly for again you can see there we

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.030 
there fly for again you can see there we
go<00:05:38.650> we're<00:05:38.950> getting<00:05:39.040> an<00:05:39.310> intern<00:05:39.630> indication<00:05:40.630> of

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
go we're getting an intern indication of

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.480 
go we're getting an intern indication of
areas<00:05:42.040> that<00:05:42.190> are<00:05:42.340> being<00:05:42.370> attacked<00:05:43.980> and<00:05:44.980> if<00:05:45.310> we

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
areas that are being attacked and if we

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.520 
areas that are being attacked and if we
aim<00:05:45.669> for<00:05:45.700> this<00:05:46.060> engine<00:05:46.660> at<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:46.840> back<00:05:46.960> we

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
aim for this engine at the back we

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:53.790 
aim for this engine at the back we
should<00:05:47.710> get<00:05:47.890> the<00:05:48.010> same<00:05:48.220> deal<00:05:49.860> and<00:05:52.530> yeah<00:05:53.530> we're

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
should get the same deal and yeah we're

getting the indication there

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.320 
getting the indication there
which<00:05:57.039> is<00:05:57.250> good<00:05:57.460> because<00:05:57.580> then<00:05:57.940> we're<00:05:58.120> being

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
which is good because then we're being

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.810 
which is good because then we're being
alerted<00:05:58.720> as<00:05:59.350> to<00:05:59.590> which<00:05:59.979> areas<00:06:00.370> we're<00:06:00.610> getting

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
alerted as to which areas we're getting

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.029 
alerted as to which areas we're getting
damaged<00:06:01.740> and<00:06:02.740> they<00:06:02.919> take<00:06:03.190> a<00:06:03.400> lot<00:06:03.729> of<00:06:03.850> damage<00:06:05.039> or

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
damaged and they take a lot of damage or

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:07.560 
damaged and they take a lot of damage or
they'll<00:06:06.340> get<00:06:06.550> damaged<00:06:06.940> and<00:06:07.090> you<00:06:07.180> can<00:06:07.360> see

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
they'll get damaged and you can see

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.480 
they'll get damaged and you can see
there's<00:06:07.810> the<00:06:07.960> one<00:06:08.110> on<00:06:08.229> the<00:06:08.320> side<00:06:08.530> that<00:06:08.590> hasn't

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
there's the one on the side that hasn't

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.120 
there's the one on the side that hasn't
quite<00:06:09.789> been<00:06:09.850> destroyed<00:06:10.509> but<00:06:11.410> it<00:06:11.680> doesn't<00:06:11.979> take

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
quite been destroyed but it doesn't take

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.580 
quite been destroyed but it doesn't take
too<00:06:12.370> much<00:06:12.400> to<00:06:12.610> taking<00:06:13.210> them<00:06:13.300> out<00:06:13.449> it<00:06:14.020> takes<00:06:14.259> a

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
too much to taking them out it takes a

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.590 
too much to taking them out it takes a
lot<00:06:15.250> more<00:06:15.280> to<00:06:15.550> take<00:06:15.759> out<00:06:15.910> the<00:06:16.030> hard<00:06:16.240> and<00:06:16.419> half

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
lot more to take out the hard and half

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.290 
lot more to take out the hard and half
in<00:06:16.780> just<00:06:16.990> say<00:06:17.139> and<00:06:17.320> you<00:06:17.380> can<00:06:17.560> see<00:06:17.940> there<00:06:18.940> we<00:06:19.120> go

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
in just say and you can see there we go

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.230 
in just say and you can see there we go
we've<00:06:19.509> got<00:06:19.720> both<00:06:19.960> lights<00:06:20.470> flashing<00:06:21.240> regarding

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
we've got both lights flashing regarding

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.969 
we've got both lights flashing regarding
all<00:06:22.360> of<00:06:22.479> that<00:06:22.630> I<00:06:22.660> mean<00:06:22.930> all<00:06:23.320> right<00:06:23.470> let's<00:06:23.740> just

all of that I mean all right let's just
get<00:06:24.070> the<00:06:24.190> final<00:06:24.520> one<00:06:24.669> which<00:06:24.850> is<00:06:25.030> here<00:06:25.240> in<00:06:25.330> the

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:25.389 
get the final one which is here in the

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:32.310 
get the final one which is here in the
cockpit<00:06:26.580> look<00:06:27.580> at<00:06:27.669> our<00:06:27.850> fire<00:06:28.270> pane<00:06:29.550> and<00:06:31.320> you'll

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
cockpit look at our fire pane and you'll

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.689 
cockpit look at our fire pane and you'll
see<00:06:33.389> as<00:06:34.389> we<00:06:34.419> fly<00:06:34.810> in<00:06:35.050> now<00:06:35.650> all<00:06:36.099> things<00:06:36.370> under

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:36.699 
see as we fly in now all things under

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:38.460 
see as we fly in now all things under
attack<00:06:37.030> in<00:06:37.240> fact<00:06:37.479> we're<00:06:37.750> missing<00:06:38.050> a<00:06:38.080> whole

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
attack in fact we're missing a whole

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.719 
attack in fact we're missing a whole
front<00:06:38.770> section<00:06:39.720> so<00:06:40.720> there<00:06:40.930> we<00:06:41.020> go<00:06:41.050> that's<00:06:41.440> the

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
front section so there we go that's the

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.719 
front section so there we go that's the
indication<00:06:42.729> system<00:06:43.720> for<00:06:44.680> everything<00:06:45.009> it's

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:45.729 
indication system for everything it's

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:47.310 
indication system for everything it's
fairly<00:06:45.940> easy<00:06:46.060> to<00:06:46.360> build<00:06:46.509> you<00:06:46.780> just<00:06:46.990> use<00:06:47.139> the

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
fairly easy to build you just use the

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.110 
fairly easy to build you just use the
loop<00:06:47.530> and<00:06:47.740> all<00:06:48.039> the<00:06:48.160> different<00:06:48.490> things<00:06:48.550> you

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
loop and all the different things you

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.810 
loop and all the different things you
can<00:06:49.270> do<00:06:49.449> the<00:06:49.570> shapes<00:06:49.840> as<00:06:50.139> how<00:06:50.380> you<00:06:50.440> want<00:06:50.820> but

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:51.820 
can do the shapes as how you want but

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.060 
can do the shapes as how you want but
until<00:06:52.360> next<00:06:52.479> time<00:06:52.720> my<00:06:53.169> name<00:06:53.229> is<00:06:53.349> bench<00:06:53.740> and

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
until next time my name is bench and

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.610 
until next time my name is bench and
thanks<00:06:54.460> for<00:06:54.550> watching
