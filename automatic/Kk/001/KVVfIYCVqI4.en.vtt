with the traditional linoleum carver you

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.410 
with the traditional linoleum carver you
push<00:01:34.079> into<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.310> block<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.819> then<00:01:36.179> try<00:01:36.389> to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
push into the block and then try to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.949 
push into the block and then try to
glide<00:01:36.719> smoothly<00:01:37.289> along<00:01:38.189> your<00:01:38.459> cut<00:01:38.700> edge

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
glide smoothly along your cut edge

our lino zip cutter the lino zip cutter
is<00:01:45.959> a<00:01:45.990> safety<00:01:46.560> cutter<00:01:46.770> because<00:01:47.039> it<00:01:47.310> has<00:01:47.459> a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
is a safety cutter because it has a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.459 
is a safety cutter because it has a
sharpened<00:01:48.090> edge<00:01:48.209> on<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> inside<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.259> the
