campaign<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.040> go<00:01:50.130> back<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.520> play

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
campaign you can go back and play

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.530 
campaign you can go back and play
through<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.909> again<00:01:51.090> because<00:01:51.360> there'll<00:01:51.510> be

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
through it again because there'll be

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.149 
through it again because there'll be
different<00:01:51.750> missions<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.470> believe<00:01:53.040> they<00:01:53.130> said

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
different missions I believe they said

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.340 
different missions I believe they said
there<00:01:53.340> was<00:01:53.420> 30-something<00:01:54.420> missions<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.050> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
there was 30-something missions in the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.350 
there was 30-something missions in the
book<00:01:55.560> which<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.800> quite<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> bit<00:01:56.370> each<00:01:57.000> mission

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
book which is quite a bit each mission

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.120 
book which is quite a bit each mission
except<00:01:57.930> maybe<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:58.260> final<00:01:58.620> one<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.040> to

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
except maybe the final one is going to

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.100 
except maybe the final one is going to
take<00:01:59.280> 45<00:01:59.760> minutes<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.270> an<00:02:00.360> hour<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.870> play

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
take 45 minutes to an hour so to play

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.899 
take 45 minutes to an hour so to play
and<00:02:01.380> after<00:02:01.860> having<00:02:02.010> played<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.370> can<00:02:02.640> say<00:02:02.790> it's

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
and after having played I can say it's

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.910 
and after having played I can say it's
very<00:02:03.120> much<00:02:03.390> true<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.229> do<00:02:04.560> different

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
very much true so you do different

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.410 
very much true so you do different
things<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.190> in<00:02:05.430> our<00:02:05.520> mission<00:02:05.850> we<00:02:05.940> jumped<00:02:06.330> out

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
things like in our mission we jumped out

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.679 
things like in our mission we jumped out
of<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:07.819> landing<00:02:08.819> shadow<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.149> was<00:02:09.239> tractored

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:09.689 
of a landing shadow it was tractored

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.449 
of a landing shadow it was tractored
aboard<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.079> ship<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.709> we<00:02:10.829> got<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.069> jump<00:02:11.249> out<00:02:11.400> of

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
aboard a ship so we got to jump out of

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.830 
aboard a ship so we got to jump out of
that<00:02:11.549> ship<00:02:11.790> we<00:02:11.909> got<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.150> blow<00:02:12.359> stuff<00:02:12.629> up<00:02:12.780> so

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
that ship we got to blow stuff up so

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.180 
that ship we got to blow stuff up so
that<00:02:13.139> breaks<00:02:13.439> up<00:02:13.590> their<00:02:13.769> track

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
that breaks up their track

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.070 
that breaks up their track
so<00:02:14.490> we<00:02:14.580> can<00:02:14.700> get<00:02:14.820> out<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.030> there<00:02:15.420> we<00:02:15.720> jump<00:02:15.990> out

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
so we can get out of there we jump out

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.210 
so we can get out of there we jump out
of<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.290> ship<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.560> there's<00:02:16.710> stormtroopers

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
of the ship and there's stormtroopers

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.380 
of the ship and there's stormtroopers
all<00:02:17.340> staying<00:02:17.610> around<00:02:17.700> all<00:02:18.000> right

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
all staying around all right

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.020 
all staying around all right
time<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.960> fight<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.410> what<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.190> game<00:02:20.430> does<00:02:20.460> is

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
time to fight and what this game does is

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.000 
time to fight and what this game does is
it<00:02:21.150> presents<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:21.720> cool<00:02:22.020> fighting<00:02:22.350> mechanism

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
it presents this cool fighting mechanism

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.460 
it presents this cool fighting mechanism
which<00:02:23.160> was<00:02:23.790> used<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.300> descent<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.320> is

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
which was used in descent but this is

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.500 
which was used in descent but this is
it's<00:02:25.710> been<00:02:25.860> modified<00:02:26.400> some<00:02:26.700> essentially

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
it's been modified some essentially

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.150 
it's been modified some essentially
you're<00:02:27.840> going<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.140> roll<00:02:28.380> dice<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.860> attack

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
you're going to roll dice to attack

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.190 
you're going to roll dice to attack
people<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.640> those<00:02:29.790> dice<00:02:30.060> will<00:02:30.240> show<00:02:30.450> if<00:02:30.690> you

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
people and those dice will show if you

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.500 
people and those dice will show if you
have<00:02:31.440> if<00:02:31.860> enough<00:02:32.160> range<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.850> reach<00:02:32.880> them<00:02:33.300> and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
have if enough range to reach them and

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.200 
have if enough range to reach them and
if<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.230> how<00:02:34.980> much<00:02:35.130> damage<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.580> do<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.730> them

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
if you how much damage you do to them

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.550 
if you how much damage you do to them
the<00:02:36.300> person<00:02:36.630> who<00:02:36.720> you're<00:02:36.870> attacking<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.380> gonna

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
the person who you're attacking is gonna

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.770 
the person who you're attacking is gonna
roll<00:02:37.740> defense<00:02:38.160> dice<00:02:38.460> now<00:02:39.120> on<00:02:39.270> these<00:02:39.420> defense

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
roll defense dice now on these defense

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.360 
roll defense dice now on these defense
dice<00:02:40.020> there's<00:02:40.290> two<00:02:40.650> different<00:02:40.950> defense<00:02:41.160> dice

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
dice there's two different defense dice

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.040 
dice there's two different defense dice
one<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.700> them<00:02:41.790> has<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> lot<00:02:42.270> of<00:02:42.330> shields<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:42.900> it

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
one of them has a lot of shields on it

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.540 
one of them has a lot of shields on it
so<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:43.530> block<00:02:43.710> a<00:02:43.770> lot<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.190> hits<00:02:44.370> that

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
so you can block a lot of the hits that

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.820 
so you can block a lot of the hits that
work<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.150> attack<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.050> roll<00:02:46.320> under<00:02:46.560> attack

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
work that you attack a roll under attack

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.400 
work that you attack a roll under attack
dice<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.670> other<00:02:47.820> one<00:02:48.060> has<00:02:48.510> fewer<00:02:49.020> but<00:02:49.290> also

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
dice the other one has fewer but also

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.130 
dice the other one has fewer but also
has<00:02:49.770> a<00:02:49.800> complete<00:02:50.430> miss<00:02:50.910> on<00:02:51.210> it<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:51.720> two<00:02:51.780> misses

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
has a complete miss on it so two misses

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.650 
has a complete miss on it so two misses
unlike<00:02:52.650> defense<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.280> descent<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:54.090> miss<00:02:54.450> is

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
unlike defense the descent the miss is

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.560 
unlike defense the descent the miss is
on<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.290> defenders<00:02:56.040> die<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.940> they<00:02:57.090> can<00:02:57.270> like<00:02:57.420> oh

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
on the defenders die so they can like oh

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.030 
on the defenders die so they can like oh
I<00:02:57.600> dodged<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.140> attack<00:02:58.410> which<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.830> pretty

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
I dodged the attack which is a pretty

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.040 
I dodged the attack which is a pretty
cool<00:02:59.250> thing<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.820> you<00:02:59.880> want<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.180> dodging<00:03:00.660> dice

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
cool thing so you want the dodging dice

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.990 
cool thing so you want the dodging dice
or<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.350> want<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.530> data<00:03:01.650> absorbs<00:03:02.610> more<00:03:02.790> hit

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
or you want the data absorbs more hit

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.050 
or you want the data absorbs more hit
points<00:03:03.320> also<00:03:04.320> defense<00:03:04.830> dice<00:03:05.040> have<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.550> little

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
points also defense dice have a little

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.020 
points also defense dice have a little
symbol<00:03:06.720> on<00:03:06.810> them<00:03:06.990> which<00:03:07.380> cancels<00:03:07.950> surges<00:03:08.640> this

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
symbol on them which cancels surges this

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.610 
symbol on them which cancels surges this
game<00:03:09.210> has<00:03:09.690> something<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.080> do<00:03:10.170> with<00:03:10.200> surges

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
game has something to do with surges

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.990 
game has something to do with surges
again<00:03:10.830> something<00:03:11.040> from<00:03:11.250> descent<00:03:11.550> to<00:03:11.730> where

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
again something from descent to where

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.640 
again something from descent to where
there<00:03:12.630> are<00:03:12.690> little<00:03:12.900> symbols<00:03:13.080> that<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.380> roll

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
there are little symbols that you roll

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.440 
there are little symbols that you roll
and<00:03:13.860> when<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.070> rule<00:03:14.280> them<00:03:14.490> depending<00:03:15.210> on<00:03:15.270> what

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
and when you rule them depending on what

weapons and special abilities you have

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.230 
weapons and special abilities you have
you<00:03:17.070> can<00:03:17.250> activate<00:03:17.670> different<00:03:17.730> things<00:03:18.060> maybe

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
you can activate different things maybe

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.390 
you can activate different things maybe
do<00:03:18.420> more<00:03:18.600> damage<00:03:18.810> get<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.440> longer<00:03:19.800> range<00:03:20.010> do

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
do more damage get a longer range do

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.310 
do more damage get a longer range do
some<00:03:20.580> special<00:03:20.760> action<00:03:21.300> but<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.870> defense<00:03:22.170> I

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
some special action but the defense I

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.920 
some special action but the defense I
can<00:03:22.560> cancel<00:03:22.860> surges<00:03:23.520> now<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.690> all

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
can cancel surges now so this is all

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.930 
can cancel surges now so this is all
interesting<00:03:25.320> so<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.890> way<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.220> game<00:03:26.250> works<00:03:26.610> is

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
interesting so the way the game works is

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.030 
interesting so the way the game works is
one<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.630> rebel<00:03:27.959> players<00:03:28.140> will<00:03:28.560> go<00:03:28.770> and

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
one of the rebel players will go and

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.770 
one of the rebel players will go and
he'll<00:03:29.459> activate<00:03:29.970> his<00:03:30.120> character<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.660> do

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
he'll activate his character and do

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.390 
he'll activate his character and do
different<00:03:31.020> things<00:03:31.200> move<00:03:31.590> an<00:03:31.709> attack<00:03:32.010> attack

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
different things move an attack attack

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.750 
different things move an attack attack
twice<00:03:32.580> move<00:03:33.330> twice<00:03:33.830> then<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:35.100> then<00:03:35.640> the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
twice move twice then the then the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.390 
twice move twice then the then the
Imperial<00:03:36.330> is<00:03:36.510> going<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.110> exhaust<00:03:37.980> one<00:03:38.310> of

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
Imperial is going to exhaust one of

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.620 
Imperial is going to exhaust one of
their<00:03:38.520> characters<00:03:38.790> that's<00:03:39.090> on<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.270> board<00:03:39.480> and

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
their characters that's on the board and

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.449 
their characters that's on the board and
use<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:39.959> then<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.650> rebel<00:03:40.830> player<00:03:41.100> goes<00:03:41.310> so

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
use that then and a rebel player goes so

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.620 
use that then and a rebel player goes so
there's<00:03:41.610> this<00:03:41.730> back<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.240> forth<00:03:42.330> thing

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
there's this back and forth thing

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.660 
there's this back and forth thing
between<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.230> different<00:03:43.500> players<00:03:43.739> until<00:03:44.520> they

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
between the different players until they

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.220 
between the different players until they
one<00:03:45.090> side<00:03:45.300> runs<00:03:45.540> out<00:03:45.720> then<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:45.959> other<00:03:46.050> side

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
one side runs out then the other side

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.930 
one side runs out then the other side
finishes<00:03:46.770> and<00:03:46.980> then<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.459> start<00:03:47.760> another

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
finishes and then you start another

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.290 
finishes and then you start another
round<00:03:48.440> also<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.620> game<00:03:49.800> is<00:03:49.950> very<00:03:50.250> story<00:03:50.910> based

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
round also the game is very story based

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.570 
round also the game is very story based
because<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:52.350> rebels<00:03:52.530> never<00:03:52.800> know<00:03:52.950> maybe<00:03:53.130> you

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
because the rebels never know maybe you

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.600 
because the rebels never know maybe you
open<00:03:53.850> this<00:03:53.940> door<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.390> something<00:03:54.690> happens<00:03:55.260> or

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
three buttons that I could just making

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.910 
three buttons that I could just making
stuff<00:03:57.870> up<00:03:58.020> here<00:03:58.200> because<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.500> don't<00:03:58.560> want<00:03:58.830> to

press three buttons on a computer and

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.820 
press three buttons on a computer and
then<00:04:02.610> something<00:04:03.270> happens<00:04:03.720> or<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.170> never<00:04:04.560> know

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
then something happens or you never know

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.620 
then something happens or you never know

and the bad guy has different cards in
his<00:04:06.720> hand<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:07.260> he's<00:04:07.440> getting<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.920> certain

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
his hand that he's getting a certain

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.710 
his hand that he's getting a certain
amount<00:04:08.520> of<00:04:08.640> thread<00:04:08.940> each<00:04:09.090> term<00:04:09.330> where<00:04:09.480> he<00:04:09.570> can

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
amount of thread each term where he can

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.720 
amount of thread each term where he can
play<00:04:09.959> these<00:04:10.230> cards<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.739> introduce<00:04:11.400> more

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
play these cards and introduce more

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.860 
play these cards and introduce more
enemies<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.300> will<00:04:12.420> show<00:04:12.600> up<00:04:12.660> in<00:04:12.750> different

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
enemies that will show up in different

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.870 
enemies that will show up in different
spots<00:04:13.230> or<00:04:13.530> met<00:04:14.070> error<00:04:14.370> just<00:04:14.730> there's

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
spots or met error just there's

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.400 
spots or met error just there's
different<00:04:15.150> cards<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.630> can<00:04:15.780> affect<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.230> game

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
different cards that can affect the game

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.920 
different cards that can affect the game
so<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.370> game<00:04:17.400> has<00:04:17.609> very<00:04:17.820> specific<00:04:18.540> missions

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
so the game has very specific missions

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.150 
so the game has very specific missions
and<00:04:19.109> aren't<00:04:19.230> mission<00:04:19.440> we'd<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.650> go<00:04:19.770> and<00:04:19.980> blow

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
and aren't mission we'd to go and blow

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.219 
and aren't mission we'd to go and blow
some<00:04:20.370> stuff<00:04:20.549> up<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:20.970> get<00:04:21.419> off<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.780> ship

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
some stuff up and get off the ship

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.380 
some stuff up and get off the ship
but<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:23.460> missions<00:04:23.760> can<00:04:23.940> be<00:04:24.030> completely

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
but the missions can be completely

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.490 
but the missions can be completely
different<00:04:24.630> this<00:04:24.900> was<00:04:25.050> something<00:04:25.200> that<00:04:25.320> was

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500
