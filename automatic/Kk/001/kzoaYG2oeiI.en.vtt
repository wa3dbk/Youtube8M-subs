i'm not the best player I'm just sort of

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.620 
i'm not the best player I'm just sort of
trying<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.250> share<00:00:11.490> my<00:00:11.639> own<00:00:11.759> opinions<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.360> what

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
trying to share my own opinions and what

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.930 
trying to share my own opinions and what
I<00:00:12.660> think<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.139> her<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:14.099> after<00:00:14.280> playing<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.790> few

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
I think of her so after playing a few

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.120 
I think of her so after playing a few
games<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.480> think<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.500> new<00:00:16.680> fee<00:00:16.859> or<00:00:16.949> is

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
games I think that new fee or is

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.359 
games I think that new fee or is
definitely<00:00:17.699> more<00:00:17.850> fun<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.300> better<00:00:18.330> designed

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
definitely more fun and better designed

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.849 
definitely more fun and better designed
although<00:00:20.369> she<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> worse<00:00:21.779> champion<00:00:22.350> overall

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
although she is a worse champion overall

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.929 
although she is a worse champion overall
now<00:00:23.850> by<00:00:24.119> worse<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.720> don't<00:00:24.960> mean<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.230> she<00:00:25.680> is

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
now by worse I don't mean that she is

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.480 
now by worse I don't mean that she is
horrible<00:00:26.939> she's<00:00:27.359> not<00:00:27.570> bad<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.800> do<00:00:28.859> feel<00:00:29.250> as

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
horrible she's not bad but I do feel as

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.040 
horrible she's not bad but I do feel as
this<00:00:29.609> as<00:00:30.060> though<00:00:30.330> her<00:00:30.510> presence<00:00:30.929> in

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
this as though her presence in

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.319 
this as though her presence in
teamfights<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.740> basically<00:00:32.309> nothing<00:00:32.610> compared

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
teamfights is basically nothing compared

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.450 
teamfights is basically nothing compared
to<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> old<00:00:33.719> fiora<00:00:34.050> whereas<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.980> old<00:00:35.100> fiora

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
to the old fiora whereas the old fiora

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.160 
to the old fiora whereas the old fiora
could<00:00:35.700> go<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.239> deal<00:00:36.360> tons<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.750> damage<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
could go in and deal tons of damage and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.709 
could go in and deal tons of damage and
be<00:00:37.290> totally<00:00:37.530> safe<00:00:38.010> while<00:00:38.550> doing<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.510> V

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
be totally safe while doing it this V

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.330 
be totally safe while doing it this V
aura<00:00:39.930> cannot<00:00:40.290> do<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> same<00:00:40.829> thing<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.309> she

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
aura cannot do the same thing so she

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.400 
aura cannot do the same thing so she
feels<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.790> different<00:00:42.210> role<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> terms<00:00:43.230> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
feels a different role in the terms of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.200 
feels a different role in the terms of
team<00:00:43.559> fighting<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.460> do<00:00:44.579> feel<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:44.969> her

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
team fighting but I do feel that her

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.049 
team fighting but I do feel that her
Lane<00:00:45.420> presence<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.989> slightly<00:00:46.379> better<00:00:47.059> because

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
Lane presence is slightly better because

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.729 
Lane presence is slightly better because
of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> way<00:00:48.510> her<00:00:48.719> new<00:00:48.960> mechanics<00:00:49.500> work

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
of the way her new mechanics work

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.830 
of the way her new mechanics work
especially<00:00:50.250> her<00:00:50.640> Q<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.180> her<00:00:51.239> perry<00:00:51.510> along

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
especially her Q and her perry along

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.900 
especially her Q and her perry along
with<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> vitals<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:53.160> trading<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:54.020> is

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
with the vitals the trading is is

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.520 
with the vitals the trading is is
different<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.030> would<00:00:57.270> say<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.899> gotta<00:00:58.109> look<00:00:58.350> at

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
different I would say you gotta look at

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.619 
different I would say you gotta look at
where<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> vital<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.760> then<00:00:59.910> play<00:01:00.239> around

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
where the vital is and then play around

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.139 
where the vital is and then play around
that<00:01:01.050> especially<00:01:01.980> since<00:01:02.219> her<00:01:02.370> Q<00:01:02.670> does<00:01:02.879> count

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
that especially since her Q does count

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.820 
that especially since her Q does count
as<00:01:03.270> an<00:01:03.420> auto-attack<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.140> can't<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:04.619> go<00:01:04.799> in

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
as an auto-attack you can't just go in

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.230 
as an auto-attack you can't just go in
to<00:01:05.040> strike<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.309> vital<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:05.880> your<00:01:06.030> Q

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
to strike a vital with your Q

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.880 
to strike a vital with your Q
willy-nilly<00:01:06.630> because<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> minions<00:01:07.710> will

that<00:02:32.969> it's<00:02:33.150> not<00:02:33.329> as<00:02:33.540> binary<00:02:34.049> so<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.290> do<00:02:34.469> have

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
that it's not as binary so you do have

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.649 
that it's not as binary so you do have
