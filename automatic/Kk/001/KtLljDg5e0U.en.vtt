00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.820 
what I call an orange head because of
the<00:02:26.030> dense<00:02:26.299> foam<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:26.989> sits<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.380> top<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.650> the

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
the dense foam that sits on top of the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.680 
the dense foam that sits on top of the
drink<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.370> almost<00:02:28.880> like<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.150> head<00:02:29.330> of<00:02:29.420> again

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
drink and almost like the head of again

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.300 
drink and almost like the head of again
is<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.959> travel<00:02:30.320> through<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.769> drink<00:02:31.010> with<00:02:31.190> you

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
is to travel through the drink with you

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.039 
is to travel through the drink with you
what's<00:02:31.850> nice<00:02:32.090> about<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.019> really

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
what's nice about it is that you really

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.930 
what's nice about it is that you really
get<00:02:33.380> that<00:02:33.560> little<00:02:33.769> bit<00:02:33.950> of<00:02:33.980> foam<00:02:34.310> on<00:02:34.549> your<00:02:34.580> lips

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
get that little bit of foam on your lips

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.000 
get that little bit of foam on your lips
and<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.269> get<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.510> fresh<00:02:35.840> orange<00:02:36.200> flavor<00:02:36.470> so

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
and you get that fresh orange flavor so

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.860 
and you get that fresh orange flavor so
rather<00:02:37.250> than<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.580> orange<00:02:37.850> being<00:02:38.120> lost<00:02:38.450> in<00:02:38.780> the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
rather than the orange being lost in the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.330 
rather than the orange being lost in the
drink<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.260> way<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.620> with<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:39.860> classic

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
drink the way it is with the classic

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.220 
drink the way it is with the classic
here<00:02:40.820> it's<00:02:40.970> really<00:02:41.239> highlighted<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:41.930> becomes

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
here it's really highlighted and becomes

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.090 
here it's really highlighted and becomes
a<00:02:42.350> nice<00:02:42.910> acidic<00:02:43.910> note<00:02:44.900> at<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.709> end<00:02:45.829> of<00:02:46.010> the

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
a nice acidic note at the end of the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.789 
a nice acidic note at the end of the
drink<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:47.049> course<00:02:48.049> I<00:02:48.200> think<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.530> makes<00:02:48.650> it

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
drink of course I think it makes it

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.100 
drink of course I think it makes it
looks<00:02:48.980> kind<00:02:49.190> of<00:02:49.250> pretty<00:02:49.489> as<00:02:49.610> well<00:02:49.820> but<00:02:50.750> this<00:02:50.900> is

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
looks kind of pretty as well but this is

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.319 
looks kind of pretty as well but this is
a<00:02:51.140> modern<00:02:51.829> take<00:02:52.190> on<00:02:52.400> what's<00:02:52.640> really<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:52.970> classic

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
a modern take on what's really a classic

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.210 
a modern take on what's really a classic
cocktail<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.230> little-known<00:02:54.620> classic
