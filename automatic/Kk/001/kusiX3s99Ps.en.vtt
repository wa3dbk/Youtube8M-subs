00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.480
 a realization capou red thread 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.250

 he had also inaugurated what is the inaugurating size but he is so 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.570
 difficult 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.300
 in the days of wandering in recent months in Iran a second Lille goal 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.120
 the omen also we will take into account the opinion of the fall this 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.460
 history where future visitors we are obliged to know it's

 framed preparing his future however we kissed French the 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.860
 brother the present paid in the short term we have a real 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.050
 I am a victorious descendant 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.920
 20 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.369
 she 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.909
 laurel ciprelli 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.719
 it is a hundred plant species that accompanies his journey 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.719
 in the time that takes place over twelve thousand square meters 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.009
 the garden of how hard on this country divided english garden 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.009

 or again paulo ben is on mortals again since the signs of lola 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.390
 where we are 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.720
 there was a dignified life with a lot of surface remains that we call 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.520
 relics surface pieces of pottery novelistic ground so that's 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.169
 had been classified archeological area sensitivity 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.929
 and the day or two there was a real estate project on this land 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:02.929
 well we did what we call evaluation polls 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.789
 that is to say an operation that consists of making holes a little 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:07.410
 all over 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.570
 to see if there is something and then mediately when this poll has 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.329
 been done 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.799
 we discovered on the one hand that there were walls a little mess more 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.310
 on the other hand very quickly 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.010
 we fell on the wall 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.010
 Cuba basin that is behind me 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:27.509
 the excavations that took place% and very soon after 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:31.440
 we finish to bring to light a basin more done that he sells 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.649
 an ornamental pond that has absolutely not been used for fish farming for example 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:37.989
 as we know others 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.550
 and this ornamental pond is 65 meters long by 3 meters wide 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.640
 one meter deep is something absolutely extraordinary in 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.640
 the Roman world 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.299
 so for what we know other examples of basins like those like 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.420
 this one% in the roman world grosjean 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.750
 where you have to meet the tastes and whether it is in the Middle East or Italy 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.790
 we do not find it but if we go to the western part of 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.120
 the worsened especially in stick in group in the sapling 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.079
 more about the shape the borders of the current France 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.890
 in the sapling there is no equivalent 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.079
 there are basins 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.669
 it's about half of here in proportion 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.609
 it's really the biggest pool 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:20.600
 of the sapling 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.170
 I repeat census in the borders of France
