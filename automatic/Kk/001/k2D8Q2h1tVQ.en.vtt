that like sauron looking thing I'm

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.150 
that like sauron looking thing I'm
actually<00:00:59.579> not<00:01:00.000> praising<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.050> overlord<00:01:01.890> of

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
actually not praising the overlord of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.600 
actually not praising the overlord of
middle-earth<00:01:03.290> I'm<00:01:04.290> actually<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:05.100> stress

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
middle-earth I'm actually just stress

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.499 
middle-earth I'm actually just stress
testing<00:01:06.120> my<00:01:06.240> video<00:01:06.570> card<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.820> then<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.270> video

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
testing my video card and then the video

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.780 
testing my video card and then the video
card<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.930> really<00:01:10.170> hot<00:01:10.470> inside<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:11.189> 69

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
card is really hot inside like 69

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.859 
card is really hot inside like 69
Celsius<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.920> cat<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.430> enjoying<00:01:15.119> this

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
Celsius and the cat is enjoying this

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.880 
Celsius and the cat is enjoying this
high<00:01:16.140> temperature<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> video<00:01:17.340> card<00:01:18.890> see

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
high temperature of the video card see

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.190 
high temperature of the video card see
that<00:01:20.270> yeah<00:01:21.270> yeah<00:01:23.360> it's<00:01:24.360> very<00:01:24.689> efficient

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
that yeah yeah it's very efficient

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.800 
that yeah yeah it's very efficient
really<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:26.340> normally<00:01:26.880> stress<00:01:27.299> testing<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
really like normally stress testing a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.289 
really like normally stress testing a
video<00:01:28.079> card<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:28.619> inefficient<00:01:29.240> but<00:01:30.240> you

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
video card is very inefficient but you

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.109 
video card is very inefficient but you
have<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.650> now<00:01:31.920> we're<00:01:32.340> pleasuring

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
have to do it but now we're pleasuring

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.999 
have to do it but now we're pleasuring
the<00:01:33.240> cat<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.720> heating<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> house<00:01:34.619> at<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the cat and heating the house at the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.270 
the cat and heating the house at the
same<00:01:35.220> time<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.509> efficiency<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.280> actually

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
same time so the efficiency is actually

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:48.110 
same time so the efficiency is actually
through<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.729> roof<00:01:39.259> it's<00:01:40.259> pretty<00:01:40.560> good<00:01:40.710> stuff

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120
