if I was del bosque this more than I

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.289 
if I was del bosque this more than I
would<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.520> live<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.789> home<00:01:47.969> keeper

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
would have to live in a home keeper

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.899 
would have to live in a home keeper
I<00:01:48.539> mean<00:01:48.750> definitely<00:01:49.049> promote<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.189> would<00:01:50.729> see
