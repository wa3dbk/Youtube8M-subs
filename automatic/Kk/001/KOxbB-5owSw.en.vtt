00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
then we'll get back to the other one now

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.389 
then we'll get back to the other one now
they<00:00:44.700> both<00:00:44.850> sell<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.270> 2999<00:00:46.129> let's<00:00:47.129> crack<00:00:47.370> this

they both sell for 2999 let's crack this
open<00:00:47.700> right<00:00:48.090> now<00:00:48.120> there<00:00:48.840> aren't<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.079> ton<00:00:49.110> of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
open right now there aren't a ton of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.760 
open right now there aren't a ton of
holster<00:00:50.190> style<00:00:50.579> cases<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> iphone<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.680> my

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
holster style cases for the iphone in my

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.220 
holster style cases for the iphone in my
day<00:00:52.829> job<00:00:53.190> i<00:00:53.250> often<00:00:53.699> get<00:00:53.789> asked<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.390> them<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.170> I

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
day job i often get asked for them and I

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.900 
day job i often get asked for them and I
think<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.590> puter<00:00:55.949> one<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> nice<00:00:56.520> solution

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
think the puter one is a nice solution

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.750 
think the puter one is a nice solution
so<00:00:57.660> nothing<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.320> other<00:00:58.530> than<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.399> case

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
so nothing in here other than the case

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.750 
so nothing in here other than the case
itself<00:01:00.300> let's<00:01:01.199> pop<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.649> out<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.550> see

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
itself let's pop this out so we can see

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.800 
itself let's pop this out so we can see
what<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.000> all<00:01:03.120> about<00:01:04.760> to<00:01:05.760> pop<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.119> case<00:01:06.570> out

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
what it's all about to pop the case out

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.660 
what it's all about to pop the case out
of<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.020> holster<00:01:07.229> first<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.130> separate

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
of the holster first so I can separate

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
of the holster first so I can separate
the<00:01:08.850> two<00:01:08.970> pieces<00:01:09.350> essentially<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.560> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the two pieces essentially we have a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.070 
the two pieces essentially we have a
soft<00:01:11.070> touch<00:01:11.369> snap<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> back<00:01:12.420> style<00:01:12.720> case

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
soft touch snap on the back style case

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.679 
soft touch snap on the back style case
that<00:01:13.680> fits<00:01:13.920> together<00:01:14.220> with<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.850> holster<00:01:15.330> so

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
little kickstand like holster thing that

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.780 
little kickstand like holster thing that
locks<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:24.120> clip<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.319> place<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.580> then

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
locks the clip in place like so and then

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.119 
locks the clip in place like so and then
I'm<00:02:27.030> able<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.360> place<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.349> down<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.950> variety

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
I'm able to place it down in a variety

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.970 
I'm able to place it down in a variety
of<00:02:29.459> different<00:02:29.549> stand<00:02:30.269> modes<00:02:30.659> I<00:02:31.019> don't<00:02:31.769> think

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
of different stand modes I don't think

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.190 
of different stand modes I don't think
it<00:02:32.069> really<00:02:32.099> goes<00:02:32.489> in<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.090> portrait<00:02:33.629> mode<00:02:33.870> all

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
it really goes in the portrait mode all

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.080 
it really goes in the portrait mode all
that<00:02:34.739> well<00:02:35.010> let's<00:02:35.280> see<00:02:35.459> if<00:02:35.579> I<00:02:35.640> can<00:02:35.670> get<00:02:35.879> it<00:02:36.000> to

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
that well let's see if I can get it to

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.630 
that well let's see if I can get it to
do<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.360> if<00:02:36.599> I<00:02:36.750> was<00:02:36.870> maybe<00:02:37.500> less<00:02:37.860> steep<00:02:38.370> with

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
do that if I was maybe less steep with

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.180 
do that if I was maybe less steep with
it<00:02:38.760> unsafe<00:02:39.209> I'm<00:02:39.510> not<00:02:39.690> an<00:02:40.290> angle<00:02:40.680> yeah<00:02:40.920> there<00:02:41.129> it

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
it unsafe I'm not an angle yeah there it

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.119 
it unsafe I'm not an angle yeah there it
goes<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.640> goes<00:02:41.819> in<00:02:42.000> both<00:02:42.209> orientations

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
goes so it goes in both orientations

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.949 
goes so it goes in both orientations
portrait<00:02:44.129> or<00:02:44.489> landscape<00:02:44.849> in<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.420> variety<00:02:45.569> of

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
portrait or landscape in a variety of

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.670 
portrait or landscape in a variety of
angles<00:02:46.260> if<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.340> flip<00:02:47.849> this<00:02:48.030> back<00:02:48.090> down<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.079> open

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
angles if I flip this back down and open

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.199 
angles if I flip this back down and open
the<00:02:49.769> clip<00:02:50.010> hopefully<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.519> can<00:02:50.640> make<00:02:50.700> out<00:02:50.970> all

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
the clip hopefully you can make out all

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.729 
the clip hopefully you can make out all
the<00:02:51.390> different<00:02:51.720> notches<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.349> are<00:02:52.440> in<00:02:52.530> there

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
the different notches that are in there

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.589 
the different notches that are in there
it's<00:02:53.220> about<00:02:53.400> four<00:02:53.700> different<00:02:53.849> one<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.569> can

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
it's about four different one so you can

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.809 
it's about four different one so you can
set<00:02:55.379> this<00:02:55.560> thing<00:02:55.829> up<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.280> variety<00:02:56.459> of

set this thing up in a variety of
different<00:02:56.970> angles<00:02:57.659> then<00:02:57.900> when<00:02:58.019> you're<00:02:58.109> all

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
different angles then when you're all

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.440 
different angles then when you're all
done<00:02:58.470> flip<00:02:59.159> it<00:02:59.310> back<00:02:59.430> around<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.150> you're<00:03:00.299> good

instead<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.220> lines<00:03:38.519> it<00:03:38.970> has<00:03:39.120> kind<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.510> a

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
instead of the lines it has kind of a

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.259 
instead of the lines it has kind of a
dimpled<00:03:40.680> pattern<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.699> can<00:03:41.819> see<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.090> case

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
dimpled pattern you can see the case

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.229 
dimpled pattern you can see the case
itself<00:03:42.690> very<00:03:43.109> similar<00:03:43.639> shape<00:03:44.639> and<00:03:44.910> same<00:03:45.209> with

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
itself very similar shape and same with

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.349 
itself very similar shape and same with
the<00:03:45.510> holster<00:03:45.959> holster<00:03:46.739> might<00:03:46.949> even<00:03:47.129> be

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
the holster holster might even be

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.580 
the holster holster might even be
identical<00:03:48.359> except<00:03:48.660> again<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.019> has<00:03:49.139> like<00:03:49.410> this

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
identical except again it has like this

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.900 
identical except again it has like this
dimple<00:03:49.919> pattern<00:03:50.280> on<00:03:50.699> the<00:03:51.510> outside<00:03:51.959> as<00:03:52.230> well

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
dimple pattern on the outside as well

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.119 
dimple pattern on the outside as well
similar<00:03:53.910> design<00:03:54.269> hair<00:03:54.629> it<00:03:54.750> also<00:03:55.109> has<00:03:55.349> the

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
similar design hair it also has the

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.800 
similar design hair it also has the
little<00:03:56.250> clip<00:03:56.639> hair<00:03:56.910> so<00:03:57.180> let's<00:03:57.329> just<00:03:57.510> compare

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
little clip hair so let's just compare

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.930 
little clip hair so let's just compare
the<00:03:57.959> holsters<00:03:58.410> holsters<00:03:59.370> are<00:03:59.549> almost

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
the holsters holsters are almost

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.300 
the holsters holsters are almost
identical<00:04:00.150> as<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:01.049> can<00:04:01.230> see<00:04:01.470> they<00:04:01.949> just<00:04:02.129> have

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
identical as you can see they just have

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.430 
identical as you can see they just have
different<00:04:02.340> finishes<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.480> them<00:04:03.660> so<00:04:04.169> it<00:04:04.290> does

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
different finishes to them so it does

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.589 
different finishes to them so it does
have<00:04:04.470> this<00:04:04.889> like<00:04:05.099> dimple<00:04:05.549> pattern<00:04:05.730> which<00:04:06.449> you

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
have this like dimple pattern which you

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.330 
have this like dimple pattern which you
can<00:04:06.780> use<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:07.019> prop<00:04:07.470> up<00:04:07.500> your<00:04:07.650> phone<00:04:07.919> but<00:04:08.220> the

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
can use to prop up your phone but the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.789 
can use to prop up your phone but the
case<00:04:08.609> also<00:04:09.239> has<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.690> built-in<00:04:10.169> kickstand<00:04:10.650> as

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
case also has a built-in kickstand as

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.949 
case also has a built-in kickstand as
well<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.280> put<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.030> phone<00:04:12.239> in<00:04:12.419> the<00:04:12.449> case<00:04:12.720> the

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
well so put the phone in the case the

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.879 
well so put the phone in the case the
same<00:04:13.199> way<00:04:13.500> like<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:14.669> clicks<00:04:15.359> in<00:04:15.599> same<00:04:16.470> exact

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
same way like so clicks in same exact

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.800 
same way like so clicks in same exact
kind<00:04:17.190> of<00:04:17.250> design<00:04:17.549> now<00:04:17.849> taking<00:04:18.389> a<00:04:18.449> look<00:04:18.599> at<00:04:18.720> the

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
kind of design now taking a look at the

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.899 
kind of design now taking a look at the
back<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.349> cut<00:04:20.070> out<00:04:20.219> for<00:04:20.430> this<00:04:20.519> one<00:04:20.729> is<00:04:20.880> a

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
back the cut out for this one is a

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.219 
back the cut out for this one is a
little<00:04:21.120> bit<00:04:21.239> different<00:04:21.570> this<00:04:21.659> is<00:04:21.719> more<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.140> a

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
little bit different this is more of a

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.710 
little bit different this is more of a
key-hole<00:04:23.039> style<00:04:24.000> camera

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
key-hole style camera

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.930 
key-hole style camera
out<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.140> as<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:26.100> can<00:04:26.220> see<00:04:26.250> it's<00:04:26.580> got<00:04:26.760> this

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
out and as you can see it's got this

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.030 
out and as you can see it's got this
little<00:04:27.000> clip<00:04:27.420> right<00:04:27.660> hair<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:28.140> I<00:04:28.170> can<00:04:28.410> pop

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
little clip right hair that I can pop

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.080 
little clip right hair that I can pop
out<00:04:29.250> on<00:04:29.310> both<00:04:29.700> sides<00:04:30.380> and<00:04:31.380> now<00:04:31.560> I've<00:04:31.800> got<00:04:32.010> a<00:04:32.220> way

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
out on both sides and now I've got a way

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.150 
out on both sides and now I've got a way
to<00:04:33.150> prop<00:04:33.480> up<00:04:33.510> my<00:04:33.720> phone<00:04:34.080> without<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.740> holster

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
to prop up my phone without the holster

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.850 
to prop up my phone without the holster
so<00:04:35.430> if<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:35.700> don't<00:04:36.120> have<00:04:36.330> this<00:04:36.510> handy<00:04:36.960> I<00:04:37.110> can<00:04:37.620> prop

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
so if I don't have this handy I can prop

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.730 
so if I don't have this handy I can prop
it<00:04:37.890> up<00:04:38.130> in<00:04:38.370> both<00:04:38.760> portrait<00:04:39.330> or<00:04:39.480> landscape<00:04:40.140> now

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
it up in both portrait or landscape now

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.060 
it up in both portrait or landscape now
because<00:04:41.550> this<00:04:41.880> case<00:04:42.150> does<00:04:42.570> have<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.590> holster

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
because this case does have the holster

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.700 
because this case does have the holster
I<00:04:44.100> could<00:04:44.610> choose<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:45.930> know<00:04:46.050> still<00:04:46.440> use<00:04:46.680> it

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
I could choose to you know still use it

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.460 
I could choose to you know still use it
to<00:04:47.190> prop<00:04:47.400> up<00:04:47.430> my<00:04:47.820> phone<00:04:48.300> if<00:04:48.540> I<00:04:48.660> want<00:04:48.870> it's<00:04:49.320> got

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
to prop up my phone if I want it's got

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.260 
to prop up my phone if I want it's got
that<00:04:49.590> same<00:04:49.830> little<00:04:50.040> bar<00:04:50.460> back<00:04:50.730> in<00:04:50.910> there<00:04:51.090> that

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
that same little bar back in there that

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.570 
that same little bar back in there that
I<00:04:51.330> can<00:04:51.510> use<00:04:51.540> to<00:04:51.930> prop<00:04:52.200> it<00:04:52.230> up<00:04:52.470> in<00:04:53.310> either

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
I can use to prop it up in either

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.390 
I can use to prop it up in either
orientation<00:04:54.480> so<00:04:54.720> this<00:04:55.260> one<00:04:55.470> has<00:04:55.620> kind<00:04:55.980> of<00:04:56.040> both

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
orientation so this one has kind of both

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.690 
orientation so this one has kind of both
options<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.630> can<00:04:57.750> use<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.260> holster<00:04:58.740> to<00:04:59.370> prop

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
options you can use the holster to prop

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.870 
options you can use the holster to prop
it<00:04:59.730> up<00:05:00.000> or<00:05:00.380> use<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.680> case<00:05:01.920> to<00:05:02.190> prop<00:05:02.400> it<00:05:02.430> up<00:05:02.670> now

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
it up or use the case to prop it up now

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.280 
it up or use the case to prop it up now
this<00:05:03.030> one<00:05:03.210> does<00:05:03.390> fit<00:05:03.600> a<00:05:03.660> little<00:05:03.870> bit<00:05:03.990> tighter

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
this one does fit a little bit tighter

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.590 
this one does fit a little bit tighter
as<00:05:04.980> far<00:05:05.160> as<00:05:05.280> getting<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.670> in<00:05:05.790> and<00:05:05.940> out<00:05:06.060> but<00:05:06.390> no

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
I'm not a problem let's see this thing

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.400 
I'm not a problem let's see this thing
clicks<00:05:08.940> back<00:05:09.150> in<00:05:09.330> place<00:05:09.600> so<00:05:09.840> it<00:05:09.930> doesn't<00:05:09.990> flap

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
clicks back in place so it doesn't flap

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.950 
clicks back in place so it doesn't flap
around<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:10.950> again<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.760> really<00:05:12.090> nice<00:05:12.300> slim
