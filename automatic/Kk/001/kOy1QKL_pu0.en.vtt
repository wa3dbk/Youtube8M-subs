the last lesson most matific development

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.679 
the last lesson most matific development
involves<00:00:17.900> some<00:00:18.109> form<00:00:18.140> of<00:00:18.560> repetition

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
involves some form of repetition

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.659 
involves some form of repetition
repetition<00:00:20.689> is<00:00:21.410> the<00:00:21.439> underlying<00:00:21.890> key<00:00:22.400> to

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:22.669 
repetition is the underlying key to

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.140 
repetition is the underlying key to
motivic<00:00:23.150> development<00:00:24.430> the<00:00:25.430> next<00:00:25.610> techniques

we<00:00:26.300> will<00:00:26.329> look<00:00:26.630> at<00:00:26.779> are<00:00:27.020> the<00:00:27.109> techniques<00:00:27.500> of

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
we will look at are the techniques of

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.310 
we will look at are the techniques of
interval<00:00:28.340> of<00:00:28.489> expansion<00:00:29.119> and<00:00:29.270> interval<00:00:30.259> a

simply<00:00:34.740> put<00:00:35.300> intervallic<00:00:36.300> expansion<00:00:37.080> is<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
simply put intervallic expansion is the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.250 
simply put intervallic expansion is the
repetition<00:00:37.650> of<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.460> melodic<00:00:38.880> motif<00:00:39.260> using

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
repetition of a melodic motif using

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:50.470 
repetition of a melodic motif using
larger<00:00:40.680> intervals<00:00:41.780> here<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.900> an<00:00:43.020> example<00:00:48.140> as

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
larger intervals here is an example as

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.689 
larger intervals here is an example as
you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.620> melodic<00:00:53.040> motif<00:00:53.220> in<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
you can see the melodic motif in the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.549 
you can see the melodic motif in the
first<00:00:53.940> measure<00:00:54.210> consists<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.080> a<00:00:55.230> fifth

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
first measure consists of a fifth

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.510 
first measure consists of a fifth
followed<00:00:56.430> by<00:00:56.580> two<00:00:56.640> seconds<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:58.800> repetition

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
followed by two seconds the repetition

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.340 
followed by two seconds the repetition
of<00:00:59.610> the<00:00:59.760> motif<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> second<00:01:00.840> measure<00:01:01.020> is

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
of the motif and the second measure is

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.040 
of the motif and the second measure is
an<00:01:02.129> interval<00:01:02.610> ik<00:01:02.760> expansion<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> motif

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
an interval ik expansion of the motif

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.770 
an interval ik expansion of the motif
since<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.160> interval<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.880> fifth<00:01:06.149> has<00:01:06.570> been

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
since the interval of a fifth has been

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.850 
since the interval of a fifth has been
expanded<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> sixth

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.469 

there<00:01:11.860> are<00:01:12.010> three<00:01:12.250> options<00:01:12.460> for<00:01:12.850> intervallic

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
there are three options for intervallic

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.520 
there are three options for intervallic
expansion<00:01:14.200> of<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.409> motif<00:01:14.800> a<00:01:16.110> single<00:01:17.110> interval

option

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.340 
option
as<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:36.520> can<00:01:36.670> see<00:01:36.970> two<00:01:37.870> out<00:01:38.080> of<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.320> three

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
as you can see two out of the three

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.550 
as you can see two out of the three
intervals<00:01:39.130> have<00:01:39.310> been<00:01:39.490> expanded<00:01:40.260> the<00:01:41.260> fifth

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
intervals have been expanded the fifth

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.250 
intervals have been expanded the fifth
and<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:41.980> third<00:01:42.250> in<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.640> original<00:01:43.060> motif<00:01:43.420> have

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
and the third in the original motif have

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.710 
and the third in the original motif have
been<00:01:44.500> expanded<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.160> a<00:01:45.310> sixth<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.150> fourth<00:01:46.450> in

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
been expanded to a sixth and a fourth in

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.920 
been expanded to a sixth and a fourth in
the<00:01:46.840> second<00:01:47.260> measure<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:49.240> interval<00:01:49.720> of<00:01:49.810> a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
the second measure the interval of a

00:01:49.930 --> 00:02:01.330 
the second measure the interval of a
second<00:01:50.410> remains<00:01:50.890> unchanged

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.929 

in<00:02:01.810> this<00:02:02.810> example<00:02:03.229> all<00:02:03.829> of<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.549> intervals

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
in this example all of the intervals

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.870 
in this example all of the intervals
have<00:02:05.090> increased<00:02:05.509> in<00:02:05.719> size<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:07.280> thirds<00:02:07.579> in<00:02:07.759> the

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
have increased in size the thirds in the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.839 
have increased in size the thirds in the
original<00:02:08.330> motif<00:02:08.720> have<00:02:09.349> become<00:02:09.649> fourths<00:02:10.069> while

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
original motif have become fourths while

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.670 
original motif have become fourths while
the<00:02:11.090> second<00:02:11.480> in<00:02:11.629> the<00:02:11.750> original<00:02:12.110> has<00:02:12.349> become

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
the second in the original has become

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.800 
the second in the original has become
1/3

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.470 

and<00:02:21.740> all<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.430> examples<00:02:22.970> we<00:02:23.120> have<00:02:23.209> looked

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
and all of the examples we have looked

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.199 
and all of the examples we have looked
at<00:02:23.569> thus<00:02:23.780> far<00:02:23.810> we<00:02:24.800> expanded<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.580> intervals<00:02:26.000> by

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
at thus far we expanded the intervals by

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.170 
at thus far we expanded the intervals by
making<00:02:26.600> them<00:02:26.720> one<00:02:26.930> number<00:02:27.290> larger<00:02:27.940> it<00:02:28.940> is

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
making them one number larger it is

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.150 
making them one number larger it is
important<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.840> note<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.380> when<00:02:30.950> using

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
important to note that when using

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.640 
important to note that when using
interval<00:02:31.520> ik<00:02:31.790> expansion<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:33.020> intervals<00:02:33.440> can

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
interval ik expansion the intervals can

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.430 
interval ik expansion the intervals can
be<00:02:33.770> made<00:02:33.950> larger<00:02:34.160> by<00:02:34.550> any<00:02:34.819> amounts<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.510> do<00:02:36.230> not

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
be made larger by any amounts and do not

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.380 
be made larger by any amounts and do not
necessarily<00:02:36.650> need<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.400> be<00:02:37.550> made<00:02:37.819> larger<00:02:38.180> by<00:02:38.360> a

necessarily need to be made larger by a
single<00:02:38.870> number<00:02:38.989> a<00:02:40.180> third<00:02:41.180> for<00:02:41.510> example

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
single number a third for example

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.000 
single number a third for example
doesn't<00:02:42.890> need<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.160> become<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.489> fourth<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:45.010> third

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
doesn't need to become a fourth a third

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.880 
doesn't need to become a fourth a third
could<00:02:46.220> also<00:02:46.430> become<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.970> fifth<00:02:47.420> sixth<00:02:48.110> seventh

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
could also become a fifth sixth seventh

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.780 
could also become a fifth sixth seventh
etc

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.729 

once<00:02:53.330> you<00:02:53.569> understand<00:02:54.110> interval<00:02:54.620> ik

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
once you understand interval ik

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.399 
once you understand interval ik
expansion<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.909> is<00:02:55.939> very<00:02:56.299> easy<00:02:56.569> to<00:02:56.840> understand

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
expansion it is very easy to understand

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.429 
expansion it is very easy to understand
and<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.769> follow<00:02:57.980> compression<00:02:59.319> interval<00:03:00.319> ik

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:00.439 
and to follow compression interval ik

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.559 
and to follow compression interval ik
compression<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.189> simply<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.879> opposite<00:03:02.390> of

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
compression is simply the opposite of

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.670 
compression is simply the opposite of
expansion<00:03:03.970> in<00:03:04.970> interval<00:03:05.450> at<00:03:05.599> compression<00:03:06.140> the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
expansion in interval at compression the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.069 
expansion in interval at compression the
melodic<00:03:07.159> motif<00:03:07.310> is<00:03:07.790> repeated<00:03:08.360> using<00:03:08.540> smaller

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
melodic motif is repeated using smaller

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.789 
melodic motif is repeated using smaller
intervals<00:03:09.680> as<00:03:10.450> with<00:03:11.450> expansion<00:03:11.930> there<00:03:12.680> are

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
intervals as with expansion there are

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.720 
intervals as with expansion there are
also<00:03:12.980> three<00:03:13.459> options<00:03:13.909> for<00:03:14.030> compression<00:03:14.780> a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
also three options for compression a

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.809 
also three options for compression a
single<00:03:16.730> interval<00:03:17.180> may<00:03:17.360> be<00:03:17.510> compressed

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
single interval may be compressed

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.869 
single interval may be compressed
multiple<00:03:19.819> intervals<00:03:20.269> may<00:03:20.450> be<00:03:20.629> compressed<00:03:21.049> or

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
multiple intervals may be compressed or

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.439 
multiple intervals may be compressed or
all<00:03:22.879> of<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.180> intervals<00:03:23.599> may<00:03:23.780> be<00:03:23.959> compressed
