00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.610
 or not 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.289
 imagine that your son will not need 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.800
 depend on any instrument to 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.800
 calculate 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.040
 imagine that you could boost the 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.040
 Your child's intelligence 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.540
 thus increasing your motivation and 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.180
 self-confidence with mental aloha 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.520
 arithmetic is possible aloha is a 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.410
 program aimed at children between 4 and 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.930
 13 years contributing to its development 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.270
 mentally in a fun way 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.950
 the program is present in 19 countries 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.280
 of the five continents 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.710
 you want to know what the brain is 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.260
 is divided into two hemispheres on 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.390
 left and right each of these 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.460
 halves has specific functions 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.770
 our educational system and our 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.020
 lifestyle potentiate 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.300
 the use of the left hemisphere this 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.300
 hemisphere think and remember words 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.579
 the right hemisphere is the imaginative 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.579
 and creative think and remember in pictures 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.370
 aloha mental arithmetic develops the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.200
 right hemisphere through the 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.810
 abacus display 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.820
 Children learn to use the below 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.050
 to calculate as if it were a game of 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.630
 records 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.240
 little by little they begin to visualize it in 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.410
 your head and to use this mental image 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.490
 to calculate this mental exercise 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.040
 provides brain agility to 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.280
 students 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.810
 the left hemisphere is linear 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.810
 work by trial error 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.670
 the law is relational raises new 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.850
 solutions outside the patterns 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.850
 established 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.970
 boosting the right hemisphere 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.810
 we get an efficient brain for 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.810
 solve problems 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.750
 aloha mental arithmetic is a program 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.550
 interactive fun children learn 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.150
 through games and with just two 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.549
 weekly class hours 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.379
 in a few months the children will perform 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.720
 arithmetic operations with greater 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.360
 precision will show a greater 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.370
 mental speed and you will notice an improvement 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.370
 generalized in the other subjects 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.320
 In the long term, the program will boost 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.430
 concentration autonomy and ability to 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.430
 the selection of information 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.500
 aloha mental arithmetic beneficial 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.500
 forever
