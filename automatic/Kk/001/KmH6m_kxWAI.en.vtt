drive is exactly like a hard drive

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.580 
drive is exactly like a hard drive
inside<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.400> computer<00:02:46.580> I<00:02:47.090> mean<00:02:47.660> exactly<00:02:47.930> the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
inside of a computer I mean exactly the

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.640 
inside of a computer I mean exactly the
same<00:02:48.800> chord<00:02:49.190> sing<00:02:49.550> frogs<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.180> everything<00:02:50.650> so

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
same chord sing frogs and everything so

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.620 
same chord sing frogs and everything so
hopefully<00:02:52.250> pretty<00:02:52.430> soon<00:02:52.550> I'm<00:02:53.060> going<00:02:53.300> to<00:02:53.450> take

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
hopefully pretty soon I'm going to take

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.330 
hopefully pretty soon I'm going to take
my<00:02:53.810> 70<00:02:54.260> gig<00:02:54.410> hard<00:02:54.650> drive<00:02:54.710> that's<00:02:54.980> in<00:02:55.220> my

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
my 70 gig hard drive that's in my

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.660 
my 70 gig hard drive that's in my
computer<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.150> take<00:02:56.720> this<00:02:56.960> 500<00:02:57.740> gig<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.250> put

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
computer and take this 500 gig and put

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.820 
computer and take this 500 gig and put
it<00:02:58.790> in<00:02:58.940> there<00:02:59.120> instead<00:02:59.540> so<00:03:00.410> after<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.740> have

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
it in there instead so after you have

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.350 
it in there instead so after you have
that<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.340> can<00:03:01.370> just<00:03:01.670> kind<00:03:01.850> of<00:03:01.880> flip<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.210> over

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
that you can just kind of flip it over

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.460 
that you can just kind of flip it over
and<00:03:02.620> have<00:03:03.620> those<00:03:03.800> other<00:03:03.950> two<00:03:04.190> screws<00:03:04.520> follow

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
and have those other two screws follow

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.960 
and have those other two screws follow
and<00:03:06.470> they're<00:03:06.800> right<00:03:06.950> here<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:10.400> now<00:03:10.580> you<00:03:10.790> have

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
and they're right here so now you have

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.570 
and they're right here so now you have
loosened<00:03:11.570> it<00:03:11.720> up<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:12.740> now<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:12.950> can<00:03:13.160> take<00:03:13.400> it

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
loosened it up so now you can take it

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.520 
loosened it up so now you can take it
and<00:03:13.760> just<00:03:14.300> lift<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.840> out<00:03:14.960> very<00:03:15.440> carefully<00:03:16.270> and

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
and just lift it out very carefully and

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.800 
and just lift it out very carefully and
now<00:03:18.530> you've<00:03:18.860> had<00:03:19.130> it<00:03:19.400> down<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:20.450> hard<00:03:20.690> drive

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
now you've had it down to the hard drive

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.790 
now you've had it down to the hard drive
and<00:03:21.290> some<00:03:21.740> a<00:03:22.180> couple<00:03:23.180> of<00:03:23.420> more<00:03:23.570> screws<00:03:23.900> so<00:03:24.650> now

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
and some a couple of more screws so now

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.730 
and some a couple of more screws so now
all<00:03:24.830> you<00:03:25.220> need<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.370> do<00:03:25.610> is<00:03:25.640> take<00:03:26.000> off<00:03:26.210> these<00:03:27.080> two

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
all you need to do is take off these two

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.290 
all you need to do is take off these two
screens<00:03:28.190> just<00:03:28.310> like<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.760> two<00:03:28.910> that<00:03:29.060> we're<00:03:29.210> on

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
screens just like the two that we're on

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.290 
screens just like the two that we're on
the<00:03:29.330> front<00:03:29.630> this<00:03:29.930> one<00:03:29.990> and<00:03:30.470> this<00:03:31.010> one<00:03:31.070> so<00:03:32.000> I'm

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
the front this one and this one so I'm

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:40.860 
the front this one and this one so I'm
screw<00:03:32.630> those<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.170> didn't<00:03:33.650> app

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.170 

and<00:03:41.769> then<00:03:41.920> there's<00:03:42.129> one<00:03:42.459> more<00:03:42.700> which<00:03:43.000> is

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
and then there's one more which is

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.149 
and then there's one more which is
pretty<00:03:43.480> close<00:03:43.810> it's<00:03:44.349> kind<00:03:44.620> of<00:03:44.709> hard<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:44.950> get

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
pretty close it's kind of hard to get

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.430 
pretty close it's kind of hard to get
because<00:03:45.250> it's<00:03:45.459> underneath<00:03:45.930> this<00:03:46.930> thing<00:03:46.989> kind

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
because it's underneath this thing kind

00:03:47.440 --> 00:04:01.790 
because it's underneath this thing kind
of<00:03:47.650> but<00:03:48.459> you'll<00:03:48.700> get<00:03:48.879> it<00:03:48.970> off

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.370 

and<00:04:02.220> now<00:04:02.490> you<00:04:02.550> have<00:04:02.880> that<00:04:03.120> off<00:04:03.300> so<00:04:03.840> now<00:04:04.050> your

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
and now you have that off so now your

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.210 
and now you have that off so now your
hard<00:04:04.710> drive<00:04:04.980> to<00:04:05.250> be<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.730> little<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:07.380> little<00:04:08.040> bit

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
hard drive to be a little a little bit

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.340 
hard drive to be a little a little bit
just<00:04:08.490> a<00:04:08.760> little<00:04:08.820> he'll<00:04:09.600> turn<00:04:09.750> up<00:04:09.990> from<00:04:10.200> the

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
just a little he'll turn up from the

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.580 
just a little he'll turn up from the
sides<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:11.300> you'll<00:04:12.300> see<00:04:12.570> that<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:13.050> came<00:04:13.290> free

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
sides and you'll see that it came free

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.009 
sides and you'll see that it came free
from<00:04:13.770> the<00:04:13.950> side<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:14.520> from<00:04:14.760> that<00:04:14.910> side<00:04:15.180> now

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
from the side and from that side now

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.900 
from the side and from that side now
hold<00:04:16.230> that<00:04:16.440> if<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:16.920> ever<00:04:16.950> looked<00:04:17.370> inside<00:04:17.670> of<00:04:17.820> a

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
hold that if you ever looked inside of a

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.210 
hold that if you ever looked inside of a
computer<00:04:18.090> hard<00:04:18.600> drive<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:19.769> can<00:04:19.799> see<00:04:20.190> that

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
computer hard drive you can see that

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.080 
computer hard drive you can see that
these<00:04:20.580> are<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:20.820> exact<00:04:21.540> so<00:04:22.080> plugs<00:04:22.920> that<00:04:23.280> will

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
these are the exact so plugs that will

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.530 
these are the exact so plugs that will
go<00:04:24.270> into<00:04:24.480> it<00:04:24.810> your<00:04:25.440> power<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:26.250> your<00:04:26.540> ribbon

go into it your power and your ribbon
your<00:04:27.720> data<00:04:27.960> cable<00:04:28.410> so<00:04:29.130> now<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.340> can<00:04:29.640> take

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
your data cable so now you can take

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.370 
your data cable so now you can take
those<00:04:30.060> out<00:04:30.330> those<00:04:30.630> will<00:04:30.810> be<00:04:30.960> in<00:04:31.080> there<00:04:31.230> pretty

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
those out those will be in there pretty
