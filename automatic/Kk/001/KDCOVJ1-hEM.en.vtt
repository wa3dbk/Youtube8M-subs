those idea men might actually like one
of<00:01:22.420> my<00:01:22.570> ideas<00:01:22.720> and<00:01:24.120> maybe<00:01:25.120> or<00:01:25.510> maybe<00:01:26.050> not

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
of my ideas and maybe or maybe not

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.470 
of my ideas and maybe or maybe not
inspired<00:01:27.310> by<00:01:27.610> me<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.000> they<00:01:28.090> came<00:01:28.270> up<00:01:28.450> with

inspired by me and they came up with
this<00:01:28.750> stuff<00:01:29.050> and<00:01:29.740> I<00:01:30.220> actually<00:01:30.400> think<00:01:30.940> I

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
this stuff and I actually think I

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.460 
this stuff and I actually think I
actually<00:01:31.390> think<00:01:31.600> this<00:01:31.780> stuff's<00:01:32.020> a<00:01:32.140> little<00:01:32.380> bit

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
actually think this stuff's a little bit

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.260 
actually think this stuff's a little bit
better<00:01:32.620> than<00:01:33.660> than<00:01:34.660> what<00:01:34.810> I<00:01:34.840> thought<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.350> and

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
better than than what I thought of and

gold<00:02:18.760> time<00:02:18.970> buff<00:02:19.710> now<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:21.370> important<00:02:21.880> part

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
gold time buff now the important part

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.170 
gold time buff now the important part
with<00:02:22.930> this<00:02:23.370> magic<00:02:24.370> fan<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:24.670> goal<00:02:24.790> time<00:02:25.000> buff

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
with this magic fan and goal time buff

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.850 
with this magic fan and goal time buff
that<00:02:25.210> I<00:02:25.390> actually<00:02:25.630> thought<00:02:26.020> was<00:02:26.080> better<00:02:26.620> than

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
that I actually thought was better than

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.250 
that I actually thought was better than
my<00:02:27.040> idea<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.520> they're<00:02:28.090> playing<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.600> kappa<00:02:28.900> at

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
my idea is they're playing the kappa at

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.340 
my idea is they're playing the kappa at
300<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.130> if<00:02:30.220> your<00:02:30.340> paragon<00:02:30.700> level<00:02:30.970> 100<00:02:31.510> magic

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
300 so if your paragon level 100 magic

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.050 
300 so if your paragon level 100 magic
fine<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.650> goal<00:02:32.770> time<00:02:33.010> does<00:02:33.190> nothing<00:02:33.580> for<00:02:33.610> you

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
fine and goal time does nothing for you

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.150 
fine and goal time does nothing for you
and<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.810> allows<00:02:35.020> you<00:02:35.200> actually<00:02:35.380> focus<00:02:35.800> on

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
and that allows you actually focus on

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.850 
and that allows you actually focus on
really<00:02:36.850> really<00:02:36.970> good<00:02:37.600> gear<00:02:37.930> which<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.710> will

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
really really good gear which you will

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.180 
really really good gear which you will
use<00:02:38.890> for<00:02:39.400> PvP<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.830> think<00:02:41.830> that's<00:02:41.980> awesome

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
use for PvP I think that's awesome

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.090

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
what I really like about the patch so

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.160 
what I really like about the patch so
far<00:03:18.460> is<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.910> kind<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.150> ties<00:03:19.420> into<00:03:19.660> what<00:03:19.810> they

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
far is it kind of ties into what they

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.370 
far is it kind of ties into what they
talked<00:03:20.920> about<00:03:21.070> earlier<00:03:21.490> with<00:03:22.230> how<00:03:23.230> they're

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
talked about earlier with how they're

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.920 
talked about earlier with how they're
making<00:03:23.560> extra<00:03:24.430> incentives<00:03:25.090> with<00:03:25.300> parties<00:03:25.720> you

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
making extra incentives with parties you

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.130 
making extra incentives with parties you
know<00:03:25.960> they're<00:03:26.200> making<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:27.640> inferno<00:03:28.330> HP<00:03:28.990> bonus

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
know they're making the inferno HP bonus

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.160 
know they're making the inferno HP bonus
only<00:03:29.590> 75%<00:03:30.190> per<00:03:30.760> extra<00:03:31.090> player<00:03:31.420> past<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.930> first

only 75% per extra player past the first

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.200 
only 75% per extra player past the first
and<00:03:32.470> that's<00:03:32.860> really<00:03:33.280> important<00:03:33.700> because<00:03:33.820> that

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
and that's really important because that

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.160 
and that's really important because that
actually<00:03:35.170> incentivizes<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.220> group<00:03:36.520> of<00:03:36.640> play<00:03:37.170> so

each stack of Nephilim valor gives you a

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.290 
each stack of Nephilim valor gives you a
15%<00:04:10.660> bonus<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.410> experience<00:04:12.120> that's<00:04:13.120> an

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
15% bonus to experience that's an

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.810 
15% bonus to experience that's an
interesting<00:04:13.660> note<00:04:13.810> as<00:04:14.050> well<00:04:14.320> about<00:04:14.800> that<00:04:14.980> but

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
interesting note as well about that but

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.120 
interesting note as well about that but
um<00:04:17.459> hopefully<00:04:19.260> that<00:04:20.260> actually<00:04:20.650> sets<00:04:20.950> the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
um hopefully that actually sets the

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.630 
um hopefully that actually sets the
difference<00:04:21.459> between<00:04:21.640> players<00:04:22.420> and<00:04:22.570> bots

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
difference between players and bots

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.090 
difference between players and bots
because<00:04:24.640> I<00:04:24.880> feel<00:04:25.479> that<00:04:26.970> under<00:04:27.970> certain

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
because I feel that under certain

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.670 
because I feel that under certain
but<00:04:30.120> scenarios<00:04:31.120> like<00:04:31.450> some<00:04:31.720> bus<00:04:31.930> actually<00:04:32.200> run

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
but scenarios like some bus actually run

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.670 
but scenarios like some bus actually run
like<00:04:33.160> inferno<00:04:33.670> mode<00:04:33.970> I<00:04:34.660> think<00:04:35.230> those<00:04:35.410> bots

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
like inferno mode I think those bots

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.650 
like inferno mode I think those bots
will<00:04:36.100> just<00:04:36.460> mop<00:04:36.670> the<00:04:36.880> floor<00:04:37.150> with<00:04:37.180> most

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
will just mop the floor with most

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.590 
will just mop the floor with most
players<00:04:38.020> in<00:04:38.350> terms<00:04:38.530> of<00:04:38.880> Paragon<00:04:39.880> experience

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
players in terms of Paragon experience

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.410 
players in terms of Paragon experience
game<00:04:40.840> and<00:04:41.350> I<00:04:41.950> think<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.370> champion<00:04:43.090> levels

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
game and I think the champion levels

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.230 
game and I think the champion levels
might<00:04:43.840> us<00:04:45.420> alright<00:04:46.420> alright<00:04:47.230> I<00:04:47.880> I'm<00:04:48.880> not<00:04:49.060> like

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
might us alright alright I I'm not like

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.940 
might us alright alright I I'm not like
trying<00:04:49.360> to<00:04:49.510> play<00:04:49.660> you<00:04:49.720> guys<00:04:49.930> I<00:04:50.170> keep<00:04:50.710> I<00:04:50.890> keep

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
trying to play you guys I keep I keep

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.550 
trying to play you guys I keep I keep
having<00:04:51.370> on<00:04:51.610> my<00:04:51.730> mind<00:04:51.940> but<00:04:52.450> the<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:53.110> Paragon

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
having on my mind but the the Paragon

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.580 
having on my mind but the the Paragon
levels<00:04:53.590> might<00:04:54.070> be<00:04:54.220> trumped<00:04:54.670> by<00:04:54.730> BOTS<00:04:55.060> and<00:04:55.590> they

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
levels might be trumped by BOTS and they

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.110 
levels might be trumped by BOTS and they
might<00:04:56.800> they<00:04:57.250> might<00:04:57.370> be<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:57.850> they<00:04:57.910> might<00:04:58.030> be

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
might they might be and they might be

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.410 
might they might be and they might be
doing<00:04:58.240> that<00:04:58.480> because<00:05:00.030> they<00:05:01.030> just<00:05:01.060> play<00:05:01.360> so

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
doing that because they just play so

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.520 
doing that because they just play so
much<00:05:01.660> more<00:05:01.900> than<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:02.110> like<00:05:02.290> when<00:05:02.410> you're

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
much more than you like when you're

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.740 
much more than you like when you're
playing<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:03.010> game<00:05:03.040> even<00:05:03.820> with<00:05:04.090> like<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.300> 45

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
playing the game even with like a 45

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.360 
playing the game even with like a 45
percent<00:05:04.870> buff<00:05:05.320> you<00:05:05.890> know<00:05:05.980> you're<00:05:06.130> playing

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
percent buff you know you're playing

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.220 
percent buff you know you're playing
maybe<00:05:06.550> six<00:05:06.910> seven<00:05:06.970> hours<00:05:07.270> before<00:05:07.450> you<00:05:08.110> know

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
maybe six seven hours before you know

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.200 
maybe six seven hours before you know
you<00:05:08.290> want<00:05:08.800> to<00:05:08.860> do<00:05:08.950> something<00:05:09.160> else<00:05:09.430> or<00:05:09.670> you

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
you want to do something else or you

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.150 
you want to do something else or you
know<00:05:10.420> even<00:05:10.750> even<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.200> extreme<00:05:11.500> sense<00:05:11.890> like

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
know even even the extreme sense like

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.810 
know even even the extreme sense like
ten<00:05:12.490> hours<00:05:12.520> you<00:05:13.150> know<00:05:13.270> a<00:05:13.510> box<00:05:14.080> doing<00:05:14.350> 24<00:05:15.450> so<00:05:16.450> I

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
ten hours you know a box doing 24 so I

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.640 
ten hours you know a box doing 24 so I
think<00:05:18.820> this<00:05:19.030> might<00:05:19.240> incentivize<00:05:19.690> more<00:05:20.350> but

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
think this might incentivize more but

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.620 
think this might incentivize more but
again<00:05:21.450> however<00:05:23.520> you<00:05:24.520> know<00:05:24.640> the<00:05:24.820> more<00:05:25.060> bots<00:05:25.390> you

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
again however you know the more bots you

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.720 
again however you know the more bots you
have<00:05:25.870> the<00:05:26.410> more<00:05:26.590> easier<00:05:26.980> they<00:05:27.100> are<00:05:27.130> to<00:05:27.250> detect

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
have the more easier they are to detect

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.640 
have the more easier they are to detect
so<00:05:28.060> there<00:05:28.210> may<00:05:28.330> be<00:05:28.360> some<00:05:28.720> balancing<00:05:29.260> point<00:05:29.440> in

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
so there may be some balancing point in

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.980 
so there may be some balancing point in
that<00:05:29.800> in<00:05:29.920> the<00:05:30.040> future<00:05:30.400> but<00:05:31.030> short<00:05:31.420> of<00:05:31.540> that<00:05:31.600> I

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
that in the future but short of that I

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.890 
that in the future but short of that I
think<00:05:32.380> it's<00:05:32.560> just<00:05:32.710> absolutely<00:05:33.430> awesome<00:05:33.700> and

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.870 

yeah<00:05:37.900> I<00:05:38.110> might<00:05:38.410> I<00:05:38.620> might<00:05:38.710> start<00:05:39.310> doing<00:05:39.370> some

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
yeah I might I might start doing some

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.660 
yeah I might I might start doing some
some<00:05:40.420> Diablo<00:05:40.930> grinding<00:05:41.380> but<00:05:42.160> we're<00:05:42.580> gonna

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
some Diablo grinding but we're gonna

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:43.950 
some Diablo grinding but we're gonna
have<00:05:42.880> to<00:05:42.910> take<00:05:43.120> this<00:05:43.270> Guild<00:05:43.540> Wars<00:05:43.720> thing

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
have to take this Guild Wars thing

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.390 
have to take this Guild Wars thing
pretty<00:05:44.170> seriously<00:05:44.260> if<00:05:44.920> you<00:05:45.070> wanted<00:05:45.280> to

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
pretty seriously if you wanted to

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.390 
pretty seriously if you wanted to
succeed<00:05:45.610> and<00:05:46.680> you<00:05:47.680> know<00:05:47.770> that<00:05:47.950> might<00:05:48.160> come

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
succeed and you know that might come

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.270 
succeed and you know that might come
first<00:05:48.700> but<00:05:49.240> holy<00:05:49.600> shit<00:05:49.990> this<00:05:50.560> is<00:05:50.620> some<00:05:51.040> really

first but holy shit this is some really
good<00:05:51.400> news<00:05:51.760> and<00:05:52.230> hopefully<00:05:53.230> hopefully<00:05:53.920> may

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
good news and hopefully hopefully may

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.400 
good news and hopefully hopefully may
continue<00:05:54.700> on<00:05:54.730> this<00:05:55.000> track<00:05:55.300> you<00:05:56.110> know<00:05:56.230> I've

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
continue on this track you know I've

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.990 
continue on this track you know I've
been<00:05:56.440> playing<00:05:56.890> kind<00:05:57.160> of<00:05:57.250> exile<00:05:57.580> for<00:05:57.760> like

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
been playing kind of exile for like

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.590 
been playing kind of exile for like
three<00:05:58.270> weeks

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
three weeks

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.890 
three weeks
and<00:05:58.740> I<00:05:59.740> think<00:06:00.370> they<00:06:00.490> take<00:06:00.700> a<00:06:00.730> lot<00:06:01.030> of<00:06:01.240> feedback

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
and I think they take a lot of feedback

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.600 
and I think they take a lot of feedback
from<00:06:02.140> their<00:06:02.590> users<00:06:02.980> I<00:06:03.760> know<00:06:04.630> they<00:06:04.990> do<00:06:05.370> and<00:06:06.370> I

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
from their users I know they do and I

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.840 
from their users I know they do and I
think<00:06:06.670> I<00:06:07.060> think<00:06:07.120> now<00:06:07.570> that<00:06:07.600> Blizzard<00:06:08.200> has<00:06:08.440> been

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
think I think now that Blizzard has been

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.470 
think I think now that Blizzard has been
showing<00:06:09.850> to<00:06:10.030> do<00:06:10.330> the<00:06:10.480> same<00:06:11.190> it<00:06:12.190> really<00:06:12.820> shows

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
showing to do the same it really shows

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.020 
showing to do the same it really shows
the<00:06:14.140> game<00:06:14.380> and<00:06:14.620> a<00:06:14.650> positive<00:06:15.250> light<00:06:15.490> for<00:06:15.880> the

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
the game and a positive light for the

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.860 
the game and a positive light for the
future<00:06:16.360> of<00:06:17.220> Diablo<00:06:18.220> 3<00:06:18.630> hopefully<00:06:19.630> you<00:06:19.720> guys
