weeks<00:00:12.450> when<00:00:12.929> we<00:00:12.960> talk<00:00:13.170> about<00:00:13.200> drama<00:00:13.469> super

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
weeks when we talk about drama super

weeks when we talk about drama super
stuff<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.730> was<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> question<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.210> popped

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
stuff and it was a question that popped

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.609 
stuff and it was a question that popped
up<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> other<00:00:15.690> day<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:16.109> one<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.260> my<00:00:16.350> comments

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
up the other day in one of my comments

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.830 
up the other day in one of my comments
and<00:00:17.010> specifically<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.640> question<00:00:18.060> was<00:00:18.210> why<00:00:18.779> do

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
and specifically the question was why do

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.450 
and specifically the question was why do
I<00:00:19.050> keep<00:00:19.260> believing<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:19.949> there<00:00:20.100> won't<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.430> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
I keep believing it there won't be a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.010 
I keep believing it there won't be a
time<00:00:20.760> skip<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.150> Dragon<00:00:21.449> Ball<00:00:21.539> super<00:00:21.570> and

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
time skip and Dragon Ball super and

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.470 
time skip and Dragon Ball super and
simply<00:00:22.410> that's<00:00:22.529> because<00:00:22.890> well<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.730> my<00:00:24.119> theory

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
simply that's because well in my theory

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.790 
simply that's because well in my theory
i<00:00:24.510> think<00:00:24.779> drama<00:00:24.990> super<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.380> going<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.650> take

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
i think drama super is going to take

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.070 
i think drama super is going to take
place<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.490> 10-year<00:00:26.880> time<00:00:27.150> gap<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.599> don't

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
place in the 10-year time gap I don't

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.080 
place in the 10-year time gap I don't
see<00:00:28.199> much<00:00:28.380> room<00:00:28.740> there<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.820> be<00:00:29.939> any

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
see much room there for it to be any

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.970 
see much room there for it to be any
time<00:00:30.390> skips<00:00:30.689> other<00:00:30.900> than<00:00:31.560> something<00:00:31.830> that

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
time skips other than something that

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.620 
time skips other than something that
could<00:00:32.070> happen<00:00:32.160> later<00:00:32.520> which<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.120> my<00:00:33.239> Asteria

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
could happen later which is my Asteria

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.540 
could happen later which is my Asteria
why<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> believe<00:00:34.079> toyama<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.130> first<00:00:35.399> place

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
why I believe toyama in the first place

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.790 
why I believe toyama in the first place
decided<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.300> start<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.050> serious<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> lot<00:00:37.559> sooner

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
decided to start to serious a lot sooner

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.260 
decided to start to serious a lot sooner
than<00:00:37.950> later<00:00:38.160> now<00:00:38.610> remember<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.030> battle<00:00:39.210> of

the world tournament that basically

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.110 
the world tournament that basically
ended<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:49.710> Dragon<00:00:49.950> Ball<00:00:50.070> Z<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.489> then<00:00:50.850> after

ended with Dragon Ball Z and then after
that<00:00:51.379> resurrection<00:00:52.379> never<00:00:52.530> took<00:00:52.680> place

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
that resurrection never took place

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.439 
that resurrection never took place
roughly<00:00:53.160> about<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.520> year<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.000> half<00:00:54.030> after

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
roughly about a year and a half after

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.260 
roughly about a year and a half after
that<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:54.960> run<00:00:55.649> literally<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> middle<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
that so run literally the middle of the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.450 
that so run literally the middle of the
ten-year<00:00:58.050> time<00:00:58.260> gap<00:00:58.500> but<00:00:58.920> now<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.160> Tony<00:00:59.370> I'm

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
ten-year time gap but now that Tony I'm

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.830 
ten-year time gap but now that Tony I'm
gonna<00:00:59.609> start<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> series<00:01:00.329> which<00:01:00.719> I'm

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
gonna start to do a series which I'm

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.029 
gonna start to do a series which I'm
pretty<00:01:00.989> sure<00:01:01.079> he<00:01:01.320> didn't<00:01:01.500> really<00:01:01.649> plan<00:01:01.890> on

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
pretty sure he didn't really plan on

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.380 
pretty sure he didn't really plan on
doing<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> first<00:01:02.550> place<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.090> not<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.300> do

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
doing the first place but it's not to do

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.539 
doing the first place but it's not to do
it<00:01:03.480> anyway<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:03.840> because<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:05.040> dragon<00:01:05.339> budget

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
it anyway just because the dragon budget

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.640 
it anyway just because the dragon budget
community<00:01:05.880> has<00:01:05.970> been<00:01:06.060> booming<00:01:06.420> at<00:01:07.380> past

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
community has been booming at past

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.050 
community has been booming at past
couple<00:01:07.860> months<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.250> think<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> main<00:01:09.030> reason

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
couple months I think the main reason

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.850 
couple months I think the main reason
why<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.479> decided<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.840> start<00:01:10.080> over<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.619> because

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
why I decided to start over it's because

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.649 
why I decided to start over it's because
he<00:01:10.979> wanted<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> give<00:01:11.369> him<00:01:11.460> some<00:01:11.760> room<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.630> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
he wanted to give him some room to do a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.330 
he wanted to give him some room to do a
lot<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.260> terms<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.740> all<00:01:13.950> what<00:01:14.070> he<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.159> do<00:01:14.310> for

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
lot in terms of all what he can do for

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.460 
lot in terms of all what he can do for
the<00:01:14.520> series<00:01:14.850> now<00:01:15.299> dragon<00:01:15.780> ball<00:01:15.900> z<00:01:16.080> overall

the series now dragon ball z overall

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.980 
the series now dragon ball z overall
happens<00:01:16.979> over<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> lot<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.299> amount<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.600> years<00:01:18.810> I

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.490 
mean there's a couple times gifts that
we<00:01:20.159> see<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> series<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.210> good<00:01:21.600> example<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:22.170> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
we see in the series a good example is a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.590 
we see in the series a good example is a
after<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.490> freezer<00:01:23.700> fight<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> year

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
after the freezer fight it's like a year

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.260 
after the freezer fight it's like a year
or<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.470> ultimately<00:01:25.979> after<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.880> cell

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
or so and then ultimately after the cell

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.390 
or so and then ultimately after the cell
fight<00:01:27.540> seven<00:01:27.990> years<00:01:28.110> passes<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:29.040> now<00:01:29.189> it's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
fight seven years passes but now it's

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.800 
fight seven years passes but now it's
like<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.939> ten-year<00:01:30.270> time<00:01:30.479> gap<00:01:30.689> o

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
like we have this ten-year time gap o

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.210 
like we have this ten-year time gap o
toriyama<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.350> do<00:01:31.409> pretty<00:01:31.500> much<00:01:31.650> anything<00:01:32.040> he

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
toriyama can do pretty much anything he

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.530 
toriyama can do pretty much anything he
wants<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> that's<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.360> ultimately

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
wants to that's going to ultimately

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.630 
wants to that's going to ultimately
probably<00:01:33.990> end<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.320> same<00:01:34.619> way<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.280> dragon

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
probably end the same way the dragon

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.520 
probably end the same way the dragon
ball<00:01:35.729> z<00:01:35.850> did<00:01:36.000> or<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.329> see<00:01:36.540> Goku<00:01:36.900> flower<00:01:37.110> with<00:01:37.350> oh

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
ball z did or we see Goku flower with oh

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.350 
ball z did or we see Goku flower with oh
maybe<00:01:38.070> go<00:01:38.340> past<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.850> mean<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.090> don't<00:01:39.150> know

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
maybe go past that I mean we don't know

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.210 
maybe go past that I mean we don't know
yet<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.900> what<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> plans<00:01:40.530> are<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.070> feel

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
yet the what the plans are but I feel

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.039 
yet the what the plans are but I feel
like<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.490> started<00:01:41.820> um<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.509> know<00:01:42.630> six<00:01:42.960> months

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
like you started um you know six months

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.899 
like you started um you know six months
after<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.500> bullfight<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.250> he<00:01:44.340> has<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> 10-year

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
after the bullfight so he has a 10-year

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.330 
after the bullfight so he has a 10-year
time<00:01:45.270> gap<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.630> work<00:01:45.780> with<00:01:45.960> whatever<00:01:46.340> could

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
time gap to work with whatever could

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.830 
time gap to work with whatever could
have<00:01:47.430> possibly<00:01:47.579> happen<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.210> between<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
have possibly happen in between the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.359 
have possibly happen in between the
series<00:01:49.229> basically<00:01:49.619> ending<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.070> kid<00:01:50.250> buu

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
series basically ending in a kid buu

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.950 
series basically ending in a kid buu
fight<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.970> that's<00:01:51.119> why<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.270> keep<00:01:51.509> sticking<00:01:51.720> with

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
fight so that's why I keep sticking with

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.539 
fight so that's why I keep sticking with
the<00:01:52.049> theory<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.530> believe<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.159> dragon

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the theory that I believe that dragon

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.700 
the theory that I believe that dragon
ball<00:01:53.640> super<00:01:53.670> won't<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:54.810> any<00:01:54.990> time<00:01:55.229> skips<00:01:55.530> at

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
ball super won't have any time skips at

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.039 
ball super won't have any time skips at
least<00:01:55.860> anytime<00:01:56.250> soon<00:01:56.869> originally<00:01:57.869> we<00:01:57.960> all

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
least anytime soon originally we all

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.300 
least anytime soon originally we all
believe<00:01:58.290> there<00:01:58.469> might<00:01:58.560> there<00:01:58.920> might<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.189> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
believe there might there might be a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.039 
believe there might there might be a
time<00:01:59.549> skip<00:01:59.759> just<00:01:59.939> because<00:02:00.210> we<00:02:00.810> saw<00:02:01.020> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
time skip just because we saw a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.840 
time skip just because we saw a

resurrection F and bowel God's we're all

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.859 
resurrection F and bowel God's we're all
trying<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.060> figure<00:02:03.299> out<00:02:03.329> how<00:02:03.570> both<00:02:03.719> these

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
trying to figure out how both these

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.480 
trying to figure out how both these
moves<00:02:04.140> are<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.530> fit<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.399> new

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
moves are going to fit in with the new

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.249 
moves are going to fit in with the new
series<00:02:05.759> but<00:02:06.030> now<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.240> pretty<00:02:06.450> much<00:02:06.630> toriyama

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
series but now that pretty much toriyama

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.979 
series but now that pretty much toriyama
has<00:02:07.409> confirmed<00:02:07.710> himself<00:02:08.190> last<00:02:09.179> week<00:02:09.450> that

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
battle gods go with this saga and

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.309 
battle gods go with this saga and

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
resurrection effort Oliver it's also got

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.820

as well as have a universe 6 saga in a

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.530 
as well as have a universe 6 saga in a
series<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.950> pretty<00:02:17.190> much<00:02:17.280> confirms<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.210> you

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
series it pretty much confirms that you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.760 
series it pretty much confirms that you
know<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.810> serious<00:02:19.080> won't<00:02:19.260> take<00:02:19.440> place<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.680> at

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
know the serious won't take place in at

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.740 
know the serious won't take place in at
any<00:02:19.950> time<00:02:20.040> gap<00:02:20.460> and<00:02:20.700> at<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.360> point<00:02:21.540> right<00:02:21.690> now

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
any time gap and at this point right now

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.140 
any time gap and at this point right now
that<00:02:21.990> just<00:02:22.080> seems<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.410> be<00:02:22.500> no<00:02:22.770> room<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.100> do<00:02:23.550> much

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
that just seems to be no room to do much

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.640 
that just seems to be no room to do much
of<00:02:24.180> times<00:02:24.540> people<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.840> mean<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:25.290> might<00:02:25.470> have

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
of times people I mean we might have

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.560 
of times people I mean we might have
like<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.830> year<00:02:25.860> or<00:02:26.130> two<00:02:26.250> maybe<00:02:26.640> pass<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.270> between

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
like a year or two maybe pass in between

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.720 
like a year or two maybe pass in between
the<00:02:28.020> resurrection<00:02:28.560> F<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.220> universe<00:02:29.550> 6

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
the resurrection F and the universe 6

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.240 
the resurrection F and the universe 6
fight<00:02:30.000> or<00:02:30.240> saga<00:02:30.780> excuse<00:02:31.050> me<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.860> terms<00:02:32.040> of

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
fight or saga excuse me but in terms of

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.920 
fight or saga excuse me but in terms of
battle<00:02:32.460> gods<00:02:32.730> it's<00:02:33.030> starting<00:02:33.330> right<00:02:33.360> now<00:02:33.570> a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
battle gods it's starting right now a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.990 
battle gods it's starting right now a
lot<00:02:34.110> earlier<00:02:34.280> Toriyama<00:02:35.280> is<00:02:35.340> rewriting<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.850> and

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
lot earlier Toriyama is rewriting it and

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.100 
lot earlier Toriyama is rewriting it and
then<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.240> probably<00:02:36.390> gonna<00:02:36.570> go<00:02:36.690> directly

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
then it's probably gonna go directly

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.740 
then it's probably gonna go directly
into<00:02:37.230> resurrection<00:02:37.860> F<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.160> then<00:02:38.220> from<00:02:38.400> there

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
into resurrection F and then from there

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.970 
into resurrection F and then from there
we're<00:02:39.750> probably<00:02:39.960> like<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.260> year<00:02:40.320> tasket<00:02:40.860> more

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
we're probably like a year tasket more

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.430
