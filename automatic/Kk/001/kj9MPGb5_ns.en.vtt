00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
wait for this time because we can just

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.479 
wait for this time because we can just
kill<00:00:30.210> people<00:00:30.630> for<00:00:30.960> days<00:00:31.140> constantly<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.399> it

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.319 
just happens over and over and over
again<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.860> because<00:00:35.489> they're<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:35.880> new<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.239> the

cqb<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.420> has<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> higher<00:01:43.049> damage<00:01:43.409> model<00:01:43.979> or

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
cqb is it has a higher damage model or

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.490 
cqb is it has a higher damage model or
higher<00:01:44.399> damage<00:01:44.640> output<00:01:45.000> than<00:01:45.630> most<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
higher damage output than most of the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.080 
higher damage output than most of the
other<00:01:46.680> weapons<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> game<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.610> doesn't<00:01:47.700> max

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
other weapons in the game it doesn't max

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.350 
other weapons in the game it doesn't max
damage<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.630> 34<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.710> 8<00:01:49.920> meters<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.210> you're

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
damage of 34 up to 8 meters so if you're

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.030 
damage of 34 up to 8 meters so if you're
in<00:01:51.479> close<00:01:51.659> quarters<00:01:51.960> combat<00:01:51.990> 3<00:01:52.560> shots<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
in close quarters combat 3 shots and

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.069 
in close quarters combat 3 shots and
they're<00:01:53.130> down<00:01:53.310> from<00:01:54.270> eight<00:01:54.390> me<00:01:54.540> as<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.840> drops

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
they're down from eight me as it drops

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.990 
they're down from eight me as it drops
off<00:01:55.259> down<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.649> 50<00:01:56.009> meters<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.460> even<00:01:56.670> then<00:01:56.850> it's

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
off down to 50 meters and even then it's

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.850 
off down to 50 meters and even then it's
still<00:01:57.060> doing<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.540> maximum<00:01:57.990> damage<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.469> twenty

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
still doing a maximum damage of twenty

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.200 
still doing a maximum damage of twenty
first<00:01:59.100> shot<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.520> you're<00:01:59.729> looking<00:01:59.880> at<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
first shot so you're looking at a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.569 
first shot so you're looking at a
maximum<00:02:00.600> 5<00:02:00.990> hit<00:02:01.320> kill<00:02:01.590> with<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.040> weapon<00:02:02.310> at

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
maximum 5 hit kill with this weapon at

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.459 
maximum 5 hit kill with this weapon at
any<00:02:02.820> range<00:02:03.180> really<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.350> to

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
any range really and you have to

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.800 
any range really and you have to
consider<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:05.430> obviously<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.329> carbine

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
consider that obviously it's a carbine

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.930 
consider that obviously it's a carbine
so<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.380> not<00:02:07.740> really<00:02:07.799> supposed<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.550> be<00:02:08.670> used

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
so it's not really supposed to be used

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.180 
so it's not really supposed to be used
by<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.179> really<00:02:09.420> long<00:02:09.660> range<00:02:09.959> combat<00:02:10.259> doesn't

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
by the really long range combat doesn't

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.979 
by the really long range combat doesn't
mean<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.520> can't<00:02:11.790> use<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.840> means

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
mean that you can't use it just means

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.850 
mean that you can't use it just means
that<00:02:13.110> you're<00:02:13.260> going<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.440> be<00:02:13.500> held

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that you're going to be held

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.140 
that you're going to be held
back<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.010> little<00:02:14.130> bit<00:02:14.400> by<00:02:14.550> some<00:02:14.820> of<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.000> other

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
back a little bit by some of the other

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.540 
back a little bit by some of the other
weapons<00:02:15.540> statistics<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:17.160> bullet<00:02:17.460> velocity

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
weapons statistics the bullet velocity

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.180 
weapons statistics the bullet velocity
for<00:02:18.090> this<00:02:18.210> weapon<00:02:18.570> caps<00:02:18.840> out<00:02:19.080> at<00:02:19.290> 400<00:02:19.920> meters

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
for this weapon caps out at 400 meters

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.440 
for this weapon caps out at 400 meters
per<00:02:20.340> second<00:02:20.700> which<00:02:20.880> puts<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.240> in<00:02:21.360> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
per second which puts it in the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.840 
per second which puts it in the
mid-range<00:02:21.660> category<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.650> it's<00:02:22.680> sort<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.550> easy

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
mid-range category and it's sort of easy

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.550 
mid-range category and it's sort of easy
to<00:02:24.060> work<00:02:24.210> with<00:02:24.270> but<00:02:24.750> especially<00:02:24.990> for<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
to work with but especially for the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.680 
to work with but especially for the
medium<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.010> longer<00:02:26.220> range<00:02:26.460> targets<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.450> will

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
medium to longer range targets you will

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.270 
medium to longer range targets you will
have<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.020> lead<00:02:28.200> your<00:02:28.320> target<00:02:28.530> just<00:02:28.950> very

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
have to lead your target just very

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.310 
have to lead your target just very
slightly<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.090> if<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.480> add<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.020> bullet

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
slightly and if you add in the bullet

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.900 
slightly and if you add in the bullet
drop<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.800> which<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.010> 15<00:02:32.490> meters<00:02:32.640> per

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
drop to that which is 15 meters per

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.030 
drop to that which is 15 meters per
second<00:02:33.300> squared<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:34.320> one<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.680> those<00:02:34.740> weapons

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
second squared it's one of those weapons

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.010 
second squared it's one of those weapons
that's<00:02:35.400> got<00:02:35.550> more<00:02:35.820> bullet<00:02:36.120> drop<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.480> most<00:02:36.780> so

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
that's got more bullet drop the most so

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.270 
that's got more bullet drop the most so
if<00:02:37.260> you're<00:02:37.380> going<00:02:37.560> for<00:02:37.710> those<00:02:37.830> longer<00:02:38.130> raised

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
if you're going for those longer raised

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.860 
if you're going for those longer raised
targets<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:38.850> will<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.330> aim<00:02:39.510> slightly

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
targets you will have to aim slightly

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.560 
targets you will have to aim slightly
higher<00:02:40.350> than<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.830> normally<00:02:41.010> would<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:42.480> be

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
higher than you normally would and to be

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.030 
higher than you normally would and to be
honest<00:02:42.840> those<00:02:43.080> are<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.350> only<00:02:43.470> things<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:44.010> I

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
honest those are the only things that I

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.040 
honest those are the only things that I
can<00:02:44.250> really<00:02:44.520> find<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:45.180> bugged<00:02:45.450> me<00:02:45.600> about<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
can really find that bugged me about the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.800 
can really find that bugged me about the
ace<00:02:46.170> 52<00:02:46.380> cqb<00:02:47.250> apart<00:02:48.060> from<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.330> fact<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.630> it

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
ace 52 cqb apart from the fact that it

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.660 
ace 52 cqb apart from the fact that it
does<00:02:48.990> massive<00:02:49.560> damage<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:50.010> mean<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.370> should

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
does massive damage I mean that should

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.430 
does massive damage I mean that should
really<00:02:50.880> be<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.180> deciding<00:02:51.570> factor<00:02:52.110> for<00:02:52.140> you

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
really be the deciding factor for you

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.380 
really be the deciding factor for you
for<00:02:52.920> me<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.190> was<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.610> always<00:02:53.790> wanted<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.120> try<00:02:54.360> out

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
for me it was I always wanted to try out

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.150 
for me it was I always wanted to try out
and<00:02:54.780> actually<00:02:54.870> get<00:02:55.140> properly<00:02:55.560> good<00:02:55.860> with<00:02:56.040> it

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
and actually get properly good with it

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.860 
and actually get properly good with it
start<00:02:56.400> unlocking<00:02:56.640> some<00:02:57.000> specific<00:02:57.540> battle

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
start unlocking some specific battle

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.330 
start unlocking some specific battle
packs<00:02:58.110> for<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.709> could<00:02:58.800> get<00:02:59.160> those

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
packs for it so I could get those

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.640 
packs for it so I could get those
attachments<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.030> wanted<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.450> use<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:01.020> was

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
attachments that I wanted to use it was

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.229 
attachments that I wanted to use it was
really<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.010> only<00:03:02.040> deciding<00:03:02.640> factor<00:03:02.940> because

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
really the only deciding factor because

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.640 
really the only deciding factor because
the<00:03:03.570> more<00:03:03.750> damage<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.140> can<00:03:04.290> put<00:03:04.410> into

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
the more damage you can put into

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
the more damage you can put into
somebody<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.040> quicker<00:03:05.250> you're<00:03:05.430> going<00:03:05.580> to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
somebody the quicker you're going to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.490 
somebody the quicker you're going to

other weapons in the game and therefore
for<00:03:15.390> me<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.720> closer<00:03:16.020> medium-range<00:03:16.770> this<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.489> one

for me a closer medium-range this is one

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.590 
for me a closer medium-range this is one
of<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.820> weapons<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.209> I'm<00:03:18.330> going<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.510> be

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
of the weapons that I'm going to be

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.229

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.080 
using for a long time now as the name
might<00:03:21.450> suggest<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:22.290> ace<00:03:22.500> 52<00:03:22.769> c<00:03:23.280> QV<00:03:23.519> is<00:03:23.820> from

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
might suggest the ace 52 c QV is from

the ACE family of weapons now I found

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.949 
the ACE family of weapons now I found
that<00:03:26.190> they<00:03:26.280> all<00:03:26.430> seem<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.820> sort<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.090> handle<00:03:27.810> the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
already found that with the ace23 that I

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.710 
already found that with the ace23 that I
use<00:03:37.890> for<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.160> assault<00:03:38.489> class<00:03:38.700> I<00:03:39.000> don't<00:03:39.540> need

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
use for the assault class I don't need

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.240 
use for the assault class I don't need
to<00:03:39.780> use<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.080> barrel<00:03:40.440> attachment<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:41.040> that's

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
to use a barrel attachment and that's

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.860 
to use a barrel attachment and that's
the<00:03:41.400> same<00:03:41.580> with<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.850> ace<00:03:41.970> 52<00:03:42.180> I<00:03:42.480> just<00:03:42.690> don't

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
the same with the ace 52 I just don't

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.630 
the same with the ace 52 I just don't
think<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:43.260> needs<00:03:43.530> one<00:03:43.799> none<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:44.489> the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
think it needs one none of the

think it needs one none of the
attachments<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.299> are<00:03:45.420> available<00:03:45.600> really

recommend the angled foregrip instead of

continually<00:04:32.350> going<00:04:32.530> through<00:04:32.860> automatic<00:04:33.220> fire

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
continually going through automatic fire

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.020 
continually going through automatic fire
so<00:04:34.300> for<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:34.570> ace<00:04:34.690> 52<00:04:34.900> its<00:04:35.560> 2.3<00:04:36.460> so<00:04:36.700> that<00:04:36.850> is<00:04:37.000> a

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
so for the ace 52 its 2.3 so that is a

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.580 
so for the ace 52 its 2.3 so that is a
little<00:04:37.270> bit<00:04:37.420> higher<00:04:37.720> than<00:04:37.750> even<00:04:38.230> some<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:38.470> the

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
little bit higher than even some of the

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.930 
little bit higher than even some of the
other<00:04:38.800> weapons<00:04:39.190> out<00:04:39.340> there<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:39.640> usually

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
other weapons out there that usually

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.570 
other weapons out there that usually
have<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.150> around<00:04:40.420> too<00:04:40.720> so<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:42.070> angled

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
have it around too so the angled

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.340 
have it around too so the angled
foregrip<00:04:43.000> reduces<00:04:43.690> that<00:04:43.870> first<00:04:44.110> shot<00:04:44.290> recoil

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
foregrip reduces that first shot recoil

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.230 
foregrip reduces that first shot recoil
multiplier<00:04:44.830> by<00:04:45.430> about<00:04:45.550> thirty<00:04:45.850> three<00:04:46.210> percent

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
multiplier by about thirty three percent

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.880 
multiplier by about thirty three percent
so<00:04:47.080> you're<00:04:47.230> going<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.440> see<00:04:47.620> an<00:04:47.740> improvement

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
so you're going to see an improvement

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.740 
so you're going to see an improvement
with<00:04:48.430> that<00:04:48.610> and<00:04:48.790> you<00:04:48.880> can<00:04:49.060> keep<00:04:49.240> your<00:04:49.390> bullets

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
with that and you can keep your bullets

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.830 
with that and you can keep your bullets
on<00:04:49.870> target<00:04:50.320> when<00:04:50.440> you<00:04:50.560> first<00:04:50.860> start<00:04:51.160> shooting

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
on target when you first start shooting

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.330 
on target when you first start shooting
ultimately<00:04:52.840> controlling<00:04:53.500> recoil<00:04:53.920> is<00:04:54.100> one<00:04:54.250> of

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
ultimately controlling recoil is one of

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.220 
ultimately controlling recoil is one of
the<00:04:54.400> hardest<00:04:54.610> things<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:55.150> do<00:04:55.390> in<00:04:55.630> battlefield

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
the hardest things to do in battlefield

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.140 
the hardest things to do in battlefield
because<00:04:56.410> each<00:04:56.770> weapon<00:04:57.100> has<00:04:57.460> a<00:04:57.490> different<00:04:57.970> type

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
because each weapon has a different type

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.850 
because each weapon has a different type
of<00:04:58.180> Rico<00:04:58.720> and<00:04:58.840> you<00:04:58.900> have<00:04:59.080> to<00:04:59.230> adjust<00:04:59.560> to<00:04:59.710> that

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
of Rico and you have to adjust to that

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.860 
of Rico and you have to adjust to that
every<00:05:00.220> time<00:05:00.400> you<00:05:00.580> change<00:05:00.790> weapon<00:05:01.330> and

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
every time you change weapon and

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.660 
every time you change weapon and
especially<00:05:02.140> for<00:05:02.470> newer<00:05:02.620> players<00:05:02.980> with

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
especially for newer players with

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.400 
especially for newer players with
something<00:05:04.090> like<00:05:04.270> a<00:05:04.450> controller<00:05:04.930> and<00:05:05.200> thumb

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
something like a controller and thumb

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.380 
something like a controller and thumb
sticks<00:05:05.710> it<00:05:05.890> can<00:05:06.190> be<00:05:06.370> quite<00:05:06.610> hard<00:05:06.850> to<00:05:07.090> control

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
sticks it can be quite hard to control

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.000 
sticks it can be quite hard to control
the<00:05:07.600> recoil<00:05:07.780> now<00:05:08.140> if<00:05:08.230> you're<00:05:08.380> an<00:05:08.470> experienced

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
the recoil now if you're an experienced

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.260 
the recoil now if you're an experienced
player<00:05:09.160> then<00:05:09.400> I'm<00:05:09.490> guessing<00:05:09.850> you've<00:05:10.000> learned

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
player then I'm guessing you've learned

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.180 
player then I'm guessing you've learned
that<00:05:10.420> already<00:05:10.540> but<00:05:11.350> if<00:05:11.440> you<00:05:11.590> have<00:05:11.770> just<00:05:11.800> got<00:05:12.160> a

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
that already but if you have just got a

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.820 
that already but if you have just got a
brand<00:05:12.520> new<00:05:12.610> console<00:05:13.150> for<00:05:13.300> Christmas<00:05:13.780> just<00:05:14.560> try

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
brand new console for Christmas just try

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.830 
brand new console for Christmas just try
and<00:05:15.070> sort<00:05:15.370> of<00:05:15.460> learn<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:15.910> recoil<00:05:16.360> first<00:05:16.690> of

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
and sort of learn the recoil first of

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.570 
and sort of learn the recoil first of
all<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.200> weapons<00:05:17.590> start<00:05:18.100> out<00:05:18.280> with<00:05:18.460> the

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
all the weapons start out with the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.490 
all the weapons start out with the
starter<00:05:18.940> weapons<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.300> ak-12<00:05:19.810> doesn't<00:05:20.320> really

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
starter weapons the ak-12 doesn't really

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.290 
starter weapons the ak-12 doesn't really
have<00:05:20.740> any<00:05:20.980> recoil<00:05:21.340> so<00:05:21.550> when<00:05:21.700> you<00:05:21.790> start<00:05:21.970> to<00:05:22.150> get

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
have any recoil so when you start to get

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.970 
have any recoil so when you start to get
into<00:05:22.480> some<00:05:22.690> of<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:22.840> more<00:05:23.020> assault<00:05:23.320> weapons<00:05:23.710> or

into some of the more assault weapons or

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.409 
into some of the more assault weapons or
if<00:05:24.400> you're<00:05:24.550> going<00:05:24.700> through<00:05:24.790> the<00:05:24.970> engineer

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
if you're going through the engineer

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.510 
if you're going through the engineer
class<00:05:25.660> make<00:05:26.350> sure<00:05:26.560> you<00:05:26.710> get<00:05:26.890> a<00:05:26.950> feel<00:05:27.220> for<00:05:27.430> that

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
class make sure you get a feel for that

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.400 
class make sure you get a feel for that
recoil<00:05:27.970> before<00:05:28.360> you<00:05:28.450> start<00:05:28.660> going<00:05:28.780> ham<00:05:29.110> on<00:05:29.140> the

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
recoil before you start going ham on the

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.380 
recoil before you start going ham on the
enemies<00:05:29.740> because<00:05:30.130> it's<00:05:30.550> a<00:05:30.669> real<00:05:30.940> asset<00:05:31.180> to

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
enemies because it's a real asset to

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.240 
enemies because it's a real asset to
know<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.990> recall<00:05:32.380> of<00:05:32.410> a<00:05:32.680> weapon<00:05:32.860> you<00:05:33.100> can

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
know the recall of a weapon you can

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.210 
know the recall of a weapon you can
control<00:05:33.669> it<00:05:33.820> so<00:05:34.090> much<00:05:34.300> more<00:05:34.890> moving<00:05:35.890> back<00:05:36.040> to

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
control it so much more moving back to

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.340 
control it so much more moving back to
the<00:05:36.340> weapon<00:05:36.700> though<00:05:36.910> it's<00:05:37.630> becoming<00:05:38.050> one<00:05:38.320> of

the weapon though it's becoming one of

the weapon though it's becoming one of
my<00:05:38.560> favorite<00:05:39.010> ones<00:05:39.190> in<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.580> whole<00:05:39.790> game<00:05:40.030> I've

brilliant weapon and once you unlock it
it<00:05:57.550> will<00:05:57.669> be<00:05:57.760> hard<00:05:58.000> to<00:05:58.180> go<00:05:58.330> back<00:05:58.360> to<00:05:58.690> any<00:05:58.870> sort

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169

higher<00:06:01.570> damage<00:06:01.900> model<00:06:02.350> you<00:06:02.500> drop<00:06:02.770> people<00:06:02.950> so

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
higher damage model you drop people so

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.370 
higher damage model you drop people so
much<00:06:03.520> quicker<00:06:03.850> it's<00:06:04.390> got<00:06:04.570> a<00:06:04.600> low<00:06:04.810> rate<00:06:04.990> of<00:06:05.169> fire

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
much quicker it's got a low rate of fire

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.540 
much quicker it's got a low rate of fire
which<00:06:05.590> means<00:06:05.860> that<00:06:05.919> you<00:06:06.040> can<00:06:06.130> keep<00:06:06.460> the

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
which means that you can keep the

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.700 
which means that you can keep the
bullets<00:06:06.729> on<00:06:07.000> target<00:06:07.540> all<00:06:07.660> the<00:06:07.780> time<00:06:07.990> and<00:06:08.229> as<00:06:08.590> I

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
bullets on target all the time and as I

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.260 
bullets on target all the time and as I
said<00:06:08.770> if<00:06:08.979> you<00:06:09.070> can<00:06:09.250> learn<00:06:09.400> to<00:06:09.640> control<00:06:09.940> the

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
said if you can learn to control the

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.840 
said if you can learn to control the
recoil<00:06:10.450> you<00:06:11.260> really<00:06:11.800> can<00:06:12.040> drop<00:06:12.370> people<00:06:12.550> with

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
recoil you really can drop people with

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.420 
recoil you really can drop people with
