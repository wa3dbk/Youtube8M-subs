00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.910
 we are the conference of htc friends 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.190
 of ideas and we have just arrived here at 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.679
 world congress htc and the second 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.089
 conference the day before and huawei ma 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.510
 huawei showed only one 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.189
 beautiful smartwatch htc has passed 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.470
 quickly of the presentation of the one 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.500
 m9 you see framed in this 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.990
 moment because the real news are others 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.119
 ie a brv virtual arbitrator viewer 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.199
 realized in collaboration with val ma 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.660
 we'll talk about that later 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.059
 let's talk now is instead of the htc m9 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.940
 hdc still raises the bar compared 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.550
 last year proposing a one 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.110
 even higher level smartphone 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.059
 I will sell a smartphone today really is 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.660
 really hard to make one 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.989
 High-end smartphone is really 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.690
 very hard 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.190
 htc tried to do it tried to 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.289
 further improve its model 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.020
 last year's peak changing 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.399
 slightly design but you see it is not 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.920
 however quite unchanged except 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.260
 this small profile that unites two 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.030
 different aluminum levels 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.070
 otherwise the form and this screen 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.659
 5-inch speakers above and below 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.970
 bull sound comes to collaboration 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.040
 with dolby for 5.1 sound 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.990
 it seems to us all marketing this 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.030
 we clearly say 5.1 years on 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.799
 smartphone with speakers so small 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.630
 don't believe it 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.939
 the audio quality impression will be 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.659
 certainly good though 5.1 is all 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.380
 another thing 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.600
 htc has improved a lot instead 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.189
 camcorder camcorders because ultra 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.229
 pixel was not understood from the point of 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.270
 view of ultra peak direct camera marketing 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.270
 but then with some people he only saw 4 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.590
 megapixel thought well maybe they are me 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.390
 a little tease better to take 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.220
 those with more pixels made them htc 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.619
 he married the unsa pixel camera 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.390
 in front of this room is perhaps the room 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.610
 for my people experience is present 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.750
 in the market they are only 4 megapixels though 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.700
 are 4 megapixels 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.890
 let's say big guys so they help 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.159
 especially for the senses in the dark on 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.799
 retro camera instead of traditional 20 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.450
 megapixel also always gets up 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.219
 sensor resolution remains more and more 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.960
 small perhaps in this case if in 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.629
 little womb because I respect it 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.180
 last year the room stands out 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.890
 hair 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.390
 returning to the other data 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.380
 inside we find 3gb of ram 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.520
 processor with 810 and 32 GB of memory 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.020
 let's say I never have the platform 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.390
 standard for the latest range phone 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.580
 high 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.380
 we did play not warm let's say 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.970
 that maybe samsung needs an excuse 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.700
 to abandon some of this 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.160
 example rules 810 seem to put it 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.770
 all a bit everywhere without too many 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.580
 concerns 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.910
 obviously the smartphone and hyper 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.910
 bodied with everything to bluetooth and nfc 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.680
 you think of elements that are never straight 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.600
 integrates or the play of qualcomm then yes 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.100
 connects to multiroom speakers without 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.590
 need to have a bridge adapter 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.310
 between him and the speaker 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.830
 news for the htc sense we see 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.840
 right now the improvements in this 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.120
 case they are essentially two the widget 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.280
 This is the main thing we see there 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.130
 written home house because geolocalized 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.260
 automatically changes between home work and 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.150
 other settings we go to 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.440
 prepare by showing us the applications 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.160
 more appropriate therefore if we are at home 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.140
 maybe media player invitations for movies 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.850
 various house charges at work 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.850
 the apps we use at work instead 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.760
 more often then they have not changed 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.880
 radicals in the sense we say sen 7 which will be 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.090
 day also on other smartphones 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.970
 door 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.270
 but few new things we say that they are 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.890
 interesting news especially this 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.140
 because it allows us to organize better 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.260
 let's say the app is also the possibility 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.580
 to take a picture and go to load 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.780
 probably with an application of 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.730
 gallery that manages all the 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.830
 Cloud spaces often take a picture 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.480
 you never know where it ends up and with 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.440
 photo not knowing had to finish it never is 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.930
 nice this however new one one m9 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.800
 an upgrade compared to m 8 maybe even 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.290
 a product certainly beautiful but to the 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.440
 question is or the bikes with problems 9 the 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.510
 answer is I don't know we don't know what 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.980
 advise why actually one 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.280
 smartphone better but not so 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.540
 different will arrive in March the price is 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.140
 It was formalized but given the 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.209
 equipment 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.090
 we think 699 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.830
 be the minimum for this new htc too 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.539
 for charity usually smartphones there 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.919
 makes beautiful makes them beautiful and all 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.699
 detailed but also makes them pay 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.699
 quite expensive
