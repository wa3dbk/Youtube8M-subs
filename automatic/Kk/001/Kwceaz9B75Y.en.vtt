is absolutely overpowered and I'm pretty

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.780 
is absolutely overpowered and I'm pretty
sure<00:00:12.840> Bruce<00:00:13.200> we're<00:00:13.410> going<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.620> not<00:00:14.160> fix<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.670> at

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
some point so I will show you two other

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.470 
some point so I will show you two other
ones<00:00:16.890> which<00:00:17.100> are<00:00:17.250> quite<00:00:17.430> reasonable<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:18.270> I

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
ones which are quite reasonable that I

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.990 
ones which are quite reasonable that I
think<00:00:18.779> have<00:00:18.900> got<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.109> far<00:00:19.859> smaller<00:00:20.160> risk<00:00:20.760> of

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
think have got a far smaller risk of

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.599 
think have got a far smaller risk of
being<00:00:21.570> hot<00:00:21.869> fixed<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.740> right<00:00:23.039> now<00:00:23.160> I'm<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
being hot fixed so right now I'm in the

my character thing is and it's pretty

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.430 
my character thing is and it's pretty
insane<00:00:31.109> actually<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.360> these<00:00:33.360> mobs<00:00:33.630> spawn<00:00:34.079> at

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
insane actually and these mobs spawn at

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.250 
insane actually and these mobs spawn at
a<00:00:34.500> ridiculously<00:00:35.460> fast<00:00:35.969> level<00:00:36.510> like<00:00:36.809> maybe

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
a ridiculously fast level like maybe

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.130 
a ridiculously fast level like maybe
sometimes<00:00:38.010> ten<00:00:38.340> seconds<00:00:38.879> faster<00:00:39.329> or<00:00:39.840> after

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
sometimes ten seconds faster or after

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.720 
sometimes ten seconds faster or after
you<00:00:40.230> kill<00:00:40.469> one<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> them<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.579> that's

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
you kill one of them so that's

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.740

help you a lot of it comes down just a
potluck<00:01:00.300> because<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.840> drop<00:01:01.050> rates<00:01:01.320> are<00:01:01.559> so

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
potluck because the drop rates are so

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.609 
potluck because the drop rates are so
inconsistent<00:01:03.000> there<00:01:03.809> are<00:01:03.930> times<00:01:04.199> where<00:01:04.500> I've

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
inconsistent there are times where I've

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.800 
inconsistent there are times where I've
went<00:01:04.860> through<00:01:05.010> maybe<00:01:05.430> 10<00:01:05.939> 15<00:01:06.360> minutes<00:01:06.659> with<00:01:06.780> no

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
went through maybe 10 15 minutes with no

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.500 
went through maybe 10 15 minutes with no
drops<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:08.189> bright<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:08.970> I've<00:01:09.090> done<00:01:09.299> this

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
drops and just bright but I've done this

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.270 
drops and just bright but I've done this
video<00:01:09.720> look<00:01:10.110> how<00:01:10.229> many<00:01:10.439> I've<00:01:10.619> got<00:01:10.830> that's

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
definitely going to be hot fixed at some

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.740 
definitely going to be hot fixed at some
point<00:01:31.650> however<00:01:32.090> look<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.390> duration<00:01:33.570> of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
point however look for the duration of

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.660 
point however look for the duration of

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
whatever if while this is a thing go

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.350 
whatever if while this is a thing go
ahead<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.310> use<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.490> because<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:39.150> save

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
ahead and use it because it will save

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.179 
ahead and use it because it will save
you<00:01:39.509> time<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.200> drop<00:01:40.439> rates<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.860> these<00:01:41.009> things

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
you time the drop rates for these things

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.639 
you time the drop rates for these things
as<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> said<00:01:41.670> are<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:41.970> inconsistent<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.869> time

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
as I said are so inconsistent that time

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.960 
as I said are so inconsistent that time
you<00:01:43.890> need<00:01:44.040> everything<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.549> your<00:01:44.700> side

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
you need everything on your side

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
to the frost fire one obviously however

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.370 
to the frost fire one obviously however
it<00:02:01.979> does<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.310> one<00:02:02.549> rather<00:02:03.000> large<00:02:03.570> problem

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
it does have one rather large problem

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.550 
it does have one rather large problem
this<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.520> questing<00:02:06.060> location<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:07.380> fact

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
this is a questing location and in fact

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.650 
this is a questing location and in fact
a<00:02:07.710> lot<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.979> these<00:02:08.069> mobs<00:02:08.340> drop<00:02:08.940> quest<00:02:09.300> items

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
a lot of these mobs drop quest items

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.420 
a lot of these mobs drop quest items
this<00:02:09.810> means<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.440> may<00:02:10.709> face<00:02:11.039> competition

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
this means that you may face competition

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.520 
this means that you may face competition
from<00:02:12.209> other<00:02:12.420> people<00:02:12.900> who<00:02:13.110> are

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
you know during their quests which is a

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.040 
you know during their quests which is a
little<00:02:16.230> bit<00:02:16.350> annoying<00:02:16.590> honestly<00:02:17.630> so<00:02:18.630> if<00:02:18.870> it's

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
little bit annoying honestly so if it's

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.230 
little bit annoying honestly so if it's
busy<00:02:19.470> then<00:02:19.709> you're<00:02:20.190> probably<00:02:20.400> not<00:02:20.610> want<00:02:21.000> to

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
busy then you're probably not want to

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.030 
busy then you're probably not want to
you<00:02:22.050> probably<00:02:22.290> won't<00:02:22.410> want<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.650> check<00:02:22.890> this

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
you probably won't want to check this

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
this place during my testing before this

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.530 
this place during my testing before this
video<00:02:37.500> where<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:37.770> had<00:02:38.010> loads<00:02:38.459> of<00:02:38.880> things<00:02:39.120> drop

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
and very quickly you know within five

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.350 
and very quickly you know within five
minutes<00:02:42.540> like<00:02:42.930> maybe<00:02:43.230> got<00:02:43.590> like<00:02:43.860> 15<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.670> then

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
minutes like maybe got like 15 and then

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.000 
minutes like maybe got like 15 and then
I've<00:02:45.540> had<00:02:45.570> loads<00:02:46.019> dry<00:02:46.260> spells<00:02:46.530> where<00:02:46.769> again

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
I've had loads dry spells where again

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.560 
I've had loads dry spells where again
it's<00:02:47.190> been<00:02:47.370> like<00:02:47.489> 20<00:02:47.880> minutes<00:02:48.060> with<00:02:48.330> hardly

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.860 
it's been like 20 minutes with hardly
anything<00:02:48.959> so<00:02:49.610> again<00:02:50.610> it's<00:02:50.940> really<00:02:51.180> about<00:02:51.720> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
anything so again it's really about the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.830 
anything so again it's really about the
luck<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.230> draw<00:02:52.410> with<00:02:53.070> this<00:02:53.630> you<00:02:54.630> could<00:02:54.780> be

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
luck of the draw with this you could be

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.390 
luck of the draw with this you could be
in<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.019> best<00:02:55.200> farming<00:02:55.560> location<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.190> just

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
in the best farming location and just

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.970 
in the best farming location and just
get<00:02:56.580> extremely<00:02:57.330> unlucky<00:02:57.930> now<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.650> terms<00:02:58.830> of

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
get extremely unlucky now in terms of

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.620 
get extremely unlucky now in terms of
routes<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.370> stuff<00:02:59.459> like<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.970> really<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.569> just

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
routes and stuff like that really I just

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.000 
routes and stuff like that really I just
recommend<00:03:01.170> running<00:03:01.440> around<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.709> place<00:03:01.800> and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
recommend running around the place and

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.400 
recommend running around the place and
killing<00:03:02.610> stuff<00:03:02.880> that's<00:03:03.150> living<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.690> if<00:03:04.290> you

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
killing stuff that's living and if you

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.080 
killing stuff that's living and if you
go<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:04.709> here<00:03:04.980> with<00:03:05.160> some<00:03:05.430> sort<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.670> specific

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
go in here with some sort of specific

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.130 
go in here with some sort of specific
route<00:03:06.269> all<00:03:06.420> that's<00:03:06.569> going<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.780> happen<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:07.110> a

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
route all that's going to happen is a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.770 
route all that's going to happen is a
few<00:03:07.380> people<00:03:07.650> doing<00:03:07.890> quests<00:03:08.130> will<00:03:08.510> appear<00:03:09.510> and

or<00:03:29.310> spot<00:03:30.140> so<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.290> final<00:03:31.620> place<00:03:31.829> is<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.640> Arun<00:03:33.390> I

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
or spot so the final place is the Arun I

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.870 
or spot so the final place is the Arun I
coast<00:03:34.019> which<00:03:34.590> is<00:03:34.829> located<00:03:35.220> here<00:03:35.579> which<00:03:35.760> is

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
coast which is located here which is

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.600 
coast which is located here which is
actually<00:03:36.030> right<00:03:36.450> beside<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:37.260> marking<00:03:37.950> on<00:03:38.070> see

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
actually right beside a marking on see

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.340 
actually right beside a marking on see
chart<00:03:38.910> this<00:03:39.360> place<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.720> really<00:03:39.900> good<00:03:40.110> for<00:03:40.290> a

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
chart this place is really good for a

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.840 
chart this place is really good for a
number<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.590> reasons<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:41.220> there's<00:03:41.519> decently

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
number of reasons and there's decently

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.370 
number of reasons and there's decently
consistent<00:03:42.390> spawns<00:03:42.630> with<00:03:42.840> these<00:03:42.959> boats<00:03:43.200> that

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
consistent spawns with these boats that

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.650 
consistent spawns with these boats that
come<00:03:43.530> in<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.950> they<00:03:44.100> drop<00:03:44.760> off<00:03:44.940> guys<00:03:45.180> in<00:03:45.390> pairs

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
come in and they drop off guys in pairs

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.960 
come in and they drop off guys in pairs
which<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:46.410> pretty<00:03:46.590> handy<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.250> in<00:03:47.579> general

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
which is pretty handy and in general

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.130 
which is pretty handy and in general
there's<00:03:48.150> just<00:03:48.299> quite<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.570> lot<00:03:48.810> of<00:03:48.930> mobs

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
there's just quite a lot of mobs

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.330 
there's just quite a lot of mobs
floating<00:03:49.590> around<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.950> place

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
floating around the place

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.150 
floating around the place
they<00:03:50.790> are<00:03:51.239> also<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:52.260> know<00:03:52.350> it's<00:03:52.500> tailed<00:03:52.739> or<00:03:52.950> so

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
they are also you know it's tailed or so

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.770 
they are also you know it's tailed or so
there<00:03:53.280> have<00:03:53.400> 94<00:03:53.910> they're<00:03:54.120> pretty<00:03:54.299> weak<00:03:54.540> and

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
there have 94 they're pretty weak and

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.900 
there have 94 they're pretty weak and
that's<00:03:55.200> certainly<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.709> nice<00:03:55.890> thing<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.670> fact

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
that's certainly a nice thing the fact

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.430 
that's certainly a nice thing the fact
that<00:03:56.970> they<00:03:57.090> spawn<00:03:57.329> in<00:03:57.359> pairs<00:03:57.660> is<00:03:57.900> very<00:03:58.200> nice

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
that they spawn in pairs is very nice

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.080 
that they spawn in pairs is very nice
for<00:03:58.650> some<00:03:58.799> classes<00:03:59.280> for<00:03:59.310> an<00:03:59.489> example<00:03:59.880> I've<00:03:59.940> got

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
for some classes for an example I've got

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.150 
for some classes for an example I've got
chimera<00:04:00.510> shot<00:04:00.810> which<00:04:01.079> will<00:04:01.320> do<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.500> bit<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.680> AoE

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
chimera shot which will do a bit of AoE

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.710 
chimera shot which will do a bit of AoE
to<00:04:02.579> targets<00:04:03.060> who<00:04:03.150> are<00:04:03.209> adjacent<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.630> each

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
to targets who are adjacent to each

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.560 
to targets who are adjacent to each
other<00:04:03.989> it's<00:04:04.260> very<00:04:04.380> good<00:04:04.829> and<00:04:05.180> really<00:04:06.180> while

beach and then just make your way back

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.959 
beach and then just make your way back
here<00:04:54.229> and<00:04:54.469> that<00:04:54.710> should<00:04:55.069> be<00:04:55.189> you<00:04:55.340> pretty<00:04:55.699> much

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:55.969 
here and that should be you pretty much

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.540 
here and that should be you pretty much
good<00:04:56.330> you<00:04:56.840> really<00:04:57.110> do<00:04:57.379> kill<00:04:57.620> a<00:04:57.650> lot<00:04:58.159> of<00:04:58.340> mobs

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
good you really do kill a lot of mobs

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.390 
good you really do kill a lot of mobs
here<00:04:58.849> and<00:04:59.560> this<00:05:00.560> is<00:05:00.740> my<00:05:00.770> favorite<00:05:01.310> spot

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
here and this is my favorite spot

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.149 
here and this is my favorite spot
because<00:05:01.849> unlike<00:05:02.479> the<00:05:02.689> Arcanum<00:05:03.080> shipyard<00:05:03.860> it's

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
because unlike the Arcanum shipyard it's

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:06.309 
because unlike the Arcanum shipyard it's
not<00:05:04.939> really<00:05:05.419> it's<00:05:05.659> not<00:05:05.779> full<00:05:06.080> of<00:05:06.169> players

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319 
not really it's not full of players

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.019 
not really it's not full of players
question<00:05:06.830> anything<00:05:07.039> like<00:05:07.219> that<00:05:07.250> there<00:05:07.909> is<00:05:08.000> a

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:08.029 
question anything like that there is a

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:10.240 
question anything like that there is a
bonus<00:05:08.210> objective<00:05:08.689> here<00:05:08.870> but<00:05:09.169> I<00:05:09.529> just<00:05:10.039> seem<00:05:10.159> to

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
bonus objective here but I just seem to

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.309 
bonus objective here but I just seem to
have<00:05:10.370> less<00:05:10.520> competition<00:05:10.699> and<00:05:11.270> well<00:05:12.050> I<00:05:12.080> say

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:12.319

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
armor scraps mean that you would have to

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.629 
armor scraps mean that you would have to
farm<00:05:49.580> for<00:05:49.759> like<00:05:50.089> 20<00:05:50.750> or<00:05:50.870> 30<00:05:51.139> hours<00:05:51.560> to<00:05:51.589> get<00:05:52.009> a<00:05:52.339> a

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
farm for like 20 or 30 hours to get a a

farm for like 20 or 30 hours to get a a
ver<00:05:52.699> egde<00:05:53.000> number<00:05:53.779> per<00:05:53.960> hour<00:05:54.080> that<00:05:54.349> sticks

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
ver egde number per hour that sticks

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.679 
ver egde number per hour that sticks
statistically<00:05:55.580> like<00:05:56.000> significant<00:05:56.599> and

00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:56.689 
statistically like significant and

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.079 
statistically like significant and
meaningful<00:05:56.779> and<00:05:57.349> so<00:05:58.069> I'm<00:05:58.219> gonna<00:05:58.430> say<00:05:58.639> is<00:05:58.879> that

00:05:59.079 --> 00:05:59.089 
meaningful and so I'm gonna say is that

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:02.439 
meaningful and so I'm gonna say is that
roughly<00:05:59.449> you're<00:05:59.990> going<00:06:00.229> to<00:06:00.319> get<00:06:00.500> from<00:06:01.330> 40<00:06:02.330> if

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
roughly you're going to get from 40 if

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:05.679 
roughly you're going to get from 40 if
you're<00:06:02.599> super<00:06:02.810> unlucky<00:06:03.259> to<00:06:04.189> to<00:06:05.000> a<00:06:05.029> hundred<00:06:05.569> an

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:05.689 
you're super unlucky to to a hundred an

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:08.709 
you're super unlucky to to a hundred an
hour<00:06:06.039> maybe<00:06:07.039> you're<00:06:07.250> gonna<00:06:07.430> be<00:06:07.789> you<00:06:08.569> might

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:08.719 
hour maybe you're gonna be you might

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:10.420 
hour maybe you're gonna be you might
just<00:06:08.930> have<00:06:09.050> an<00:06:09.169> extremely<00:06:09.800> lucky<00:06:10.069> hour<00:06:10.279> and

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
just have an extremely lucky hour and

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.249 
just have an extremely lucky hour and
get<00:06:10.580> 200<00:06:11.120> maybe<00:06:11.569> you'll<00:06:11.750> have<00:06:11.810> a<00:06:11.900> terrible

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259 
get 200 maybe you'll have a terrible

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.740 
get 200 maybe you'll have a terrible
hour<00:06:12.379> and<00:06:12.589> only<00:06:12.620> get<00:06:12.860> 20<00:06:13.310> but<00:06:13.729> roughly<00:06:14.120> I<00:06:14.210> found

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
hour and only get 20 but roughly I found

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.010 
hour and only get 20 but roughly I found
that<00:06:14.930> I've<00:06:15.050> been<00:06:15.199> getting<00:06:15.560> in<00:06:15.680> and<00:06:16.219> around<00:06:17.020> 60

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
that I've been getting in and around 60

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.350 
that I've been getting in and around 60
to<00:06:18.560> 80<00:06:18.770> an<00:06:18.979> hour<00:06:19.099> that<00:06:19.310> would<00:06:19.490> be<00:06:19.610> my<00:06:19.789> average<00:06:20.180> I

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
to 80 an hour that would be my average I

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.600 
to 80 an hour that would be my average I
would<00:06:20.539> say<00:06:20.779> based<00:06:21.050> on<00:06:21.319> what<00:06:21.500> I<00:06:21.529> can<00:06:21.740> what

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
would say based on what I can what

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.279 
would say based on what I can what
really<00:06:22.909> I<00:06:22.939> found<00:06:23.180> during<00:06:23.419> the<00:06:23.539> beta<00:06:23.779> and<00:06:24.110> then

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
really I found during the beta and then

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.290 
really I found during the beta and then
with<00:06:24.500> my<00:06:24.650> testing<00:06:25.069> in<00:06:25.189> life<00:06:25.400> so<00:06:25.969> that's<00:06:26.060> really

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
with my testing in life so that's really

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.689 
with my testing in life so that's really
it<00:06:26.509> for<00:06:26.839> farming<00:06:27.379> this<00:06:27.680> stuff<00:06:27.949> um<00:06:28.189> overall

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:28.699 
it for farming this stuff um overall

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:30.490 
it for farming this stuff um overall
it's<00:06:29.029> a<00:06:29.120> bit<00:06:29.300> of<00:06:29.419> a<00:06:29.509> sped<00:06:29.990> of<00:06:30.080> a<00:06:30.139> painting<00:06:30.469> I

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
it's a bit of a sped of a painting I

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.619 
it's a bit of a sped of a painting I
asked<00:06:30.620> the<00:06:30.770> farm<00:06:31.039> I'll<00:06:31.159> be<00:06:31.279> honest<00:06:31.610> but<00:06:32.330> it

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:32.629 
asked the farm I'll be honest but it

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:35.800 
asked the farm I'll be honest but it
does<00:06:33.110> yield<00:06:33.620> some<00:06:34.039> really<00:06:34.849> awesome<00:06:35.029> transmog

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
does yield some really awesome transmog

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.629 
does yield some really awesome transmog
gear<00:06:36.080> so<00:06:36.349> hey<00:06:36.500> I<00:06:36.529> guess<00:06:36.889> it's<00:06:37.069> worth<00:06:37.279> it<00:06:37.459> in<00:06:37.610> the

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
gear so hey I guess it's worth it in the

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:38.100 
gear so hey I guess it's worth it in the
end

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:44.980 
get additional armor scraps via the work

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.620 
get additional armor scraps via the work

however<00:06:47.200> it's<00:06:47.560> not<00:06:47.830> really<00:06:48.070> worth<00:06:48.790> it<00:06:49.090> and

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
however it's not really worth it and

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.710 
however it's not really worth it and
it's<00:06:49.810> 20-gallon<00:06:50.380> resources<00:06:51.250> for<00:06:51.850> usually<00:06:52.300> one

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
it's 20-gallon resources for usually one

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.450 
it's 20-gallon resources for usually one
scrap<00:06:53.170> and<00:06:53.380> that's<00:06:53.530> one<00:06:53.680> scrap<00:06:53.920> every<00:06:54.190> four

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460

scrap and that's one scrap every four
hours<00:06:54.490> I<00:06:55.380> personally<00:06:56.380> just<00:06:56.410> do<00:06:56.740> not<00:06:56.920> see<00:06:57.130> the

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250 
hours I personally just do not see the

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.920 
hours I personally just do not see the
value<00:06:57.370> in<00:06:57.670> that<00:06:57.820> I<00:06:57.850> don't<00:06:58.330> think<00:06:58.570> it's<00:06:58.750> worth

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
value in that I don't think it's worth

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.530 
value in that I don't think it's worth
it<00:06:59.170> and<00:06:59.290> now<00:06:59.890> that<00:07:00.070> said<00:07:00.340> if<00:07:00.550> you<00:07:00.940> are<00:07:00.970> like<00:07:01.330> me

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:01.540 
it and now that said if you are like me

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.310 
it and now that said if you are like me
and<00:07:01.600> you've<00:07:01.720> got<00:07:01.840> a<00:07:01.870> whole<00:07:02.020> bunch<00:07:02.140> of

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
and you've got a whole bunch of

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.200 
and you've got a whole bunch of
scavenger<00:07:02.710> followers<00:07:03.160> you<00:07:03.580> will<00:07:03.700> probably

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
scavenger followers you will probably

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.690 
scavenger followers you will probably
want<00:07:04.420> to<00:07:04.540> throw<00:07:05.410> your<00:07:05.650> garrison<00:07:05.950> resources

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 
into the bunker anyway and the reason

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.860 
into the bunker anyway and the reason
for<00:07:09.580> that<00:07:09.670> is<00:07:09.790> because<00:07:10.000> you<00:07:10.090> can<00:07:10.120> get<00:07:10.510> armor

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:10.870 
for that is because you can get armor

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.510 
for that is because you can get armor
