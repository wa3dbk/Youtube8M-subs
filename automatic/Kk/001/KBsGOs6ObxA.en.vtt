00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.709
 is the curb rubs them 

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:12.120
 there are several blocks that collide name of 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:18.379
 skype 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.379
 the runner is trying to help 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.350
 and here unfortunately 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.119
 it seems to me that some only use the 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.119
 Lotus true number 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.750
 in Asia 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.620
 the cut will logically not affect the 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.380
 general classification there we have to 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.170
 counter that has happened has also passed 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:01:00.230
 froome without major problems out there 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:01:02.470
 valverde also if only for a 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.470
 Fight 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.280
 desde 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.970
 and here at the time they will put it because 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.130
 red valverde 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.570
 If they were thrown red, our 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.890
 mori and more back there are a couple of 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.110
 more riders inside you are greipel 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.640
 effectively that was the entire row of 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.090
 your peers to this accountant already 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.329
 closing this little group 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.340
 a kilometer that way I was going to go 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.770
 rolling for what they want as it has come out 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.970
 fortunately well fired 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.890
 will realize that it has been placed well 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.930
 this time he says that some madman does not 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.850
 section also the long corridor 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.040
 Julian Simon put in head 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.390
 and now there's going to be another turn and it's 300 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.070
 meters there are already exploding for 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.540
 catch air that is the third the fourth 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.540
 is and a little bit more back 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.990
 very well placed 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.730
 calling cavendish let's see 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.410
 at the time of progressing, do them the 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.120
 postman that this can advance by the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.709
 left part remove the one that is 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.370
 opening with a lot of force remove the 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.370
 that we are going to win 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.230
 I had overcome 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.269
 the others have not had any action and 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.260
 see how he has let start 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.599
 very fast 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:00.569
 this will make the best we will see in the 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.689
 repetition of the cowboys will take us out of 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.689
 Doubts 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.530
 yes 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.030
 here are all the mind by perception 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.060
 they were playing 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.250
 I am smiling even this wine 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.250
 development of this this forgetting 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.110
 if we see 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.350
 of the arrival 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.010
 this is the color that celebrates 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.450
 effectively the victory of his 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.310
 partner of marcel kittel 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.739
 it was amazing for them of 3 wins 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.690
 of stage and leadership undoubtedly a 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.959
 result before rich security until 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.959
 would be 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:58.030
 for the fall but I'm not too sure 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.620
 what's up it was very down some 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.620
 come until they do not move away 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.970
 in the final on land 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.390
 the metal 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:29.660
 with which he had appeared third 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.030
 stage victory in the round can 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.120
 believe because he's beating here he has 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.620
 eliminated everyone to practically have 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.620
 entered a little bit ago and there it is 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:53.480
 he said it was hard to reach up 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:55.960
 the runners that were on top of him 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.960
 why 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.960
 the fall 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.630
 is carrying
