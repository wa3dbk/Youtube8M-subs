 kobe ​​access not only to information technologies but professionals 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:13.869
 Experts 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:16.869
 technical support to the process and study 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:24.660
 rivero added 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.599
 Economic sectors 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.069
 I explain 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.059
 learn to work 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:32.679
 gifted / 4 hours ago 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:36.849

 and eight communities have been served 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:55.759
 in the laboratory has many computers 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:57.129
 a solar system 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.069
 electric denial 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.869
 a prediction system and connection to the internet via satellite 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:12.329
 the polytechnic high school of the littoral through the circuit will continue 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.889
 with its objective of educating for the society of
