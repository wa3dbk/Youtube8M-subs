flecks<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:43.579> now<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.610> need<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.969> chop<00:00:45.210> up<00:00:45.390> all

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
flecks in it now you need to chop up all

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.389

your bits of polymer clay into pieces
like<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:48.020> you'll<00:00:49.020> need<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.289> use

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
like this you'll need to use

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.069 
like this you'll need to use
unconditioned<00:00:50.430> clay<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.539> don't<00:00:51.809> want

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
unconditioned clay because we don't want

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.369 
unconditioned clay because we don't want
the<00:00:52.170> clay<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.649> soft<00:00:53.539> if<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.780> find<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
the clay to be soft if you find that the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.170 
the clay to be soft if you find that the
clay<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.620> too<00:00:55.920> soft<00:00:56.160> anyway<00:00:56.610> because<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
clay is too soft anyway because of the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.260 
clay is too soft anyway because of the
temperature<00:00:58.340> just<00:00:59.340> pop<00:00:59.640> them<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> freezer

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
temperature just pop them in the freezer

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.170 
temperature just pop them in the freezer
or<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.780> fridge<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.469> few<00:01:01.739> minutes<00:01:02.280> until<00:01:02.489> they

or a fridge for a few minutes until they

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.929 
or a fridge for a few minutes until they
get<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.390> little<00:01:03.629> bit<00:01:03.750> hard<00:01:04.610> you'll<00:01:05.610> then<00:01:05.790> want

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
get a little bit hard you'll then want

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.850 
get a little bit hard you'll then want
to<00:01:06.030> mix<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.570> these<00:01:06.750> little<00:01:06.930> piles<00:01:07.200> together

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
to mix all these little piles together

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.760 
to mix all these little piles together
but<00:01:08.700> remember<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.180> gentle<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:10.140> don't<00:01:10.380> want<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
but remember be gentle we don't want the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.760 
but remember be gentle we don't want the
pieces<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.280> mix<00:01:11.490> together<00:01:11.700> or<00:01:12.119> blend<00:01:12.560> you<00:01:13.560> need

to<00:01:13.950> keep<00:01:14.450> individual<00:01:15.450> pieces<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.869> clay<00:01:16.259> sharp

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
to keep individual pieces of clay sharp

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.960 
to keep individual pieces of clay sharp
and<00:01:17.549> angular<00:01:19.100> make<00:01:20.100> sure<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.520> mix<00:01:20.790> it

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
and angular make sure you mix it

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.560

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
fine pieces remember we are going to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.210 
fine pieces remember we are going to
chop<00:01:56.729> again<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.780> don't<00:01:58.110> go<00:01:58.350> too<00:01:58.410> fine<00:01:58.950> at<00:01:59.130> this

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
chop again so don't go too fine at this

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.719 
chop again so don't go too fine at this
stage<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:04.710> we'll<00:02:04.830> just<00:02:05.010> speed<00:02:05.160> it<00:02:05.220> up<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.550> little

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
stage so we'll just speed it up a little

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.540 
stage so we'll just speed it up a little
bit<00:02:05.940> just<00:02:06.440> remember<00:02:07.440> keep<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.860> all<00:02:08.009> mixed<00:02:08.369> in

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
bit just remember keep it all mixed in

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:16.130 
bit just remember keep it all mixed in
as<00:02:08.790> you're<00:02:09.119> chopping<00:02:14.630> for<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.690> next<00:02:15.900> part

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
as you're chopping for the next part

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.870 
as you're chopping for the next part
we're<00:02:16.410> going<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.590> add<00:02:16.740> some<00:02:17.010> gold<00:02:17.310> leaf<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.790> the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
we're going to add some gold leaf to the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.290 
we're going to add some gold leaf to the
project<00:02:21.680> this<00:02:22.680> here<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.070> called<00:02:23.340> leaf<00:02:23.580> now

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
project this here is called leaf now

project this here is called leaf now
it's<00:02:24.510> not<00:02:24.720> real<00:02:24.900> gold<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:27.060> looks<00:02:27.330> exactly<00:02:27.540> the

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
it's not real gold it looks exactly the

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.920 
it's not real gold it looks exactly the
same<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.790> now<00:02:29.910> we<00:02:30.090> cover<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.480> block<00:02:30.780> of

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
same so now we cover a block of

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.800 
same so now we cover a block of
translucent<00:02:31.650> clay<00:02:32.100> in<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:33.120> gold<00:02:33.300> leaf<00:02:33.540> and

translucent clay in the gold leaf and

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.760 
translucent clay in the gold leaf and
chop<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.739> up<00:02:34.830> this<00:02:35.760> gives<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.300> effect

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
chop it up this gives you the effect

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.130 
chop it up this gives you the effect

this give it a mix in and push it all
together<00:03:10.440> into<00:03:10.950> little<00:03:11.370> cubes<00:03:11.610> take<00:03:12.390> care<00:03:12.660> of

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
together into little cubes take care of

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.610 
together into little cubes take care of
course<00:03:13.110> not<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.860> blend<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.220> colors<00:03:14.519> together

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
now you can make all sorts of imitation

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.979 
now you can make all sorts of imitation
lapis<00:03:18.840> lazuli<00:03:19.250> pendants<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.370> beads<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.989> hope
