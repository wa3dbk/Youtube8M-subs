 but let's start talking about what colors do what they transmit 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.310
 colors and if you allow me I do not think we're going to talk about this procedure in

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.140
 blue green and violet ode those denote this this cold this sobriety 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.190
 we try to talk about the characteristics of each of the 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.570

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.009
 it's more not for negotiations if you want to do a negotiation on 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.390
 red is not the best is passionate 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.950
 but for negotiations 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.130
 accelerates then it is not recommended energy data and somewhat elevated allen fernandez 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.050

 all colors have these two parts 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.240
 in the positive part and the negative part I feel the restaurants will be fine 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.370
 then they accuse the orange so that it accelerates you and what caused that they have 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.259

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.649
 to see clearly we are a little bit clear and if the French for you do very 

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:17.359
 bright and that has to do with the nuance of color then we go with the 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:17.869
 blue 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:22.019

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.959
 for friends when the neighbors in the area are more relaxed and good to do 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.909
 that the characteristic 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.519
 very visible in your personality within the other new areas because if you 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.839

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.830
 that authoritative color that color 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.679
 of the status is the color 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:01.929

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.689
 those in white is also a color 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:33.340
 that normally what you do is that if you hit the target then we come to the 

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:37.830
 pale colors to the pale ones to the angels with the rose was what I asked 

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:41.490
 ask what happened to the rodeo i rothstein tracy that happens with the red and 

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:45.369
 the white gives us the rose and when entering the pink we are to the romanticism in 

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:49.319

 blue sky blue that means passion for abstract romantics behind 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.629
 the protests there are people of the third age before venezuela the seminar that has 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:15.169

 transport of animals arrived in Spain will win to pull patterns of 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.240
 omen the chair that you have to stop this is that through the colors 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.690
 we can send a message 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.220
 and you have to use them correctly to communicate what we want however 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.810
 so much and so well know we feed the project with more 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.120
 color and we lack the color 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.860
 that projects more power 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.849
 and denotes many things have 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:48.389
 the absence of color this is the color par excellence of greater power of greater 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:54.129
 hierarchy and even agenda sobriety when there is wind according to satellite 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:59.619
 the black because for that hierarchy for that sobriety that's why we say we're in 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:04.560
 peace tranquility then is the absence of all the colors that denotes this ap 

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:07.960
 but he left a question the black was formerly 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.050
 it symbolized something now as it has changed a lot no designers editions 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.590
