 and read and write early 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.430
 solve complex formulas use 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.240
 cultured words and do not have fun with 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.880
 common games they are children 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.010
 gifted whose amazing intelligence 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.380
 it is not always synonymous with happiness and 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.149
 success because they suffer twice as much bullying 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.780
 that children of IQ 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.850
 average and this is the case of nuria a 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.040
 15 year old girl who until recently 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.079
 he knew that he was over gifted and here in his 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.090
 school mates upset from 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.200
 that was very small considering it 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.200
 rare and different 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.270
 entering primary school was when I started 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.280
 have more serious bullying problems 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.150
 of asia from my companions likewise 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.010
 because it was with the mind they know to say that 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.790
 directly that I was weird is crazy 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.320
 it was ugly I was fat the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.240
 continued abuse of other children 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.550
 they made nuria's self-esteem 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.660
 fell from the ground to the degree of starting 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:18.119
 causing damage to the body was so 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.030
 frustrated so desperate that no 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.970
 I found an exit I felt fat and 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.380
 I could not be thin and I felt bad about 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.050
 try by the means that was 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.110
 using to make thin and not 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.899
 achieve it that then total frustration 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.110
 that I hurt myself with knives and with 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.550
 crystals according to the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.500
 broader research has 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.149
 done to date on the profile 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.700
 of the child over gifted intellectual 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.610
 mexican 82 percent of them 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.680
 suffer bullying compared to 43% 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.400
 of the rest of the children 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.980
 in this case what we have found is 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.170
 that suffers a lot in this case bullying and 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.390
 many problems at school level but 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.430
 mainly from both tests 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.650
 different that exist of tastes that is 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.000
 the case of society tends to attack 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.380
 say the elements we want to do 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.149
 something that has to have resistance 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.709
 in front of what is different also with 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.140
 two children 50 in something that is not equal to 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.700
 what some a 5 year old 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.380
 like to talk about cartoons comes another 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.780
 carla left of good mathematics and 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.980
 there to see this case a church of 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.050
 tastes that will generate rejection to your 17 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.040
 years andrew is the youngest psychologist 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.120
 of the world 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.610
 A year ago he graduated from university 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.090
 and is about to graduate also from 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.090
 medicine 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.200
 in 2010 he founded together with his parents the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.909
 talent center a space 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.609
 designed to detect the greatest number 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.500
 possible of gifted children in agreement 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:50.129
 with a series of characteristics that he 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.170
 he has studied and defined the 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.239
 major criticisms these children true 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.609
 they are first present hyperactivity 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.709
 and also that tend to be distracted 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.450
 easily this hyperactivity is 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.670
 distraction really occur when the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.349
 boy is bored but that many times 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.969
 and said confuse what sounds with 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.950
 attention deficit disorder and 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.450
 hyperactivity but the difference between 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.879
 the child with tdh and a level with 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.040
 overcapacity is that when is this 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.510
 case gifted the child but if it 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.549
 distracts and gets bored but if you 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.349
 presented something of interest that is that 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.150
 this disappears those children are concentrated 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.459
 and they do not present any problem in that 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.840
 case of hyperactivity or lack of 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.989
 attention as you have learned something that 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.340
 interest 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.620
 the investigations that Andrew has 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.569
 carried out determine that in Mexico there 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.969
 more than 3 million people with high 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.049
 capacities one million of which are 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.049
 children and adolescents 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.350
 93% of them were diagnosed 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.410
 wrongly with deficit disorder 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.640
 attention and 77% suffer disorders 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.030
 emotional 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.650
 where more than 98% of 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.069
 register the schools and have 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.069
 problems 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:05.060
 here then everything has appeared in 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.110
 mexico makes us think maybe 2000 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.310
 about all of us who have 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.380
 problems and the problem is in another 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.360
 side and the problem here first is 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.540
 being that we have been caught 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.549
 time detecting the gifted to 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.900
 time and provide them a space 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.000
 suitable for them to develop their 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.130
 personal projects and relate to 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.990
 others similar to them is the most 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.910
 important for guys like nuria 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.070
 who says that after entering the 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.880
 talent service center has become 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.880
 to feel happy 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.660
 and I feel like I can be myself again 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.270
 I feel like I can go back to 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.790
 wrong 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.840
