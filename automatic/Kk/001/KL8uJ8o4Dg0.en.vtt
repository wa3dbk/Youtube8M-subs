00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.140 
together so you can see you created a
nice<00:02:39.440> sauce<00:02:39.770> from<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.580> butter<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.030> was

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
nice sauce from the butter that was

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.300 
nice sauce from the butter that was
already<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:41.570> there<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.620> wine<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:42.890> the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
chicken stock and that's really the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.590 
chicken stock and that's really the
basis<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.380> lot<00:02:45.470> of<00:02:45.530> good<00:02:45.740> sauces<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:47.510> we're

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
basis of a lot of good sauces so we're

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.970 
basis of a lot of good sauces so we're

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.830 
will be the finishing touch so that I'm
not<00:03:19.580> going<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:19.910> be<00:03:19.970> able<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.480> tonight

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
would be nice for a touch of green I

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.729 
would be nice for a touch of green I
mean<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:23.030> can<00:03:23.180> add<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.390> touch<00:03:23.870> of<00:03:23.930> oregano<00:03:24.500> but

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
mean it can add a touch of oregano but

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.199 
mean it can add a touch of oregano but
that's<00:03:25.250> really<00:03:25.489> gonna<00:03:25.580> be<00:03:25.700> more<00:03:25.850> for<00:03:26.000> flavor

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
that's really gonna be more for flavor

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.070 
that's really gonna be more for flavor
it's<00:03:26.420> not<00:03:26.540> going<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:26.720> be<00:03:26.780> more<00:03:26.930> for

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
it's not going to be more for

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.110 
it's not going to be more for
presentation<00:03:27.800> although<00:03:28.370> parsley<00:03:28.760> does<00:03:28.910> have

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
presentation although parsley does have

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.880 
presentation although parsley does have
a<00:03:29.150> nice<00:03:29.390> flavor<00:03:29.750> doesn't<00:03:30.050> part<00:03:30.380> a<00:03:30.470> really<00:03:30.709> nice

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
a nice flavor doesn't part a really nice

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.890 
a nice flavor doesn't part a really nice
flavor<00:03:31.130> so<00:03:31.970> since<00:03:32.209> I<00:03:32.269> already<00:03:32.390> salt<00:03:32.750> and

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
flavor so since I already salt and

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.350 
flavor so since I already salt and
peppered<00:03:33.200> um<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:34.459> shrimp<00:03:34.790> I'm<00:03:34.940> not<00:03:35.150> going<00:03:35.300> to

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
peppered um the shrimp I'm not going to

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.670 
peppered um the shrimp I'm not going to
go<00:03:35.450> crazy<00:03:35.600> with<00:03:35.959> it<00:03:35.989> but<00:03:36.170> what<00:03:36.290> I<00:03:36.320> am<00:03:36.470> going<00:03:36.620> to

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
go crazy with it but what I am going to

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.009 
go crazy with it but what I am going to
do<00:03:36.830> right<00:03:36.860> now<00:03:37.070> is<00:03:37.519> if<00:03:37.760> I<00:03:37.940> can<00:03:38.239> open<00:03:38.540> with<00:03:38.810> one

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
do right now is if I can open with one

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.960 
do right now is if I can open with one
hand<00:03:39.050> and<00:03:39.560> a<00:03:39.590> little<00:03:40.100> crushed<00:03:40.459> red<00:03:40.730> pepper

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
hand and a little crushed red pepper

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.539 
hand and a little crushed red pepper
just<00:03:41.720> for<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:41.989> little<00:03:42.080> heat<00:03:42.709> but<00:03:42.769> not<00:03:43.160> too<00:03:43.370> much

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
just for a little heat but not too much

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.250 
just for a little heat but not too much
just<00:03:44.140> a<00:03:45.140> little<00:03:45.170> bit<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:46.480> then<00:03:47.480> maybe<00:03:47.840> add

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
just a little bit and then maybe add

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.830 
just a little bit and then maybe add
just<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.680> touch<00:03:48.950> more<00:03:49.010> salt<00:03:49.340> but<00:03:50.030> again<00:03:50.660> that's

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
just a touch more salt but again that's

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.230 
just a touch more salt but again that's
to<00:03:51.290> taste

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.330 

okay<00:03:55.260> it's<00:03:55.440> seeming<00:03:55.740> to<00:03:55.800> turn<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:56.070> flame

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
okay it's seeming to turn that flame

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.620 
okay it's seeming to turn that flame
down<00:03:56.550> because<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.000> worst<00:03:57.210> thing<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.510> can

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
down because the worst thing you can

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.740 
down because the worst thing you can
have<00:03:57.690> is<00:03:58.020> overcooked<00:03:58.500> shrimp<00:03:59.510> turn<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.630> down

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
have is overcooked shrimp turn it down

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.080 
have is overcooked shrimp turn it down
just<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:01.080> little<00:04:01.110> bit<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:01.830> then<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.850> very<00:04:03.030> last

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
just a little bit and then the very last

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.210 
just a little bit and then the very last
thing<00:04:03.510> I'm<00:04:03.600> going<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:03.960> do<00:04:04.080> is<00:04:04.320> add<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.980> little

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
thing I'm going to do is add a little

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.820 
thing I'm going to do is add a little
bit<00:04:05.520> of<00:04:05.850> minced<00:04:06.060> garlic<00:04:06.260> so<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.320> could<00:04:07.620> see

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
bit of minced garlic so you could see

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.010 
bit of minced garlic so you could see
how<00:04:07.980> quickly<00:04:08.370> this<00:04:08.880> went<00:04:09.210> I<00:04:09.390> mean<00:04:09.540> this<00:04:09.660> is<00:04:09.810> all

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
how quickly this went I mean this is all

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.190 
how quickly this went I mean this is all
of<00:04:10.370> four<00:04:11.370> minutes<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:11.970> really<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.810> hardest

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
of four minutes and really the hardest

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.000 
of four minutes and really the hardest
part<00:04:13.500> in<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.740> dish<00:04:13.920> like<00:04:14.100> this<00:04:14.160> is<00:04:14.580> just

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
part in the dish like this is just

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
part in the dish like this is just
defrosting<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.040> shrimp<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.610> making<00:04:17.940> the

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
defrosting the shrimp and making the

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.620 
defrosting the shrimp and making the
rice<00:04:19.130> so<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.310> is<00:04:20.460> it<00:04:20.640> pretty<00:04:20.910> much<00:04:21.090> done<00:04:21.420> I'm

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
rice so that is it pretty much done I'm

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.030 
rice so that is it pretty much done I'm
just<00:04:21.750> going<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:21.900> let<00:04:22.050> the<00:04:22.200> alcohol<00:04:22.350> burn<00:04:22.830> off

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
just going to let the alcohol burn off

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.890 
just going to let the alcohol burn off
which<00:04:23.340> wasn't<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:23.910> lot<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.090> begin<00:04:24.330> with<00:04:24.630> and

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
which wasn't a lot to begin with and

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.260 
which wasn't a lot to begin with and
then<00:04:25.530> I'm<00:04:25.710> going<00:04:26.040> to<00:04:26.070> add<00:04:26.370> it<00:04:26.670> with<00:04:26.880> yellow

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
then I'm going to add it with yellow

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.390 
then I'm going to add it with yellow
rice<00:04:27.540> so<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.320> yellow<00:04:28.440> rice<00:04:28.710> was<00:04:29.040> by<00:04:29.340> the

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
rice so the yellow rice was by the

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.880 
rice so the yellow rice was by the
package<00:04:29.940> just<00:04:30.840> by<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.080> package<00:04:31.470> instructions

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
package just by the package instructions

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.830 
package just by the package instructions
it<00:04:32.370> was<00:04:32.490> one<00:04:32.670> in<00:04:32.820> two<00:04:32.940> third<00:04:33.120> cups<00:04:33.150> of<00:04:33.600> water

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
it was one in two third cups of water

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.440 
it was one in two third cups of water
and<00:04:34.050> a<00:04:34.500> tablespoon<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:35.130> olive<00:04:35.310> oil<00:04:35.610> add<00:04:35.940> the

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
and a tablespoon of olive oil add the

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.320 
and a tablespoon of olive oil add the
rice<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:37.050> just<00:04:37.590> turn<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.890> down<00:04:37.920> to<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.220> low<00:04:38.550> boil

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
rice and just turn it down to a low boil

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.020 
rice and just turn it down to a low boil
and<00:04:39.720> then<00:04:39.870> just<00:04:40.170> let<00:04:40.290> that<00:04:40.440> cook<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:40.980> then<00:04:41.730> you

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
and then just let that cook and then you

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.280 
and then just let that cook and then you
pretty<00:04:42.210> much<00:04:42.360> saw<00:04:42.570> everything<00:04:42.930> that<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.080> did

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
pretty much saw everything that I did

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.600 
pretty much saw everything that I did
here<00:04:43.470> with<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.710> exception<00:04:43.920> of<00:04:44.130> prepping<00:04:44.490> the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
here with the exception of prepping the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.520 
here with the exception of prepping the
shrimp<00:04:44.880> so<00:04:45.150> it<00:04:45.270> was<00:04:45.420> really<00:04:45.690> easy<00:04:45.840> just<00:04:46.200> sauté

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
shrimp so it was really easy just sauté

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.860 
shrimp so it was really easy just sauté
the<00:04:46.680> shrimp<00:04:46.710> in<00:04:47.100> salt<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:48.060> pepper<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.540> olive

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
the shrimp in salt and pepper and olive

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.460 
the shrimp in salt and pepper and olive
oil<00:04:49.230> and<00:04:49.620> butter<00:04:49.830> and<00:04:50.870> just<00:04:51.870> adding<00:04:52.260> some

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
oil and butter and just adding some

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.430 
oil and butter and just adding some
minced<00:04:52.770> onion<00:04:53.160> adding<00:04:53.730> some<00:04:54.060> wine<00:04:55.050> which<00:04:55.320> is

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
minced onion adding some wine which is

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.230 
minced onion adding some wine which is
always<00:04:55.590> optional<00:04:55.860> adding<00:04:56.730> a<00:04:56.790> little<00:04:57.000> chicken

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
always optional adding a little chicken

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.730 
always optional adding a little chicken
stock<00:04:57.450> which<00:04:57.780> I<00:04:57.870> would<00:04:58.050> suggest<00:04:58.200> because

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
stock which I would suggest because

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.780 
stock which I would suggest because
that's<00:04:58.890> going<00:04:58.980> to<00:04:59.040> be<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.310> basis<00:04:59.610> of<00:04:59.640> your

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
that's going to be the basis of your

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.840 
that's going to be the basis of your
sauce<00:05:00.120> or<00:05:00.420> at<00:05:00.540> least<00:05:00.720> water<00:05:01.190> a<00:05:02.190> little<00:05:02.610> more

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
sauce or at least water a little more

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.610 
sauce or at least water a little more
salt<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.180> pepper<00:05:03.300> if<00:05:03.630> you<00:05:03.660> want<00:05:03.750> I<00:05:04.140> added<00:05:04.440> some

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
salt and pepper if you want I added some

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.130 
salt and pepper if you want I added some
red<00:05:04.800> pepper<00:05:05.040> and<00:05:05.460> that's<00:05:06.420> pretty<00:05:06.690> much<00:05:06.810> it<00:05:06.960> so

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
red pepper and that's pretty much it so

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.050 
red pepper and that's pretty much it so
I'm<00:05:07.380> going<00:05:07.500> to<00:05:07.590> turn<00:05:07.740> this<00:05:07.890> off<00:05:08.130> this<00:05:08.850> is

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
I'm going to turn this off this is

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.030 
I'm going to turn this off this is
pretty<00:05:09.270> much<00:05:09.390> done<00:05:09.900> I<00:05:10.230> don't<00:05:10.710> want<00:05:10.890> it<00:05:10.950> to
