00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.339
 Welcome to a new video of mine 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.000
 I have the review of the huawei today 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.889
 e5 330 because it's hot spot and what the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.240
 Everything works and the whole thing works 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.469
 we will look at in the video 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.809
 but first let's see how the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.240
 I pronounce that way extremely easily 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.859
 I already have a battery in it and that feels 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.199
 at the cheek paperbacks though 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.660
 it is still much smaller behind it 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.550
 we have the micro-usb connection 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.369
 is unfortunately supplied by huawei in 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.660
 the box just a normal very short 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.210
 Micro USB cable 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.969
 but you can do it with each zb 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.140
 Samsung charger so charge that 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.290
 works without problems 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.390
 but that just has to any awareness 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.489
 we already in the device into it 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.170
 The whole thing can be opened easily 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.950
 below right is in fact a 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:54.809
 small flap and then we can there 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.090
 just look in now 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.800
 the first time the battery but also 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.039
 I'll come back later 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.809
 how do I think about it here inside 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.570
 we have now apart from one 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.070
 few numbers because a sim card that one 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.470
 Normal sympathized with that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.119
 adaptern a bit bent but 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.820
 We can now just the battery again 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.590
 Give in and then we see here 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.780
 Above a small key that is the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.580
 reset button to get everything back to the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.049
 factory settings 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.240
 I needed that a few times because 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.470
 it does not always have everything quite so well 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.450
 works especially if you are on 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.579
 not insanely good at the beginning 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.770
 so if i have it now i have it 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.020
 we have a sim card in here 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.119
 the side of a button that one sees yes 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.350
 that is severed and white I stroked 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.110
 just pressed a few seconds 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.970
 on it we say five seconds it people 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.159
 there as well as a christmas tree 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.899
 that means the device turns on 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.520
 a little bit here, the symbol of the left 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.899
 connection stronger but switches in the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.680
 That's why everything is green 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.479
 then we have just the wlan strength 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.399
 and the wieland status so we see 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.570
 now he is not connected yet 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.630
 that takes a few things now 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.040
 here we have the battery indicator and now 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.420
 just raised the hotspot and the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.979
 Connection also built up we go 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.329
 now for example to the ipad or too 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.890
 it is another device at all 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.179
 no problem that also applies to android 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.400
 of course it works with 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.090
 we just go to the wlan 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.010
 attitudes and just wait for us 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.090
 our huawei e5 530 is displayed 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.459
 that does not always work completely 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.200
 perfect but there is already under 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.310
 By the way, standard password is on the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.290
 back I have to tell you this now 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.480
 not necessarily show me how you see 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.859
 the whole thing that takes the time to connect 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.489
 one or the other customer and that's it 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.099
 made 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.900
 so if we are on now we are 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.579
 only this green dot would be flashing 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.930
 so that have any information 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.730
 we want to press shortly afterwards 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.120
 then we see we have full signal 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.799
 strength we have a hotspot enabled 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.780
 is and we have a full load 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.430
 Battery but this green battery banks 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.790
 Did not say that much because of that 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.040
 there is the so-called huawei hailing 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.480
 app that you can do is both 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.239
 in the app store as well as in googleplex 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.659
 It will be documents and will be the app 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.959
 Of course, the app recognizes immediately 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:10.919
 Immediately that we are here with the Huawei E5 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.049
 30 are connected and shows us once 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:15.150
 a few important information and it 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.150
 shows it otherwise deserves the battery to 100 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.180
 percent loaded one page and 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.199
 It also shows us how much internet 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.760
 we consumed 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.199
 that is very practical 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.370
 brain no longer consumed internet 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.169
 I just put it on again 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.729
 directory that nothing planned so 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.590
 We could spend on the internet 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:34.199
 a nice graphic we see how much 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.939
 but would have consumed in the app itself 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:39.359
 we can do a little more 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.949
 Of course, we can join once 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.419
 Of course, that's what our device itself does 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.949
 password change can do it 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:47.609
 we can update it here new 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:49.109
 States if crashes and otherwise can 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.739
 We have our own account of course 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.269
 manage 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.340
 Another nice thing is if it is 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.560
 several clients are connected here 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.709
 we can push it up here and 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.680
 would see five or six now 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:04.349
 See different people but that was 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.290
 it's a forge to that high far us 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.299
 Why are you the device itself 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.560
 The device is really extremely lightweight 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:16.530
 We weigh approximately as much as we pack 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.060
 towels as I have already said and it 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.219
 costs only 40 euros 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.959
 what he extremely cheap for such a great 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:23.270
 device is 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.550
 we do not have a 4g function here 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.780
 only 3g but what do I think on vacation 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.840
 if you just sim card 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.139
 just enter here should be extremely good 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.449
 is because I have my 40 euro for it you 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.520
 a really good hotspot and the 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.870
 Roaming charges are the most exorbitant 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.990
 high if you just now for example 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.930
 an ipad abroad in the internet gest 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.970
 But the battery is such a point where I 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.960
 Mixed feelings have a 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.960
 simple reason 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.970
 at an average usage and 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.000
 this battery does not last longer 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.220
 as a day 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.870
 you have to charge in every day that can 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.880
 Of course, be a bit difficult if you can 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.099
 now some days no outlet for 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.229
 But it has that way it is 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.550
 the device costs as I said something 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.199
 more over 40 euros maybe has become 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.460
 the price again a bit later 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.490
 Looks a bit again 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.349
 changed and what is my conclusion to that 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.990
 you should buy this and 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.949
 should buy themselves 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.539
 I think that it is from the 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.580
 price performance ratio extreme 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:26.150
 pay as I said before but 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.800
 for who needs that if for example now vacation 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.570
 Going somewhere for two weeks 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.400
 france or somewhere in a hotel 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.090
 where you only defend then it will be 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.550
 do not need 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.530
 but if he does, I do not know again and again 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.039
 hotels are changing or there are not always 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.330
 a company or even camps or 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.909
 just be with friends abroad 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.320
 then something very practical is there 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:47.030
 can you be really good for that? 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.789
 simply a cheap sim card locally 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.789
 buy and have a top device and always 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:54.229
 internet and if you like the video 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:57.349
