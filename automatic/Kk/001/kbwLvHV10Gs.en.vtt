hello<00:00:15.860> I'm<00:00:16.610> professor<00:00:16.820> Matthew<00:00:17.539> Schmidt<00:00:17.869> and

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
hello I'm professor Matthew Schmidt and

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.429 
hello I'm professor Matthew Schmidt and
welcome<00:00:18.740> to<00:00:19.099> genetics<00:00:19.720> we're<00:00:20.720> continuing<00:00:21.349> our

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
welcome to genetics we're continuing our

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.580 
welcome to genetics we're continuing our
series<00:00:21.500> of<00:00:22.099> revisiting<00:00:22.849> Mendel<00:00:23.360> again<00:00:24.289> in<00:00:24.470> the

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
series of revisiting Mendel again in the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.780 
series of revisiting Mendel again in the
sense<00:00:24.860> of<00:00:25.150> wondering<00:00:26.150> when<00:00:26.329> we<00:00:26.480> see<00:00:26.770> aberrant

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
sense of wondering when we see aberrant

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.080 
sense of wondering when we see aberrant
results<00:00:28.790> or<00:00:28.910> at<00:00:28.939> least<00:00:29.180> those<00:00:29.450> that<00:00:29.660> seem<00:00:29.930> odd

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
results or at least those that seem odd

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.670 
results or at least those that seem odd
does<00:00:32.090> this<00:00:32.239> mean<00:00:32.509> that<00:00:32.540> there's<00:00:33.320> a<00:00:33.410> problem

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
does this mean that there's a problem

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.830 
does this mean that there's a problem
with<00:00:33.800> Mendel's<00:00:34.309> laws<00:00:34.520> or<00:00:35.120> how<00:00:35.390> are<00:00:35.570> we<00:00:35.690> going

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
with Mendel's laws or how are we going

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.720 
with Mendel's laws or how are we going
to<00:00:35.960> interpret<00:00:36.500> this<00:00:36.739> so<00:00:37.340> that<00:00:37.520> they<00:00:37.670> are

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
to interpret this so that they are

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.840 
to interpret this so that they are
consonant<00:00:38.360> with<00:00:38.540> his<00:00:38.719> laws<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.379> explain<00:00:40.309> the

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
consonant with his laws and explain the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.169 
consonant with his laws and explain the
apparent<00:00:41.180> discrepancy<00:00:41.860> so<00:00:42.860> this<00:00:43.670> session<00:00:43.910> is

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:44.179 
apparent discrepancy so this session is

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:45.939 
apparent discrepancy so this session is
a<00:00:44.210> little<00:00:44.449> shorter<00:00:44.809> than<00:00:44.839> some<00:00:44.989> others<00:00:45.469> it

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
a little shorter than some others it

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:47.739 
a little shorter than some others it
really<00:00:46.309> addresses<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.030> phenomenon<00:00:47.570> of

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:47.749 
really addresses the phenomenon of

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:50.319 
really addresses the phenomenon of
lethal<00:00:48.140> alleles<00:00:48.589> and<00:00:48.949> I<00:00:49.550> wanted<00:00:49.789> to<00:00:49.909> put<00:00:50.149> the

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
lethal alleles and I wanted to put the

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.700 
lethal alleles and I wanted to put the
idea<00:00:50.480> of<00:00:50.780> pleiotropy

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
idea of pleiotropy

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.160 
idea of pleiotropy
in<00:00:51.920> there<00:00:52.550> as<00:00:52.670> well<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:53.239> let's<00:00:53.719> see<00:00:53.899> what<00:00:54.019> this

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
in there as well so let's see what this

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.840 
in there as well so let's see what this
is<00:00:54.230> all<00:00:54.499> about<00:00:55.179> it<00:00:56.179> turns<00:00:56.539> out<00:00:59.230> that<00:01:00.850> we're

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
is all about it turns out that we're

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.250 
is all about it turns out that we're
gonna<00:01:01.940> see<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.390> definition<00:01:02.899> of<00:01:02.960> a<00:01:03.050> leaf

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
gonna see the definition of a leaf

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.530 
gonna see the definition of a leaf
lethal<00:01:04.010> allele<00:01:04.309> but<00:01:04.519> I<00:01:04.610> want<00:01:04.820> to<00:01:04.909> explain<00:01:05.300> to

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
lethal allele but I want to explain to

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.250 
lethal allele but I want to explain to
you<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.830> experiment<00:01:06.830> that<00:01:07.930> led<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:08.990> the

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
you the experiment that led to the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.910 
you the experiment that led to the
discovery<00:01:09.530> of<00:01:09.860> this<00:01:10.210> in<00:01:11.210> mice<00:01:11.630> there<00:01:12.440> are<00:01:12.590> two

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
discovery of this in mice there are two

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.890 
discovery of this in mice there are two
alleles<00:01:13.280> that<00:01:13.670> exist<00:01:14.030> that<00:01:14.180> one<00:01:14.450> of<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.720> low

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
alleles that exist that one of the low

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.590 
alleles that exist that one of the low
side<00:01:15.170> that<00:01:15.409> controls<00:01:15.710> coat<00:01:16.159> color<00:01:16.399> now<00:01:16.700> coat

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
side that controls coat color now coat

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.230 
side that controls coat color now coat
color<00:01:17.869> and<00:01:18.140> mice<00:01:18.320> is<00:01:18.799> actually<00:01:19.310> a<00:01:19.579> little<00:01:20.030> more

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
color and mice is actually a little more

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.630 
color and mice is actually a little more
complicated<00:01:20.600> than<00:01:20.960> we<00:01:21.200> fled<00:01:21.469> on<00:01:21.649> but<00:01:22.280> this<00:01:22.430> is

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
complicated than we fled on but this is

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.340 
complicated than we fled on but this is
the<00:01:22.880> same<00:01:23.119> locus<00:01:23.570> that<00:01:23.600> we<00:01:23.840> were<00:01:23.960> talking

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
the same locus that we were talking

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.279 
the same locus that we were talking
about<00:01:24.439> in<00:01:25.159> a<00:01:25.280> previous<00:01:25.759> video<00:01:25.969> that<00:01:26.180> had<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.140> do

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
about in a previous video that had to do

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.830 
about in a previous video that had to do
with<00:01:27.320> being<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:28.130> GU<00:01:28.340> D<00:01:28.490> versus<00:01:29.060> black<00:01:29.659> etc<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:31.840> an

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
with being a GU D versus black etc so an

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.109 
with being a GU D versus black etc so an
allele<00:01:33.320> was<00:01:33.500> discovered<00:01:34.159> that<00:01:34.579> was<00:01:34.729> actually

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
allele was discovered that was actually

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.170 
allele was discovered that was actually
dominant<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:36.110> agouti<00:01:36.469> and<00:01:36.860> they<00:01:37.670> called<00:01:37.969> it

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
dominant to agouti and they called it

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.469 
dominant to agouti and they called it
capital<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.320> capital<00:01:39.740> y<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.789> give<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.329> idea

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
capital a capital y to give the idea

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.599 
capital a capital y to give the idea
that<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:41.930> was<00:01:42.049> dominant<00:01:42.560> now

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
that it was dominant now

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.599 
that it was dominant now
it<00:01:43.700> caused<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.299> yellow<00:01:44.750> coat<00:01:45.469> color<00:01:45.829> at<00:01:46.310> least

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
it caused a yellow coat color at least

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:49.270 
it caused a yellow coat color at least
this<00:01:47.119> is<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.299> preliminary<00:01:47.719> story<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:48.890> it

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
this is the preliminary story and it

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.160 
this is the preliminary story and it
turned<00:01:49.520> out<00:01:49.729> that<00:01:50.000> if<00:01:50.180> they<00:01:50.329> took<00:01:50.570> two<00:01:50.869> yellow

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
turned out that if they took two yellow

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.370 
turned out that if they took two yellow
mice<00:01:51.490> every<00:01:52.490> time<00:01:52.759> no<00:01:53.390> matter<00:01:53.420> what<00:01:53.689> -<00:01:54.140> yellow

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
mice every time no matter what - yellow

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.849 
mice every time no matter what - yellow
mice<00:01:54.679> cross<00:01:55.640> them<00:01:55.939> together<00:01:56.140> what<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.170> see<00:01:57.560> is

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
mice cross them together what you see is

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.889 
mice cross them together what you see is
a<00:01:58.130> strange<00:01:58.759> two<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.929> one<00:02:00.109> ratio<00:02:00.350> of<00:02:01.009> yellow<00:02:01.969> to

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
a strange two to one ratio of yellow to

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.230 
a strange two to one ratio of yellow to
non<00:02:03.079> yellow<00:02:03.439> it<00:02:03.799> turns<00:02:03.829> out<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.880> non

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
non yellow it turns out that the non

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.529 
non yellow it turns out that the non
yellow<00:02:05.570> is<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.840> GU<00:02:06.140> T<00:02:06.289> colored<00:02:07.189> but<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.060> two<00:02:08.360> to

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
yellow is a GU T colored but a two to

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.600 
yellow is a GU T colored but a two to
one<00:02:08.570> ratio<00:02:08.720> guys<00:02:09.350> it's<00:02:09.770> certainly<00:02:10.130> not<00:02:10.310> three

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
one ratio guys it's certainly not three

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.210 
one ratio guys it's certainly not three
to<00:02:10.729> one<00:02:10.910> there's<00:02:11.570> no<00:02:11.810> way<00:02:11.960> to<00:02:12.020> make<00:02:12.320> them<00:02:13.070> which

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
to one there's no way to make them which

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.040 
to one there's no way to make them which
is<00:02:13.370> why<00:02:13.490> I<00:02:13.520> put<00:02:13.850> this<00:02:13.970> separate<00:02:14.420> there's<00:02:14.900> no

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
is why I put this separate there's no

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.840 
is why I put this separate there's no
way<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.260> think<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.770> two-to-one<00:02:16.100> ratio<00:02:16.370> in

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
way to think of a two-to-one ratio in

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.910 
way to think of a two-to-one ratio in
the<00:02:17.300> context<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:17.930> nine<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.380> three<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.680> three<00:02:18.890> to

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
the context of nine to three to three to

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.050 
the context of nine to three to three to
one<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.849> really<00:02:20.090> just<00:02:20.180> doesn't<00:02:20.540> work<00:02:22.060> no

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
one that it really just doesn't work no

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.660 
one that it really just doesn't work no
way<00:02:23.239> I<00:02:23.269> can<00:02:23.569> see<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.709> what<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.250> explanation

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
way I can see so what is the explanation

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.750 
way I can see so what is the explanation
well<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.330> turns<00:02:26.599> out<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.170> all<00:02:27.650> yellow<00:02:28.520> mice

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
well it turns out that all yellow mice

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.020 
well it turns out that all yellow mice
are<00:02:29.660> heterozygous<00:02:30.470> meaning<00:02:31.370> they<00:02:31.520> have<00:02:31.730> one

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
are heterozygous meaning they have one

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.690 
are heterozygous meaning they have one
capital<00:02:32.569> a<00:02:32.690> capital<00:02:32.989> y<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.709> one<00:02:34.459> regular

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
capital a capital y and one regular

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.830 
capital a capital y and one regular
capital<00:02:35.420> A

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
capital A

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.559 
capital A
you<00:02:36.380> would<00:02:36.560> think<00:02:36.830> under<00:02:37.099> normal

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
you would think under normal

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.350 
you would think under normal
circumstances<00:02:38.569> that<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:39.670> yellow<00:02:40.670> Mouse<00:02:41.000> could

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
circumstances that a yellow Mouse could

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.949 
circumstances that a yellow Mouse could
be<00:02:41.860> capital<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:43.010> white<00:02:43.370> capital<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.180> Y<00:02:44.390> but<00:02:44.840> we're

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
be capital a white capital a Y but we're

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.410 
be capital a white capital a Y but we're
going<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.140> see<00:02:45.350> that<00:02:45.560> that's<00:02:45.709> not<00:02:45.980> possible

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
going to see that that's not possible

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.030 
going to see that that's not possible
but<00:02:47.420> first<00:02:47.690> let's<00:02:47.959> look<00:02:48.140> at<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.319> experiment

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
but first let's look at the experiment

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.759 
but first let's look at the experiment
so<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.310> idea<00:02:49.610> was<00:02:50.319> after<00:02:51.319> doing<00:02:51.560> some

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
so the idea was after doing some

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.100 
so the idea was after doing some
preliminary<00:02:51.920> stuff<00:02:52.580> I<00:02:52.819> mean<00:02:53.239> it's<00:02:53.510> sort<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:54.080> a

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
preliminary stuff I mean it's sort of a

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.509 
preliminary stuff I mean it's sort of a
little<00:02:54.530> backwards<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:55.190> way<00:02:55.310> we're<00:02:55.489> thinking

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
little backwards the way we're thinking

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.300 
little backwards the way we're thinking
about<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.150> but<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.989> fact<00:02:57.019> is<00:02:57.470> all<00:02:57.739> yellow<00:02:58.010> mice

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
about it but the fact is all yellow mice

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.820 
about it but the fact is all yellow mice
yellow<00:02:58.910> mice<00:02:59.150> are<00:02:59.480> heterozygous<00:03:00.110> but<00:03:00.500> how<00:03:00.680> did

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
yellow mice are heterozygous but how did

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.759 
yellow mice are heterozygous but how did
we<00:03:00.860> determine<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:01.519> so<00:03:02.300> if<00:03:02.450> they<00:03:02.630> took<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:03.200> pure

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
we determine that so if they took a pure

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.340 
we determine that so if they took a pure
breeding<00:03:04.069> agouti<00:03:04.519> line<00:03:05.510> like<00:03:05.810> this<00:03:06.080> and

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
breeding agouti line like this and

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.250 
breeding agouti line like this and
crossed<00:03:07.069> it<00:03:07.310> with<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.580> yellow<00:03:07.670> mice<00:03:08.260> always

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
crossed it with the yellow mice always

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.900 
crossed it with the yellow mice always
what<00:03:09.530> they<00:03:09.709> saw<00:03:09.980> was<00:03:10.970> that<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.870> got<00:03:12.049> 50%

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
what they saw was that you got 50%

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.250 
what they saw was that you got 50%
yellow<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.209> 50%<00:03:15.310> agouti<00:03:16.360> we<00:03:17.360> know<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:18.080> this

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
yellow and 50% agouti we know that this

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.370 
yellow and 50% agouti we know that this
parent<00:03:18.739> can<00:03:19.340> only<00:03:19.549> contribute<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.870> big<00:03:21.110> a

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
parent can only contribute the big a

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.210 
parent can only contribute the big a
allele<00:03:21.410> right<00:03:22.190> so<00:03:22.880> what<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.209> means<00:03:23.510> is<00:03:24.220> the

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
allele right so what that means is the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.890 
allele right so what that means is the
other<00:03:25.430> parent<00:03:25.940> would<00:03:26.120> have<00:03:26.569> to<00:03:26.780> be

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
other parent would have to be

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.940 
other parent would have to be
contributing<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:29.390> big<00:03:29.630> game<00:03:29.840> y<00:03:30.170> half<00:03:30.650> of<00:03:30.829> the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
contributing the big game y half of the

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.400 
contributing the big game y half of the
time<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.519> big<00:03:32.269> a<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.480> other<00:03:32.870> half<00:03:33.140> of<00:03:33.290> the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
time and big a the other half of the

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.190 
time and big a the other half of the
time<00:03:33.590> so<00:03:34.310> every<00:03:35.120> yellow<00:03:35.329> mouse<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:35.900> was<00:03:36.049> in

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
time so every yellow mouse that was in

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.470 
time so every yellow mouse that was in
existence<00:03:36.320> when<00:03:37.160> they<00:03:37.190> crossed<00:03:37.609> it<00:03:37.850> like<00:03:38.239> this

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
existence when they crossed it like this

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.229 
existence when they crossed it like this
they<00:03:39.079> always<00:03:39.470> got<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.890> 50/50<00:03:40.549> ratio<00:03:40.700> which

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
they always got the 50/50 ratio which

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.569 
they always got the 50/50 ratio which
applies<00:03:41.660> strongly<00:03:42.320> that<00:03:42.859> the<00:03:43.040> yellow<00:03:43.370> Mouse

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
applies strongly that the yellow Mouse

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.220 
applies strongly that the yellow Mouse
is<00:03:43.910> in<00:03:43.970> fact<00:03:44.920> heterozygous<00:03:45.920> for<00:03:46.730> this<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.540> wide

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
is in fact heterozygous for this a wide

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.120 
is in fact heterozygous for this a wide
mutation<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.299> regular<00:03:50.810> goudi<00:03:51.230> allele<00:03:51.560> so

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
mutation and the regular goudi allele so

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.039 
mutation and the regular goudi allele so
what<00:03:52.430> is<00:03:52.609> going<00:03:52.940> on<00:03:53.120> here<00:03:53.390> if<00:03:53.450> that's<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.870> case

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
what is going on here if that's the case

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.949 
what is going on here if that's the case
well<00:03:55.010> if<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.579> do<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.910> cross<00:03:56.180> yellow<00:03:56.660> times

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
well if you do the cross yellow times

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.170 
well if you do the cross yellow times
yellow<00:03:57.410> so<00:03:58.100> now<00:03:58.280> we<00:03:58.340> know<00:03:58.609> what<00:03:58.760> that<00:03:58.940> means

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
yellow so now we know what that means

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.620 
yellow so now we know what that means
that<00:03:59.359> sorry<00:04:00.140> that<00:04:00.739> I<00:04:00.769> had<00:04:01.010> my<00:04:01.190> highlighter

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
that sorry that I had my highlighter

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.319 
that sorry that I had my highlighter
each<00:04:02.630> parent<00:04:04.390> can<00:04:05.390> donate<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:06.370> Y<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.730> a<00:04:07.940> right

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
each parent can donate a Y and a right

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.120 
each parent can donate a Y and a right
so<00:04:08.870> let's<00:04:09.049> follow<00:04:09.290> that<00:04:10.150> hey<00:04:11.150> Y<00:04:11.390> an<00:04:11.600> A<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:12.650> Y<00:04:12.920> an

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
so let's follow that hey Y an A and Y an

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.550 
so let's follow that hey Y an A and Y an
A<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.880> let's<00:04:14.090> just<00:04:14.269> fill<00:04:14.450> in<00:04:14.569> the<00:04:14.660> boxes<00:04:15.049> so<00:04:15.530> we

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
A and let's just fill in the boxes so we

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.800 
A and let's just fill in the boxes so we
get<00:04:15.920> one<00:04:16.390> homozygous<00:04:17.390> dominant<00:04:18.910> we<00:04:19.910> get<00:04:20.150> two

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
get one homozygous dominant we get two

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.940 
get one homozygous dominant we get two
that<00:04:21.709> are<00:04:21.859> heterozygotes<00:04:22.820> for<00:04:23.030> a<00:04:23.240> Y<00:04:23.600> and<00:04:23.930> a<00:04:24.110> and

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
that are heterozygotes for a Y and a and

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.690 
that are heterozygotes for a Y and a and
we<00:04:25.220> get<00:04:25.430> one<00:04:25.700> that's<00:04:26.389> capital<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.169> capital<00:04:27.470> A<00:04:27.860> so

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
we get one that's capital a capital A so

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.890 
we get one that's capital a capital A so
this<00:04:29.000> one<00:04:29.300> looks<00:04:29.600> a<00:04:29.810> GU<00:04:29.990> T<00:04:30.550> as<00:04:31.550> you<00:04:32.450> can<00:04:32.630> tell

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
this one looks a GU T as you can tell

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.450 
this one looks a GU T as you can tell
this<00:04:33.440> one<00:04:33.770> and<00:04:33.979> this<00:04:34.070> one<00:04:34.180> look<00:04:35.180> yellow<00:04:36.460> and

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
this one and this one look yellow and

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.950 
this one and this one look yellow and
what's<00:04:37.669> up<00:04:37.880> with<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.180> other<00:04:38.300> one<00:04:38.570> well<00:04:38.840> it

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
what's up with the other one well it

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.580 
what's up with the other one well it
turns
