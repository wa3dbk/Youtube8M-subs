i'm not saying these aren't easy to
produce<00:00:28.260> at<00:00:28.560> all<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:28.980> they<00:00:29.429> are<00:00:29.580> easier<00:00:29.970> than

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
produce at all but they are easier than

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.870 
produce at all but they are easier than
having<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.480> record<00:00:30.960> spots<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.309> my<00:00:32.640> power

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
positions video but let's go ahead and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.870

talk<00:00:34.200> about<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.559> car<00:00:34.860> responds<00:00:35.219> if<00:00:35.489> you

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
talk about the car responds if you

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.430 
talk about the car responds if you
notice<00:00:36.120> they're<00:00:36.300> really<00:00:36.540> bunched<00:00:36.899> up<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.260> both

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
notice they're really bunched up on both

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.040 
notice they're really bunched up on both
sides<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> map<00:00:38.100> which<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:39.059> can<00:00:39.690> make<00:00:39.899> it

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
sides of the map which it can make it

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.389 
sides of the map which it can make it
difficult<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.590> rush<00:00:40.829> at<00:00:40.980> times<00:00:41.190> especially

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
difficult to rush at times especially

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.660 
difficult to rush at times especially
against<00:00:42.059> good<00:00:42.420> players<00:00:43.219> you<00:00:44.219> know<00:00:44.340> that's<00:00:44.550> why

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
against good players you know that's why

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.950 
against good players you know that's why
you<00:00:44.700> see<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.030> many<00:00:45.120> people<00:00:45.239> camping<00:00:45.809> with

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
you see so many people camping with

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.600 
you see so many people camping with
sniper<00:00:46.170> rifles<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:46.920> they<00:00:47.100> tend<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.370> spawn

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
sniper rifles because they tend to spawn

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.439 
sniper rifles because they tend to spawn
in<00:00:47.760> waves<00:00:48.000> right<00:00:48.420> next<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> each<00:00:48.870> other

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
in waves right next to each other

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.520 
in waves right next to each other
although<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.809> could<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> good<00:00:52.320> thing<00:00:52.379> if

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
although this could be a good thing if

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
although this could be a good thing if
you<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:52.949> against<00:00:53.280> bad<00:00:53.430> players<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.270> know

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
you go up against bad players you know

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.850 
you go up against bad players you know
they're<00:00:54.600> not<00:00:54.629> going<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.989> expect<00:00:55.379> your<00:00:55.559> coming

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
they're not going to expect your coming

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.740 
they're not going to expect your coming
since<00:00:56.670> there's<00:00:56.850> no<00:00:56.969> sponsor<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> middle

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
since there's no sponsor in the middle

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.840 
since there's no sponsor in the middle
of<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> map<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.320> very<00:00:58.649> very<00:00:58.890> easy<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.520> flank

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
of the map it's very very easy to flank

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.180 
of the map it's very very easy to flank
down<00:01:00.120> one<00:01:00.449> side<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.440> enemy<00:01:01.680> team<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:02.010> not

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
down one side if the enemy team is not

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.479 
down one side if the enemy team is not
paying<00:01:02.430> attention<00:01:03.589> one<00:01:04.589> area<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.040> want<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> tell
