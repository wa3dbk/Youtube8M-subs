00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
clear to me at first but I think Obama

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.470 
clear to me at first but I think Obama
definitely<00:00:19.260> pretty<00:00:20.070> handily<00:00:20.460> won<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:20.970> one<00:00:21.240> I

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
debate took a little while to get going

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.670 
debate took a little while to get going
and<00:00:54.329> for<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.570> first<00:00:54.780> half<00:00:54.930> hour<00:00:55.320> they<00:00:55.620> were

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
and for the first half hour they were

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.740 
and for the first half hour they were
sort<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> weeds<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.760> policy<00:00:57.239> detail

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
sort of in the weeds of policy detail

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.959 
sort of in the weeds of policy detail
and<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.320> didn't<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:58.680> see<00:00:58.800> one<00:00:59.340> candidate

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
and I didn't really see one candidate

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.330 
and I didn't really see one candidate
prevailing<00:01:00.600> over<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.899> other<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:02.039> then<00:01:02.190> it

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
prevailing over the other but then it

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.240 
prevailing over the other but then it
became<00:01:03.149> clear<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.690> what<00:01:04.049> Romney<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.739> doing

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
became clear that what Romney was doing

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.910 
became clear that what Romney was doing
was<00:01:05.939> tacking<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.720> center<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.380> agreeing

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
was tacking to the center and agreeing

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.070 
was tacking to the center and agreeing
as<00:01:08.189> much<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.520> possible<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.240> seemed<00:01:09.479> with<00:01:09.659> Obama

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
as much as possible it seemed with Obama

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.100 
as much as possible it seemed with Obama
and<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.820> made<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.970> hard<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.330> Romney<00:01:12.869> to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and that made it hard for Romney to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.499 
and that made it hard for Romney to
distinguish<00:01:13.890> himself<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.970> were<00:01:15.119> stuck<00:01:15.479> with

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
distinguish himself you were stuck with

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.520 
distinguish himself you were stuck with

exploded<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.630> felt<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> same<00:01:49.710> as<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
exploded I felt the same as the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.160 
exploded I felt the same as the
President<00:01:50.430> did<00:01:50.640> Romney<00:01:51.240> tried<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.990> land

any weak moment sort of threw them back

that any time since 1917 the Navy said
they<00:02:03.869> needed<00:02:04.049> 313<00:02:04.979> ships<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.430> kyrat<00:02:05.820> their

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.400 
mission we're now down to 285
we're<00:02:08.429> headed<00:02:08.700> down<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> low<00:02:09.660> 200s

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
if we go through with sequestration

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.370 
if we go through with sequestration
that's<00:02:12.300> unacceptable<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.989> me

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
that's unacceptable to me

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.200 
that's unacceptable to me
I think<00:02:13.590> Governor<00:02:13.860> Romney<00:02:13.890> maybe<00:02:14.310> hasn't

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.760 
I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't
spent<00:02:15.360> enough<00:02:15.540> time<00:02:15.570> looking<00:02:16.200> at<00:02:16.560> how<00:02:16.590> our

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
spent enough time looking at how our

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.560 
spent enough time looking at how our
military<00:02:16.950> works<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.790> mentioned<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> Navy

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
military works you mentioned the Navy

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.720 
military works you mentioned the Navy
for<00:02:18.840> example<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.470> then<00:02:19.740> we<00:02:19.830> have<00:02:19.950> fewer<00:02:20.460> ships

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
for example and then we have fewer ships

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.390 
for example and then we have fewer ships
than<00:02:20.970> we<00:02:21.060> did<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.240> 1916<00:02:21.930> well<00:02:22.890> governor<00:02:23.280> we

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
than we did in 1916 well governor we

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.270 
than we did in 1916 well governor we
also<00:02:23.430> have<00:02:23.700> fewer<00:02:23.820> horses<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.750> bayonets

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
also have fewer horses and bayonets

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.830 
also have fewer horses and bayonets
because<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.970> nature<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.510> our<00:02:27.660> military's

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
because the nature of our military's

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.390 
because the nature of our military's
changed<00:02:28.170> we<00:02:28.800> had<00:02:28.980> these<00:02:29.100> things<00:02:29.280> called

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
changed we had these things called

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.490 
changed we had these things called
aircraft<00:02:29.730> carriers<00:02:30.390> where<00:02:30.600> planes<00:02:30.630> land<00:02:31.290> on

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
aircraft carriers where planes land on

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.680 
aircraft carriers where planes land on
them<00:02:31.680> we<00:02:32.040> have<00:02:32.220> these<00:02:32.850> ships<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.570> go

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
them we have these ships that go

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.500 
them we have these ships that go
underwater<00:02:33.930> nuclear<00:02:34.590> submarines<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:36.030> could

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
underwater nuclear submarines it could

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.030 
underwater nuclear submarines it could
have<00:02:36.600> been<00:02:36.690> almost<00:02:36.930> too<00:02:37.260> condescending<00:02:37.920> but

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
have been almost too condescending but

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.790 
have been almost too condescending but
it<00:02:38.190> wasn't<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.390> really<00:02:39.630> got<00:02:40.050> picked<00:02:40.530> up<00:02:40.650> on

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
it wasn't and it really got picked up on

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.880 
it wasn't and it really got picked up on
the<00:02:40.920> internet<00:02:41.280> right<00:02:41.460> away<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.210> got<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.900> lot<00:02:43.680> of

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
the internet right away and got a lot of

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.450 
the internet right away and got a lot of
attention<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.360> made<00:02:45.690> Romney<00:02:46.460> that

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
attention and that made Romney that

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.340 
attention and that made Romney that
didn't<00:02:47.760> make<00:02:47.970> Romney<00:02:48.510> look<00:02:48.720> great

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
didn't make Romney look great

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.890 
didn't make Romney look great
Romney<00:02:49.770> said<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.010> he<00:02:50.250> would<00:02:50.600> he<00:02:51.600> would<00:02:51.720> never

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
Romney said that he would he would never

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.050 
Romney said that he would he would never
do<00:02:52.140> anything<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.530> hurt<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.950> auto<00:02:53.400> industry

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
do anything to hurt the auto industry

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.300 
do anything to hurt the auto industry
and<00:02:54.090> then<00:02:54.810> he<00:02:55.080> started<00:02:55.530> saying<00:02:55.800> something

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
and then he started saying something

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.410 
and then he started saying something
sort<00:02:56.580> of<00:02:57.260> vague<00:02:58.260> about<00:02:58.740> well<00:02:59.550> he<00:03:00.000> wanted<00:03:00.300> a

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
sort of vague about well he wanted a

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.970 
sort of vague about well he wanted a
kind<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.870> bankruptcy<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.680> would<00:03:01.890> have

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
kind of bankruptcy that would have

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.790 
kind of bankruptcy that would have
allowed<00:03:02.280> them<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.580> survive<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.660> Obama<00:03:04.530> came

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
allowed them to survive and Obama came

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.010 
allowed them to survive and Obama came
right<00:03:05.040> back<00:03:05.280> in<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.910> said<00:03:06.240> let's<00:03:06.600> look<00:03:06.780> at<00:03:06.900> the

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
right back in and said let's look at the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.930 
right back in and said let's look at the
record<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.650> sounded<00:03:08.040> as<00:03:08.160> if<00:03:08.190> we<00:03:08.820> were

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
record and it sounded as if we were

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.240 
record and it sounded as if we were
heading<00:03:09.210> toward<00:03:09.420> another<00:03:09.920> Benghazi<00:03:10.920> moment

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
heading toward another Benghazi moment

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.510 
heading toward another Benghazi moment
from<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.550> second<00:03:11.880> debate<00:03:12.000> not<00:03:12.510> only<00:03:12.930> was

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
from the second debate not only was

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.660 
from the second debate not only was
Romney<00:03:15.470> stuck<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.740> his<00:03:17.240> decision<00:03:18.240> to<00:03:19.640> try<00:03:20.640> to

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
Romney stuck in his decision to try to

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.670 
Romney stuck in his decision to try to
agree<00:03:21.270> with<00:03:21.480> Obama<00:03:21.510> as<00:03:22.080> much<00:03:22.290> as<00:03:22.470> possible

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
agree with Obama as much as possible

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.210 
agree with Obama as much as possible
which<00:03:23.220> made<00:03:23.460> it<00:03:23.640> hard<00:03:24.270> to<00:03:24.390> find<00:03:25.220> difference

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
which made it hard to find difference

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.060 
which made it hard to find difference
between<00:03:26.610> him<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.140> Obama<00:03:28.140> where<00:03:28.500> he<00:03:28.740> really

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
between him and Obama where he really

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.070 
between him and Obama where he really
attacked<00:03:29.520> Obama<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.300> really<00:03:30.630> could<00:03:30.810> attack

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
attacked Obama and really could attack

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.960 
attacked Obama and really could attack
Obama<00:03:31.410> was<00:03:31.560> on<00:03:31.710> domestic<00:03:32.160> policy<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:32.700> once

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
Obama was on domestic policy and once

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.520 
Obama was on domestic policy and once
again<00:03:33.180> is<00:03:33.300> in<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.510> second<00:03:33.840> debate<00:03:33.930> he<00:03:34.290> was

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
again is in the second debate he was

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.190 
again is in the second debate he was
probably<00:03:34.770> strongest<00:03:35.670> where<00:03:36.360> he<00:03:36.570> was<00:03:36.720> reeling

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
probably strongest where he was reeling

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.050 
probably strongest where he was reeling
off<00:03:37.350> things<00:03:37.740> that<00:03:37.920> Obama<00:03:38.220> had<00:03:38.460> promised<00:03:38.940> that

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
off things that Obama had promised that

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.150 
off things that Obama had promised that
he<00:03:39.330> could<00:03:39.540> do<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:39.930> hadn't<00:03:40.290> delivered<00:03:40.560> on<00:03:40.860> but

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
he could do and hadn't delivered on but
