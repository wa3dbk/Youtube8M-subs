it was great to get his insights and
feedback<00:02:04.690> on<00:02:04.870> the<00:02:04.960> car<00:02:05.140> I'm<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.560> big<00:02:05.830> fan<00:02:06.070> of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
feedback on the car I'm a big fan of

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.100 
feedback on the car I'm a big fan of
all-wheel<00:02:06.520> drive<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.060> I<00:02:07.360> was<00:02:07.720> certainly

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
all-wheel drive so I was certainly

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.380 
all-wheel drive so I was certainly
pushing<00:02:08.410> for<00:02:08.770> it<00:02:08.860> behind<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.310> scenes<00:02:09.610> but<00:02:10.270> I'm

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
pushing for it behind the scenes but I'm

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.180 
pushing for it behind the scenes but I'm
thrilled<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.929> Ford<00:02:11.170> decided<00:02:11.740> to<00:02:11.830> make<00:02:12.010> the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.460 
new Focus RS a powerful will drive beast
and<00:02:16.150> since<00:02:16.450> we<00:02:16.570> can<00:02:16.720> change<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.200> all-wheel

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
and since we can change the all-wheel

and since we can change the all-wheel
drive<00:02:17.650> settings<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.310> can<00:02:18.459> really<00:02:18.850> tailor<00:02:19.480> the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
drive settings you can really tailor the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.990 
drive settings you can really tailor the
handling<00:02:20.170> character<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.950> RS<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.760> suit
