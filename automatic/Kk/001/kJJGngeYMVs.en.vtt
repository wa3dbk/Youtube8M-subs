00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
there that the brake cable will go

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.780 
there that the brake cable will go
through<00:00:30.800> just<00:00:31.800> feed<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.369> brake<00:00:32.579> cable

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
through just feed the brake cable

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.299 
through just feed the brake cable
through<00:00:33.149> here<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:36.590> then<00:00:37.590> pull<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.100> brake

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.510 
through here and then pull the brake
cable<00:00:38.489> tight<00:00:39.410> this<00:00:40.410> brake<00:00:40.739> cable<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.160> already

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
cable tight this brake cable is already

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.729 
cable tight this brake cable is already
cut<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> proper<00:00:42.390> length<00:00:45.500> what<00:00:46.500> we'll<00:00:46.620> want

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
cut to the proper length what we'll want

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.950 
cut to the proper length what we'll want
to<00:00:46.890> do<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.610> place<00:00:47.850> an<00:00:48.000> end<00:00:48.210> cap<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
to do is just place an end cap on the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.229 
to do is just place an end cap on the
end<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> cable<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.670> will<00:00:50.850> prevent<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
end of the cable this will prevent the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.670 
end of the cable this will prevent the
cable<00:00:51.510> from<00:00:51.750> up<00:00:51.989> from<00:00:52.320> unraveling<00:00:53.039> or<00:00:53.250> fraying

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
cable from up from unraveling or fraying

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.490 
cable from up from unraveling or fraying
this<00:00:55.680> simply<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.190> goes<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
this simply just goes on like so and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.220 
this simply just goes on like so and
then<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.590> take<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> crimper<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.670> and

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
then you take a crimper like this and

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:10.270 
then you take a crimper like this and
simply<00:01:01.230> crimp<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.890> end<00:01:02.039> cap<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.570> cable

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.109 

there<00:01:10.970> we<00:01:11.180> go<00:01:11.600> just<00:01:11.900> get<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:12.170> in<00:01:12.260> place<00:01:12.500> and

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
there we go just get it in place and

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:25.910 
there we go just get it in place and
pinch<00:01:14.119> it<00:01:14.270> shut

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.980 

now<00:01:26.920> that<00:01:27.070> is<00:01:27.220> secured<00:01:27.580> in<00:01:27.610> place<00:01:27.909> and<00:01:28.390> will

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
now that is secured in place and will

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:37.140 
now that is secured in place and will
prevent<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.650> end<00:01:29.800> from<00:01:30.070> fraying<00:01:35.880> our<00:01:36.880> next

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
prevent the end from fraying our next

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.090 
prevent the end from fraying our next
step<00:01:37.330> is<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.510> tighten<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.260> brake<00:01:38.500> cable<00:01:38.680> bolt
