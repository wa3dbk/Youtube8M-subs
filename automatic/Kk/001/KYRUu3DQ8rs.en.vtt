 always been attracted by the paths of 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.480
 iron is a time when there was 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.770
 a lot of steam locomotive it's 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.020

 we have about 12% of all railway workers 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.170
 the rest are all classes 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.770

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.250
 a little above it's like that 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.769
 that's going on too, we're going to say 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.739
 that's archaic 1 but roughly speaking 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.390
 system that's the one that's that one 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.329
 open the signals the signals open 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.760

 total under the network and then you see 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.540
 sometimes it can be a son to cut 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.610
