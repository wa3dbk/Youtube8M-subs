so<00:00:31.070> Putnam<00:00:32.070> famously<00:00:32.489> said<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.820> meaning

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
that didn't make any sense let's take a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.350 
that didn't make any sense let's take a
look<00:01:08.070> at<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> specific<00:01:08.610> thought<00:01:08.820> experiment

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
look at the specific thought experiment

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.630 
look at the specific thought experiment
and<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:09.869> if<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.260> clear<00:01:10.530> things<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.979> so

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and see if that can clear things up so

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.240 
and see if that can clear things up so
imagine<00:01:12.330> we're<00:01:12.450> back<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.810> 1600<00:01:13.680> specifically

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
imagine we're back in 1600 specifically

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.130 
imagine we're back in 1600 specifically
before<00:01:14.400> Henry<00:01:15.090> Cavendish<00:01:15.450> has<00:01:15.720> discovered

before Henry Cavendish has discovered

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.370 
before Henry Cavendish has discovered
that<00:01:16.290> water<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.950> h2o<00:01:17.810> imagine<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.049> earth

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
that water is h2o imagine we have earth

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.260 
that water is h2o imagine we have earth
