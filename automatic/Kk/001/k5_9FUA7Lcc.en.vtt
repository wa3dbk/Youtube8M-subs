00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
holographic stuff on it it's really

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.600 
holographic stuff on it it's really
cutting-edge<00:00:26.210> stuff<00:00:26.480> on<00:00:26.720> me<00:00:26.870> now<00:00:27.520> it's<00:00:28.520> the

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
the front I hope you can see that on the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.760 
the front I hope you can see that on the
camera<00:00:34.579> with<00:00:34.870> you<00:00:35.870> tell<00:00:36.079> it<00:00:36.170> details<00:00:36.530> in<00:00:36.710> the

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
camera with you tell it details in the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.729 
camera with you tell it details in the
back<00:00:36.949> too<00:00:37.190> I<00:00:37.659> mean<00:00:38.659> this<00:00:38.749> is<00:00:38.809> a<00:00:38.960> really<00:00:39.409> it

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
back too I mean this is a really it

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.130 
back too I mean this is a really it
looks<00:00:39.890> like<00:00:40.010> a<00:00:40.039> 3d<00:00:40.670> image<00:00:40.819> and<00:00:41.269> the<00:00:41.539> way<00:00:41.629> his

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
looks like a 3d image and the way his

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.939 
looks like a 3d image and the way his
hand<00:00:42.409> comes<00:00:42.649> out<00:00:42.829> I<00:00:43.089> mean<00:00:44.089> I<00:00:44.179> can't<00:00:44.449> even<00:00:44.920> so<00:00:45.920> I

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
hand comes out I mean I can't even so I

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:47.290 
hand comes out I mean I can't even so I
think<00:00:46.129> it<00:00:46.339> was<00:00:46.429> worth<00:00:46.579> the<00:00:46.670> ten<00:00:46.909> dollar<00:00:47.120> that's

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
think it was worth the ten dollar that's

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.610 
think it was worth the ten dollar that's
spent<00:00:47.359> on<00:00:47.629> this<00:00:47.719> thing<00:00:47.929> because<00:00:48.109> I<00:00:48.289> some

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
spent on this thing because I some

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.779 
spent on this thing because I some
people<00:00:48.829> have<00:00:48.949> seen<00:00:49.069> it<00:00:49.219> already<00:00:49.339> they're<00:00:49.609> like

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
modes you mean he's a great robot mode

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.600 
modes you mean he's a great robot mode
and<00:01:13.840> it's<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.899> great<00:01:15.079> vehicle<00:01:15.409> mode<00:01:15.649> to<00:01:15.860> it<00:01:16.039> and

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
school in robot mode but how's it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.270 
school in robot mode but how's it
looking<00:01:22.789> vehicle<00:01:23.030> more<00:01:23.740> so<00:01:24.740> this<00:01:24.979> way<00:01:25.130> they

great so yeah different way to display

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.099 
great so yeah different way to display
figures<00:01:45.460> that's<00:01:46.460> what<00:01:46.609> you<00:01:46.670> have<00:01:46.880> both<00:01:47.780> you

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
figures that's what you have both you

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.230 
figures that's what you have both you
know<00:01:48.200> you<00:01:48.979> can<00:01:49.130> see<00:01:49.280> both<00:01:49.460> modes<00:01:49.759> nothing<00:01:50.119> it

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240
