00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
on the market you don't really get a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.330 
on the market you don't really get a
good<00:01:08.939> view<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.630> what<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.320> actually<00:01:10.500> looks<00:01:10.799> like

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
good view of what it actually looks like

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.179 
good view of what it actually looks like
it<00:01:11.880> looks<00:01:11.939> kind<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:12.960> one<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.710> my<00:01:13.950> colleagues

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
it looks kind of as one of my colleagues

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.039 
it looks kind of as one of my colleagues
mentioned<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:15.180> looks<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> rubber<00:01:15.810> band

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
mentioned it looks like a rubber band

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.480 
mentioned it looks like a rubber band
that's<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.890> fit<00:01:17.070> around<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that's just going to fit around the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.700 
that's just going to fit around the
actual<00:01:17.970> phone<00:01:18.180> itself<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.530> much

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
actual phone itself but it is so much

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.570 
actual phone itself but it is so much
more<00:01:19.740> than<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.939> does<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> metal<00:01:22.580> well

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
more than that it does have a metal well

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.609 
more than that it does have a metal well
a<00:01:23.610> quasi<00:01:24.330> metal<00:01:24.689> i<00:01:24.780> believe<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.320> plastic

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
a quasi metal i believe it is plastic

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.980 
a quasi metal i believe it is plastic
because<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.250> pliable<00:01:26.549> but<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.299> very<00:01:27.600> metal

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
because it is pliable but a very metal

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.980 
because it is pliable but a very metal
looking<00:01:28.790> case<00:01:29.790> around<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.570> then<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
looking case around it and then on the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.870 
looking case around it and then on the
back<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:32.210> rubbery<00:01:33.210> type<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:34.670> material<00:01:35.670> that

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
back is a rubbery type of material that

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.399 
back is a rubbery type of material that
wraps<00:01:36.119> around<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.600> phone<00:01:36.840> very<00:01:37.170> nice<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
wraps around the phone very nice and

can imagine what a thirty-dollar version

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.370 
can imagine what a thirty-dollar version
of<00:04:36.610> this<00:04:36.700> case<00:04:36.970> would<00:04:37.180> do<00:04:37.389> but<00:04:37.990> just<00:04:38.230> to<00:04:38.350> show

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
of this case would do but just to show

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.110 
of this case would do but just to show
you<00:04:38.590> in<00:04:38.860> comparison<00:04:39.580> i<00:04:39.669> mean<00:04:39.850> you<00:04:40.030> know

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
you in comparison i mean you know

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.360 
you in comparison i mean you know
size-wise<00:04:40.510> they're<00:04:41.230> pretty<00:04:41.770> much<00:04:41.980> the<00:04:42.160> same

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
size-wise they're pretty much the same

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.670 
size-wise they're pretty much the same
this<00:04:42.910> one<00:04:43.120> does<00:04:43.270> have<00:04:43.300> a<00:04:43.480> full<00:04:43.750> back<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.380> it<00:04:44.530> and

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
this one does have a full back to it and

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.670 
this one does have a full back to it and
so<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:44.950> cutouts<00:04:45.430> are<00:04:46.260> important<00:04:47.260> for<00:04:47.470> the

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
so the cutouts are important for the

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.510 
so the cutouts are important for the
volume<00:04:47.950> and<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:49.150> camera<00:04:49.870> but<00:04:50.800> this<00:04:50.919> case<00:04:51.190> here

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
volume and the camera but this case here

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.330
