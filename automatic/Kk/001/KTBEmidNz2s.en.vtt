00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
that utilizes the Qi standard 2 at the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.869 
that utilizes the Qi standard 2 at the
heart<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.320> easy<00:00:37.739> torch<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> wireless

heart of the easy torch is the wireless
base<00:00:39.450> station<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.100> world<00:00:41.340> charging

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
base station and this is world charging

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.850 
base station and this is world charging
it's<00:00:42.059> done<00:00:42.450> nothing<00:00:43.140> really<00:00:43.379> integrate<00:00:43.739> with

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
it's done nothing really integrate with

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.740 
it's done nothing really integrate with
this<00:00:44.010> with<00:00:44.340> its<00:00:44.520> design<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.239> basically<00:00:45.600> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
this with its design it's basically a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.350 
this with its design it's basically a
flat<00:00:46.079> piece<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.379> plastic<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.460> glossy<00:00:48.180> side

flat piece of plastic on the glossy side

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.119 
flat piece of plastic on the glossy side
so<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.719> tends<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.140> accumulate<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.649> lot<00:00:49.920> of

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
so it tends to accumulate a lot of

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.160 
so it tends to accumulate a lot of
smudges<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.940> fingerprints<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.050> is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
smudges and fingerprints but this is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.049 
smudges and fingerprints but this is
where<00:00:52.379> all<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.559> charging<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.340> done<00:00:53.550> it's

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
where all the charging is done it's

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.119 
where all the charging is done it's
compatible<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.780> work<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:55.170> any<00:00:55.410> devices<00:00:55.829> that

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
compatible to work with any devices that

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.760 
compatible to work with any devices that
utilizes<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.030> Qi<00:00:57.420> standard<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.469> case

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
utilizes the Qi standard so in this case

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.920 
utilizes the Qi standard so in this case
you<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.430> the<00:01:00.000> battery<00:01:00.329> case<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.840> the

galaxy<00:01:27.869> s3<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:28.680> makes<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.280> handset<00:01:29.820> very

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
galaxy s3 it just makes the handset very

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.719 
galaxy s3 it just makes the handset very
massive<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.049> overall<00:01:31.409> size<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:32.640> nice

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
massive in overall size but it's nice

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.910 
massive in overall size but it's nice
that<00:01:32.820> has<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.540> soft<00:01:34.079> touch<00:01:34.259> finish<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.829> it

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
that has a soft touch finish so it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.210 
that has a soft touch finish so it
maintains<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.729> very<00:01:36.000> clean<00:01:36.360> exterior<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:38.070> we

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
maintains a very clean exterior if we

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.980 
maintains a very clean exterior if we
take<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.400> look<00:01:38.460> around<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.000> case<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:39.869> could

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
take a look around the case so we could

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.420 
take a look around the case so we could
tell<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.290> all<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.439> buns<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.009> ports<00:01:41.310> are

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
tell that all the buns and ports are

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.429 
tell that all the buns and ports are
still<00:01:41.460> relatively<00:01:42.150> accessible<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
still relatively accessible you have the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.469 
still relatively accessible you have the
volume<00:01:43.649> control<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.250> left<00:01:44.430> hand<00:01:44.640> side<00:01:44.759> the
