00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:01.279 
everything is nicely organized I prefer

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:03.459 
everything is nicely organized I prefer
the<00:05:01.849> more<00:05:02.060> old-school<00:05:02.659> traditional<00:05:02.840> style

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469 
the more old-school traditional style

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:04.809 
the more old-school traditional style
because<00:05:03.770> I<00:05:03.800> find<00:05:04.250> things<00:05:04.460> a<00:05:04.580> little<00:05:04.639> bit

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
because I find things a little bit

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:06.610 
because I find things a little bit
easier<00:05:05.120> but<00:05:05.509> it's<00:05:05.750> definitely<00:05:06.139> not<00:05:06.379> as

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
easier but it's definitely not as

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.219 
easier but it's definitely not as
overwhelming<00:05:07.580> as<00:05:07.729> it<00:05:07.789> was<00:05:08.090> on<00:05:08.300> the<00:05:08.389> LG<00:05:08.719> on<00:05:08.870> the

and as you maybe saw there is not a
whole<00:05:15.469> lot<00:05:15.770> going<00:05:16.219> on<00:05:16.340> but<00:05:16.849> what<00:05:17.180> is<00:05:17.360> there<00:05:17.629> is

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
whole lot going on but what is there is

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.050 
whole lot going on but what is there is

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
lockscreen shortcuts and so on what

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.360 
lockscreen shortcuts and so on what
doesn't<00:05:26.779> work<00:05:26.960> that's<00:05:27.439> maybe<00:05:27.770> a<00:05:27.919> small

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
doesn't work that's maybe a small

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.110 
doesn't work that's maybe a small
drawback<00:05:28.819> you<00:05:29.449> can't<00:05:29.779> really<00:05:30.909> expand<00:05:31.909> a

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
drawback you can't really expand a

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.149 
drawback you can't really expand a
notification<00:05:32.569> on<00:05:33.020> the<00:05:33.139> homescreen<00:05:33.469> you<00:05:33.919> have

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
notification on the homescreen you have

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.430 
notification on the homescreen you have
and<00:05:34.370> if<00:05:34.520> you<00:05:34.639> want<00:05:34.879> to<00:05:35.060> actually<00:05:35.509> activate<00:05:36.319> it

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
and if you want to actually activate it

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.649 
and if you want to actually activate it
you<00:05:36.589> can<00:05:37.039> just<00:05:37.069> double<00:05:37.699> tap<00:05:37.879> it<00:05:38.060> as<00:05:38.240> you<00:05:38.389> could

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
you can just double tap it as you could

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.869 
you can just double tap it as you could
on<00:05:38.900> lollipop<00:05:39.349> usually<00:05:39.800> you<00:05:40.129> have<00:05:40.339> to<00:05:40.490> tap<00:05:40.699> it

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:40.879 
on lollipop usually you have to tap it

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:43.390 
on lollipop usually you have to tap it
once<00:05:41.089> and<00:05:41.330> then<00:05:41.629> open<00:05:42.110> the<00:05:42.229> screen<00:05:42.529> this<00:05:43.339> is

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
once and then open the screen this is

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.850 
once and then open the screen this is
maybe<00:05:43.789> a<00:05:43.909> slight<00:05:44.210> drawback<00:05:44.419> but<00:05:44.719> I<00:05:44.779> got<00:05:45.440> ok

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
maybe a slight drawback but I got ok

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.790

what you think of the LG G I know it is
not<00:05:59.900> the<00:06:00.020> same<00:06:00.139> as<00:06:00.319> to<00:06:00.469> g4<00:06:00.860> and<00:06:00.919> I<00:06:01.129> will<00:06:01.339> I<00:06:01.550> won't

but<00:06:06.110> from<00:06:06.500> what<00:06:06.680> I<00:06:06.710> see<00:06:07.009> here<00:06:07.430> it<00:06:07.610> works<00:06:08.150> very

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
but from what I see here it works very

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:12.700 
but from what I see here it works very
well<00:06:08.689> also<00:06:09.169> here<00:06:09.860> we<00:06:10.099> can<00:06:10.310> see<00:06:10.580> the<00:06:11.710> recent

integrated not really

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:18.610 
integrated not really
maybe<00:06:16.520> not<00:06:16.789> material<00:06:17.389> style<00:06:17.659> but<00:06:17.900> it<00:06:18.139> does<00:06:18.409> the

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
maybe not material style but it does the

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.189 
maybe not material style but it does the
job<00:06:18.650> very<00:06:19.159> well<00:06:19.339> so<00:06:20.150> I<00:06:20.529> like<00:06:21.529> this<00:06:22.240> UI<00:06:23.240> and<00:06:23.719> I

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
job very well so I like this UI and I

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.110 
job very well so I like this UI and I
would<00:06:24.409> prefer<00:06:24.680> it<00:06:25.039> over<00:06:25.189> stock<00:06:25.879> I<00:06:26.089> would

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
would prefer it over stock I would

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.999

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
prefer it over over the Motorola UI over

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:33.610 
prefer it over over the Motorola UI over
TouchWiz<00:06:31.580> and<00:06:31.789> even<00:06:32.599> over<00:06:32.990> the<00:06:33.139> Sony<00:06:33.409> UI

TouchWiz and even over the Sony UI

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.399 
TouchWiz and even over the Sony UI
because<00:06:34.370> I<00:06:34.699> have<00:06:35.180> these<00:06:35.479> few<00:06:35.870> little<00:06:36.139> nice

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:36.409 
because I have these few little nice

this

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
this

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.170 
this
something<00:06:40.409> I<00:06:40.500> don't<00:06:40.560> get<00:06:41.039> out<00:06:41.220> of<00:06:41.610> the<00:06:41.759> box<00:06:41.970> on

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
something I don't get out of the box on

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.570 
something I don't get out of the box on
its<00:06:42.330> own<00:06:42.479> UI<00:06:42.720> if<00:06:43.199> heavily<00:06:43.889> modified<00:06:44.159> with

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
its own UI if heavily modified with

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.740 
its own UI if heavily modified with
exposed<00:06:45.090> and<00:06:45.300> so<00:06:45.449> on

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
exposed and so on

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.749 
exposed and so on
then<00:06:46.110> I<00:06:46.139> take<00:06:46.590> maybe<00:06:46.889> what<00:06:47.220> looks<00:06:47.490> a<00:06:47.639> little

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 
then I take maybe what looks a little

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.770 
then I take maybe what looks a little
bit<00:06:48.000> more<00:06:48.210> stuff<00:06:48.449> but<00:06:48.629> I<00:06:49.490> don't<00:06:50.490> find<00:06:51.240> anything

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
bit more stuff but I don't find anything

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 
about the LG UI on the lg spirit that I

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:57.320 
about the LG UI on the lg spirit that I
don't<00:06:55.680> like<00:06:56.009> and<00:06:56.340> I<00:06:56.520> would<00:06:56.699> have<00:06:56.849> to<00:06:56.970> complain
