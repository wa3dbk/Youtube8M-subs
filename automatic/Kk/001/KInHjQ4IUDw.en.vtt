here<00:04:29.180> in<00:04:29.240> 82<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:29.950> because<00:04:30.950> everybody<00:04:31.400> held

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
here in 82 and because everybody held

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.130 
here in 82 and because everybody held
the<00:04:31.790> ball<00:04:31.940> that<00:04:32.180> we<00:04:32.300> played<00:04:32.540> control<00:04:32.990> the

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
the ball that we played control the

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
tempo there was no shot clock and so

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.690 
tempo there was no shot clock and so
that's<00:04:36.470> part<00:04:36.800> of<00:04:36.890> it<00:04:36.980> but<00:04:37.040> the<00:04:37.310> other<00:04:37.430> thing

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
that's part of it but the other thing

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.850 
that's part of it but the other thing
when<00:04:38.480> people<00:04:38.660> ask<00:04:38.990> Michael<00:04:39.440> about<00:04:39.620> that

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
when people ask Michael about that

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.560 
when people ask Michael about that
Michael<00:04:40.070> would<00:04:40.310> say<00:04:40.520> that<00:04:40.760> Coach<00:04:40.970> Smith<00:04:41.270> gave

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
Michael would say that Coach Smith gave

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.440 
Michael would say that Coach Smith gave
me<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:41.840> foundation<00:04:42.580> that<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:43.640> could<00:04:43.940> build<00:04:44.210> on

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
me the foundation that I could build on

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.970 
me the foundation that I could build on
but<00:04:44.780> he<00:04:44.900> made<00:04:45.080> sure<00:04:45.320> I<00:04:45.380> had<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:45.590> strong

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
but he made sure I had a strong

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.010 
but he made sure I had a strong
foundation<00:04:46.280> knew<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.180> fundamentals<00:04:47.870> and

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
foundation knew the fundamentals and

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.800 
foundation knew the fundamentals and
then<00:04:48.590> I<00:04:48.710> could<00:04:48.920> move<00:04:49.130> into<00:04:49.340> any<00:04:49.610> area<00:04:49.810> because

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
then I could move into any area because

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.230 
then I could move into any area because
I<00:04:51.020> was<00:04:51.260> strong<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:51.680> fundamentally<00:04:52.550> sound<00:04:52.820> and

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
I was strong and fundamentally sound and

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.450 
I was strong and fundamentally sound and
I<00:04:53.390> think<00:04:53.810> Michael<00:04:54.170> always<00:04:54.470> appreciated<00:04:55.250> that

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
I think Michael always appreciated that

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.490 
I think Michael always appreciated that
and<00:04:55.900> he<00:04:56.900> was<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:58.100> one<00:04:58.280> that<00:04:58.310> made<00:04:58.750> Michael<00:04:59.750> see

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
and he was the one that made Michael see

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.440 
and he was the one that made Michael see
how<00:05:00.530> important<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.550> strong<00:05:01.790> fundamental

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
how important the strong fundamental

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.330 
how important the strong fundamental
part<00:05:02.660> of<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.840> game<00:05:03.020> was<00:05:03.290> and<00:05:03.590> then<00:05:03.980> Michael

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
part of the game was and then Michael

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.420

picture<00:06:37.460> of<00:06:37.610> a<00:06:37.760> little<00:06:37.880> boy

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
picture of a little boy

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.160 
picture of a little boy
and<00:06:39.030> if<00:06:39.120> you<00:06:39.210> put<00:06:39.420> the<00:06:39.540> little<00:06:39.720> boy<00:06:39.900> together

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.170 
and if you put the little boy together

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.310 
and if you put the little boy together
correctly<00:06:40.830> the<00:06:40.980> puzzle<00:06:41.340> fits<00:06:41.550> right<00:06:41.730> in<00:06:41.940> and<00:06:42.320> I

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
correctly the puzzle fits right in and I

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.080 
correctly the puzzle fits right in and I
gave<00:06:43.620> that<00:06:43.800> to<00:06:43.920> coach<00:06:44.100> Smith<00:06:44.460> and<00:06:44.790> he<00:06:44.880> thought

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
gave that to coach Smith and he thought

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.970 
gave that to coach Smith and he thought
that<00:06:45.150> was<00:06:45.330> one<00:06:45.570> of<00:06:45.630> the<00:06:45.750> greatest<00:06:46.020> things<00:06:46.380> may

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:46.980 
that was one of the greatest things may

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.480 
that was one of the greatest things may
be<00:06:47.040> the<00:06:47.190> only<00:06:47.310> thing<00:06:47.550> I<00:06:47.700> ever<00:06:47.730> did<00:06:47.970> for<00:06:49.490> that

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
be the only thing I ever did for that

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.820 
be the only thing I ever did for that
was<00:06:50.670> him<00:06:50.880> and<00:06:51.120> I<00:06:51.150> think<00:06:51.210> that<00:06:51.660> the<00:06:52.260> way<00:06:52.500> that<00:06:52.770> I

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
was him and I think that the way that I

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.950 
was him and I think that the way that I
hope<00:06:53.190> that<00:06:53.400> we<00:06:53.550> can<00:06:53.700> honor<00:06:53.880> coach<00:06:54.180> Smith<00:06:54.540> is<00:06:54.780> to
