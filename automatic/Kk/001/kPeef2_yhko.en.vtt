00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.330 
tune the entire thing and get it to a
fairly<00:00:47.640> fairly<00:00:48.059> decent<00:00:48.570> level<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.829> method

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
fairly fairly decent level this method

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.189 
fairly fairly decent level this method
we're<00:00:50.760> not<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.239> through<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.170> know

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
we're not going to go through you know

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.189 
we're not going to go through you know
all<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.890> all<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.579> complete<00:00:54.030> theory<00:00:54.930> and

we're<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> kind<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.820> focus<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.980> using<00:01:01.980> an

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
we're going to kind of focus on using an

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.160 
we're going to kind of focus on using an
electronic<00:01:02.760> tuning<00:01:03.149> device<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.750> order<00:01:03.870> to

electronic tuning device in order to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.920 
electronic tuning device in order to
tune<00:01:04.379> because<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.890> feel<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.540> know<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
tune because I feel that you know for a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.899 
tune because I feel that you know for a
beginning<00:01:07.200> tuner<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.799> kind<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.610> gets<00:01:08.790> you

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
beginning tuner it kind of gets you

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.880 
beginning tuner it kind of gets you
started<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> point<00:01:10.710> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
started and can get you to the point of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.590 
started and can get you to the point of
being<00:01:11.640> able<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:13.460> tune<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.549> piano<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.180> learn

without having to work too much on

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.060 
without having to work too much on
training<00:01:24.600> your<00:01:24.720> ear<00:01:25.020> which<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:25.770> want<00:01:25.979> to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
training your ear which you do want to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.710 
training your ear which you do want to
do<00:01:26.189> eventually<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.119> know<00:01:27.240> especially<00:01:27.479> if

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
do eventually if you know especially if

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.060 
do eventually if you know especially if
you're<00:01:27.869> going<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.049> learn<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.380> tune<00:01:28.560> for<00:01:28.590> others

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
you're going to learn to tune for others

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.390 
you're going to learn to tune for others
but<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.640> know<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.950> method

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
but you know this can this this method

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.950 
but you know this can this this method

and that we're going to be teaching in
this<00:01:34.140> series<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.979> videos<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.630> teach

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
this series of videos is going to teach

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.440 
this series of videos is going to teach
you<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> basics<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.280> get<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.119> and

you the basics and get you up and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.289 
you the basics and get you up and
running<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.920> get<00:01:41.299> somewhat

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
running so that you can get somewhat

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.319 
running so that you can get somewhat
decent<00:01:42.540> tuning<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.729> sounds

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
decent tuning that that sounds

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.660 
decent tuning that that sounds
acceptable<00:01:45.960> using<00:01:46.710> an<00:01:46.799> electronic<00:01:47.250> tuning

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
acceptable using an electronic tuning

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.109 
acceptable using an electronic tuning
device<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.670> they're<00:01:50.939> gonna<00:01:51.000> be

be part of that video the next video is
going<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.530> be<00:03:24.620> going<00:03:25.190> through<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.670> tuning<00:03:26.269> the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
going to be going through and tuning the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.780 
going to be going through and tuning the
unison<00:03:26.840> okay<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:27.440> what<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:27.769> is<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.070> once

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
unison okay and what that is is once

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.240 
unison okay and what that is is once
we've<00:03:29.390> tuned<00:03:29.720> one<00:03:29.989> string<00:03:30.440> per<00:03:30.650> note<00:03:30.860> we're

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
we've tuned one string per note we're

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.210 
we've tuned one string per note we're
going<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.400> go<00:03:31.580> through<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.030> tune<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:33.799> rest<00:03:34.010> of

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
going to go through and tune the rest of

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.690 
going to go through and tune the rest of
the<00:03:34.310> strings<00:03:34.900> as<00:03:35.900> you<00:03:36.140> can<00:03:36.260> see<00:03:36.470> most<00:03:36.709> most<00:03:37.459> of

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
the strings as you can see most most of

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.090 
the strings as you can see most most of
the<00:03:37.790> notes<00:03:37.970> have<00:03:38.269> three<00:03:38.630> strings<00:03:38.959> per<00:03:39.200> note<00:03:39.410> so

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
the notes have three strings per note so

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.610 
the notes have three strings per note so
if<00:03:40.160> we<00:03:40.250> just<00:03:40.430> do<00:03:40.580> one<00:03:40.820> then<00:03:41.780> we<00:03:42.290> have<00:03:42.380> to<00:03:42.500> go

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
if we just do one then we have to go

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.250 
if we just do one then we have to go
back<00:03:42.860> through<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:43.459> tune<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.209> other<00:03:44.570> two<00:03:44.930> for

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
back through and tune the other two for

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.190 
back through and tune the other two for
that<00:03:45.350> for<00:03:45.590> each<00:03:45.650> of<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.950> notes<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:48.019> then

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
that for each of the notes and then

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.140 
that for each of the notes and then
finally<00:03:48.739> we're<00:03:49.340> going<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.489> go<00:03:49.670> through<00:03:49.970> and

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
finally we're going to go through and

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.900 
finally we're going to go through and
tune<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:51.079> bass<00:03:51.260> section<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:52.070> the<00:03:52.670> high

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
tune the the bass section and the high

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.259 
tune the the bass section and the high
treble<00:03:53.209> section<00:03:53.810> in<00:03:54.049> the<00:03:54.230> last<00:03:54.470> video<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:56.030> by

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
treble section in the last video and by

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.759
