00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
this is my go anywhere rig I've been

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.230 
this is my go anywhere rig I've been
using<00:00:03.480> it<00:00:03.659> now<00:00:03.689> for<00:00:03.840> six<00:00:04.440> or<00:00:04.589> eight<00:00:04.710> years<00:00:05.240> I've

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
using it now for six or eight years I've

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.059 
using it now for six or eight years I've
tried<00:00:06.569> all<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.930> complicated<00:00:07.410> rigs<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.010> I've

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
tried all the complicated rigs and I've

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.620 
tried all the complicated rigs and I've
kind<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.429> come<00:00:08.580> back<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:09.059> area<00:00:09.480> it's

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
kind of come back to this area it's

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.160 
kind of come back to this area it's

curve on there and always use it with a
bottom<00:00:16.020> bait<00:00:16.230> I've<00:00:16.440> tried<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.859> with<00:00:16.890> little

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
bottom bait I've tried it with little

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.609 
bottom bait I've tried it with little

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
balance things and pop ups not on it but

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.050 
balance things and pop ups not on it but
for<00:00:19.830> some<00:00:19.980> reason<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.430> tend<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.730> pull<00:00:20.910> out<00:00:21.029> a

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
for some reason I tend to pull out a

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.700 
for some reason I tend to pull out a
fish<00:00:21.359> not<00:00:21.660> all<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> time<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.350> do<00:00:22.529> those

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
fish not all the time but you do those

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.679 
fish not all the time but you do those
fishermen<00:00:23.130> fishing<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.000> with<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.180> bottom<00:00:24.510> bite

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
fishermen fishing it with a bottom bite

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.290 
fishermen fishing it with a bottom bite
it<00:00:25.289> seems<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.710> nail<00:00:26.519> him<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.910> central<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
it seems to nail him in a central the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.210 
it seems to nail him in a central the
bottom<00:00:27.599> lip<00:00:27.750> every<00:00:27.990> time<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.470> very<00:00:28.769> very

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
bottom lip every time and very very

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.150 
bottom lip every time and very very
rarely<00:00:29.310> lose<00:00:29.849> fish<00:00:30.179> which<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.570> great<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
rarely lose fish which is great and the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.340 
rarely lose fish which is great and the
advantages<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.759> using<00:00:33.030> fluorocarbon<00:00:33.750> are

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
advantages to using fluorocarbon are

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.100 
advantages to using fluorocarbon are
that<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.309> mister<00:00:35.910> anti-tangle<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:36.930> kind

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
that you mister anti-tangle so it's kind

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.900 
that you mister anti-tangle so it's kind
of<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.260> got<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> semi<00:00:37.739> stiff<00:00:38.070> property<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.730> it

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
of like got a semi stiff property to it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.940 
of like got a semi stiff property to it
so<00:00:39.480> that's<00:00:39.600> obviously<00:00:39.840> great

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
so that's obviously great

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.590 
so that's obviously great
another<00:00:41.460> thing<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.910> obviously<00:00:42.210> being

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
another thing is obviously being

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.720 
another thing is obviously being
fluorocarbon<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.590> virtually<00:00:44.160> invisible<00:00:44.399> in

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
fluorocarbon it's virtually invisible in

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.790 
fluorocarbon it's virtually invisible in
water<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.899> doesn't<00:00:45.960> really<00:00:46.230> matter<00:00:46.469> what

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
water so it doesn't really matter what

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.100 
water so it doesn't really matter what
I'm<00:00:46.920> fishing<00:00:47.309> over<00:00:47.460> out<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> lake<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.020> I'm

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
I'm fishing over out in the lake so I'm

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.810 
I'm fishing over out in the lake so I'm
fishing<00:00:49.440> over<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.800> gravel<00:00:50.190> bottom<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.760> it

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
fishing over a gravel bottom and it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.090 
fishing over a gravel bottom and it
blends<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.329> I'm<00:00:52.170> fishing<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> silt<00:00:52.890> then

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
blends in I'm fishing in the silt then

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.130 
blends in I'm fishing in the silt then
it<00:00:53.219> blends<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.000> if<00:00:54.329> I'm<00:00:54.449> fishing<00:00:54.629> close<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
it blends in and if I'm fishing close to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.500 
it blends in and if I'm fishing close to
wade<00:00:55.379> then<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.710> blends<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.000> suits<00:00:57.300> my

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
wade then it blends in and it suits my

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.420 
wade then it blends in and it suits my
fish<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.960> there<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.829> know<00:00:58.949> roving<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
fish in there on you know roving the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.799 
fish in there on you know roving the
rods<00:00:59.670> about<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> lot<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.270> don't<00:01:00.539> know<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:00.719> I'm

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
rods about a lot I don't know what I'm

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.170 
rods about a lot I don't know what I'm
going<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:00.989> be<00:01:01.109> casting<00:01:01.469> over<00:01:01.680> next<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.789> this

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
going to be casting over next so this

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.260 
going to be casting over next so this
kind<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.870> know<00:01:03.989> helps<00:01:04.409> massively<00:01:05.270> it's

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
kind of you know helps massively it's

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.200 
kind of you know helps massively it's
very<00:01:06.630> very<00:01:06.930> simple<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.409> tie<00:01:07.909> basically<00:01:08.909> all<00:01:09.060> is

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
very very simple to tie basically all is

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.330 
very very simple to tie basically all is
what<00:01:09.330> I'm<00:01:09.450> doing<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.780> tying<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.229> loop<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.220> create

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
what I'm doing is tying a loop to create

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.670 
what I'm doing is tying a loop to create
a<00:01:11.549> hair<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> end<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.930> fluorocarbon

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
a hair in the end of the fluorocarbon

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.710 
a hair in the end of the fluorocarbon
and<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.729> thread<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> little<00:01:15.479> bit<00:01:15.630> of

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and then I thread on a little bit of

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660 
and then I thread on a little bit of
silicon<00:01:16.140> tube<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.650> I'm<00:01:16.740> gonna<00:01:17.159> thread<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
silicon tube that I'm gonna thread the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.300 
silicon tube that I'm gonna thread the
hook<00:01:17.790> onto<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.770> sits<00:01:19.770> at<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.950> bottom<00:01:20.220> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
hook onto and that sits at the bottom of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.300 
hook onto and that sits at the bottom of
the<00:01:20.400> shank<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.320> simple<00:01:22.320> knotless<00:01:22.619> knot<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.250> I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
the shank and simple knotless knot so I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.030 
the shank and simple knotless knot so I
sort<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.610> go<00:01:23.729> six<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.210> eight<00:01:24.360> turns<00:01:24.659> down<00:01:25.040> and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
sort of go six or eight turns down and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.980 
sort of go six or eight turns down and
then<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.310> come<00:01:26.549> what<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.210> tend<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.750> well<00:01:27.900> as

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
then I come what I tend to do as well as

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.719 
then I come what I tend to do as well as
come<00:01:28.229> round<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> not<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> couple<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.220> times<00:01:29.490> to

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
come round the not a couple of times to

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.539 
come round the not a couple of times to
stop<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.119> knot<00:01:30.299> from<00:01:30.420> slipping<00:01:31.310> comfort<00:01:32.310> hook

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
stop the knot from slipping comfort hook

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.359 
stop the knot from slipping comfort hook
back<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.880> from<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.810> then<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.710> tire<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
back to from and then I tire just a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.370 
back to from and then I tire just a
little<00:01:35.640> figure<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.180> eight<00:01:36.329> knot<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.140> end
