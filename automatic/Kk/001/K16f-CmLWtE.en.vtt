00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
be his final game in a Canucks uniform

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.789 
be his final game in a Canucks uniform
as<00:00:09.900> well<00:00:10.139> he's<00:00:10.830> an<00:00:11.010> unrestricted<00:00:11.580> free<00:00:11.790> agent

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
as well he's an unrestricted free agent

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.259 
as well he's an unrestricted free agent
following<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:14.219> season<00:00:14.730> there's

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
following this season there's

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.500 
following this season there's
speculation<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:16.430> the<00:00:17.430> cup<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.970> hockey<00:00:18.150> club

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
speculation that the cup the hockey club

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.560 
speculation that the cup the hockey club
I<00:00:18.600> should<00:00:18.810> say<00:00:19.189> doesn't<00:00:20.189> plan<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.670> resign<00:00:21.300> him

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
I should say doesn't plan to resign him

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.890 
I should say doesn't plan to resign him
so<00:00:22.199> Naslund<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.890> free<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.250> go<00:00:23.400> wherever<00:00:23.640> he<00:00:23.900> he

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
so Naslund is free to go wherever he he

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.200 
so Naslund is free to go wherever he he
chooses<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.590> think<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.130> there<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.150> be

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
chooses I think so there is going to be

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.750 
chooses I think so there is going to be
a<00:00:27.330> real<00:00:27.750> change<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.590> think<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> dynamics

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
a real change I think in the dynamics

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.840 
a real change I think in the dynamics
the<00:00:30.210> personality<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.759> transition<00:00:32.759> of

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the personality and the transition of

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.080 
the personality and the transition of
leadership<00:00:33.079> with<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.320> hockey<00:00:34.590> club<00:00:35.010> if<00:00:35.940> you

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.500 
certainly think so I mean he was the
coach<00:04:51.440> of<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.770> year<00:04:51.950> last<00:04:52.220> year<00:04:52.510> obviously

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
coach of the year last year obviously

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.180
