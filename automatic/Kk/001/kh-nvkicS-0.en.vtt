00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
not be a whole lot of room that means

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.280 
not be a whole lot of room that means
we've<00:01:13.740> had<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.189> resource<00:01:14.909> our<00:01:15.330> speaker<00:01:16.049> line

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
we've had to resource our speaker line

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.210 
we've had to resource our speaker line
and<00:01:16.680> we've<00:01:17.640> been<00:01:17.850> testing<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.110> series<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.040> new

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and we've been testing a a series of new

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.999 
and we've been testing a a series of new
speakers<00:01:20.729> over<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.330> last<00:01:21.540> year<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.200> different

arrangement of different enclosures in
order<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.860> really<00:01:59.100> capture<00:01:59.549> what<00:01:59.939> these

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
order to really capture what these

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.510 
order to really capture what these
little<00:02:00.360> speakers<00:02:00.719> can<00:02:01.140> do<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.619> if<00:02:02.369> you're

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
little speakers can do and if you're

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.499 
little speakers can do and if you're
familiar<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.600> old<00:02:04.130> TDS<00:02:05.130> mini<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.880> micro

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
familiar with the old TDS mini and micro

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.130 
familiar with the old TDS mini and micro
ovals<00:02:07.550> these<00:02:08.550> are<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.140> significant

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
ovals these are a significant

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.160 
ovals these are a significant
improvement<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.830> fact<00:02:11.280> we've<00:02:11.720> not<00:02:12.720> only<00:02:12.750> to

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
improvement in fact we've not only to

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.760 
improvement in fact we've not only to
our<00:02:13.319> ear

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
our ear

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.760 
our ear
but<00:02:13.920> we<00:02:14.130> are<00:02:14.400> measuring<00:02:14.940> these

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
but we are measuring these

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
but we are measuring these
scientifically<00:02:16.770> yes<00:02:17.010> I'm<00:02:17.190> using<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.640> word

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
scientifically yes I'm using that word

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.430 
scientifically yes I'm using that word
scientifically<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:18.960> we<00:02:19.920> have<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.430> nearly<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:21.440> 30%

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
scientifically is we have a nearly a 30%

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.020 
scientifically is we have a nearly a 30%
increase<00:02:22.940> in<00:02:23.940> total<00:02:24.800> total<00:02:25.800> quality<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.520> at

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
increase in total total quality and at

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.950 
increase in total total quality and at
least<00:02:27.390> two<00:02:27.840> octaves<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:29.300> improved<00:02:30.300> sound

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
least two octaves of improved sound

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.670 
least two octaves of improved sound
quality<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:31.710> a<00:02:32.810> big<00:02:33.810> difference<00:02:34.230> in<00:02:34.350> how<00:02:34.470> these

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
quality so a big difference in how these

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.760 
quality so a big difference in how these
little<00:02:34.920> baby<00:02:35.100> sound<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:36.350> basically<00:02:37.350> the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
little baby sound and basically the

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.980 
little baby sound and basically the
bigger<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.250> enclosure<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.850> get<00:02:39.270> with<00:02:39.870> the

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
bigger the enclosure you get with the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.260 
bigger the enclosure you get with the
same<00:02:40.200> size<00:02:40.500> speaker<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.670> can<00:02:41.700> really

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
same size speaker you can really

00:02:42.270 --> 00:05:54.720 
same size speaker you can really
maximize<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:43.290> sound

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.880 

okay<00:05:55.730> guys<00:05:55.940> for<00:05:56.330> those<00:05:56.900> of<00:05:57.110> you<00:05:57.230> who<00:05:57.440> are<00:05:57.530> a<00:05:57.590> fan
