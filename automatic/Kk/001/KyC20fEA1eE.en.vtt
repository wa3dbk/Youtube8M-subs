00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.940 
that that rag I can kind of use it as a
bull<00:02:16.360> cape<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.870> let<00:02:16.990> them<00:02:17.110> fight<00:02:17.350> that<00:02:17.620> for<00:02:17.920> a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
bull cape and let them fight that for a

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.410 
bull cape and let them fight that for a
couple<00:02:18.310> minutes<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.730> then<00:02:18.910> just<00:02:19.090> throw<00:02:19.300> it

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
couple minutes and then just throw it

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.210 
couple minutes and then just throw it
over<00:02:19.510> their<00:02:19.780> head<00:02:19.990> and<00:02:20.170> they<00:02:20.260> really<00:02:20.830> settle

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
over their head and they really settle

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.150 
over their head and they really settle
down<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.790> then<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:23.140> way<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.320> don't<00:02:23.530> get<00:02:23.860> bit

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
down and then that way I don't get bit

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.020 
down and then that way I don't get bit
and<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:25.750> don't<00:02:26.709> know<00:02:26.950> if<00:02:27.130> it's<00:02:27.310> really<00:02:27.580> good<00:02:27.760> for

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
and I don't know if it's really good for

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.120 
and I don't know if it's really good for
their<00:02:28.150> temperament<00:02:28.750> but<00:02:29.050> that's<00:02:29.800> what<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.070> do

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130
