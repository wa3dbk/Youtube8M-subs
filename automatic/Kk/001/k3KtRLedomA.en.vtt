00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
sort of peering through there on the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.780 
sort of peering through there on the
bottom<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.030> really<00:01:51.930> no<00:01:52.049> big<00:01:52.229> deal<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.790> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
bottom but really no big deal and the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.160 
bottom but really no big deal and the
thing<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.030> really<00:01:54.329> do<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.570> about<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.930> case

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
thing I really do like about this case

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.550 
thing I really do like about this case
is<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.500> hardly<00:01:55.770> adds<00:01:56.009> any<00:01:56.310> size<00:01:56.880> or<00:01:57.329> bulk<00:01:58.320> to

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
is it hardly adds any size or bulk to

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.010 
is it hardly adds any size or bulk to
your<00:01:58.590> iPhone<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.030> can<00:02:00.180> fit<00:02:00.210> very<00:02:00.570> easily<00:02:00.750> in

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
your iPhone so it can fit very easily in

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.359 
your iPhone so it can fit very easily in
a<00:02:01.079> pocket<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:01.829> don't<00:02:01.950> even<00:02:02.219> notice

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
a pocket and you just don't even notice

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.060 
a pocket and you just don't even notice
it<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.420> iphone<00:02:03.719> doesn't<00:02:03.930> seem<00:02:04.200> any<00:02:04.350> bigger<00:02:04.740> or

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
it the iphone doesn't seem any bigger or

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.570 
it the iphone doesn't seem any bigger or
anything<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.909> then<00:02:06.240> stock<00:02:07.340> now<00:02:08.340> as<00:02:08.520> you

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
anything like that then stock now as you

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.249 
anything like that then stock now as you
can<00:02:08.729> see<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.090> top<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.569> pretty<00:02:09.810> much<00:02:09.959> fully

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
can see the top is pretty much fully

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.920 
can see the top is pretty much fully
open<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> corners<00:02:11.099> are<00:02:11.370> protected<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.270> as

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
open the corners are protected so and as

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.850 
open the corners are protected so and as
you<00:02:13.050> can<00:02:13.170> see<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.410> buttons<00:02:13.680> he

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
you can see the buttons he

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.880 
you can see the buttons he
are<00:02:13.950> also<00:02:14.100> exposed<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.820> side<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:16.680> does

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
are also exposed on the side it does

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.470 
are also exposed on the side it does
have<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.100> bit<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.490> lay<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.970> table<00:02:18.000> design

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
have a bit of a lay on the table design

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
have a bit of a lay on the table design
I<00:02:18.510> don't<00:02:18.810> know<00:02:18.900> if<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.050> can<00:02:19.140> see<00:02:19.320> in<00:02:19.410> this

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
I don't know if you can see in this

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.040 
I don't know if you can see in this
video<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:20.010> right<00:02:20.430> here<00:02:20.820> there<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.690> slight

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
video but right here there is a slight

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.710 
video but right here there is a slight
raised<00:02:22.410> part<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.160> if<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.150> like<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.450> do<00:02:24.570> what<00:02:24.690> I

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
raised part so if you like to do what I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.110 
raised part so if you like to do what I
do<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.260> often<00:02:25.740> put<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.370> phone<00:02:26.610> down<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:27.090> a

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
do and often put the phone down on a

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.390 
do and often put the phone down on a
table<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.750> flat<00:02:28.140> down<00:02:28.410> like<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.250> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
table like flat down like that so the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.580 
table like flat down like that so the
screen<00:02:29.580> doesn't<00:02:29.970> get<00:02:30.090> dusty<00:02:30.570> or<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:31.410> know<00:02:31.500> on

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
screen doesn't get dusty or you know on

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.490 
screen doesn't get dusty or you know on
a<00:02:31.620> couch<00:02:31.860> or<00:02:32.160> something<00:02:32.370> like<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:34.020> know

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
a couch or something like that you know

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.410 
a couch or something like that you know
the<00:02:34.710> you're<00:02:35.040> not<00:02:35.190> lying<00:02:35.460> it<00:02:35.670> directly<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.270> the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
the you're not lying it directly on the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.880 
the you're not lying it directly on the
screen<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:36.990> that's<00:02:37.350> really<00:02:37.500> nice<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:40.680> case

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
screen so that's really nice the case

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.400 
screen so that's really nice the case
seems<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.370> fit<00:02:41.520> very<00:02:41.730> well<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.209> it's<00:02:42.480> not<00:02:43.230> a

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
seems to fit very well and it's not a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.199 
seems to fit very well and it's not a
rubbery<00:02:43.830> material<00:02:44.100> it's<00:02:44.610> just<00:02:44.820> sort<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.090> a

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
rubbery material it's just sort of a

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.670 
rubbery material it's just sort of a
plastic<00:02:45.630> material<00:02:46.020> so<00:02:46.110> it's<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.290> little<00:02:46.500> bit

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
plastic material so it's a little bit

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.400 
plastic material so it's a little bit
slippery<00:02:47.070> it's<00:02:47.250> not<00:02:47.400> rubbery<00:02:47.840> but<00:02:48.840> it's

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
slippery it's not rubbery but it's

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.760 
slippery it's not rubbery but it's
definitely<00:02:49.680> still<00:02:50.400> more<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.510> holdable<00:02:52.380> than

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
definitely still more and holdable than

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.520 
definitely still more and holdable than
the<00:02:53.580> iphone<00:02:53.910> without<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.239> case<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.989> iphone<00:02:55.350> 5

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
the iphone without a case the iphone 5

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.110 
the iphone without a case the iphone 5
without<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.890> case<00:02:56.160> tends<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.670> feel<00:02:56.820> quite

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
without a case tends to feel quite

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.360 
without a case tends to feel quite
slippery<00:02:57.650> whereas<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:58.770> gives<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.100> little

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
slippery whereas this gives you a little

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.940 
slippery whereas this gives you a little
bit<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.730> grip<00:03:00.110> certainly<00:03:01.110> not<00:03:01.260> rubber<00:03:01.620> or

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
bit of a grip certainly not rubber or

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.320 
bit of a grip certainly not rubber or
silicone<00:03:02.400> but<00:03:03.260> definitely<00:03:04.260> some<00:03:04.650> grip<00:03:05.040> and

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
silicone but definitely some grip and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.400 
silicone but definitely some grip and
also<00:03:06.330> it's<00:03:06.450> protecting<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.989> back<00:03:07.170> from

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
also it's protecting the back from

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.930 
also it's protecting the back from
scratches<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:07.890> all<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.280> kind<00:03:08.459> of<00:03:08.520> stuff<00:03:08.580> too

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
scratches and all that kind of stuff too

so hasn't really been a problem for me
in<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.600> past<00:03:22.280> so<00:03:23.280> I'm<00:03:23.580> planning<00:03:23.730> not<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.090> put<00:03:24.450> a

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
in the past so I'm planning not to put a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.030 
in the past so I'm planning not to put a
screen<00:03:24.720> protector<00:03:24.870> on<00:03:25.320> this<00:03:25.620> or<00:03:25.830> anything

like<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.790> should<00:03:26.970> be<00:03:27.000> fine<00:03:27.269> again<00:03:27.810> it

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
like that and it should be fine again it

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.830 
like that and it should be fine again it
does<00:03:28.200> have<00:03:28.410> that<00:03:28.590> Ridge<00:03:28.920> on<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.310> edge<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:30.810> that

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
does have that Ridge on the edge so that

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.440 
does have that Ridge on the edge so that
does<00:03:31.230> sort<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.590> protect<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.010> screen<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.310> bit<00:03:32.580> so

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
does sort of protect the screen a bit so

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.000 
does sort of protect the screen a bit so
all<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:33.780> all<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:33.900> think<00:03:34.049> this<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.470> great<00:03:34.709> case

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010
