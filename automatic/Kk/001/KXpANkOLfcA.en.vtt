00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
the energy he's stealing for a

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.300 
the energy he's stealing for a
mind-control<00:00:22.550> weapon<00:00:23.589> not<00:00:24.589> one<00:00:24.830> the<00:00:24.949> hard<00:00:25.160> way

seem<00:00:40.010> right<00:00:40.070> with<00:00:40.340> that<00:00:40.370> that's<00:00:41.120> what<00:00:41.420> I<00:00:41.450> said

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
seem right with that that's what I said

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.250 
seem right with that that's what I said
it<00:00:42.200> made<00:00:42.470> no<00:00:42.770> sense<00:00:43.150> then<00:00:44.150> I<00:00:44.420> made<00:00:44.780> a<00:00:44.810> tiny

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
it made no sense then I made a tiny

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.730 
it made no sense then I made a tiny
adjustment<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:46.280> realized<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.180> same

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
adjustment and realized the same

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.390 
adjustment and realized the same
generators<00:00:49.210> so<00:00:50.210> no<00:00:50.750> burps<00:00:51.070> well<00:00:52.070> that's<00:00:52.250> a

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
generators so no burps well that's a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.970 
generators so no burps well that's a
relief<00:00:52.520> tell<00:00:53.210> me<00:00:53.420> about<00:00:53.510> it<00:00:53.720> so<00:00:54.590> basically

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
relief tell me about it so basically

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.550 
relief tell me about it so basically
dead<00:00:55.520> man<00:00:55.850> is<00:00:56.030> using<00:00:56.360> five<00:00:56.660> tractor<00:00:57.380> beam

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
dead man is using five tractor beam

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.740 
dead man is using five tractor beam
generators<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:58.610> hold<00:00:58.850> their<00:00:59.030> planet<00:00:59.450> in<00:00:59.510> orbit

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
generators to hold their planet in orbit

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.490 
generators to hold their planet in orbit
while<00:01:00.020> he<00:01:00.140> scoops<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.860> aliens<00:01:01.250> all<00:01:01.430> up<00:01:02.500> the

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
while he scoops the aliens all up the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.280 
while he scoops the aliens all up the
whole<00:01:03.800> planet<00:01:04.189> well<00:01:04.909> it's<00:01:05.089> tiny<00:01:05.479> but<00:01:05.840> still

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
whole planet well it's tiny but still

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.239 
whole planet well it's tiny but still
yeah<00:01:06.770> okay<00:01:07.549> fine<00:01:07.630> five<00:01:08.630> generators<00:01:09.289> well<00:01:10.130> I've

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:10.249 
yeah okay fine five generators well I've

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:12.609 
yeah okay fine five generators well I've
already<00:01:10.399> leveled<00:01:10.909> too<00:01:11.149> so<00:01:11.719> if<00:01:12.079> my<00:01:12.380> math<00:01:12.590> is

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
already leveled too so if my math is

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.219 
already leveled too so if my math is
correct<00:01:12.890> that<00:01:13.729> loses<00:01:14.149> three<00:01:14.539> more<00:01:14.899> there<00:01:15.140> was

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
correct that loses three more there was

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.340 
correct that loses three more there was
a<00:01:15.259> bad<00:01:15.469> boy

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
a bad boy

nobody<00:01:17.189> said<00:01:17.430> there'd<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.700> math<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:18.240> I'm<00:01:18.509> with

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
nobody said there'd be math but I'm with

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.690 
nobody said there'd be math but I'm with
you<00:01:18.840> buddy<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.500> should<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.770> moving<00:01:19.950> yeah

soon the mind-control weapon will be

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.520 
soon the mind-control weapon will be
full<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.060> energy<00:01:36.240> i<00:01:36.509> siphoned<00:01:37.259> from<00:01:37.320> the
