infinity money glitch third thing though

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:47.820 
infinity money glitch third thing though
is<00:05:46.600> once<00:05:46.930> you<00:05:47.050> switch<00:05:47.260> over<00:05:47.500> to<00:05:47.530> your<00:05:47.680> other

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
is once you switch over to your other

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.530 
is once you switch over to your other
character<00:05:48.310> you<00:05:48.460> won't<00:05:48.790> have<00:05:48.970> the<00:05:49.210> money<00:05:49.240> on

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.210 
character you won't have the money on
him<00:05:49.750> or<00:05:50.199> just<00:05:50.440> have<00:05:50.590> it<00:05:50.620> on<00:05:50.800> the<00:05:50.919> character

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
him or just have it on the character

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.520 
him or just have it on the character
that<00:05:51.370> you're<00:05:51.490> doing<00:05:51.610> the<00:05:51.760> glitch<00:05:51.970> for<00:05:52.290> you<00:05:53.290> can

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
that you're doing the glitch for you can

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.770 
that you're doing the glitch for you can
do<00:05:53.710> the<00:05:53.860> glitch<00:05:54.040> for<00:05:54.280> both<00:05:54.460> characters<00:05:54.970> but

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
do the glitch for both characters but

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.530 
do the glitch for both characters but
you<00:05:56.139> can<00:05:56.889> like<00:05:57.370> I<00:05:57.520> think<00:05:57.940> you<00:05:58.030> can<00:05:58.180> only<00:05:58.270> do<00:05:58.449> it

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
you can like I think you can only do it

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.080 
you can like I think you can only do it
once<00:05:58.780> I<00:05:59.139> haven't<00:05:59.500> tried<00:05:59.680> because<00:06:00.430> like<00:06:00.699> after

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
once I haven't tried because like after

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.939 
once I haven't tried because like after
after<00:06:01.930> you<00:06:01.990> don't<00:06:02.169> load<00:06:02.380> the<00:06:02.560> character<00:06:02.919> I

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
after you don't load the character I

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.379 
after you don't load the character I
think<00:06:03.010> it<00:06:03.340> like<00:06:03.669> disappears
