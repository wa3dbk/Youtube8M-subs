think slightly disappointing

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.460 
think slightly disappointing
oh<00:02:03.470> no<00:02:04.100> why<00:02:04.340> um<00:02:05.060> it's<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.540> engine<00:02:05.870> i<00:02:06.110> think

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
oh no why um it's the engine i think

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.020 
oh no why um it's the engine i think
there's<00:02:06.650> either<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.920> fault<00:02:07.280> with<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.670> fueling

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
there's either a fault with the fueling

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.850 
there's either a fault with the fueling
or<00:02:08.300> something<00:02:08.900> but<00:02:09.050> it's<00:02:09.170> just<00:02:09.320> not<00:02:09.500> revving

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
or something but it's just not revving

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.030 
or something but it's just not revving
cleanly<00:02:10.480> it<00:02:11.480> seems<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.140> idles<00:02:12.500> nicely<00:02:12.860> and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
cleanly it seems to it idles nicely and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.530 
cleanly it seems to it idles nicely and
then<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.220> jumps<00:02:13.520> yeah<00:02:14.000> when<00:02:14.240> you're<00:02:14.360> putting

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
then it jumps yeah when you're putting

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.150 
then it jumps yeah when you're putting
the<00:02:14.660> power<00:02:14.870> on<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.260> since<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.800> shutter<00:02:16.040> and

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
the power on it since the shutter and

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.520 
the power on it since the shutter and
then<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.490> goes<00:02:16.910> through<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:18.080> it's<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.320> tad

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
then it goes through it so it's a tad

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.010 
then it goes through it so it's a tad
disconcerting<00:02:19.340> oh<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:20.180> disappointing<00:02:20.840> like
