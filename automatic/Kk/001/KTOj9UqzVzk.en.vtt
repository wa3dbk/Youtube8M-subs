the<00:00:50.140> bend<00:00:50.350> will<00:00:50.500> get<00:00:50.620> stinky<00:00:54.300> now<00:00:55.300> they<00:00:55.510> will

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
the bend will get stinky now they will

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.330 
the bend will get stinky now they will
try<00:00:55.930> and<00:00:55.960> catch<00:00:56.140> right<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.710> next<00:00:57.040> thing<00:00:57.220> we

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
try and catch right the next thing we

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.450 
try and catch right the next thing we
need<00:00:57.370> to<00:00:57.580> do<00:00:57.850> is<00:00:58.059> fold<00:00:58.360> it<00:00:58.540> flat<00:00:58.690> like<00:00:59.050> this<00:00:59.460> how

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
need to do is fold it flat like this how

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.020 
need to do is fold it flat like this how
come

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
come

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.119 
come
folding<00:01:01.809> that<00:01:01.930> makes<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.290> much<00:01:02.530> smaller<00:01:02.890> and

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
folding that makes a much smaller and

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.040 
folding that makes a much smaller and
seals<00:01:03.370> them<00:01:03.580> shut<00:01:03.820> first<00:01:04.300> means<00:01:04.510> we<00:01:04.720> can<00:01:04.869> fit

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
seals them shut first means we can fit

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.170 
seals them shut first means we can fit
twice<00:01:05.260> as<00:01:05.470> many<00:01:05.590> in<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:05.860> recycling<00:01:06.340> bin<00:01:06.399> then

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
twice as many in the recycling bin then

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.550 
twice as many in the recycling bin then
they<00:01:07.360> don't<00:01:07.540> have<00:01:07.690> to<00:01:07.840> be<00:01:08.050> taken<00:01:08.440> away

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
they don't have to be taken away

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.160 
they don't have to be taken away
softened<00:01:09.340> and<00:01:09.550> that<00:01:09.790> means<00:01:10.090> we<00:01:10.270> save<00:01:10.479> energy

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
softened and that means we save energy

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.730 
softened and that means we save energy
so<00:01:11.979> how<00:01:12.850> do<00:01:12.910> we<00:01:13.390> fold<00:01:13.810> it<00:01:13.990> it's<00:01:14.350> just<00:01:14.560> like

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
so how do we fold it it's just like

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:47.580 
so how do we fold it it's just like
origami<00:01:15.130> oh<00:01:15.460> I<00:01:16.119> am<00:01:16.960> awesome<00:01:17.440> at<00:01:18.040> origami
