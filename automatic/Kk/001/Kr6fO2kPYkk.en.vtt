00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.510
 hi and drop it and us right now 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.090
 we are in the new congress where we have 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.099
 presented the sony xperia z 2 that what 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.410
 we have in front of us and today we go 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.689
 to do a little review the new sony 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.849
 xperia z 2 brings some new features 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.020
 most are an evolution of those of 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.250
 zeta 1 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.560
 now we have a bigger screen 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.290
 specifically 5.2 inches with 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.360
 ips technology that as we're going to see 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.149
 right now it offers us some colors 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.590
 incredible here is very well appreciated as 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.309
 The colors are bright and very 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.620
 authentic 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.330
 besides we turn the phone we go to 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.790
 discover an angle perspective 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.620
 excellent that allows us to see the 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.780
 screen from any angle 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.340
 talking about other specifications of 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.430
 hardware we have a qualcomm processor 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.129
 snapdragon 801 from 4 cores to 2 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.410
 gigahertz combined with 3 gigabytes of 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.710
 ram an increase considering that the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.750
 xperia z1 brought 2 gigabytes too 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.070
 let's find a bigger battery 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.080
 of 3200 milliamps another novelty is the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.540
 inclusion of stereo speakers in the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.610
 bottom and top review 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.580
 hesperia z 2 is also thinner and more 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.030
 light 70 grams less and specifically 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.410
 It is 71 millimeters thick 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.539
 if we talk about design it has been achieved 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.460
 that the smartphone is softer 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.310
 hold on hands and of course more 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.840
 Easy to hold in one hand before 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.159
 talk about software functions it 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.640
 I forgot to say that the camera 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.720
 main one has 20.7 megapixels and in the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.640
 front is 2 megapixels the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.850
 camera is capable of recording video in 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.909
 4k quality among other functions 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.679
 we have the call of fields that what 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.620
 does is that the object that we have in 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:52.350
 close-up appear more focused 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.780
 in the background it really is not appreciated 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.210
 very well the effect in this image but 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.440
 good is a great novelty of the camera 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.680
 from sonic 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.110
 Now let's play a video in 4k 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.080
 a moment that you have to look for it 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.610
 we have the quality can not be appreciated 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.680
 since the screen is not a 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.930
 television but if we zoom it can be 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.490
 appreciate all the details in this case 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.710
 the figure of 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.500
 sand of course can be reproduced 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.640
 the image and we move from this zoom 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.640
 to the area that we want 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.950
 are and repeats with the reality function 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.630
 increased from the camera though now 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.690
 It can also be used in videos 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.580
 we choose the famous one with the dinosaur and 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.040
 Also new is that now 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.410
 can move the set as the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.270
 palms 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.190
 Here we have other applications 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.870
 relating to the camera and of course 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.540
 you can also access the camera with 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.730
 the screen off from this button 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.519
 which also allows us to take photos 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.950
 under the water because once again the 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.150
 xperia z 2 is resistant to water and 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.730
 powder 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.640
 to finish remember that the z 2 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.489
 run android 4.4 kitkat and that has 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.860
 16 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.270
 expandable through micro sd up to 64 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.670
 gigabytes 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.100
 on this side we have the connections for 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.560
 a parking dock that can be 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.240
 used to recharge it and so not 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.280
 we will have to open this stage for the 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.380
 USB port 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.850
 this is all I hope you liked 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.590
 our analysis of sony xperia 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.170
 accepted and of course do not hesitate 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.580
 explain and tell us what you think 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.650
 this device in the comments of 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.860
 down more information on android point 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.860
