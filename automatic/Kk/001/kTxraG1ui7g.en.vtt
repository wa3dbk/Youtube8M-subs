okay<00:00:14.140> everyone<00:00:14.590> today<00:00:15.220> we're<00:00:15.460> going<00:00:15.550> to

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.640 
okay everyone today we're going to

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.060 
okay everyone today we're going to
finish<00:00:15.880> our<00:00:16.150> study<00:00:16.480> of<00:00:16.570> closed<00:00:17.260> position

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
finish our study of closed position

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.910 
finish our study of closed position
tried<00:00:18.760> inversions<00:00:19.480> with<00:00:20.170> the<00:00:20.320> Augmented

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
tried inversions with the Augmented

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.510 
tried inversions with the Augmented
triad

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
triad

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.720 
triad
now<00:00:22.000> this<00:00:22.180> triads<00:00:22.570> gonna<00:00:22.779> sound<00:00:23.050> pretty

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
now this triads gonna sound pretty

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.450 
now this triads gonna sound pretty
dissonant<00:00:24.730> but<00:00:25.180> it<00:00:25.300> is<00:00:25.420> it's<00:00:25.930> the<00:00:26.170> by<00:00:27.099> far<00:00:27.340> the

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
dissonant but it is it's the by far the

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.819 
dissonant but it is it's the by far the
least<00:00:27.670> used<00:00:28.000> triad<00:00:28.390> but<00:00:29.230> when<00:00:29.380> we<00:00:29.500> stacked

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829 
least used triad but when we stacked

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.530 
least used triad but when we stacked
them<00:00:30.070> on<00:00:30.250> top<00:00:30.340> of<00:00:30.640> other<00:00:30.790> tribes<00:00:31.000> we<00:00:31.300> were<00:00:31.360> able

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
them on top of other tribes we were able

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.640 
them on top of other tribes we were able
to<00:00:31.689> court

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
to court

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.090 
to court
kind<00:00:33.579> of<00:00:33.700> create<00:00:34.180> these<00:00:34.620> larger<00:00:35.620> arpeggio

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
kind of create these larger arpeggio

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.040 
kind of create these larger arpeggio
forms<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.860> emphasize<00:00:39.670> larger<00:00:40.149> scale<00:00:40.390> larger

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
forms that emphasize larger scale larger

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.240 
forms that emphasize larger scale larger
chord<00:00:41.320> forms<00:00:42.070> like<00:00:42.310> 13s<00:00:43.239> and<00:00:43.390> elevenths<00:00:43.989> and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
chord forms like 13s and elevenths and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.279 
chord forms like 13s and elevenths and
some<00:00:45.250> altered<00:00:45.640> chord<00:00:45.879> forms<00:00:46.180> so<00:00:46.390> they're<00:00:46.899> very

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
some altered chord forms so they're very

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.900 
some altered chord forms so they're very
important<00:00:47.769> for<00:00:47.859> soloing<00:00:48.519> and<00:00:48.910> for<00:00:49.629> chords

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
important for soloing and for chords

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.860 
important for soloing and for chords
chord<00:00:51.910> building<00:00:52.269> and<00:00:52.420> everything<00:00:52.660> that<00:00:52.780> we're

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
chord building and everything that we're

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.919 
chord building and everything that we're
going<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.019> be<00:00:53.140> doing<00:00:53.230> in<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.500> future<00:00:53.649> so<00:00:54.929> but

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 
going to be doing in the future so but

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.020 
going to be doing in the future so but
the<00:00:56.500> bright<00:00:56.710> side<00:00:56.949> is<00:00:57.100> they're<00:00:57.370> very<00:00:57.399> easy<00:00:57.879> to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
the bright side is they're very easy to

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.279 
the bright side is they're very easy to
learn<00:00:58.149> there's<00:00:58.420> literally<00:00:58.750> only<00:00:58.899> three

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
learn there's literally only three

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.470 
learn there's literally only three
shapes<00:00:59.620> to<00:01:00.010> be<00:01:00.129> able<00:01:00.250> to<00:01:00.399> do<00:01:00.550> everything<00:01:01.239> that

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
shapes to be able to do everything that

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.530 
shapes to be able to do everything that
we<00:01:01.600> were<00:01:01.719> doing<00:01:01.870> with<00:01:02.249> the<00:01:03.249> minor<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.879> major

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
we were doing with the minor the major

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.290 
we were doing with the minor the major
and<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.140> diminished<00:01:05.620> that's<00:01:06.190> why<00:01:06.370> because<00:01:06.610> an

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
and the diminished that's why because an

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.050 
and the diminished that's why because an
Augmented<00:01:07.840> triad<00:01:07.870> divides<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.950> octave<00:01:09.460> into

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
Augmented triad divides the octave into

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.840 
Augmented triad divides the octave into
equal<00:01:10.480> parts<00:01:11.100> everything's<00:01:12.100> a<00:01:12.220> major<00:01:12.460> third

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
equal parts everything's a major third

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.000 
equal parts everything's a major third
away<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:13.540> if<00:01:13.659> we<00:01:13.810> started<00:01:14.080> with<00:01:14.140> a<00:01:14.260> root<00:01:14.470> note<00:01:14.710> I

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
away so if we started with a root note I

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.290 
away so if we started with a root note I
made<00:01:15.760> your<00:01:16.540> third<00:01:16.660> up<00:01:17.760> it<00:01:18.760> would<00:01:18.880> be<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.090> one

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
made your third up it would be the one

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.560 
made your third up it would be the one
within<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.200> three<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:20.710> then<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:21.820> raised

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
within the three and then the raised

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.410 
within the three and then the raised
fifth<00:01:22.990> sharp<00:01:23.650> five<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:25.000> another<00:01:25.210> major

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
fifth sharp five it's another major

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.840 
fifth sharp five it's another major
third<00:01:25.750> up<00:01:25.930> and<00:01:26.200> then<00:01:26.890> another<00:01:27.160> major<00:01:27.460> third<00:01:27.700> up

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
third up and then another major third up

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.020 
third up and then another major third up
from<00:01:27.880> that<00:01:28.090> sharp<00:01:28.300> 5<00:01:28.540> is<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:30.040> root<00:01:30.070> again<00:01:30.520> so

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
from that sharp 5 is the root again so

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.140 
from that sharp 5 is the root again so
you<00:01:31.120> can<00:01:31.240> see<00:01:31.450> it<00:01:31.630> basically<00:01:32.940> divides<00:01:33.940> the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
you can see it basically divides the

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.980 
you can see it basically divides the
octave<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:35.250> two<00:01:36.250> equal<00:01:36.520> parts

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
octave and two equal parts

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.840 
octave and two equal parts
therefore<00:01:37.990> this<00:01:38.350> shape<00:01:38.620> is<00:01:38.860> symmetrical<00:01:39.700> as

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
therefore this shape is symmetrical as

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.990 
therefore this shape is symmetrical as
you<00:01:40.000> take<00:01:40.180> it<00:01:40.330> across<00:01:40.660> the<00:01:40.990> neck<00:01:41.760> there<00:01:42.760> it<00:01:42.910> is

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
you take it across the neck there it is

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.870 
you take it across the neck there it is
on<00:01:43.150> a<00:01:43.300> the<00:01:43.330> root<00:01:43.690> note<00:01:43.900> C<00:01:44.710> sharp<00:01:45.040> is<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.550> third

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
on a the root note C sharp is the third

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.440 
on a the root note C sharp is the third
same<00:01:46.720> shape<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.640> first<00:01:48.850> inversion<00:01:49.090> shapes

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
same shape so the first inversion shapes

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.630 
same shape so the first inversion shapes
the<00:01:49.600> same<00:01:49.780> as<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:50.020> root<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.500> so<00:01:51.400> is<00:01:51.550> the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
the same as the root and so is the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.320 
the same as the root and so is the
second<00:01:51.940> inversion<00:01:52.150> shape<00:01:52.420> on<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.720> e<00:01:52.750> sharp<00:01:54.330> so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
second inversion shape on the e sharp so

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:03.080 
second inversion shape on the e sharp so
we<00:01:55.420> have<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:56.490> C<00:01:57.490> sharp<00:01:58.110> C<00:01:59.110> sharp<00:01:59.910> back<00:02:00.910> ta

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
we have a C sharp C sharp back ta

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.730 
we have a C sharp C sharp back ta
so<00:02:04.090> of<00:02:04.480> course<00:02:04.840> this<00:02:05.020> is<00:02:05.140> going<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.410> stay<00:02:05.590> the

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
so of course this is going to stay the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.640 
so of course this is going to stay the
same<00:02:05.770> force<00:02:06.610> resets<00:02:07.030> three<00:02:07.330> through<00:02:07.570> five

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
same force resets three through five

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.960 
same force resets three through five
just<00:02:08.650> follow<00:02:08.860> along<00:02:09.070> in<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.460> paper<00:02:09.640> I'm<00:02:09.850> going

not an open string to where we can

actually play the form we do have an
open<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.530> but<00:02:20.800> we<00:02:20.920> can't<00:02:21.160> play<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.520> form<00:02:21.730> off<00:02:21.880> of

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
open a but we can't play the form off of

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.850 
open a but we can't play the form off of
that<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:22.840> we<00:02:22.960> have<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.140> start<00:02:23.350> with<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.470> c-sharp

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
that so we have to start with a c-sharp

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.220 
that so we have to start with a c-sharp
so<00:02:24.850> theoretically<00:02:25.330> even<00:02:25.900> though<00:02:25.960> all<00:02:26.110> the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
so theoretically even though all the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.400 
so theoretically even though all the
shapes<00:02:26.440> are<00:02:26.560> same<00:02:26.710> in<00:02:26.950> almost<00:02:27.130> any<00:02:27.520> of<00:02:27.730> these

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
shapes are same in almost any of these

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.570 
shapes are same in almost any of these
notes<00:02:29.410> in<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.650> quarter<00:02:29.920> can<00:02:30.070> be<00:02:30.160> seen<00:02:30.370> as<00:02:30.550> a

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
notes in the quarter can be seen as a

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.270 
notes in the quarter can be seen as a
root<00:02:30.820> note<00:02:31.500> we're<00:02:32.500> gonna<00:02:32.620> see<00:02:33.160> it

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
root note we're gonna see it

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.550 
root note we're gonna see it
theoretically<00:02:33.850> correct<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.450> say<00:02:34.630> this<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.080> C

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
theoretically correct and say this is C

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.090 
theoretically correct and say this is C
sharp<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.490> an<00:02:36.730> A<00:02:37.080> augmented<00:02:38.080> triad<00:02:38.410> with

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
sharp this is an A augmented triad with

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.510 
sharp this is an A augmented triad with
C<00:02:39.370> sharp<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.300> bass<00:02:40.450> first<00:02:40.810> inversion<00:02:41.520> go

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
C sharp and the bass first inversion go

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.160 
C sharp and the bass first inversion go
up<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.790> G<00:02:43.060> sharp<00:02:43.270> in<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.480> base<00:02:43.510> second<00:02:44.050> version

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
up to G sharp in the base second version

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:52.720 
up to G sharp in the base second version
same<00:02:44.620> shape<00:02:45.060> then<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.150> roof<00:02:47.490> C<00:02:48.490> sure

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.740 

first<00:02:53.180> uh<00:02:53.470> sorry<00:02:54.470> second<00:02:55.280> version<00:02:55.750> first

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.319 
first uh sorry second version first
version<00:02:57.200> root<00:02:59.799> all<00:03:00.799> right<00:03:01.010> now<00:03:01.640> screen<00:03:01.939> sets<00:03:02.150> 2

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
version root all right now screen sets 2

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.220 
version root all right now screen sets 2
through<00:03:02.540> 4<00:03:03.129> so<00:03:04.129> we<00:03:04.250> have<00:03:04.780> our<00:03:05.780> first<00:03:05.989> one

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
through 4 so we have our first one

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.199 
through 4 so we have our first one
available<00:03:06.439> here's<00:03:06.799> e<00:03:07.099> so<00:03:07.430> this<00:03:07.579> is<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.879> sharp

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
available here's e so this is a sharp

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.869 
available here's e so this is a sharp
right<00:03:08.450> here<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.709> then<00:03:09.829> we<00:03:09.920> have<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.189> and<00:03:10.640> C

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
right here and then we have a and C

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.839 
right here and then we have a and C
sharp<00:03:11.180> so<00:03:11.510> our<00:03:12.230> form<00:03:12.500> is<00:03:12.650> basically<00:03:12.829> like<00:03:13.159> this

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
sharp so our form is basically like this

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.339 
sharp so our form is basically like this
once<00:03:15.569> again<00:03:15.689> you're<00:03:15.959> gonna<00:03:16.019> be<00:03:16.140> your

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
once again you're gonna be your

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.660 
once again you're gonna be your
fingering<00:03:16.709> these<00:03:16.829> things<00:03:17.040> multiple

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
fingering these things multiple

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.740 
fingering these things multiple
different<00:03:17.849> ways<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.299> don't<00:03:18.450> always<00:03:18.599> have

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
different ways so you don't always have

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.940 
different ways so you don't always have
to<00:03:18.870> pry<00:03:19.019> something<00:03:19.260> like<00:03:19.439> I<00:03:19.530> do<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.799> was<00:03:19.890> you

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
to pry something like I do it was you

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.959 
to pry something like I do it was you
can<00:03:20.069> do<00:03:20.159> it<00:03:20.280> like<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.430> or<00:03:20.969> or<00:03:21.480> whatever<00:03:21.750> but

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:22.969 
can do it like that or or whatever but

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.699 
can do it like that or or whatever but
so<00:03:23.969> we<00:03:24.090> had<00:03:24.209> that<00:03:24.390> right<00:03:24.599> there<00:03:24.810> with<00:03:25.590> the

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
so we had that right there with the

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.550 
so we had that right there with the
sharps<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.459> at<00:03:26.579> second<00:03:27.030> inversion<00:03:27.349> same<00:03:28.349> as<00:03:28.530> a

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
sharps and at second inversion same as a

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.470 
sharps and at second inversion same as a
root<00:03:28.890> shape<00:03:30.620> same<00:03:31.620> as<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:32.010> third<00:03:32.849> see<00:03:33.209> sharp

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
root shape same as the third see sharp

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.040 
root shape same as the third see sharp
shape<00:03:33.829> back<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.099> beginning

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.200 

and<00:03:39.710> we're<00:03:39.920> gonna<00:03:40.010> end<00:03:40.250> this<00:03:40.400> here's<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:40.970> root

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
and we're gonna end this here's the root

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.890 
and we're gonna end this here's the root
position<00:03:41.570> shape<00:03:42.880> or<00:03:43.880> basically<00:03:44.780> the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
position shape or basically the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.330 
position shape or basically the
Augmented<00:03:45.410> shape<00:03:45.590> for<00:03:45.830> this<00:03:45.950> whole<00:03:46.130> string

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
Augmented shape for this whole string

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.800 
Augmented shape for this whole string
set<00:03:46.550> to<00:03:46.730> string<00:03:47.450> this<00:03:47.570> 1<00:03:48.050> through<00:03:48.230> 3<00:03:48.410> a<00:03:49.810> c-sharp

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
set to string this 1 through 3 a c-sharp

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.720 
set to string this 1 through 3 a c-sharp
d-sharp<00:03:51.620> so<00:03:52.010> we<00:03:52.100> have<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.370> root<00:03:52.580> position

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
d-sharp so we have the root position

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.240 
d-sharp so we have the root position
shape

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250
