heavy metals for environmental spills or

heavy metals for environmental spills or
industrial<00:01:58.030> cleanup<00:01:58.690> sites<00:01:58.990> there's<00:01:59.979> been<00:02:00.190> a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
industrial cleanup sites there's been a

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.480 
industrial cleanup sites there's been a
lot<00:02:00.550> of<00:02:00.580> interest<00:02:01.030> in<00:02:01.180> using<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.660> to<00:02:02.340> make<00:02:03.340> the

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
lot of interest in using it to make the

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.260 
lot of interest in using it to make the
area<00:02:03.790> less<00:02:04.030> toxic<00:02:04.540> or<00:02:04.660> the<00:02:04.840> water<00:02:05.080> less<00:02:05.380> toxic

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
area less toxic or the water less toxic

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.639 
area less toxic or the water less toxic
so<00:02:07.270> I<00:02:07.300> guess<00:02:07.420> part<00:02:07.869> of<00:02:07.900> what<00:02:08.020> we<00:02:08.140> are<00:02:08.200> doing<00:02:08.350> is

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
so I guess part of what we are doing is

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.740 
so I guess part of what we are doing is
using<00:02:08.830> comparative<00:02:09.729> protea<00:02:10.149> genomics<00:02:10.630> to

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
using comparative protea genomics to

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.300 
using comparative protea genomics to
help<00:02:10.929> understand<00:02:11.350> how<00:02:11.980> this<00:02:12.130> organism

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
help understand how this organism

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.130 
help understand how this organism
functions<00:02:13.090> what<00:02:13.570> are<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.720> reasons<00:02:13.870> for

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
functions what are the reasons for

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.840 
functions what are the reasons for
comparative<00:02:14.680> pro<00:02:14.980> do<00:02:15.130> genomics<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.900> its

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
comparative pro do genomics is its

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.699 
comparative pro do genomics is its
ability<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:19.630> overcome<00:02:20.110> some<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.530> the

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
ability to overcome some of the

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.509 
ability to overcome some of the
obstacles<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:22.500> were<00:02:23.500> found<00:02:23.830> with<00:02:24.220> not<00:02:24.489> only

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
obstacles that were found with not only

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.750 
obstacles that were found with not only
just<00:02:24.790> pro<00:02:25.150> do<00:02:25.300> genomics<00:02:25.660> but<00:02:26.590> also

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
just pro do genomics but also

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.490 
just pro do genomics but also
comparative<00:02:27.760> genomics<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.810> comparative

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
comparative genomics and comparative

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.680 
comparative genomics and comparative
genomics<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.130> important<00:02:30.730> because<00:02:31.060> it's<00:02:31.390> used

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
genomics is important because it's used

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.310 
genomics is important because it's used
to<00:02:33.000> annotate<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.300> new<00:02:34.570> genomes<00:02:35.019> that<00:02:35.140> are

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
to annotate the new genomes that are

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.130 
to annotate the new genomes that are
coming<00:02:35.620> out<00:02:35.739> on<00:02:36.300> an<00:02:37.300> almost<00:02:37.480> weekly<00:02:37.959> basis<00:02:38.560> and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
coming out on an almost weekly basis and

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.720 
coming out on an almost weekly basis and
if<00:02:41.140> we<00:02:41.290> don't<00:02:41.380> have<00:02:41.620> good<00:02:41.830> annotation<00:02:42.550> for

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
if we don't have good annotation for

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.380 
if we don't have good annotation for
those<00:02:42.880> genomes<00:02:43.360> then<00:02:44.850> we're<00:02:45.850> missing<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.269> lot

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
those genomes then we're missing a lot

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.229 
those genomes then we're missing a lot
of<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.660> information<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.350> could<00:02:47.709> be

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
of the information that could be

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.090 
of the information that could be
important<00:02:49.239> not<00:02:49.630> only<00:02:49.660> just<00:02:50.049> from<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.440> purely

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
important not only just from a purely

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.470 
important not only just from a purely
scientific<00:02:51.430> point<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.090> view<00:02:52.150> but<00:02:52.420> also

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
scientific point of view but also

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.870 
scientific point of view but also
potentially<00:02:52.870> from<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.799> clinical<00:02:54.519> point<00:02:54.760> of

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
potentially from a clinical point of

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.550 
potentially from a clinical point of
view<00:02:55.060> it's<00:02:55.450> an<00:02:55.510> experience<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:56.049> that<00:02:56.530> I

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
view it's an experience that that I

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.150 
view it's an experience that that I
enjoyed<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.950> lot<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:58.470> we<00:02:59.470> definitely<00:02:59.590> do<00:02:59.920> again

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
enjoyed a lot and we definitely do again

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.900 
enjoyed a lot and we definitely do again
so<00:03:00.820> I<00:03:01.090> can<00:03:01.450> curb
