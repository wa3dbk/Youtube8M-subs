the<00:00:30.090> value<00:00:30.449> comes<00:00:30.689> because<00:00:30.960> vertex

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the value comes because vertex

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.040 
the value comes because vertex
intentionally<00:00:32.550> chose<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.030> make<00:00:33.180> some<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.719> the

components easier to assemble at the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.810 
components easier to assemble at the
factory<00:00:36.809> because<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.040> production<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.640> more

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
factory because the production is more

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.850 
factory because the production is more
efficient<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:39.989> get<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> same<00:00:40.440> bubble

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
efficient you can get the same bubble

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.920 
efficient you can get the same bubble
King<00:00:41.219> performance<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.270> at<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.420> lower<00:00:42.629> price

you can get a vertex alpha for about

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.410 
you can get a vertex alpha for about
twenty<00:01:10.920> percent<00:01:11.070> less<00:01:11.400> than<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.210> a

that<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.369> could<00:02:08.459> almost<00:02:08.610> assume<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.360> your

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
that you could almost assume that your

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.460 
that you could almost assume that your
skim<00:02:09.720> row<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:09.959> going<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.110> be<00:02:10.200> made

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
skim row is going to be made

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.740 
skim row is going to be made
of<00:02:10.680> high-quality<00:02:10.890> acrylic<00:02:11.760> however<00:02:12.630> these

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
of high-quality acrylic however these

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.240 
of high-quality acrylic however these
days<00:02:13.050> they're<00:02:13.380> using<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.770> variety<00:02:13.890> of

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
days they're using a variety of

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.190 
days they're using a variety of
materials<00:02:14.820> including<00:02:15.420> some<00:02:15.660> inexpensive

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
materials including some inexpensive

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.730 
materials including some inexpensive
plastics<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.850> vertex<00:02:18.360> alpha<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:19.020> using<00:02:19.560> only

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
plastics the vertex alpha is using only

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.030 
plastics the vertex alpha is using only
cast<00:02:20.160> acrylic<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:20.940> PVC<00:02:21.350> this<00:02:22.350> may<00:02:22.500> sound<00:02:22.770> silly

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
cast acrylic in PVC this may sound silly

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.400 
cast acrylic in PVC this may sound silly
but<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:24.060> can<00:02:24.180> actually<00:02:24.330> feel<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.780> difference

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
but you can actually feel the difference

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.590 
but you can actually feel the difference
when<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.620> touch<00:02:25.920> one<00:02:26.270> including<00:02:27.270> simple

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
when you touch one including simple

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.810 
when you touch one including simple
things<00:02:27.810> like<00:02:28.110> when<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.770> hold<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.250> lid<00:02:29.490> you

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
things like when you hold the lid you

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.490 
things like when you hold the lid you
can<00:02:29.850> feel<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.360> weight<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.960> quality<00:02:31.440> of

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
can feel the weight and the quality of

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.530 
can feel the weight and the quality of
the<00:02:31.590> materials<00:02:32.130> used<00:02:32.250> one<00:02:33.210> of<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.360> nice

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
the materials used one of the nice

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.600 
the materials used one of the nice
features<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.410> neck<00:02:34.710> of<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> skimmer<00:02:35.310> cup

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
features is the neck of the skimmer cup

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.140 
features is the neck of the skimmer cup
is<00:02:36.090> actually<00:02:36.510> threaded<00:02:37.160> this<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.370> not<00:02:38.940> only

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
is actually threaded this is not only

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.650 
is actually threaded this is not only
much<00:02:39.390> nicer<00:02:39.900> than<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:41.010> common<00:02:41.550> sliding<00:02:42.270> cup

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
much nicer than the common sliding cup

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.110 
much nicer than the common sliding cup
with<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.350> o-ring<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.860> frequently<00:02:44.520> binds<00:02:44.820> up

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
with the o-ring that frequently binds up

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.510 
with the o-ring that frequently binds up
but<00:02:45.870> functionally<00:02:46.560> it's<00:02:46.710> actually<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.310> lot

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
but functionally it's actually a lot

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.880 
but functionally it's actually a lot
better<00:02:47.760> as<00:02:47.940> well<00:02:48.020> because<00:02:49.020> we<00:02:49.140> only<00:02:49.320> have<00:02:49.590> to

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
better as well because we only have to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.940 
better as well because we only have to
provide<00:02:50.700> about<00:02:51.060> 3/8<00:02:51.600> inch<00:02:51.900> room<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.770> remove

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
provide about 3/8 inch room to remove

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.550 
provide about 3/8 inch room to remove
the<00:02:53.490> skimmer<00:02:53.760> cup<00:02:54.060> completely<00:02:54.750> this<00:02:55.380> is

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
the skimmer cup completely this is

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.320 
the skimmer cup completely this is
important<00:02:56.100> because<00:02:56.160> most<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.850> us<00:02:56.970> don't<00:02:57.210> have

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
important because most of us don't have

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.500 
important because most of us don't have
much<00:02:57.750> space<00:02:58.080> in<00:02:58.410> our<00:02:59.010> sump<00:02:59.340> area<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.450> you

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
much space in our sump area so you

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.480 
much space in our sump area so you
really<00:03:00.870> need<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.380> be<00:03:01.590> as<00:03:01.710> low<00:03:01.920> profile<00:03:02.460> as

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
really need it to be as low profile as

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.090 
really need it to be as low profile as
possible<00:03:02.990> rather<00:03:03.990> than<00:03:04.230> attaching<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.830> pump

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100
