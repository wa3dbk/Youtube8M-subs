00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.100 
alright this is gonna be a little loud
until<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.620> shuts<00:00:10.860> off<00:00:11.160> but<00:00:11.700> this<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.840> how<00:00:13.049> to

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
until it shuts off but this is how to

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.750 
until it shuts off but this is how to
restart<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.340> reaper<00:00:15.119> that<00:00:16.080> if<00:00:16.530> you<00:00:16.770> run<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> few

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
restart a reaper that if you run a few

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.470 
restart a reaper that if you run a few
or<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.390> stops<00:00:18.810> for<00:00:19.320> some<00:00:19.500> reason

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
or it stops for some reason

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.339 
or it stops for some reason
let<00:00:21.869> me<00:00:21.990> stir<00:00:22.260> with<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.089 

okay<00:00:28.210> see<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.359> fuel<00:00:29.630> gauge<00:00:29.869> is<00:00:30.259> about<00:00:30.650> almost

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
okay see the fuel gauge is about almost

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.650 
okay see the fuel gauge is about almost
half<00:00:32.170> sometimes<00:00:33.760> they<00:00:34.760> don't<00:00:35.000> read<00:00:35.270> properly

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
half sometimes they don't read properly

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.840 
half sometimes they don't read properly
it'll<00:00:36.530> be<00:00:36.649> full<00:00:36.949> but<00:00:37.250> it<00:00:37.399> only<00:00:37.550> reads

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
it'll be full but it only reads

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.540 
it'll be full but it only reads
three-quarters<00:00:38.809> so<00:00:39.800> if<00:00:39.890> it<00:00:39.980> gets<00:00:40.070> down<00:00:40.309> to<00:00:40.370> e

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
three-quarters so if it gets down to e

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.540 
three-quarters so if it gets down to e
might<00:00:41.269> be<00:00:41.420> one-quarter<00:00:42.050> full

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
might be one-quarter full

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.189 
might be one-quarter full
always<00:00:43.550> fuel<00:00:43.940> it<00:00:44.089> when<00:00:44.269> the<00:00:44.420> needle<00:00:44.780> gets<00:00:44.960> down

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
always fuel it when the needle gets down

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.649 
always fuel it when the needle gets down
to<00:00:45.230> one-quarter<00:00:46.040> no<00:00:46.250> matter<00:00:46.489> what<00:00:46.850> whether

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
to one-quarter no matter what whether

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.280 
to one-quarter no matter what whether
your<00:00:47.989> gauge<00:00:48.620> works<00:00:48.980> properly<00:00:49.460> or<00:00:49.879> not<00:00:50.290> always

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
your gauge works properly or not always

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.649 
your gauge works properly or not always
feel<00:00:51.589> it<00:00:51.800> when<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.159> needle<00:00:52.850> gets<00:00:53.030> down<00:00:53.300> to<00:00:53.480> one

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
feel it when the needle gets down to one

00:00:53.659 --> 00:01:04.939 
feel it when the needle gets down to one
quarter<00:00:54.610> okay<00:00:55.610> now<00:00:57.250> here<00:00:58.250> we<00:00:58.280> go

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.840 

you'll<00:01:05.219> wind<00:01:05.579> up<00:01:05.880> clear

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:02:34.699 

here<00:01:10.330> you<00:01:10.840> get<00:01:10.990> it

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.720 

okay<00:02:35.579> now<00:02:36.209> as<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:38.040> saw<00:02:38.340> in<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:39.239> noisy<00:02:39.930> video

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
okay now as you saw in the noisy video

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:49.370 
okay now as you saw in the noisy video
that<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.760> was<00:02:42.030> pointing<00:02:42.659> to<00:02:45.980> the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.180 

the<00:02:49.920> little<00:02:50.630> screw<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.320> diagram<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:53.070> the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
the little screw the the diagram on the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.760 
the little screw the the diagram on the
inside<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.700> door<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.090> tells<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.770> to

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
inside of the door that tells you to

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.570 
inside of the door that tells you to
prime<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.310> okay<00:02:57.410> then

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
prime it okay then

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.090 
prime it okay then
you<00:03:00.150> unscrew<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.750> thing<00:03:01.140> till<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.560> pops<00:03:01.830> out

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
you unscrew that thing till it pops out

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.000 
you unscrew that thing till it pops out
then<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.880> pump<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.360> that's<00:03:03.600> your<00:03:03.810> prime<00:03:04.140> okay

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
then you pump it that's your prime okay

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.190 
then you pump it that's your prime okay
going<00:03:05.250> back<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.550> forth<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:06.360> screw<00:03:06.870> up<00:03:06.990> there

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
going back and forth that screw up there

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.390 
going back and forth that screw up there
that<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.440> was<00:03:07.650> pointing<00:03:08.070> at

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
that I was pointing at

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.940 
that I was pointing at
that's<00:03:09.030> your<00:03:09.210> bleeder<00:03:09.510> screw<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:10.590> unscrew

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
that's your bleeder screw you unscrew

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.230 
that's your bleeder screw you unscrew
that<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.760> let<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.090> air<00:03:12.270> out<00:03:12.600> so<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.140> pump<00:03:13.620> it

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
that to let the air out so you pump it

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.800 
that to let the air out so you pump it
first<00:03:15.240> you<00:03:15.390> unscrew<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:16.340> then<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:18.150> pump<00:03:18.570> it

first you unscrew that then you pump it
to<00:03:19.020> let<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.740> air<00:03:19.890> out<00:03:19.920> once<00:03:20.460> fuel<00:03:20.850> starts

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
to let the air out once fuel starts

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.630 
to let the air out once fuel starts
coming<00:03:21.510> out<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.780> your<00:03:21.870> screw<00:03:22.550> tighten<00:03:23.550> the

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
coming out of your screw tighten the

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.140 
coming out of your screw tighten the
screw<00:03:23.940> keep<00:03:24.840> pumping<00:03:25.290> your<00:03:25.440> pump<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.220> then

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
screw keep pumping your pump and then

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.089 

set<00:03:57.530> points<00:03:57.980> but<00:03:58.189> if<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:59.030> this<00:03:59.330> is<00:03:59.569> the<00:03:59.689> name
