00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.830
 Hello you guys, be careful: Today we are 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.710
 Convert any picture, picture, graphic, 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.989
 Text okay? So we will do 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:11.269
 Will be mixed 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.679
 Tail with water (water two parts and one tail) to glue too 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.599
 Poor Okay? 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.470
 This glue we will 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.079
 use 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.419
 We will put all surface paper 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.550
 By looking well 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.790
 Especially in spot corners 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.460
 And edges. 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.610
 In this paper we will put it to a piece of cloth. In this case it is fabric 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.240
 blanquita possible, and as thin as possible. Then there is the fabric spend 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.890
 At what time 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.800
 We want to work 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.040
 And pegariamos, or coserÃ­amos the work we do. 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.970
 After we have also stretched out 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.130
 Put the load off and let dry. 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.380
 After we have done this we go to the printer, 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.420
 We are 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.600
 This 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.410
 Paper weaving 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.320
 In the printer. We are going to put it on printer mode 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.030
 Ask us 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.940
 for printing. In this case the fabric has been put up. If the printer is 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.810
 Asking down ... down. 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.140
 You go to your computer, 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.040
 Choose the picture, drawing, or characters, you want 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.520
 Print 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.310
 And we will print how? 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.390
 With the system 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.540
 Its normal, like what you should do in any other color document 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.700
 And apartment all right? 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.830
 My normal printer printer, 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.150
 No laser, 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.510
 Nor is it industrial, nothing. It is a printer 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.370
 Normal we have any one of us 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.140
 Home. 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.230
 Even in you should work equally. 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.720
 Well, now it's just wait for the printer 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.020
 Go do their work. 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.780
 I also wanted to say that what kind of posts can be washed 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.309
 Quite hand. 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:14.579
 Obviously I will not mess with washing or bleaching 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.219
 But if it gets dirty 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.539
 Yes you can wash it with any problems, so 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.389
 It can be quite 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.589
 Use it to make a pillow, for 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.879
 Make a bag or 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.759
 For any other matters. 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:32.240
 Look at you rather than stay! 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.790
 What is surprising? 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.319
 For me, I like this image transfer system 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.609
 For the fabric. Now we simply took off as we did 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.519
 The glue was very weak 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.139
 Come off very easily. 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.279
 We have this task. 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:49.779
 Yes now 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.619
 Just need to 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:54.019
 paste 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.259
 Or fabric weaving 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:00.319
 In the work you want. I'm sure this will work on 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.309
 Do a lot of things. 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:06.999
 I hope you liked, hope to do, here I leave some 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:08.469
