00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
something like a vulture all because you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.400 
something like a vulture all because you
don't<00:00:50.070> need<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.570> take<00:00:51.570> into<00:00:51.750> account<00:00:51.989> yet<00:00:52.260> you

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
don't need to take into account yet you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.760 
don't need to take into account yet you
don't<00:00:52.590> need<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:54.289> yeah<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.590> bypass

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
don't need to yeah you can bypass

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.350 
don't need to yeah you can bypass
restrictions<00:00:56.610> something<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.329> that

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
restrictions something on you that

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.069 
restrictions something on you that
summoning<00:00:58.230> restrictions<00:00:59.930> guard<00:01:00.930> like

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
summoning restrictions guard like

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.200 
summoning restrictions guard like
faultroll<00:01:01.559> has<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.090> effort

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
faultroll has so it's it's the effort

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.929 
faultroll has so it's it's the effort
for<00:01:03.989> something<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.710> decent<00:01:05.220> but

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
for something like that it's decent but

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.090 
for something like that it's decent but
yeah<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> think<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.229> only<00:01:07.500> one<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.950> main

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
yeah I think it's only one on the main

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.590 
yeah I think it's only one on the main
deck<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.369> more<00:01:08.640> than<00:01:08.760> enough<00:01:09.030> since<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.420> also

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
deck is more than enough since we also

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.510 
deck is more than enough since we also
have<00:01:09.810> sold<00:01:10.080> charges<00:01:10.619> which<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.070> obviously

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
have sold charges which is obviously

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.840 
have sold charges which is obviously
much<00:01:11.760> better<00:01:12.890> then<00:01:13.890> yes<00:01:14.070> I'm<00:01:14.280> still<00:01:14.490> testing<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
much better then yes I'm still testing a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.210 
much better then yes I'm still testing a
few<00:01:15.060> things<00:01:15.299> out<00:01:15.450> due<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.680> two<00:01:16.920> times<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
few things out due to a two times the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.050 
few things out due to a two times the
tuner<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.360> full<00:01:18.810> hell<00:01:18.990> night<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.680> sure

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
tuner so to full hell night to be sure

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.920 
tuner so to full hell night to be sure
of<00:01:21.060> course<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.509> had<00:01:21.650> 33<00:01:22.650> Dark<00:01:22.950> Soul<00:01:23.930> 3403

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
of course you had 33 Dark Soul 3403

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.510 
of course you had 33 Dark Soul 3403
barger<00:01:25.560> nights<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.220> think<00:01:26.670> pretty<00:01:27.119> much<00:01:27.270> staple

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
barger nights I think pretty much staple

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.929 
barger nights I think pretty much staple
yeah<00:01:29.520> let's<00:01:29.939> see<00:01:30.060> some<00:01:30.270> tools<00:01:31.610> okay<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:32.850> you

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
yeah let's see some tools okay so if you

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.520 
yeah let's see some tools okay so if you
test<00:01:33.180> tools<00:01:33.420> against<00:01:33.750> Clive<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.350> pretty

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
test tools against Clive for it's pretty

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.690 
test tools against Clive for it's pretty
much<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> best<00:01:35.070> x<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> current

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
much one of the best x of the current

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.999 
much one of the best x of the current
format<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.320> sincere<00:01:37.320> i<00:01:37.350> think<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.799> should

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
format and sincere i think that should

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.530 
format and sincere i think that should
should<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.670> an<00:01:38.759> interesting<00:01:39.030> matchup

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
should be an interesting matchup

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.109 
should be an interesting matchup
although<00:01:40.049> i<00:01:40.560> think<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.430> obvious<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.790> Clive

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
although i think it's obvious that Clive

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.569 
although i think it's obvious that Clive
forts<00:01:42.509> are<00:01:43.079> definitely<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> better<00:01:44.250> deck

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
forts are definitely the better deck

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.460 
forts are definitely the better deck
because<00:01:45.570> they're<00:01:45.689> much<00:01:45.840> more<00:01:46.020> consistent

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
because they're much more consistent

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.399 
because they're much more consistent
right<00:01:47.280> with<00:01:47.579> tool<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:48.119> odd-eyes<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.170> all

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
right with tool with odd-eyes and all

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.300 
right with tool with odd-eyes and all
the<00:01:49.530> back<00:01:49.740> row<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.890> yeah<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.040> gets<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
the back row and so on yeah it gets a

you<00:02:12.970> can<00:02:13.120> go<00:02:13.240> for<00:02:13.480> something<00:02:13.750> like<00:02:13.960> in<00:02:14.140> huele

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
you can go for something like in huele

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.450 
you can go for something like in huele
yeah<00:02:15.580> set<00:02:15.970> up<00:02:16.060> in<00:02:16.180> Huell<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.600> play<00:02:17.130> next<00:02:18.130> turn

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
yeah set up in Huell and play next turn

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.610 
yeah set up in Huell and play next turn
but<00:02:18.970> yeah<00:02:19.060> then<00:02:19.210> again<00:02:19.420> he<00:02:19.720> has<00:02:19.810> skill<00:02:20.290> drain

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
but yeah then again he has skill drain

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.620 
but yeah then again he has skill drain
have<00:02:20.980> also<00:02:21.580> think<00:02:21.760> he<00:02:21.850> has<00:02:21.970> emptiness<00:02:22.450> on<00:02:22.540> the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
have also think he has emptiness on the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.410 
have also think he has emptiness on the
field<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:24.070> don't<00:02:24.340> f<00:02:24.520> trap<00:02:24.760> stun<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.210> told

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
field and I don't f trap stun I told

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.930 
field and I don't f trap stun I told
that<00:02:25.600> mystical<00:02:25.900> Space<00:02:26.140> typhoon<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.940> yeah

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
that mystical Space typhoon and yeah

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.820 
that mystical Space typhoon and yeah
anyway<00:02:28.300> natori<00:02:28.960> abyss<00:02:29.170> is<00:02:29.320> definitely<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.740> very

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
anyway natori abyss is definitely a very

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.290 
anyway natori abyss is definitely a very
good<00:02:30.130> guard<00:02:30.370> against<00:02:30.610> Clive<00:02:30.820> board<00:02:31.060> since<00:02:31.210> I

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
good guard against Clive board since I

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.900 
good guard against Clive board since I
can<00:02:31.480> negate<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.470> activation<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:33.370> the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
can negate the activation of the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.000 
can negate the activation of the
pendulums<00:02:34.480> at<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.200> pendulum<00:02:35.500> monsters<00:02:35.830> when

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
pendulums at the pendulum monsters when

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.300 
pendulums at the pendulum monsters when
they<00:02:36.130> are<00:02:36.250> put<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.730> bedlam<00:02:37.720> zone<00:02:38.160> but<00:02:39.160> yeah

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
they are put in the bedlam zone but yeah

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.640 
they are put in the bedlam zone but yeah
then<00:02:39.460> again<00:02:39.670> he<00:02:39.730> has<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.910> skill<00:02:40.390> drain<00:02:40.650> I'm

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
then again he has a skill drain I'm

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.610 
then again he has a skill drain I'm
obviously<00:02:42.100> going<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.730> book<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.060> moon<00:02:43.300> his

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
obviously going to book of moon his

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.920 
obviously going to book of moon his
monster<00:02:44.620> here<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.040> he<00:02:45.160> loses<00:02:45.580> his<00:02:45.930> sacrifice

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
monster here so he loses his sacrifice

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.440 
monster here so he loses his sacrifice
so<00:02:47.710> I<00:02:47.740> get<00:02:47.980> an<00:02:48.070> icee<00:02:48.250> attack<00:02:48.610> over<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.270> we

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
so I get an icee attack over it and we

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.750 
so I get an icee attack over it and we
know<00:02:49.660> I<00:02:49.690> think<00:02:49.870> his<00:02:50.500> back<00:02:50.950> row<00:02:51.160> is<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.430> second

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
know I think his back row is the second

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.580 
know I think his back row is the second
skill<00:02:52.090> drain<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.540> another<00:02:52.840> emptiness<00:02:53.350> so

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
skill drain and another emptiness so

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.800 
skill drain and another emptiness so
that's<00:02:53.770> not<00:02:53.860> going<00:02:54.070> to<00:02:54.220> save<00:02:54.490> him<00:02:54.670> very<00:02:55.600> nice

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
that's not going to save him very nice

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.760 
that's not going to save him very nice
10<00:02:56.770> from<00:02:57.190> me<00:02:57.670> then<00:02:58.600> I<00:02:58.840> think<00:02:59.260> he<00:02:59.320> gets<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.530> start

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
10 from me then I think he gets a start

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.530 
10 from me then I think he gets a start
he<00:02:59.920> has<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.070> very<00:03:00.610> good<00:03:00.670> opening<00:03:01.090> hand<00:03:01.180> with<00:03:01.390> the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
he has a very good opening hand with the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.330 
he has a very good opening hand with the
tool<00:03:01.810> is<00:03:02.050> going<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.320> search<00:03:02.590> out<00:03:02.860> I<00:03:02.890> believe
