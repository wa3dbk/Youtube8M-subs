like<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> blackboard<00:00:36.989> paint<00:00:37.200> with<00:00:37.469> some

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
like on the blackboard paint with some

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.500 
like on the blackboard paint with some
chalk<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.700> change<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.180> as<00:00:39.329> often

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
chalk and you can change that as often

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.459 
chalk and you can change that as often
as<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.840> like<00:00:39.890> so<00:00:40.890> first<00:00:41.399> things<00:00:41.670> first<00:00:41.730> let's

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
as you like so first things first let's

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.080 
as you like so first things first let's
mark<00:00:43.469> out<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.980> shape<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.489> we're<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:44.969> to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
mark out the shape that we're going to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.580 
mark out the shape that we're going to
make<00:00:45.469> just<00:00:46.469> say<00:00:46.680> get<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:48.110> strip<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.410> masking

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
make just say get a strip of masking

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.569 
make just say get a strip of masking
tape<00:00:50.600> this<00:00:51.600> doesn't<00:00:52.230> really<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.489> be

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
tape this doesn't really have to be

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.540 
tape this doesn't really have to be
particularly<00:00:54.270> carefully<00:00:54.870> worked<00:00:55.050> out<00:00:55.550> well

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
particularly carefully worked out well

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.610 
particularly carefully worked out well
as<00:00:56.820> long<00:00:57.030> as<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.629> longer<00:00:57.960> than<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> shape

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
as long as it is longer than the shape

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.729 
as long as it is longer than the shape
you're<00:00:58.800> trying<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.190> create<00:01:00.350> I'm<00:01:01.350> just<00:01:01.620> going

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
you're trying to create I'm just going

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.369 
you're trying to create I'm just going
to<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> simple<00:01:02.730> square<00:01:03.120> shape<00:01:03.690> here<00:01:03.960> because

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
to do a simple square shape here because

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.560 
to do a simple square shape here because
that's<00:01:05.070> roughly<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> shape<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> jar<00:01:06.540> that

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that's roughly the shape of the jar that

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.100 
that's roughly the shape of the jar that
I'm<00:01:06.900> working<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:08.210> if<00:01:09.210> you've<00:01:09.420> got<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.840> bigger

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
I'm working with if you've got a bigger

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.260 
I'm working with if you've got a bigger
surface<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.950> work<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.369> which<00:01:11.880> we're<00:01:12.090> going<00:01:12.210> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
surface to work on which we're going to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.390 
surface to work on which we're going to
be<00:01:12.360> doing<00:01:12.570> later

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
be doing later

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.719 
be doing later
if<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.880> more<00:01:15.240> elaborate<00:01:15.630> shape<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.280> just

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
if you a more elaborate shape so just

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.719 
if you a more elaborate shape so just
one<00:01:20.970> more<00:01:21.240> bit<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.630> go<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:22.369> I'm<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.670> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
one more bit to go on I'm just going to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.219 
one more bit to go on I'm just going to
turn<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:23.970> around<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.390> do<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.080> can

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
turn it around to do that one so I can

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:35.300 
turn it around to do that one so I can
see<00:01:25.380> where<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.650> goes

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.770 

okay<00:01:36.310> that's<00:01:36.850> our<00:01:39.210> that's<00:01:40.210> cheap

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
okay that's our that's cheap

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.780 
okay that's our that's cheap
so<00:01:41.020> our<00:01:41.170> next<00:01:41.320> job<00:01:41.620> is<00:01:41.920> now<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:42.100> fill<00:01:42.490> in<00:01:42.610> this

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
so our next job is now to fill in this

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.940 
so our next job is now to fill in this
square<00:01:43.150> with<00:01:43.480> blackboard<00:01:43.960> paint<00:01:44.200> now<00:01:44.770> you

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
square with blackboard paint now you

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.470 
square with blackboard paint now you
should<00:01:45.130> be<00:01:45.160> able<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.490> get<00:01:45.610> this<00:01:45.730> for<00:01:45.940> most<00:01:46.240> of

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
should be able to get this for most of

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
should be able to get this for most of
hardware<00:01:46.900> stores<00:01:47.230> and<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:48.700> is<00:01:49.140> very<00:01:50.140> similar

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
hardware stores and it is very similar

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.840 
hardware stores and it is very similar
to<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.950> stuff<00:01:51.160> that<00:01:51.190> we<00:01:51.400> used<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.610> have<00:01:51.700> at

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
to the stuff that we used to have at

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.710 
to the stuff that we used to have at
school<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:53.010> it<00:01:54.010> will<00:01:54.160> allow<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:54.720> to

school and it will allow you to

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.700 
school and it will allow you to
customize<00:01:55.960> your<00:01:56.850> jars<00:01:57.850> with<00:01:58.270> ease<00:01:58.480> so<00:01:58.870> I've

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
your paint before you start a bright or

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.620 
your paint before you start a bright or
later<00:02:29.560> over<00:02:29.830> tool<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:31.030> I'm<00:02:31.120> going<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.330> put<00:02:31.480> that

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
later over tool so I'm going to put that

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.000 
later over tool so I'm going to put that
to<00:02:31.810> one<00:02:31.930> side<00:02:31.990> out<00:02:34.230> now<00:02:35.230> that<00:02:35.530> we've<00:02:35.710> painted

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
to one side out now that we've painted

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.500 
to one side out now that we've painted
that<00:02:36.250> one<00:02:36.400> I'm<00:02:36.670> going<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:36.880> show<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.090> what<00:02:37.420> it

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
that one I'm going to show you what it

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.530 
that one I'm going to show you what it
should<00:02:37.540> look<00:02:37.750> like<00:02:38.820> once<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:40.030> paint<00:02:40.300> is<00:02:40.480> dry

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
should look like once the paint is dry

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.380 
should look like once the paint is dry
and<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.560> have<00:02:41.590> peeled<00:02:42.280> off<00:02:42.700> your<00:02:42.970> masking

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
and you have peeled off your masking

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.190 
and you have peeled off your masking
tape<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:43.870> on<00:02:44.680> this<00:02:44.830> one<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.660> used<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.870> slightly

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
tape so on this one I used a slightly

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.949 
tape so on this one I used a slightly
less<00:02:47.560> equal<00:02:48.040> shape<00:02:48.360> just<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.480> add<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.690> little

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
less equal shape just to add a little

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.520 
less equal shape just to add a little
bit<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.200> interest<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.810> once<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.959> peeled<00:02:53.320> off

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
bit of interest and once I peeled off

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.860 
bit of interest and once I peeled off
all<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.739> masking<00:02:53.890> tape<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.700> just<00:02:55.420> needed<00:02:55.600> to

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
all the masking tape I just needed to

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.690 
all the masking tape I just needed to
need<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.200> note<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.500> edges<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.770> little<00:02:56.860> bit<00:02:57.220> and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
need to note the edges a little bit and

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.410 
need to note the edges a little bit and
there<00:02:57.970> we<00:02:58.090> go

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
there we go

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.510 
there we go
and<00:02:58.709> we've<00:02:59.709> filled<00:02:59.950> this<00:03:00.160> one<00:03:00.430> with<00:03:00.780> tea<00:03:01.780> bags

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
and we've filled this one with tea bags

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
and we've filled this one with tea bags
so<00:03:03.520> on<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:04.030> front

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
so on the front

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.040 
so on the front
guess<00:03:05.380> what<00:03:05.620> I'll<00:03:06.130> be<00:03:06.250> writing<00:03:06.459> teeth<00:03:06.820> okay<00:03:07.810> I

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
guess what I'll be writing teeth okay I

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.340 
guess what I'll be writing teeth okay I
haven't<00:03:08.910> written<00:03:09.910> on<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.150> chalkboard<00:03:10.450> in<00:03:11.110> quite

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
haven't written on a chalkboard in quite

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.220 
haven't written on a chalkboard in quite
a<00:03:11.380> long<00:03:11.709> time<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:13.300> I'm<00:03:13.420> being<00:03:13.600> relatively

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
a long time so I'm being relatively

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.190 
a long time so I'm being relatively
careful<00:03:14.770> but<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.730> beauty<00:03:16.060> is<00:03:16.090> if<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:16.930> doesn't

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
careful but the beauty is if it doesn't

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.490 
careful but the beauty is if it doesn't
work<00:03:17.380> I<00:03:17.739> can<00:03:18.489> wipe<00:03:19.270> it<00:03:19.390> off

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
work I can wipe it off

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.530 
work I can wipe it off
and<00:03:20.920> start<00:03:21.190> again<00:03:23.520> now<00:03:24.520> because<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.120> idea<00:03:25.510> is

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
and start again now because the idea is

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.120 
and start again now because the idea is
that<00:03:25.720> you're<00:03:25.870> going<00:03:26.050> to<00:03:26.110> be<00:03:26.200> selling<00:03:26.590> these<00:03:26.800> it

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
that you're going to be selling these it

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.510 
that you're going to be selling these it
might<00:03:27.490> be<00:03:27.670> worth<00:03:28.320> selling<00:03:29.320> an<00:03:29.560> offcut<00:03:30.040> of<00:03:30.430> a

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
might be worth selling an offcut of a

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.790 
might be worth selling an offcut of a
sponge<00:03:30.850> or<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.540> small<00:03:31.990> bit<00:03:32.140> of<00:03:32.200> cloth

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
sponge or a small bit of cloth

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.680 
sponge or a small bit of cloth
you<00:03:33.340> could<00:03:33.490> even<00:03:33.670> embroider<00:03:34.120> with<00:03:34.510> your

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
you could even embroider with your

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.640 
you could even embroider with your
company<00:03:35.230> name<00:03:36.060> your<00:03:37.060> customers<00:03:37.630> can<00:03:37.810> use<00:03:37.840> when

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
company name your customers can use when

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.160 
company name your customers can use when
they<00:03:38.770> want<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.070> change<00:03:39.130> their<00:03:39.520> label<00:03:40.110> there<00:03:41.110> we

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
they want to change their label there we

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.490 
they want to change their label there we
go

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
go

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.400 
go
now<00:03:42.430> another<00:03:42.730> idea<00:03:43.180> if<00:03:43.390> you've<00:03:43.810> got<00:03:44.020> a<00:03:44.050> jar

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
now another idea if you've got a jar

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.320 
now another idea if you've got a jar
which<00:03:44.890> isn't<00:03:45.100> quite<00:03:45.520> as<00:03:45.700> pretty<00:03:45.940> as<00:03:46.180> our

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
which isn't quite as pretty as our

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.800 
which isn't quite as pretty as our
lovely<00:03:46.630> kiln<00:03:46.870> adores<00:03:47.490> and<00:03:48.490> has<00:03:48.760> writing<00:03:49.540> all

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
lovely kiln adores and has writing all

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.720 
lovely kiln adores and has writing all
over<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:50.260> lid<00:03:50.440> you<00:03:50.950> can<00:03:51.130> use<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.520> same

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
over the lid you can use the same

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.120 
over the lid you can use the same
blackboard<00:03:52.270> pink<00:03:52.570> to<00:03:52.930> decorate<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.560> well<00:03:53.770> to

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
blackboard pink to decorate the well to

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.940 
blackboard pink to decorate the well to
cover<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.550> lid<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:55.050> then<00:03:56.050> right<00:03:56.320> on<00:03:56.709> here

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
cover the lid and then right on here

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.940 
cover the lid and then right on here
instead<00:03:57.160> so<00:03:57.580> you<00:03:57.640> have<00:03:57.790> tu<00:03:58.120> again<00:03:58.860> that's<00:03:59.860> a

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
instead so you have tu again that's a

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.850 
instead so you have tu again that's a
nice<00:04:00.220> cup<00:04:00.430> of<00:04:00.459> tea

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.780 

again<00:04:07.860> another<00:04:08.860> technique<00:04:09.280> which<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:09.640> could

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
again another technique which you could

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.000 
again another technique which you could
try<00:04:10.000> is<00:04:10.300> to<00:04:10.480> use<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:10.990> template<00:04:11.410> like<00:04:11.650> this<00:04:11.830> one

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
try is to use a template like this one

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.880 
try is to use a template like this one
so<00:04:12.670> just<00:04:13.030> draw<00:04:13.300> a<00:04:13.570> simple<00:04:13.990> shape<00:04:14.200> onto<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.680> piece

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
so just draw a simple shape onto a piece

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.860 
so just draw a simple shape onto a piece
of<00:04:15.070> paper<00:04:15.190> like<00:04:15.910> I've<00:04:16.090> drawn<00:04:16.359> this<00:04:16.600> flower

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
of paper like I've drawn this flower

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.720 
of paper like I've drawn this flower
shape<00:04:17.200> here<00:04:17.440> which<00:04:17.620> might<00:04:17.859> suit<00:04:18.130> customers

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
shape here which might suit customers

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.460 
shape here which might suit customers
that<00:04:18.910> have<00:04:19.030> a<00:04:19.060> more<00:04:19.390> traditional<00:04:19.570> kitchen<00:04:20.140> and

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
that have a more traditional kitchen and

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.040 
that have a more traditional kitchen and
then<00:04:21.310> blue<00:04:21.549> tack<00:04:21.820> it<00:04:21.970> to<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.240> inside<00:04:22.780> of<00:04:22.810> the

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
then blue tack it to the inside of the

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.530 
then blue tack it to the inside of the
jar<00:04:23.350> now<00:04:23.650> I've<00:04:24.340> been<00:04:24.610> doing<00:04:24.910> quite<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.150> lot<00:04:25.210> of

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
jar now I've been doing quite a lot of

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.060 
jar now I've been doing quite a lot of
painting<00:04:25.930> recently<00:04:26.350> so<00:04:26.560> I<00:04:26.620> feel<00:04:26.800> like<00:04:26.919> I've

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
painting recently so I feel like I've

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.700 
painting recently so I feel like I've
got<00:04:27.280> my<00:04:27.460> my<00:04:28.000> hand<00:04:28.300> in<00:04:28.510> but<00:04:29.140> if<00:04:29.230> you<00:04:29.260> want<00:04:29.560> to

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
got my my hand in but if you want to

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.260 
got my my hand in but if you want to
practice<00:04:29.950> especially<00:04:30.580> if<00:04:30.820> you've<00:04:30.940> got<00:04:31.090> new
