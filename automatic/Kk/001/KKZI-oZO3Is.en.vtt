00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.250 

in<00:00:03.740> the<00:00:04.700> last<00:00:04.850> video<00:00:05.060> we<00:00:05.330> saw<00:00:05.540> how<00:00:05.569> planar<00:00:06.109> and

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:06.260 
in the last video we saw how planar and

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.289 
in the last video we saw how planar and
planar<00:00:06.710> cut<00:00:07.040> can<00:00:07.549> essentially<00:00:07.910> create<00:00:08.270> a

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:08.299 
planar cut can essentially create a

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:10.570 
planar cut can essentially create a
plane<00:00:08.630> out<00:00:09.049> of<00:00:09.230> certain<00:00:09.559> area<00:00:10.010> in<00:00:10.219> our<00:00:10.370> model

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
plane out of certain area in our model

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.029 
plane out of certain area in our model
what<00:00:11.299> I'd<00:00:11.389> like<00:00:11.510> to<00:00:11.629> demonstrate<00:00:11.780> now<00:00:12.350> is<00:00:12.619> the

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:13.039 
what I'd like to demonstrate now is the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.570 
what I'd like to demonstrate now is the
planar<00:00:13.520> flatten<00:00:14.030> brush<00:00:14.650> now<00:00:15.650> I'm<00:00:16.100> going<00:00:16.490> to

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
planar flatten brush now I'm going to

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.970 
planar flatten brush now I'm going to
jump<00:00:16.880> and<00:00:17.090> grab<00:00:17.300> my<00:00:17.990> standard<00:00:18.529> brush<00:00:18.740> first

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
jump and grab my standard brush first

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.410 
jump and grab my standard brush first
because<00:00:19.400> we<00:00:19.519> want<00:00:19.670> to<00:00:19.730> make<00:00:19.849> this<00:00:19.970> surface

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
because we want to make this surface

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.630 
because we want to make this surface
slightly<00:00:20.750> uneven<00:00:23.859> and<00:00:24.859> i'm<00:00:25.279> just<00:00:25.429> going<00:00:25.519> to

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
slightly uneven and i'm just going to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.999 
slightly uneven and i'm just going to
elevate<00:00:25.849> portions<00:00:26.720> of<00:00:26.839> the<00:00:26.960> surface<00:00:27.380> and<00:00:27.890> then

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
elevate portions of the surface and then

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.370 
elevate portions of the surface and then
hold<00:00:28.220> the<00:00:28.279> Alt<00:00:28.490> key<00:00:28.609> and<00:00:28.939> kind<00:00:29.660> of<00:00:29.720> cut<00:00:29.900> down<00:00:30.169> in

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
hold the Alt key and kind of cut down in

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.080 
hold the Alt key and kind of cut down in
different<00:00:30.710> areas<00:00:31.990> so<00:00:33.100> if<00:00:34.100> we<00:00:34.220> were<00:00:34.460> to<00:00:34.520> use<00:00:34.760> the

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
different areas so if we were to use the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.180 
different areas so if we were to use the
planer<00:00:35.719> or<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:36.260> planer<00:00:36.500> cut<00:00:36.829> at<00:00:37.039> this<00:00:37.190> point

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
planer or the planer cut at this point

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.770 
planer or the planer cut at this point
you<00:00:40.190> can<00:00:40.340> see<00:00:40.520> that<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:40.879> planer<00:00:41.180> does<00:00:41.420> a<00:00:41.449> great

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
you can see that the planer does a great

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.560 
you can see that the planer does a great
job<00:00:41.809> at<00:00:42.350> taking<00:00:43.219> certain<00:00:43.789> areas<00:00:44.270> of<00:00:44.449> the

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
job at taking certain areas of the

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.900 
job at taking certain areas of the
surface<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.260> then<00:00:45.739> flattening<00:00:46.309> it<00:00:46.430> out<00:00:46.550> along

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
surface and then flattening it out along

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.330 
surface and then flattening it out along
a<00:00:46.969> plane<00:00:47.329> but<00:00:48.140> what<00:00:48.289> about<00:00:48.469> these<00:00:48.620> areas<00:00:49.100> that

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
a plane but what about these areas that

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.150 
a plane but what about these areas that
are<00:00:49.820> carved<00:00:50.750> into<00:00:51.079> the<00:00:51.289> surface<00:00:51.469> you<00:00:51.859> can<00:00:51.980> see

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
are carved into the surface you can see

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.130 
are carved into the surface you can see
it's<00:00:52.309> kind<00:00:52.519> of<00:00:52.550> just<00:00:52.699> sliding<00:00:53.449> along<00:00:53.539> here<00:00:53.989> but

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
it's kind of just sliding along here but

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.139 
it's kind of just sliding along here but
as<00:00:54.260> we<00:00:54.440> get<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:54.679> those<00:00:54.829> areas<00:00:55.160> it's<00:00:55.820> not<00:00:56.000> really

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
as we get to those areas it's not really

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.060 
as we get to those areas it's not really
doing<00:00:56.449> anything<00:00:56.750> with<00:00:56.989> it<00:00:57.019> this<00:00:57.500> is<00:00:57.679> where<00:00:57.920> the

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
doing anything with it this is where the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.799 
doing anything with it this is where the
planar<00:00:58.399> flatten<00:00:59.000> will<00:00:59.210> work<00:00:59.420> well<00:00:59.629> because

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
planar flatten will work well because

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.229 
planar flatten will work well because
not<00:01:00.079> only<00:01:00.109> does<00:01:00.500> it<00:01:00.559> push<00:01:01.039> down<00:01:01.579> and<00:01:01.910> kind<00:01:02.089> of

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
not only does it push down and kind of

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.880 
not only does it push down and kind of
flatten<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:02.719> surface<00:01:02.750> but<00:01:03.530> it<00:01:03.649> will<00:01:03.739> also

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
flatten the surface but it will also

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.160 
flatten the surface but it will also
pull<00:01:04.309> up<00:01:04.489> specific<00:01:05.059> areas<00:01:05.420> of<00:01:05.480> the<00:01:05.780> surface

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
pull up specific areas of the surface

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.380 
pull up specific areas of the surface
and<00:01:06.470> we're<00:01:06.650> going<00:01:06.770> to<00:01:06.800> select<00:01:07.280> our<00:01:07.700> planar

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
and we're going to select our planar

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.310 
and we're going to select our planar
flatten<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:10.540> you'll<00:01:11.540> notice<00:01:11.840> I'll<00:01:12.020> start

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
flatten and you'll notice I'll start

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.050 
flatten and you'll notice I'll start
again<00:01:12.470> by<00:01:12.830> selecting<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.460> plane<00:01:13.790> that<00:01:13.940> we're

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
again by selecting the plane that we're

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.670 
again by selecting the plane that we're
going<00:01:14.150> to<00:01:14.210> work<00:01:14.390> with<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:14.840> I'll<00:01:14.960> choose<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.200> flat

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
going to work with so I'll choose a flat

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.650 
going to work with so I'll choose a flat
area<00:01:15.890> right<00:01:16.280> around<00:01:16.400> here<00:01:16.820> on<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.180> cube<00:01:17.450> and

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
area right around here on the cube and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.900 
area right around here on the cube and
then<00:01:18.260> as<00:01:18.440> I<00:01:18.680> move<00:01:18.890> across<00:01:19.130> this<00:01:19.370> area<00:01:19.760> you're

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
then as I move across this area you're

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:20.830 
then as I move across this area you're
going<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.090> see<00:01:20.180> it's<00:01:20.330> going<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.510> continue

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
going to see it's going to continue

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.510 
going to see it's going to continue
flattening<00:01:21.500> that<00:01:21.680> out<00:01:21.830> just<00:01:22.100> as<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:22.370> would

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
flattening that out just as you would

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.330 
flattening that out just as you would
expect<00:01:23.170> just<00:01:24.170> like<00:01:24.320> with<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.590> planer<00:01:24.830> brushes

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
expect just like with the planer brushes

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.970 
expect just like with the planer brushes
but<00:01:25.490> as<00:01:25.670> we<00:01:25.850> get<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:26.150> these<00:01:26.440> deeper<00:01:27.440> areas<00:01:27.620> let

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
but as we get to these deeper areas let

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.120 
but as we get to these deeper areas let
me<00:01:28.100> make<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.340> larger<00:01:28.820> brush<00:01:29.030> size<00:01:29.300> here<00:01:29.980> as<00:01:30.980> we

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
me make a larger brush size here as we

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.740 
me make a larger brush size here as we
get<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.370> these<00:01:31.490> deeper<00:01:31.910> areas<00:01:32.060> you<00:01:32.450> can<00:01:32.540> see

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
get to these deeper areas you can see

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.090 
get to these deeper areas you can see
that<00:01:32.780> it's<00:01:33.020> going<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.230> go<00:01:33.590> ahead<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:33.860> clean

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
that it's going to go ahead and clean

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.130 
that it's going to go ahead and clean
those<00:01:34.250> up<00:01:34.310> as<00:01:34.610> well<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.600> we<00:01:35.630> can<00:01:35.840> actually

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
those up as well and we can actually

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.170 
those up as well and we can actually
continue<00:01:36.470> moving<00:01:36.950> off<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.400> cube<00:01:37.880> here

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
continue moving off the cube here

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.150 
continue moving off the cube here
because<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:38.510> can<00:01:38.630> see<00:01:38.840> it's<00:01:39.500> trying<00:01:40.070> to

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
because you can see it's trying to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.540 
because you can see it's trying to
continue<00:01:40.580> that<00:01:40.910> plane<00:01:41.300> off<00:01:42.010> into<00:01:43.010> space<00:01:43.160> and

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
continue that plane off into space and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.300 
continue that plane off into space and
it's<00:01:43.670> actually<00:01:43.900> elevating<00:01:44.900> specific<00:01:45.890> areas

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
it's actually elevating specific areas

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.590 
it's actually elevating specific areas
of<00:01:46.370> our<00:01:47.360> geometry<00:01:48.790> so<00:01:49.790> unlike<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.240> planar

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
of our geometry so unlike the planar

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.260 
of our geometry so unlike the planar
brush<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.230> planer<00:01:51.740> flattened<00:01:52.430> brush<00:01:52.640> will

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
brush the planer flattened brush will

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.710 
brush the planer flattened brush will
kind<00:01:53.720> of<00:01:54.430> plane<00:01:55.430> out<00:01:55.760> specific<00:01:56.330> areas<00:01:56.630> that

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
kind of plane out specific areas that

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.330 
kind of plane out specific areas that
are<00:01:56.810> elevated<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:57.500> other<00:01:57.740> areas<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.250> have

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
been carved into the surface and again

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.470 
been carved into the surface and again
just<00:02:00.710> like<00:02:00.860> we<00:02:01.040> looked<00:02:01.280> at<00:02:01.490> earlier<00:02:01.880> you<00:02:02.330> can

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
just like we looked at earlier you can

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.210 
just like we looked at earlier you can
see<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.840> embed<00:02:03.260> value<00:02:03.650> for<00:02:03.860> this<00:02:03.950> brush

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
see that the embed value for this brush

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.800 
see that the embed value for this brush
is<00:02:04.250> different<00:02:04.850> than<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.150> planer<00:02:05.390> brushes

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
is different than the planer brushes

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.440 
is different than the planer brushes
that<00:02:05.840> we<00:02:06.230> were<00:02:06.350> looking<00:02:06.680> at<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.070> also<00:02:07.760> to<00:02:08.000> new

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
that we were looking at and also to new

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.540 
that we were looking at and also to new
values<00:02:08.810> have<00:02:08.959> been<00:02:09.020> added<00:02:09.440> on<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:10.039> top<00:02:10.280> and

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
values have been added on the top and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.610 
values have been added on the top and
bottom<00:02:10.759> of<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.209> sphere

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
bottom of the sphere

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.800 
bottom of the sphere
