00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.470
 hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.019
 Alina Balaban 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.720
 and today we have with you a master class on 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:26.029
 new petal how does our 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.039
 petal like this if the tape is more 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.869
 tight yes so tough get here 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.430
 so here if more gently out 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.650
 round but the principle is the same 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.530
 Well, we start means we need to tape 5 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.600
 centimeters squared scissors and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.190
 lighter 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.059
 means we do we fold the tape 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.920
 together here and now we do further 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:59.299
 Now that times here have made and the 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.299
 fingers gently put a little bit 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:10.100
 there is still doing the same thing with 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.100
 the other side we fold and together 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.399
 there is 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.200
 the next thing we need to do is just 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:25.740
 neatly roll it like this 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.039
 through yes here we have such a basis yes 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:35.399
 it turns out and tidy it like this 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.399
 fold and fold in half as 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.450
 it turns out such a petal now 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.450
 we are pruning 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.030
 trimmed back 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.780
 In principle, everything works out like this 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.780
 interesting petal 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.860
 he will look very nice 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:27.420
 your some beautiful interesting 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.910
 Flowers, yes, look at it 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.110
 the tape is different 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.970
 tops up depending on stiffness but 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.570
 dear friends thank you all very much for 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.400

 try to create and you will succeed 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.420
