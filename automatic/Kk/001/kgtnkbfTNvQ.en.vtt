00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
like Moab's and stuff like that and

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.709 
like Moab's and stuff like that and
coincidentally<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.820> actually<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> double

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
coincidentally this is actually a double

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.260 
coincidentally this is actually a double
Moab<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.260> PP<00:00:58.530> 90<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.270> resistance

Moab with the PP 90 on resistance

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.810 
Moab with the PP 90 on resistance
playing<00:01:00.629> domination<00:01:01.370> not<00:01:02.370> sure<00:01:02.520> about<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
playing domination not sure about the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.329 
playing domination not sure about the
end<00:01:02.940> score<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.019> good<00:01:04.170> time<00:01:04.379> not<00:01:05.129> sure

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
end score that it's a good time not sure

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.789 
end score that it's a good time not sure
if<00:01:05.489> they're<00:01:05.670> super<00:01:06.030> quick<00:01:06.330> or<00:01:06.479> not<00:01:06.770> but<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
if they're super quick or not but I

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.140 
if they're super quick or not but I
believe<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> first<00:01:08.369> move<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.000> two

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
believe the first move is like two

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.539 
believe the first move is like two
minutes<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> guess<00:01:09.869> that's<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.350> kind<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.430> an

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
minutes so I guess that's a kind of an

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.399 
minutes so I guess that's a kind of an
okay<00:01:11.670> speed<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> second<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.200> actually

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
okay speed and the second one I actually

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.870 
okay speed and the second one I actually
have<00:01:13.920> no<00:01:13.950> idea<00:01:14.310> about<00:01:15.590> but<00:01:16.590> anyways<00:01:17.040> just

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
have no idea about but anyways just

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.010 
have no idea about but anyways just
thought<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:18.330> funny<00:01:18.420> because<00:01:18.720> I've

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
thought it was funny because I've

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.480 
thought it was funny because I've
uploaded<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.500> many<00:01:19.680> more<00:01:19.799> than<00:01:19.920> one<00:01:20.040> 43<00:01:20.220> videos

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
uploaded so many more than one 43 videos

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.609
