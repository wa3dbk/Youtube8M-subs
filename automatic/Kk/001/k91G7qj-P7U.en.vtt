00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
new car has got a smaller diesel engine

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.750 
new car has got a smaller diesel engine
it's<00:03:34.480> got<00:03:34.629> a<00:03:34.659> 1.6<00:03:34.930> liter<00:03:35.620> common-rail<00:03:36.370> diesel

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
injection turbo charged diesel compared

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.830 
injection turbo charged diesel compared
to<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.549> 2-liter<00:03:39.970> engine<00:03:40.180> that<00:03:40.480> was<00:03:40.569> there<00:03:40.750> in

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
to the 2-liter engine that was there in

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.470 
to the 2-liter engine that was there in
the<00:03:40.959> previous<00:03:41.319> generation<00:03:41.349> Elantra<00:03:42.220> but<00:03:43.030> this

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
the previous generation Elantra but this

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.149 
the previous generation Elantra but this
engine<00:03:43.900> has<00:03:44.019> been<00:03:44.140> tuned<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.530> make<00:03:44.680> more<00:03:44.890> power

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
engine has been tuned to make more power

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.210 
engine has been tuned to make more power
more<00:03:45.730> torque<00:03:45.790> so<00:03:46.659> overall<00:03:47.110> it<00:03:47.470> will<00:03:47.739> be<00:03:47.799> a<00:03:47.950> lot

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
more torque so overall it will be a lot

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.699 
more torque so overall it will be a lot
more<00:03:48.250> efficient<00:03:48.909> we<00:03:49.510> also<00:03:49.659> expect<00:03:50.140> it<00:03:50.319> to<00:03:50.409> be<00:03:50.530> a

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
more efficient we also expect it to be a

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.270 
more efficient we also expect it to be a
slightly<00:03:51.129> better<00:03:51.489> performer<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:53.799> petrol<00:03:54.189> on

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
slightly better performer the petrol on

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.039 
slightly better performer the petrol on
the<00:03:54.400> other<00:03:54.549> hand<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.909> is<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.239> same<00:03:55.480> 1.8
