sue<00:00:58.890> samsung<00:00:59.550> for<00:01:00.180> making<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.719> thinner<00:01:01.020> tablet

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
sue samsung for making a thinner tablet

I<00:01:01.649> personally<00:01:02.160> think<00:01:02.309> they<00:01:02.460> were<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:02.579> trying

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
I personally think they were just trying

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.420 
I personally think they were just trying
to<00:01:03.030> weaken<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.690> competition<00:01:04.430> considering

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
to weaken the competition considering

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.730 
to weaken the competition considering
that<00:01:05.460> Samsung<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> big<00:01:06.750> player<00:01:07.080> for<00:01:07.590> android

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
in another video actually but I just

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.140 
in another video actually but I just
think<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.439> pricing<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.340> wrong<00:01:20.610> they

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
think that the pricing is wrong they

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.420 
think that the pricing is wrong they
really<00:01:21.540> need<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.840> bring<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.680> pricing<00:01:23.220> down

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
really need to bring the pricing down

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.539 
really need to bring the pricing down
against<00:01:23.759> around<00:01:24.180> about<00:01:24.330> 150<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.350> 170<00:01:26.280> pound

tablet if you put the two devices side
by<00:01:42.600> side<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.320> think<00:01:44.100> what<00:01:44.399> Apple<00:01:45.030> were<00:01:45.119> doing

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
by side I think what Apple were doing

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.780 
by side I think what Apple were doing
was<00:01:45.630> saying<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.049> Samsung<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:47.490> did<00:01:47.640> make

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
was saying that Samsung really did make

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.749 
was saying that Samsung really did make
a<00:01:47.850> device<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.299> front<00:01:48.960> front<00:01:49.590> facing<00:01:50.100> look

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
a device that front front facing look

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.090 
a device that front front facing look
like<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.600> had<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.079> add<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> black<00:01:52.590> bezel

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
like and I had to add the black bezel

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.399 
like and I had to add the black bezel
and<00:01:53.220> really<00:01:54.119> they<00:01:54.509> did<00:01:54.810> look<00:01:54.990> very<00:01:55.020> very

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
and really they did look very very

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.139 
and really they did look very very
similar<00:01:56.180> also<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.329> fact<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.719> Samsung<00:01:58.969> did<00:01:59.969> a

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
similar also the fact that Samsung did a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.109 
similar also the fact that Samsung did a
UIL<00:02:00.810> user<00:02:01.140> interface<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:02.399> again<00:02:02.759> looked

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
UIL user interface that again looked

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.600 
UIL user interface that again looked
very<00:02:03.420> similar<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.020> icons<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:05.250> were<00:02:05.369> used

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
very similar to the icons that were used

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.630 
very similar to the icons that were used
in<00:02:05.790> iOS<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.799> think<00:02:07.890> that's<00:02:08.160> what<00:02:08.340> Apple

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
in iOS so I think that's what Apple

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.150 
in iOS so I think that's what Apple
we're<00:02:08.759> suing<00:02:08.970> them<00:02:09.209> for<00:02:09.530> now

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.430 
to weaken their position you could say
that<00:02:16.990> but<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:18.370> way<00:02:18.550> saw<00:02:19.180> trademark<00:02:19.840> law<00:02:20.080> works

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
be seen to be looking for those things

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.120 
be seen to be looking for those things
and<00:04:51.710> taking<00:04:52.460> them<00:04:52.759> down<00:04:53.000> if<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:54.289> case<00:04:54.500> arises

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
and taking them down if the case arises

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.580 
and taking them down if the case arises
so<00:04:55.550> it's<00:04:55.699> very<00:04:55.789> similar<00:04:56.180> if<00:04:56.720> Apple<00:04:57.410> see

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
so it's very similar if Apple see

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.650 
so it's very similar if Apple see
somebody<00:04:57.979> copy<00:04:58.190> in<00:04:58.370> their<00:04:58.520> products<00:04:58.910> they
