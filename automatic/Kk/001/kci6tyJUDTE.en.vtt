everywhere people don't realize what's

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.660 
everywhere people don't realize what's
going<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.439> their<00:00:25.589> crawlspace<00:00:26.070> with<00:00:26.550> all

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
going on in their crawlspace with all

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.640 
going on in their crawlspace with all
the<00:00:26.789> dirt<00:00:27.029> down<00:00:27.330> there<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.839> moisture<00:00:28.320> can

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the dirt down there and the moisture can

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.050 
the dirt down there and the moisture can
just<00:00:28.830> come<00:00:29.009> right<00:00:29.160> through<00:00:29.519> they<00:00:29.699> get<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> lot

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
just come right through they get a lot

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.579 
just come right through they get a lot
of<00:00:30.119> mold<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.689> routing<00:00:31.019> going<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.470> their

of mold and routing going on in their
crawl<00:00:31.740> spaces<00:00:31.980> there's<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.850> many<00:00:32.970> ways<00:00:33.180> for

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
crawl spaces there's so many ways for

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.780 
crawl spaces there's so many ways for
moisture<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.260> get<00:00:34.470> in<00:00:34.590> more<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.100> across<00:00:35.460> based

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
moisture to get in more so across based

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.760 
moisture to get in more so across based
on<00:00:35.970> a<00:00:36.000> basement<00:00:36.450> being<00:00:36.600> all<00:00:36.810> wide<00:00:36.990> open<00:00:37.410> we

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
on a basement being all wide open we

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.140 
on a basement being all wide open we
have<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.040> go<00:00:38.160> down<00:00:38.340> there<00:00:38.580> and<00:00:38.610> look<00:00:38.880> it<00:00:39.060> over

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
have to go down there and look it over

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.730 
have to go down there and look it over
the<00:00:39.690> first<00:00:39.900> thing<00:00:40.020> we're<00:00:40.140> going<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> look<00:00:40.500> at

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
the first thing we're going to look at

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.250 
the first thing we're going to look at
is<00:00:41.190> how<00:00:41.610> much<00:00:41.970> water's<00:00:42.570> down<00:00:42.810> there<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.170> we

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
is how much water's down there do we

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.170 
is how much water's down there do we
need<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.560> do<00:00:43.680> anything<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:44.280> drainage<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:45.150> a

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
need to do anything for drainage with a

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.510 
need to do anything for drainage with a
crawlspace<00:00:45.570> being<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> dirt<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.460> to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
crawlspace being in the dirt you have to

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.240 
crawlspace being in the dirt you have to
take<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.390> into<00:00:48.660> account<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:49.650> have<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> system

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
take that into account we have a system

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.980 
take that into account we have a system
that<00:00:50.280> we've<00:00:50.580> designed<00:00:50.760> called<00:00:51.240> a<00:00:51.450> smart<00:00:51.780> pipe

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
that we've designed called a smart pipe

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.930 
that we've designed called a smart pipe
and<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.590> designed<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.250> work<00:00:53.400> in<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.820> dirt

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
and it is designed to work in the dirt

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.790 
and it is designed to work in the dirt
so<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.300> doesn't<00:00:54.630> get<00:00:54.720> clogged<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.590> can

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
so it doesn't get clogged and it can

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.890 
so it doesn't get clogged and it can
drain<00:00:56.220> at<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.670> crawlspace<00:00:57.330> water<00:00:57.660> you're

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
drain at that crawlspace water you're

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.750 
drain at that crawlspace water you're
having<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.800> we're<00:00:58.890> doing<00:00:59.040> that<00:00:59.220> to<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> sump

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
having then we're doing that to a sump

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.000 
having then we're doing that to a sump
system<00:00:59.970> again<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:01.170> can't<00:01:01.380> always<00:01:01.560> get<00:01:01.860> in

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
system again you can't always get in

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.410 
system again you can't always get in
there<00:01:02.220> like<00:01:02.430> you'd<00:01:02.610> like<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.790> so<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.330> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
there like you'd like to so we have to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.450 
there like you'd like to so we have to
have<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.600> smaller<00:01:03.930> some<00:01:04.589> crack<00:01:04.860> system<00:01:05.309> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
have a smaller some crack system and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.070 
have a smaller some crack system and
then<00:01:05.580> again<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.970> still<00:01:06.210> need<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> good<00:01:06.720> sump

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
then again we still need a good sump

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.070 
then again we still need a good sump
pump<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.439> there<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:08.310> get<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.030> water<00:01:09.300> out<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
pump in there to get that water out the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.630 
pump in there to get that water out the
other<00:01:10.230> things<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.680> need<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.950> look<00:01:11.130> at<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
other things we need to look at is the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.730 
other things we need to look at is the
overall<00:01:11.670> moisture<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:12.840> need<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.200> seal<00:01:13.530> that

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
overall moisture we need to seal that

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.900 
overall moisture we need to seal that
crawlspace<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.610> don't<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:14.850> that

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
crawlspace so we don't have that

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.310 
crawlspace so we don't have that
moisture<00:01:15.420> coming<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.780> through<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.200> dirt

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
moisture coming up through the dirt

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.530 
moisture coming up through the dirt
anymore<00:01:16.650> now<00:01:17.460> what<00:01:17.610> we<00:01:17.730> do<00:01:17.880> there<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.120> we<00:01:18.270> use

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
anymore now what we do there is we use

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.899 
anymore now what we do there is we use
our<00:01:18.720> clean<00:01:18.990> spaced<00:01:19.320> lining<00:01:20.130> system<00:01:20.370> and<00:01:20.790> that

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
our clean spaced lining system and that

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.510 
our clean spaced lining system and that
goes<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.600> floor<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.230> up<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> wall<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
goes on the floor and up the wall and it

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.060 
goes on the floor and up the wall and it
seals<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.180> crawl<00:01:24.510> space<00:01:24.650> it<00:01:25.650> doesn't<00:01:25.920> allow

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
seals that crawl space it doesn't allow

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.890 
seals that crawl space it doesn't allow
the<00:01:26.100> moisture<00:01:26.370> come<00:01:26.790> through<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:27.750> to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the moisture come through we want to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.570 
the moisture come through we want to
make<00:01:28.050> sure<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.470> there's<00:01:28.650> no<00:01:28.800> vents<00:01:29.130> open<00:01:29.250> in

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
make sure that there's no vents open in

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.560 
make sure that there's no vents open in
that<00:01:29.730> crawl<00:01:29.970> space

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
that crawl space

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.450 
that crawl space
you<00:01:30.720> want<00:01:30.870> to<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.080> nice<00:01:31.230> dry<00:01:31.680> air<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.250> any

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
you want to have nice dry air and any

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.060 
you want to have nice dry air and any
air<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.880> bring<00:01:33.120> in<00:01:33.300> from<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.570> outside<00:01:34.070> it's

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
air you bring in from the outside it's

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.280 
air you bring in from the outside it's
not<00:01:35.310> always<00:01:35.580> dry<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.720> could<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:37.020> adding

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
not always dry and you could be adding

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.140 
not always dry and you could be adding
to<00:01:37.409> your<00:01:37.560> problem<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.190> you<00:01:38.370> had<00:01:38.550> your<00:01:38.700> basement

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
to your problem if you had your basement

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.180 
to your problem if you had your basement
windows<00:01:39.479> open<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.930> you're<00:01:40.080> in<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.500> basement<00:01:40.650> in

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
windows open and you're in a basement in

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.790 
windows open and you're in a basement in
the<00:01:41.970> summer<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.420> humidity<00:01:42.810> month<00:01:43.080> all<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
the summer and a humidity month all the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.469 
the summer and a humidity month all the
concrete<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.520> all<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> pipes<00:01:44.940> would<00:01:45.150> start

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
concrete and all the pipes would start

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.390 
concrete and all the pipes would start
to<00:01:45.630> get<00:01:45.750> damp<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.260> sweat<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.040> would<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.370> the

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
to get damp and sweat and would be the

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.980 
to get damp and sweat and would be the
same<00:01:47.700> thing<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.000> your<00:01:48.120> crawlspace<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:48.780> just

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
same thing in your crawlspace you just

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.060 
same thing in your crawlspace you just
wouldn't<00:01:49.200> see<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.440> because<00:01:49.650> you<00:01:49.740> weren't<00:01:49.920> down

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
wouldn't see it because you weren't down

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.039 
wouldn't see it because you weren't down
there<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.090> want<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.360> make<00:01:51.510> sure<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.900> have

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
there so we want to make sure we have

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.260 
there so we want to make sure we have
that<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.409> sealed<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.159> vents<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.850> everything

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that all sealed up vents and everything

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.760 
that all sealed up vents and everything
so<00:01:54.420> we<00:01:54.479> can't<00:01:54.720> allow<00:01:54.900> any<00:01:55.140> moisture<00:01:55.590> in

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
so we can't allow any moisture in

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.160 
so we can't allow any moisture in
in<00:01:56.430> fact<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.970> Wisconsin<00:01:57.600> they<00:01:57.690> actually

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
in fact in Wisconsin they actually

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.440 
in fact in Wisconsin they actually
updated<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.830> building<00:01:59.159> codes<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.670> they<00:02:00.270> no

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
updated the building codes and they no

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.300 
updated the building codes and they no
longer<00:02:00.479> recommend<00:02:01.470> venting<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.010> crawlspace

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
longer recommend venting a crawlspace

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.030 
longer recommend venting a crawlspace
when<00:02:02.790> constructing<00:02:03.330> one<00:02:03.479> after<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:04.740> get<00:02:04.860> that

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
when constructing one after we get that

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.620 
when constructing one after we get that
all<00:02:05.190> sealed<00:02:05.460> up<00:02:05.670> we<00:02:05.940> measure<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.420> humidity

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
all sealed up we measure the humidity

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.320 
all sealed up we measure the humidity
and<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:07.440> might<00:02:07.619> want<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.890> put<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.429> santur<00:02:09.000> dry<00:02:09.209> in

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
and we might want to put a santur dry in

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.969 
and we might want to put a santur dry in
our<00:02:09.450> crawl<00:02:09.629> space<00:02:09.899> as<00:02:10.110> well<00:02:10.349> just<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.799> the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
our crawl space as well just like the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.190 
our crawl space as well just like the
basement<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.489> dry<00:02:11.730> out<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.239> air<00:02:12.510> just

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
basement to dry out that air just

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.830 
basement to dry out that air just
because<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.769> have<00:02:14.040> moisture<00:02:14.670> in<00:02:14.849> there<00:02:15.090> again

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
because you have moisture in there again

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.149 
because you have moisture in there again
we<00:02:15.989> got<00:02:16.109> to<00:02:16.139> make<00:02:16.290> sure<00:02:16.439> it<00:02:16.560> stays<00:02:16.769> nice<00:02:16.950> and

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
we got to make sure it stays nice and

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:17.900 
we got to make sure it stays nice and
dry<00:02:17.279> well

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
dry well

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.950 
dry well
then<00:02:18.000> we're<00:02:18.150> going<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.300> take<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.540> look<00:02:18.750> at<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
then we're going to take a look at the

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.780 
then we're going to take a look at the
floor<00:02:19.170> joists<00:02:19.350> see<00:02:19.770> how<00:02:19.980> they<00:02:20.160> are<00:02:20.310> see<00:02:20.730> if

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
floor joists see how they are see if

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.640 
floor joists see how they are see if
they're<00:02:20.970> level<00:02:21.360> or<00:02:21.450> not<00:02:21.600> if<00:02:21.870> not<00:02:21.900> we<00:02:22.260> do<00:02:22.410> have<00:02:22.620> a

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
they're level or not if not we do have a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.470 
they're level or not if not we do have a
smart<00:02:23.100> jack<00:02:23.340> system<00:02:23.760> we<00:02:23.850> can<00:02:24.000> put<00:02:24.150> under<00:02:24.360> those

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
smart jack system we can put under those

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.510 
smart jack system we can put under those
floor<00:02:24.810> joists<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.230> support<00:02:26.040> them<00:02:26.250> and

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
floor joists to support them and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.310 
floor joists to support them and
possibly<00:02:26.730> get<00:02:27.300> them<00:02:27.480> back<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> more<00:02:28.080> level

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
possibly get them back to a more level

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.740 
possibly get them back to a more level
state<00:02:28.770> we<00:02:29.190> might<00:02:29.340> have<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.670> also<00:02:30.210> replace<00:02:30.480> some

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
state we might have to also replace some

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.120 
state we might have to also replace some
of<00:02:30.840> those<00:02:30.930> floor<00:02:31.260> joists<00:02:31.410> before<00:02:31.920> we<00:02:31.980> do<00:02:32.100> that

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
of those floor joists before we do that

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.790 
of those floor joists before we do that
and<00:02:32.310> get<00:02:32.610> some<00:02:32.850> good<00:02:33.300> solid<00:02:34.020> structure<00:02:34.650> back

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
and get some good solid structure back

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.570 
and get some good solid structure back
in<00:02:34.860> there<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.340> we<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:35.550> support<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.910> for<00:02:36.060> you

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.640 

you
