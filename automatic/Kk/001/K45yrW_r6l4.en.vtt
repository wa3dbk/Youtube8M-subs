extend<00:02:39.829> all<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.820> way<00:02:41.060> out<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.329> where<00:02:41.600> I<00:02:41.630> use<00:02:41.989> it

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
extend all the way out to where I use it

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.250 
extend all the way out to where I use it
standing<00:02:42.620> up<00:02:42.739> I<00:02:42.920> don't<00:02:43.130> do<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.489> often<00:02:43.730> but

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
standing up I don't do that often but

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.750 
standing up I don't do that often but
but<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:45.380> will<00:02:47.650> extend<00:02:48.650> far<00:02:49.010> enough<00:02:49.220> for<00:02:49.489> me<00:02:49.640> to

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
but it will extend far enough for me to

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.699 
but it will extend far enough for me to
video<00:02:50.090> standing<00:02:50.690> up<00:02:50.840> i<00:02:50.989> do<00:02:51.049> that<00:02:51.320> quite<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.620> bit
