still<00:01:10.200> between<00:01:10.470> our<00:01:10.800> actuator

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350

nine<00:01:12.560> points

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.950 

you<00:01:16.790> can<00:01:16.880> do<00:01:16.970> that<00:01:17.120> hopefully<00:01:17.480> you'll<00:01:17.810> be<00:01:17.840> able

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
you can do that hopefully you'll be able

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.070 
you can do that hopefully you'll be able
to<00:01:18.140> belt<00:01:18.320> round

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.820 

that's<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.320> goal

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
that's the goal

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.390 
that's the goal
aim<00:01:24.640> high<00:01:24.880> right

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:53.420 

can<00:01:30.640> you<00:01:30.790> stand<00:01:31.750> up<00:01:32.080> walk<00:01:32.710> around

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.750 

so<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.640> base<00:01:54.940> robot<00:01:55.540> that<00:01:56.020> you'll<00:01:56.980> see<00:01:57.250> shown

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
so the base robot that you'll see shown

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.810 
so the base robot that you'll see shown
in<00:01:58.000> a<00:01:58.060> little<00:01:58.300> bit<00:01:58.420> was<00:01:59.110> provided<00:01:59.920> by<00:01:59.950> Traulsen

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
in a little bit was provided by Traulsen

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.440 
in a little bit was provided by Traulsen
robotics<00:02:01.300> and<00:02:01.480> intra<00:02:01.750> monix<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.910> robot<00:02:04.360> is

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
robotics and intra monix so the robot is

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.350 
robotics and intra monix so the robot is
a<00:02:04.540> two<00:02:04.720> foot<00:02:04.960> tall<00:02:04.990> walking<00:02:05.530> robot<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.640> might

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
a two foot tall walking robot you might

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.150 
a two foot tall walking robot you might
think<00:02:07.630> it's<00:02:07.810> small<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.110> cheap<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.950> more

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
think it's small and cheap and more

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.560 
think it's small and cheap and more
accessible<00:02:09.580> than<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.789> big<00:02:09.940> robots<00:02:10.240> but<00:02:10.390> that

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
accessible than the big robots but that

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.880 
accessible than the big robots but that
tiny<00:02:10.810> little<00:02:10.899> robot<00:02:11.260> sitting<00:02:11.380> on<00:02:11.560> tail<00:02:11.740> right

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
tiny little robot sitting on tail right

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.260 
tiny little robot sitting on tail right
there<00:02:12.070> is<00:02:12.130> actually<00:02:12.690> $16,000<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:15.550> even<00:02:16.120> when

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
there is actually $16,000 so even when

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.090 
there is actually $16,000 so even when
the<00:02:16.300> robots<00:02:16.660> are<00:02:16.810> small<00:02:17.110> they<00:02:17.380> still<00:02:17.650> cost<00:02:17.860> a

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
the robots are small they still cost a

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.360 
the robots are small they still cost a
lot<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.310> money<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:20.260> robot<00:02:20.709> has<00:02:20.830> 10<00:02:21.130> threads

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
lot of money this robot has 10 threads

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.620 
lot of money this robot has 10 threads
and<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.670> would<00:02:21.790> say<00:02:21.940> it's<00:02:22.090> pretty<00:02:22.330> simplistic

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
and I would say it's pretty simplistic

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.550 
and I would say it's pretty simplistic
but<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.230> also<00:02:23.380> costs<00:02:24.720> $175,000<00:02:25.720> right<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:26.350> like

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
but it also costs $175,000 right so like

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.650 
but it also costs $175,000 right so like
this<00:02:27.400> that's<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.880> range<00:02:28.180> we're<00:02:28.360> talking

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
this that's the range we're talking

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.800 
this that's the range we're talking
about<00:02:30.150> Android<00:02:31.150> we're<00:02:31.330> going<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.510> be<00:02:31.570> able<00:02:31.660> to

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
about Android we're going to be able to

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.150 
about Android we're going to be able to
walk<00:02:31.989> in<00:02:32.140> front<00:02:32.260> I<00:02:32.440> dance<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.890> want<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.100> do

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
walk in front I dance you want to do

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.330 
walk in front I dance you want to do
that<00:02:33.280> after<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.640> big<00:02:33.760> runner<00:02:33.940> goes

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.680 

all<00:02:40.340> right<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:40.790> little<00:02:41.030> robot<00:02:41.150> Justin

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
all right so that little robot Justin

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.210 
all right so that little robot Justin
gets<00:02:41.810> first<00:02:42.050> steps<00:02:42.349> on<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.530> tabletop<00:02:42.860> right

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
gets first steps on the tabletop right

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.800 
gets first steps on the tabletop right
there<00:02:43.459> so<00:02:44.120> let's<00:02:44.150> give<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.569> round<00:02:44.720> of

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
there so let's give it a round of

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:54.149 
there so let's give it a round of
applause<00:02:49.870> all<00:02:50.870> right<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:51.650> we're<00:02:51.799> gonna<00:02:51.860> go<00:02:52.099> up

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.610 

this<00:02:55.159> robot<00:02:55.580> is<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.970> two-seater<00:02:56.569> driver<00:02:57.379> and

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
this robot is a two-seater driver and

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.009 
this robot is a two-seater driver and
back<00:02:57.739> will<00:02:57.920> be<00:02:58.040> yours<00:02:58.280> truly<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:59.629> gunner<00:02:59.870> in
