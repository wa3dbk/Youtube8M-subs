00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.829
 My name is Guy Michel Franca, I'm French 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.029
 and I'm a clinical psychologist. 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.739
 So for 25 years I have developed a method called "The Ethics of Human Relations" 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.089
 because I've always been interested 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.430
 to understand human behavior. 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.090
 The Ethics 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.000
 it is the art of happy living 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.090
 because simply when an individual comes to a certain one 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.630
 psychological maturity, naturally develops ethical behavior. 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.880
 When 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.109
 the individual can feel for example 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.600
 deep love of himself, 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.170
 it is no longer in the pretense of being loved. 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.750
 Therefore there are certain processes 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.860
 such envy, jealousy, 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.730
 the pleasure of making others feel guilty because they didn't answer my question 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.290
 that disappear, 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.160
 the individual no longer needs to use these processes. We essentially have 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.030
 two ways of relating: or I am in an inner fullness 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.140
 and at this point, I can give 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.070
 other 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.700
 in the report, 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.000
 I can share, cooperate; 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.800
 or I have an inner emptiness 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.330
 and I endeavor to find in the environment the element that can respond 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.830
 to fill this void. 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.850
 Actually in us 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.930
 there is a border, 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.570
 a border 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.470
 I absolutely need below 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.080
 to find something in my environment that satisfies me. 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.430
 Passing this border, 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.170
 the individual is in an internal state 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.170
 of fullness. 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.520
 When the individual goes beyond the boundaries of thought, 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.060
 obviously 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.779
 goes to overtake 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.319
 all his fears, 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.829
 shame goes overtaking 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:17.039
 all the factors that limit creativity. 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:19.360
 I have to be creative 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.669
 do by definition something that no one has done, 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:27.249
 so I have to be able to connect my thoughts together and from this 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.569
 connection must be born something new. 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.959
 Well. If my thoughts are 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.559
 directed to prove everyone 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.279
 how good i am 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:39.709
 how worthy I am 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.340
 how my friends must be because me 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.129
 I have certain values, and so on and so forth, 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.889
 my creativity will be limited to these dimensions. 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:56.199
 Indeed, I would say more: when there is a way to teach dirigiste, where 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.859
 too strict rules are given, 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.829
 the child lowers his level of creativity, because he is afraid of what? Of the judgment. 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.599
 But what is judgment? It is nothing but the projection of an external model, 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.409
 on me, to which I do not correspond. 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.199
 But if I don't match that model, can I match a different model? 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:18.849
 And the whole key is there. 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.829
 Many have said: "We are our culture". It is true up to a certain point. 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.719
 I say: we are 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.929
 and we have the culture we have. 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:34.939
 This means that I no longer identify myself with my culture, which means that 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:40.889
 I can get out of this culture, whatever it is, to express my creativity. 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.899
 And this. And I don't make a dissociation. 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:46.160
 Ok? Many have defined 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.160
 creativity, indeed, even in the past centuries (no? I think of Van Gogh, I think of many poets too 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.449
 who wrote having taken drugs), that is: I have to be in another state to be able to create. 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.699
 And this creates a dissociation of the mind. 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.149
 Ok? So, me 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:12.149
 I think that creativity can be achieved in a total unity of mind. Ok? I'm not 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:16.900
 someone different when I'm creative. 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.449
 This creativity should be developed. 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.659
 Then one might ask: "But why 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:26.029
 if this is so 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:29.879
 we observe that in reality 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.659
 are there power systems, systems that tend to standardize culture? 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.389
 Why this?". 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.999
 Well, because it's simply not convenient 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:41.340
 to those with power. 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.770
 Who has a power must be able to order things, must be able to manage minds. 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.650
 Who has power 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.710
 does not agree that people can think for themselves, 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.469
 that may be in that creation. Indeed, 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:01.599
 Internet: 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.099
 Internet is scary. But scary to whom? Not to creatives, 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.999
 indeed, it's scary to whom 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:14.999
 he is afraid of this Creativity. And the miracle of the Internet, in my opinion, is just that, that is: we'll get there 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:23.560
 at a point where what is really important is the exchange. And I think the future is really right 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.560
 sharing this complexity. 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.400
