00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
get belts up on him because this girl

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.400 
get belts up on him because this girl
forced<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.450> pull<00:03:01.630> downs<00:03:01.810> from<00:03:01.959> them<00:03:02.170> down

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.970 
because the road knows he's getting swap
G<00:03:04.420> he<00:03:04.840> starts<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.200> pull<00:03:05.320> out<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.440> bit<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.799> he

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
G he starts to pull out a bit and he

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.229 
G he starts to pull out a bit and he
even<00:03:06.070> used<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.430> step<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.760> me<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:06.970> get<00:03:07.090> away<00:03:07.150> from
