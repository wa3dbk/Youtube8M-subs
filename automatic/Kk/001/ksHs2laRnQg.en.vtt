00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 and what's up we're here what mission 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.230
 believe and we will bring a new object 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.090
 that still has no name or anything but 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:13.290
 that we already know what he does here he puts that 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.150
 is item 3,285 and is a walking object 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.960
 that by the way they do not have planned 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.470
 put it in the next patch 5.4 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.830
 and it is an object that gives 120 of pepe 7% of 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.449
 movement and the passive works from a 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.980
 way similar to the static dagger but 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.649
 version of ap meaning when doing spells 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.630
 they do damage that bounces 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.829
 enemies also that scale ap by 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.980
 true 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.989
 and mounts with the several necessarily 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.310
 big and with the leader guys that the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.140
 never agree on the name in Spanish 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.050
 let's see how it works I have if in 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.920
 load and with the basic hits does not jump 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.190
 but if one meto q 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.219
 then there you have seen that it has bounced 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.039
 they hardly look good but it is true that 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.860
 it comes out we have 52 charges and if we make a 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.870
 spell over 20 as you see we are going to 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.660
 load it at all 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.370
 As you can see, it will be loaded by examining 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.170
 skills so champions that can 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.960
 skills like six etc are going to 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.720
 benefit a lot we are going to put an e 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.830
 so that it bounces well on the edge 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.050
 and my god you can barely see the effect and I 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.970
 honestly I do not see it but if you look 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.910
 the numbers of the damage it does 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.590
 an item that is going to have enough future 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.230
 especially for the age that a 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.760
 contribution to a law that is very good and that 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.040
 extra movement speed there 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:45.010
 many champions with little mobility 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.010
 It will come very well as soon as 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.490
 know when they are going to put the object what 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.040
 I will put a comment something I hope you 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.530
 have you liked to tell me what has 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.550
 like this new favorite live object 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.160
 italy soles that helps a lot 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.290
 anything to robock imation crane 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:10.229
 where they were going to be a total that the colleague 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:10.229
 the object to the bug is that we see
