00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
it's pretty much instant all the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.990 
it's pretty much instant all the
transactions<00:01:17.009> I've<00:01:17.159> ever<00:01:17.340> done<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.970> been

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
transactions I've ever done have been

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.200 
transactions I've ever done have been
under<00:01:18.420> $30<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.229> therefore<00:01:19.799> they've<00:01:19.950> all<00:01:20.130> been

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
under $30 and therefore they've all been

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.260 
under $30 and therefore they've all been
however<00:01:22.050> if<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.830> do<00:01:23.010> have<00:01:23.370> a<00:01:23.400> transaction<00:01:23.850> I

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
however if you do have a transaction I

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.060 
however if you do have a transaction I
believe<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.720> over<00:01:24.780> 100<00:01:25.170> dollars<00:01:25.230> and<00:01:25.650> it's

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
believe it's over 100 dollars and it's

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.740 
believe it's over 100 dollars and it's
not<00:01:26.220> going<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.490> instant<00:01:26.850> unfortunately<00:01:27.570> I

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
not going to be instant unfortunately I

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.590 
not going to be instant unfortunately I
will<00:01:28.200> clear<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.710> through<00:01:29.060> through<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.210> square

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
will clear it through through the square

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.050 
will clear it through through the square
team<00:01:30.810> look<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:32.100> also<00:01:32.550> a<00:01:32.580> really<00:01:32.940> great

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
team look at it but also a really great

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.450 
team look at it but also a really great
thing<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.200> actually<00:01:34.590> has<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.010> limit

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
thing is that it actually has a limit

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.430 
thing is that it actually has a limit
okay<00:01:36.090> okay<00:01:36.540> maybe<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.930> limits<00:01:37.170> not<00:01:37.260> a<00:01:37.290> great

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
okay okay maybe a limits not a great

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.710 
okay okay maybe a limits not a great
thing<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.220> limits<00:01:38.460> $5,000<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.330> week<00:01:39.390> as

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
thing but the limits $5,000 a week as

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.290 
thing but the limits $5,000 a week as
far<00:01:40.050> as<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.320> remember<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.820> really<00:01:42.270> are

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
far as I remember so you really are

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.250 
far as I remember so you really are
going<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.510> be<00:01:42.570> running<00:01:42.810> into<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.080> too<00:01:43.229> much

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
going to be running into that too much

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.630 
going to be running into that too much
less<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.650> start<00:01:43.860> trying<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> use<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.460> for

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
less you start trying to use it for

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.520 
less you start trying to use it for
business<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.840> reduced<00:01:46.080> me<00:01:46.229> sending

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
business but it reduced me sending

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.590 
business but it reduced me sending
