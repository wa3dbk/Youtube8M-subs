run<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:37.790> right<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.240> and<00:03:39.110> you<00:03:39.530> can<00:03:39.800> did<00:03:40.250> you

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
run that right it and you can did you

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.180 
run that right it and you can did you
have<00:03:40.550> to<00:03:40.670> learn<00:03:40.820> how<00:03:40.880> to<00:03:41.000> do<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.210> goofy<00:03:41.990> way<00:03:42.190> on

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
have to learn how to do a goofy way on

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.330 
have to learn how to do a goofy way on
regular<00:03:43.970> I<00:03:44.590> read<00:03:45.590> it<00:03:45.680> this<00:03:45.860> way<00:03:47.350> IQ<00:03:48.350> fees<00:03:48.680> put

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
regular I read it this way IQ fees put

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:57.940 
regular I read it this way IQ fees put
the<00:03:49.490> right<00:03:49.730> foot<00:03:50.000> on<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.330> tip<00:03:51.730> so<00:03:56.530> that's<00:03:57.530> just

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
the right foot on the tip so that's just

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.460 
the right foot on the tip so that's just
a<00:03:58.160> little<00:03:58.190> of<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.880> inside<00:03:59.480> scoop<00:03:59.780> of<00:04:00.020> the<00:04:00.290> wave

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
a little of the inside scoop of the wave

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.250 
a little of the inside scoop of the wave
the<00:04:00.830> wave<00:04:00.860> board<00:04:01.400> is<00:04:02.000> also<00:04:02.390> better<00:04:02.720> than

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
the wave board is also better than

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.860 
the wave board is also better than
RipStik<00:04:03.920> they<00:04:04.790> think<00:04:05.060> that<00:04:05.240> so<00:04:05.420> don't<00:04:05.630> get<00:04:05.690> the

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
RipStik they think that so don't get the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.690 
RipStik they think that so don't get the
rip<00:04:06.020> stick<00:04:06.200> at<00:04:06.320> all<00:04:06.410> just<00:04:07.070> a<00:04:07.190> written<00:04:07.459> both

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
rip stick at all just a written both

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.449 
rip stick at all just a written both
wave<00:04:08.660> board<00:04:08.990> is<00:04:09.200> much<00:04:09.620> much<00:04:09.860> easier<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:10.340> learn

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
wave board is much much easier to learn

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.780 
wave board is much much easier to learn
I<00:04:10.870> had<00:04:11.870> so<00:04:12.020> much<00:04:12.170> trouble<00:04:12.440> learning<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.640> ride

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
I had so much trouble learning to ride

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.260 
I had so much trouble learning to ride
the<00:04:13.940> rip<00:04:14.120> stick<00:04:14.540> when<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:14.870> when<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:15.230> first<00:04:16.209> got<00:04:17.209> on

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
the rip stick when I when I first got on

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.490 
the rip stick when I when I first got on
one<00:04:17.600> I<00:04:17.750> buy<00:04:18.140> it

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
one I buy it

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.960 
one I buy it
flash<00:04:18.770> the<00:04:19.010> time<00:04:19.220> to<00:04:19.370> write<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.520> for<00:04:19.700> about<00:04:19.790> an

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
flash the time to write it for about an

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.520 
flash the time to write it for about an
hour<00:04:20.060> or<00:04:20.780> so<00:04:22.480> and<00:04:23.480> I<00:04:23.630> could<00:04:23.810> not<00:04:23.930> get<00:04:24.080> far<00:04:24.350> off

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
hour or so and I could not get far off

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.860 
hour or so and I could not get far off
but<00:04:24.980> with<00:04:25.100> this<00:04:25.340> it<00:04:25.670> only<00:04:25.850> took<00:04:26.150> me<00:04:26.330> out<00:04:26.540> it's

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
but with this it only took me out it's

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.830 
but with this it only took me out it's
certainly<00:04:27.230> about<00:04:27.410> 30<00:04:27.860> minutes<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.580> get<00:04:29.570> how<00:04:29.780> to

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
certainly about 30 minutes to get how to

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.600 
certainly about 30 minutes to get how to
work<00:04:30.080> it<00:04:31.240> so<00:04:32.240> wave<00:04:32.630> board<00:04:33.110> and<00:04:33.500> rip<00:04:34.190> stick<00:04:34.430> out

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
work it so wave board and rip stick out

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.680 
work it so wave board and rip stick out
lipstick<00:04:35.210> out<00:04:35.510> live<00:04:36.170> board<00:04:36.410> in<00:04:36.970> USA<00:04:38.000> okay<00:04:38.330> so

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
lipstick out live board in USA okay so

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.510 
lipstick out live board in USA okay so
yeah<00:04:38.900> go<00:04:39.530> do<00:04:39.710> 97<00:04:40.430> is<00:04:40.700> bounce
