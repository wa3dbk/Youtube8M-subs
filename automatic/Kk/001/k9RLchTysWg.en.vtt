00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340 

there<00:00:00.179> you<00:00:00.240> go<00:00:00.299> Richmond<00:00:00.659> Virginia<00:00:00.750> right<00:00:01.230> on

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
there you go Richmond Virginia right on

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.980 
there you go Richmond Virginia right on
up<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.589> i-64<00:00:02.310> here's<00:00:02.610> i-95<00:00:03.270> in<00:00:03.449> Washington<00:00:03.959> DC

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
up to i-64 here's i-95 in Washington DC

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.050 
up to i-64 here's i-95 in Washington DC
so<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.710> shake<00:00:04.950> would<00:00:05.160> be<00:00:05.310> really<00:00:05.609> on<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.850> west

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
so the shake would be really on the west

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.000 
so the shake would be really on the west
end<00:00:06.299> of<00:00:06.540> richmond<00:00:07.020> virginia<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.620> then<00:00:07.919> all

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
end of richmond virginia and then all

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.379 
end of richmond virginia and then all
the<00:00:08.040> way<00:00:08.130> back<00:00:08.220> up<00:00:08.580> here<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.000> east<00:00:09.179> of

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
the way back up here to the east of

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.020 
the way back up here to the east of
Charlottesville<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.230> that's<00:00:10.710> where<00:00:11.010> 5.8<00:00:11.940> is

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
Charlottesville and that's where 5.8 is

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.669 
Charlottesville and that's where 5.8 is
there<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> very<00:00:12.750> strong<00:00:12.900> shake<00:00:13.469> we're

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
there is a very strong shake we're

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.499 
there is a very strong shake we're
talking<00:00:13.950> about<00:00:14.130> something<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.519> in<00:00:14.730> California

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
talking about something in in California

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.910 
talking about something in in California
that<00:00:15.660> would<00:00:15.750> really<00:00:15.900> bring<00:00:16.199> some<00:00:16.500> buildings

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
that would really bring some buildings

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 
that would really bring some buildings
down<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.279> i<00:00:17.369> can<00:00:17.550> assume<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.150> i<00:00:18.720> think<00:00:18.930> you

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
down so i can assume and i think you

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.570 
down so i can assume and i think you
probably<00:00:19.109> all<00:00:19.439> can<00:00:19.680> as<00:00:19.890> well<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.369> there's

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
probably all can as well that there's

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.830 
probably all can as well that there's
going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.939> be<00:00:20.970> some<00:00:21.240> damage<00:00:21.539> here<00:00:21.570> either

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
going to be some damage here either

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.480 
going to be some damage here either
whether<00:00:22.109> it's<00:00:22.320> two<00:00:22.529> buildings<00:00:23.010> whether<00:00:23.279> it

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
whether it's two buildings whether it

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.550 
whether it's two buildings whether it
might<00:00:23.609> be<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.970> structures<00:00:24.560> infrastructure

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
might be the structures infrastructure

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.050 
might be the structures infrastructure
including<00:00:25.949> probably<00:00:26.400> some<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.789> bridges

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
including probably some of the bridges

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.910 
including probably some of the bridges
and<00:00:27.420> overpasses<00:00:27.480> we'll<00:00:28.410> all<00:00:28.590> have<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.800> be

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
and overpasses we'll all have to be

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.189 
and overpasses we'll all have to be
inspected<00:00:29.310> up<00:00:29.580> there<00:00:29.760> out<00:00:30.179> west<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.810> richmond

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
inspected up there out west of richmond

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.830 
inspected up there out west of richmond
on<00:00:31.349> i-64<00:00:32.189> as<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.790> pretty<00:00:33.059> big<00:00:33.239> shake<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.600> still

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
on i-64 as a pretty big shake we still

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.420 
on i-64 as a pretty big shake we still
have<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.260> depth<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> problem

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
have the depth and this is the problem

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.040 
have the depth and this is the problem
to<00:00:35.579> go<00:00:35.700> back<00:00:35.850> up<00:00:35.880> here<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.870> all

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
to go back up here this is this is all

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.660 
to go back up here this is this is all
real<00:00:37.290> time<00:00:37.559> since<00:00:37.860> all<00:00:38.040> literally<00:00:38.340> just

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
real time since all literally just

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.319 
real time since all literally just
coming<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.300> depth<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.020> only<00:00:40.370> 3.7<00:00:41.370> miles<00:00:41.579> that

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
coming in a depth of only 3.7 miles that

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.840 
coming in a depth of only 3.7 miles that
is<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> shallow<00:00:43.020> quake<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:44.010> means<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.430> you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
is a shallow quake that means that you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.160 
is a shallow quake that means that you
don't<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.180> lot<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.390> padding<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:46.020> don't

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
don't have a lot of padding you don't

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.560 
don't have a lot of padding you don't
have<00:00:46.350> let's<00:00:46.620> say<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.920> 20<00:00:47.520> mile<00:00:47.730> or<00:00:47.940> 30<00:00:48.239> mile

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
have let's say a 20 mile or 30 mile

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.229 
have let's say a 20 mile or 30 mile
padding<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.500> rocks<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.280> baby<00:00:50.489> won't<00:00:50.730> shakes

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
padding of rocks that baby won't shakes

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.670 
padding of rocks that baby won't shakes
a<00:00:51.360> lot<00:00:51.480> down<00:00:51.690> here<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.170> doesn't<00:00:52.410> shake<00:00:52.530> at

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
a lot down here but it doesn't shake at

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.350 
a lot down here but it doesn't shake at
the<00:00:52.800> surface<00:00:53.010> when<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.670> surface<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
shakes only 3.7 miles away that surface

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.130 
shakes only 3.7 miles away that surface
shake<00:00:57.210> was<00:00:57.329> pretty<00:00:57.539> good<00:00:57.719> go<00:00:57.840> ahead<00:00:57.870> day<00:00:58.079> do

we<00:01:53.670> will<00:01:53.850> see<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.270> shake<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.720> I'm<00:01:54.869> looking

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
we will see this shake and I'm looking

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.929 
we will see this shake and I'm looking
at<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> couple<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.649> lakes<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.610> things<00:01:56.790> around

at a couple of lakes and things around

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.139 
at a couple of lakes and things around
here<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.450> no<00:01:57.689> real<00:01:58.020> cities<00:01:58.530> under<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.730 
here but no real cities under the
epicenter<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.540> farther<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.990> get<00:02:01.110> away<00:02:01.170> 10

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
