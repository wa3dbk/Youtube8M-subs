00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
however this on the authentic is real I

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.290 
however this on the authentic is real I
mean<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.330> is<00:02:31.450> bigger<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.400> smaller<00:02:33.880> on

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
mean it is bigger and it is smaller on

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.940 
mean it is bigger and it is smaller on
here<00:02:36.450> also<00:02:37.450> this<00:02:38.230> one<00:02:38.440> holds<00:02:38.740> its<00:02:38.920> shape

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
here also this one holds its shape

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.490 
here also this one holds its shape
better<00:02:39.310> than<00:02:39.730> this<00:02:39.880> one<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.960> really<00:02:41.290> doesn't

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
better than this one it really doesn't

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.630 
better than this one it really doesn't
have<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.740> circular<00:02:42.340> or<00:02:42.550> rounded<00:02:43.300> shape<00:02:44.640> since

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
have a circular or rounded shape since

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.870 
have a circular or rounded shape since
