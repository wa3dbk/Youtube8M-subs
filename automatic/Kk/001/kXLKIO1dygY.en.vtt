00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
one time to keep the first we're looking

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.910 
one time to keep the first we're looking
back<00:00:20.820> then<00:00:20.970> run<00:00:21.090> away<00:00:21.120> right<00:00:21.990> because<00:00:22.650> if<00:00:22.830> you

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
back then run away right because if you

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.820 
back then run away right because if you
have<00:00:23.010> an<00:00:23.510> infinite<00:00:24.510> levels<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.290> the<00:00:25.350> fair<00:00:25.650> play

have an infinite levels on the fair play
Ultraman<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.850> keep<00:00:27.000> on<00:00:27.120> back<00:00:27.300> flipping<00:00:27.570> it

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
Ultraman you keep on back flipping it

Ultraman you keep on back flipping it
back<00:00:27.780> them<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.200> the<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.500> know<00:00:28.590> hitting<00:00:28.800> them

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
back them to the you know hitting them

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.290 
back them to the you know hitting them
one<00:00:29.070> time<00:00:29.220> keep<00:00:29.460> flipping<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:29.910> not<00:00:30.060> whether

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
one time keep flipping it's not whether

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.139 
one time keep flipping it's not whether
it's<00:00:30.810> long<00:00:31.140> again<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:32.129> in<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> round<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.879> mean

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
it's long again you in the round I mean

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.540 
it's long again you in the round I mean
that's<00:00:33.300> kind<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.570> went<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:34.050> my<00:00:34.170> book<00:00:34.430> you<00:00:35.430> know

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
that's kind of went in my book you know

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.729 
that's kind of went in my book you know
I<00:00:35.900> like<00:00:36.900> them<00:00:37.050> from<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.230> corner<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.680> I

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
I like them from the corner but that I

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.940 
I like them from the corner but that I
don't<00:00:37.950> like<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.810> well<00:00:39.810> it<00:00:40.470> again<00:00:40.770> with

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
don't like it well it again with

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.440 
don't like it well it again with
infinite<00:00:41.310> corners<00:00:41.640> they<00:00:41.790> live<00:00:42.030> harvester<00:00:42.420> to

infinite corners they live harvester to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.020 
infinite corners they live harvester to
be<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.630> mold<00:00:42.899> where<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.470> can<00:00:43.649> actually<00:00:43.800> run<00:00:44.340> and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
be a mold where you can actually run and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.470 
be a mold where you can actually run and
catch<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.960> opponent<00:00:46.410> after<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.520> some<00:00:48.000> some

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
dash and i believe on up to no I don't

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.370 
dash and i believe on up to no I don't
think<00:00:59.940> that's<00:01:00.120> what<00:01:00.630> without<00:01:00.930> 4tube<00:01:01.230> I

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
think that's what without 4tube I

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.200 
think that's what without 4tube I
believe<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.980> whether<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.460> person<00:01:02.790> is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
believe that is whether that person is

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.810 
believe that is whether that person is
in<00:01:03.629> case<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.229> was<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> small<00:01:04.680> short<00:01:05.280> dash<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
in case it was a small short dash a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.389 
in case it was a small short dash a
small<00:01:06.420> short<00:01:06.750> dash<00:01:06.990> there<00:01:07.979> needs<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
small short dash there needs to be a

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:09.739 
small short dash there needs to be a
more<00:01:08.670> where<00:01:08.880> there's<00:01:09.090> actually<00:01:09.509> the<00:01:09.569> wrong

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:09.749 
more where there's actually the wrong

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:12.800 
more where there's actually the wrong
move<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.259> just<00:01:10.740> those<00:01:10.950> infinite<00:01:11.340> stages<00:01:11.880> now

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
move on just those infinite stages now

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.059 
move on just those infinite stages now
they<00:01:12.959> might<00:01:13.109> want<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.469> actually<00:01:13.560> consider

00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:14.069 
they might want to actually consider

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:16.809 
they might want to actually consider
know<00:01:14.429> but<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.149> kind<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.389> changes<00:01:15.749> up<00:01:15.899> the

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:16.819 
know but it kind of changes up the

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.550 
know but it kind of changes up the
play-in<00:01:17.819> game<00:01:18.299> mechanics<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.079> I<00:01:19.289> mean

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
play-in game mechanics but I mean

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.039 
play-in game mechanics but I mean
honestly<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.279> mean<00:01:20.609> to<00:01:20.850> eat<00:01:21.029> is<00:01:21.299> my<00:01:21.539> it's<00:01:21.810> not

single bottoms in it again work some

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.010 
single bottoms in it again work some
characters<00:01:30.149> in<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.299> back<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> know<00:01:30.719> what

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
characters in the back you know what

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.480 
characters in the back you know what
characters<00:01:31.439> jumping<00:01:31.799> back<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.459> other

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.980 
character is jumping in other direction
how<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.729> there<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:35.909> infinite<00:01:36.420> spaces<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
how can there be infinite spaces the

how can there be infinite spaces the

oven character never moves for then you

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.309 
oven character never moves for then you
limit<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.819> to<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:39.090> into<00:01:39.359> that<00:01:39.389> corner<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.289> I

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
limit it to be into that corner so I

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.980 
limit it to be into that corner so I
