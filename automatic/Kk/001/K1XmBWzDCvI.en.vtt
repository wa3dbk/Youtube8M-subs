00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:04.980
 reversible it's a whole range of bags recolor functional the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.970
 practice 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.789
 made of a recovery material 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:11.609
 which is the advertising tarp in amp and let 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:16.099
 but beyond the product and it is possible a responsible solution for 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.320
 answer to a problem that is that of the end of life of these tarpaulins in 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.349
 effect this material cultivates a true paradox that is to say a duration 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.579
 ephemeral used a few days to a few weeks or more and a duration 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.630
 of life which is almost unlimited since it is a material that is not 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.250
 biodegradable so to recover them 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.550
 and then that we transmit this march 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.590
 % in the inverted blues and for those who can not be used by mr 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.640
 target 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.250
 for proof to put it back in the circuit the textile belgium is liable price 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.470
 she has a very very nice idea to work 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.130
 every time suddenly it allows us to write each time a copy that 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.990
 will never be the same model twice it's impossible it's very 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.390
 strong is fragile 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.500
 his crossing 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.150
 the market ended up cracking in tbilisi is usually on a 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.989
 product 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.590
 and he is invisible 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.450
 for example 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.450
 choosing to locate activities in China by the crisis 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.940
 we do not say it pregnant 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.180
 On the other hand 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.330
 but unemployment and other countries of the oci when the product is manufactured 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.330
 part of the dams that are used 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.750
 to simplify that if dams that are connoted unused are 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.470
 used as cyclic thanks to that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.470
 apple that as such 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.720
 end-of-life reversal when we can over 50 countries 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.260
 with the address of the famous voice are heard 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.090
 acetylsalicylic acid estimate 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.760
 art at the end of life 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.230
 television pictures so we can 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.670
 to enter the dance 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.670
 believing that this a recycling technique 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.100
 facing romania 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.000
 the basic raw materials the earth is double 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.270
 the first is constantly the products to use 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.399
 we will have to treat them in exchange for these releases 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.399
 the second rank to various tasks it's from the articles 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.159
 in the light of new raw materials 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.329
 we will have to reproduce raw materials 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.159
 they are already there they have not succeeded
