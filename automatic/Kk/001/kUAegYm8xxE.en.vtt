in<00:01:02.949> our<00:01:03.129> DNA<00:01:03.160> to<00:01:03.940> be<00:01:05.130> meticulous<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:06.399> hence

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
in our DNA to be meticulous and hence

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:12.499 
in our DNA to be meticulous and hence
the<00:01:08.289> same<00:01:08.590> level<00:01:09.340> of<00:01:09.990> fussiness<00:01:10.990> over<00:01:11.470> how<00:01:11.800> our

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
the same level of fussiness over how our

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.580 
the same level of fussiness over how our
waxes<00:01:13.509> are<00:01:13.600> created<00:01:14.050> and<00:01:14.170> that's<00:01:14.320> how<00:01:14.530> we

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
waxes are created and that's how we

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.219 
waxes are created and that's how we
connected<00:01:15.280> with<00:01:15.429> solid<00:01:15.789> scape<00:01:16.000> there<00:01:16.960> isn't

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
connected with solid scape there isn't

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.650 
connected with solid scape there isn't
another<00:01:17.470> technology<00:01:17.860> that<00:01:18.520> that<00:01:19.330> can<00:01:19.509> get

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
another technology that that can get

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.940 
another technology that that can get
surface<00:01:20.050> quality<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.770> detail<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.550> that<00:01:21.700> level

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.080 

so<00:01:26.549> we're<00:01:26.700> growing<00:01:26.969> our<00:01:27.240> business<00:01:27.740> in<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.159> in

so we're growing our business in the in
the<00:01:30.149> devotion<00:01:30.780> brand<00:01:31.289> every<00:01:32.159> piece<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.549> a

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
the devotion brand every piece is a

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.760 
the devotion brand every piece is a
special<00:01:33.000> order<00:01:33.299> there's<00:01:33.630> there<00:01:34.289> are<00:01:34.350> no<00:01:34.439> heads

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
special order there's there are no heads

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.429 
special order there's there are no heads
so<00:01:35.369> everything<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.850> integral<00:01:36.439> everything's

technology the devotion line is really

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.950 
technology the devotion line is really
built<00:01:52.950> around<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.670> technology<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.600> great

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
built around the technology to a great

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.410 
built around the technology to a great
extent<00:01:55.319> and<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.399> technology<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.119> what<00:01:57.299> is
