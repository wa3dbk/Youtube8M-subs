00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
straight forward the weight that I'm

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.910 
straight forward the weight that I'm
pointing<00:00:27.390> my<00:00:27.570> hand<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.349> want<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:28.769> my

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
sideways and I'm offsetting his head a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.069 
sideways and I'm offsetting his head a
little<00:00:57.360> bit<00:00:57.629> by<00:00:57.840> holding<00:00:58.739> my<00:00:59.030> my<00:01:00.030> rope<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.629> my

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.899 

took<00:01:17.570> me<00:01:17.750> four<00:01:18.229> steps<00:01:18.650> to<00:01:19.340> get<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.670> straight

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
took me four steps to get the straight

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:32.139 
took me four steps to get the straight
side<00:01:20.180> way<00:01:29.799> and<00:01:30.799> you<00:01:30.920> might<00:01:31.130> need<00:01:31.369> if<00:01:31.880> he's

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
side way and you might need if he's

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.570 
side way and you might need if he's
doing<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.539> lot<00:01:32.720> of<00:01:32.750> backing<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:34.070> might<00:01:34.220> need<00:01:34.369> to

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
doing a lot of backing you might need to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.820 
doing a lot of backing you might need to
use<00:01:34.610> this<00:01:34.940> hand<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.390> indicate<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.530> him<00:01:36.680> that

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
use this hand to indicate to him that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.070 
use this hand to indicate to him that
it's<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:37.070> little<00:01:37.369> bit<00:01:37.520> more<00:01:37.700> forward<00:01:38.000> than<00:01:38.240> he

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
it's a little bit more forward than he

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.740 
it's a little bit more forward than he
was<00:01:39.229> thinking<00:01:42.670> so<00:01:43.670> we<00:01:43.820> have<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.270> brass<00:01:44.509> feet

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
was thinking so we have the brass feet

00:01:44.750 --> 00:02:14.020 
was thinking so we have the brass feet
sore<00:01:45.020> backwards<00:01:51.670> I'm<00:01:52.670> off<00:01:52.850> his<00:01:53.390> head<00:02:13.030> I'm

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
sore backwards I'm off his head I'm

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.630 
sore backwards I'm off his head I'm
going<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.540> point<00:02:14.780> my<00:02:14.900> toes<00:02:15.260> at<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.069> 45<00:02:16.610> degree

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
going to point my toes at a 45 degree

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:30.780 
going to point my toes at a 45 degree
angle

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:39.630 

and<00:02:31.790> I<00:02:31.880> have<00:02:32.090> my<00:02:32.270> hand<00:02:32.860> right<00:02:33.860> on<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.160> ring

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.990 

and<00:02:40.900> then<00:02:41.900> forward<00:02:42.410> sideways<00:02:42.740> and<00:02:43.550> I'll<00:02:43.760> set

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
and then forward sideways and I'll set

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.460 
and then forward sideways and I'll set
it<00:02:44.030> just<00:02:44.270> a<00:02:44.540> little<00:02:44.660> bit<00:02:50.110> straight<00:02:51.110> sideways

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
it just a little bit straight sideways

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:05.470 
it just a little bit straight sideways
into<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:54.460> word<00:03:03.580> so<00:03:04.580> I<00:03:04.610> would<00:03:04.910> say<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.180> when

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
into the word so I would say that when

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.240 
into the word so I would say that when
you're<00:03:05.660> doing<00:03:05.810> straight<00:03:06.290> sideways<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:07.070> need

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
you're doing straight sideways you need

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.700 
you're doing straight sideways you need
to<00:03:07.370> offset<00:03:07.760> its<00:03:07.970> head<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.270> most<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:11.710> straight

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
to offset its head the most so straight

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.760 
to offset its head the most so straight
sideways<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:14.000> you're<00:03:14.210> really<00:03:14.480> going<00:03:14.630> to<00:03:14.770> lead

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
sideways and you're really going to lead

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:28.150 
sideways and you're really going to lead
him<00:03:16.070> away<00:03:16.430> from<00:03:16.910> your<00:03:17.090> hand<00:03:17.420> with<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.320> rope<00:03:27.160> so

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
him away from your hand with the rope so

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.070 
him away from your hand with the rope so
it's<00:03:28.280> almost<00:03:28.430> as<00:03:28.700> you<00:03:28.850> have<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.360> bit<00:03:29.870> of<00:03:29.900> a

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
it's almost as you have a bit of a

00:03:30.080 --> 00:04:06.339 
it's almost as you have a bit of a
Taichi<00:03:30.680> wall

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.119 

so<00:04:07.349> I<00:04:07.409> just<00:04:07.680> um<00:04:08.099> I<00:04:09.319> moved<00:04:10.319> my<00:04:10.500> body<00:04:10.739> in<00:04:10.980> the

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
so I just um I moved my body in the

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.140 
so I just um I moved my body in the
direction<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.819> I<00:04:11.940> move<00:04:12.180> my<00:04:12.769> hand<00:04:13.970> toward<00:04:14.970> his

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
direction and I move my hand toward his

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:54.110 
direction and I move my hand toward his
face

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.469 

he's<00:04:55.120> getting<00:04:55.419> really<00:04:55.719> fluent
