bit
it's<00:00:54.120> not<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.809> fast<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.440> kill<00:00:55.680> enemies<00:00:56.100> well<00:00:56.489> I

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
it's not so fast to kill enemies well I

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.470 
it's not so fast to kill enemies well I
found<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.660> woman<00:00:58.100> well<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.340> see<00:00:59.670> it's<00:00:59.969> too

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
found this woman well you see it's too

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.969 
found this woman well you see it's too
slow<00:01:01.010> it<00:01:02.010> maybe<00:01:02.730> takes<00:01:03.049> well<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:04.739> too

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
slow it maybe takes well it's it's too

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.520 
slow it maybe takes well it's it's too
slow<00:01:05.250> or<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:06.119> example<00:01:06.210> if<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.810> shoot<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.049> car

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
slow or for example if I shoot this car

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.859 
slow or for example if I shoot this car
it<00:01:07.680> will<00:01:07.860> take<00:01:08.220> too<00:01:08.430> long<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.640> explode

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
it will take too long for it to explode

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.760 
it will take too long for it to explode
but<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.900> ain't<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> shoot<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.740> now

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
but I ain't going to shoot it now

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.670 
but I ain't going to shoot it now
because<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.460> won't<00:01:14.700> get<00:01:15.150> another<00:01:15.420> car<00:01:15.750> well

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
because I won't get another car well

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.880 
because I won't get another car well

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
what the heck now well you know it takes

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.670 
what the heck now well you know it takes
two<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.479> too<00:01:21.780> slow<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:23.689> that's<00:01:24.689> why<00:01:24.960> I'm

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
to how exactly the glitch works alright

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.990 
to how exactly the glitch works alright
and<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.930> way<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.590> glitch<00:01:35.040> works<00:01:35.400> it's

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and the way have the glitch works it's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.960 
and the way have the glitch works it's
it's<00:01:36.659> pretty<00:01:37.439> simple<00:01:37.860> firstly<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.700> need<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
it's pretty simple firstly you need to

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.859 
it's pretty simple firstly you need to
aim<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.579> aiming<00:01:41.579> works<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.360> placing

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
aim and and aiming works in placing

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.780 
aim and and aiming works in placing
three<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.259> works<00:01:43.530> pressing<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.280> l2<00:01:44.490> button

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
three it works pressing the l2 button

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.870 
three it works pressing the l2 button
and<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:46.200> next<00:01:46.470> thing<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.950> need<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.280> do<00:01:47.729> is

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.469 
to press the r2 button to shoot but the
important<00:01:52.619> thing<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.159> each<00:01:53.820> time<00:01:54.240> when

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
important thing is that each time when

anything<00:02:31.610> but<00:02:32.240> you<00:02:32.810> know<00:02:32.840> they<00:02:33.230> were<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.500> I'm

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.770 
anything but you know they were that I'm
shooting<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:41.390> get<00:02:41.510> it

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
shooting so I you get it

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.350 
shooting so I you get it
alright<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:43.070> most<00:02:43.400> fun<00:02:43.880> thing<00:02:44.180> about

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
alright and the most fun thing about

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.380 
alright and the most fun thing about
this<00:02:44.900> glitch<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.400> also<00:02:46.760> works<00:02:47.120> in

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
this glitch is that it also works in

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.410 
this glitch is that it also works in
multiplayer<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:51.430> as<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.640> was<00:02:52.850> talking<00:02:53.150> about

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
multiplayer and as I was talking about

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.680 
multiplayer and as I was talking about
the<00:02:54.100> automatic<00:02:55.100> shotgun<00:02:55.610> well<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:56.000> glitch<00:02:56.450> in

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
the automatic shotgun well the glitch in

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.470 
the automatic shotgun well the glitch in
the<00:02:56.900> automatic<00:02:57.470> shotguns<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.820> works<00:02:59.269> a

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
the automatic shotguns it works a

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.300 
the automatic shotguns it works a
different<00:03:00.050> way<00:03:00.200> actually<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.739> doesn't<00:03:01.040> work

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
different way actually it doesn't work

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.160 
different way actually it doesn't work
at<00:03:01.459> all<00:03:01.640> well<00:03:02.209> we<00:03:02.420> all<00:03:02.600> know<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:02.989> the

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
at all well we all know that the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.170 
at all well we all know that the
automatic<00:03:03.500> shotgun<00:03:04.100> chutes<00:03:04.400> automatically

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
automatic shotgun chutes automatically

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.199 
automatic shotgun chutes automatically
like<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:05.810> but<00:03:06.530> with<00:03:06.739> a<00:03:06.769> glitch<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.610> looks

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
like that but with a glitch it looks

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.880 
like that but with a glitch it looks
ridiculous<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:09.140> it's<00:03:10.600> it<00:03:11.600> works<00:03:11.989> but<00:03:12.440> it's

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
ridiculous so it's it works but it's

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.520 
ridiculous so it's it works but it's
better<00:03:13.250> ridiculous<00:03:14.239> because<00:03:14.600> that<00:03:15.019> glitch<00:03:15.320> is

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
better ridiculous because that glitch is

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.030 
better ridiculous because that glitch is
only<00:03:16.220> pretty<00:03:16.700> much<00:03:16.850> working<00:03:17.269> in<00:03:17.450> team<00:03:18.040> with
