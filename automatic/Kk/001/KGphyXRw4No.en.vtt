00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:10.830
 Well polluted water of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant is matter of example though 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:16.640
 How does the assistant teacher look at this? 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:23.470
 Referred to as the contaminated water problem turned on whether you now the 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:29.230
 Though it seems that something has happened or it has been difficult 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:36.610
 When I compare it with Mr. Moon , I think I'm talking about it now 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:43.460
 The accident happened already on March 11, 2011, two years and two months ago. 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:44.660
 Since then , a lot of diving has accumulated in the ceremony , and it will 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:51.500
 Already 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:57.950
 100,000 tons in the grounds of the Fukushima Daini had accumulated contaminated water 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:01:00.190
 Is I say originally is what are we without a concrete structure because concrete 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.850
 There is nothing 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:10.000
 Besides 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:16.930
 At that time a huge earthquake destroyed the inside of the chocolate, so only the reactor 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:23.650
 Cracking occurs in the everywhere in the concrete even in the turbine building and the range pit standing high 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:29.470
 It was a basement of an almost invisible building , and the pit on the 0th would be worth it 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.990
 It's buried on the back side, but it's already around 10 in places you can not see 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.990
 There 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:38.850
 It is leaking from the inside 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:46.110
 That's right then, and it 's always been 2 years now 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:48.680
 The city prevents runoff of polluted water to the sea in the thought that it should have been leaking for two years in the soil 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:55.820
 Was there no way 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:59.990
 I thought that there was only a seed to hit the structure that would not leak from the concrete structure anyway 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.080
 It was a huge unit price that I came up with 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.440
 100,000 tones in 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.679
 There is a tanker that can be stored 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:16.969
 Bring the 100,000 tankers to the coast of Fukushima 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:22.360
 We proposed that the contaminated water in the site of Fukushima be transferred to a huge tanker anyway . 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:29.230
 But also it is also because I always come one after another contamination is accumulated in the structure of the concrete 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:31.000
 I think I have to do something about it and I will pay the huge unit price to Tokyo Electric Power Kashiwazaki 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:38.770
 Run to the power station 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:42.350
 The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Station is the world's largest nuclear power station, and the invitation to appropriate waste treatment 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:48.680
 It wins because it has been lost of treasure 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:50.750
 Hikari Iwata by moving the unit price to the Fu that is good to the processing therein of waste liquid treatment apparatus 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:57.680
 I spoke to on the March 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:03:02.370
 Since 2011, such things can not be done without politics 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:08.190
 People in politics should use power in such places 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:13.040
 I asked, but at last I could not do anything without hitting anything 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:20.150
 Right now 300,000 tons kun and contaminated water is more and more 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:25.579
 I say I have ended up but is not there I 2 years months menstruation from 3.11 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:29.900
 At that time it would be nice if I had just started 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.750
 Of course I think we are in time and also the fact that send out 10 million head to that next 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:37.330
 To It would have been able to 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:44.280
 I think it should have been much easier than the song name itself 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:44.280
 In that sense, I think that the government and Tokyo Electric Power were things
