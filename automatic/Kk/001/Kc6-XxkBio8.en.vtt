happened after a cat bite I mean that's
like<00:01:59.380> textbook<00:01:59.800> now<00:02:00.400> 80%<00:02:00.880> up<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.540> 80%<00:02:01.720> of<00:02:02.020> cat

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
like textbook now 80% up to 80% of cat

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.469 
like textbook now 80% up to 80% of cat
bites<00:02:02.410> will<00:02:02.740> become<00:02:03.160> infected<00:02:03.759> of<00:02:04.180> course

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
bites will become infected of course

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.870 
bites will become infected of course
Molly<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:04.960> know<00:02:05.080> this<00:02:05.290> as<00:02:05.440> well<00:02:05.740> as<00:02:06.009> anyone<00:02:06.340> so

you<00:02:09.399> said<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.910> was<00:02:10.300> basically<00:02:10.660> like<00:02:10.840> wet

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
you said it was basically like wet

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.680 
you said it was basically like wet
tissue<00:02:11.500> paper<00:02:11.830> your<00:02:12.130> tendon<00:02:12.490> yeah<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:13.480> was<00:02:13.600> an

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
tissue paper your tendon yeah it was an

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.740 
tissue paper your tendon yeah it was an
infection<00:02:14.020> called<00:02:14.140> tenosynovitis<00:02:14.820> um<00:02:15.820> then

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
infection called tenosynovitis um then

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.900 
infection called tenosynovitis um then
they<00:02:17.290> had<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.590> stitch<00:02:17.800> me<00:02:17.830> back<00:02:17.980> up<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.520> have<00:02:18.700> two

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
they had to stitch me back up I have two

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.870 
they had to stitch me back up I have two
scores<00:02:19.180> here<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:19.690> give<00:02:20.230> me<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.350> soft<00:02:20.560> cast

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
scores here and give me a soft cast

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.130 
scores here and give me a soft cast
we've<00:02:21.880> seen<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.300> lot<00:02:22.360> drew<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.810> mean<00:02:23.020> when

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
we've seen that a lot drew I mean when

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.870 
we've seen that a lot drew I mean when
something<00:02:23.380> gets<00:02:23.590> infected<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.459> really

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
something gets infected and you really

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.340 
something gets infected and you really
can't<00:02:25.150> get<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.660> infection<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.110> lot<00:02:26.260> of

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
can't get to the infection a lot of

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.229 
can't get to the infection a lot of
times<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.650> have<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:26.920> like<00:02:27.100> deep<00:02:27.310> breathe<00:02:27.489> and

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
times you have to like deep breathe and

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.420 
times you have to like deep breathe and
in<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.600> case<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:29.230> mean<00:02:29.410> that<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.830> cat<00:02:30.130> bite

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
in this case I mean that that cat bite

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.820 
in this case I mean that that cat bite
and<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:30.820> know<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.209> cat<00:02:31.420> fangs<00:02:31.959> are<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.470> sharp

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
and we know the cat fangs are so sharp

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.340 
and we know the cat fangs are so sharp
and<00:02:33.130> long<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:33.640> mean<00:02:33.790> it's<00:02:33.970> like<00:02:34.350> injecting

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
and long I mean it's like injecting

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.800 
and long I mean it's like injecting
bacteria<00:02:36.070> in<00:02:36.250> with<00:02:36.489> a<00:02:36.519> hypodermic<00:02:36.880> needle<00:02:37.239> and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
bacteria in with a hypodermic needle and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.860 
bacteria in with a hypodermic needle and
in<00:02:38.680> your<00:02:38.920> case<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.790> was<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.239> top<00:02:40.480> part<00:02:40.810> the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
in your case it was the top part the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.440 
in your case it was the top part the
extensive<00:02:41.650> surface<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.790> have<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:43.000> lining

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
extensive surface and you have a lining

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.930 
extensive surface and you have a lining
to<00:02:43.840> those<00:02:44.019> tendon<00:02:44.500> sheets<00:02:44.860> that's<00:02:45.459> what<00:02:45.760> gets

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
to those tendon sheets that's what gets

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.020 
to those tendon sheets that's what gets
inflamed<00:02:46.450> in<00:02:46.720> if<00:02:46.840> they<00:02:46.959> don't<00:02:47.170> clean<00:02:47.440> that<00:02:47.680> out

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
inflamed in if they don't clean that out

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.640 
inflamed in if they don't clean that out
with<00:02:49.030> surgery<00:02:49.600> that's<00:02:49.870> what<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.140> doc<00:02:50.350> said

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
with surgery that's what the doc said

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.800 
with surgery that's what the doc said
and<00:02:50.830> then<00:02:51.160> why<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.430> did<00:02:51.820> for<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.299> you

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
and then why you did for you you

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.320 
and then why you did for you you
potentially<00:02:53.709> that<00:02:54.190> infection<00:02:54.910> could<00:02:55.150> have

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
potentially that infection could have

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.120 
potentially that infection could have
spread<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:56.350> other<00:02:56.590> spaces<00:02:57.130> in<00:02:57.370> your<00:02:57.580> hand<00:02:58.209> or

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
spread to other spaces in your hand or

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.910 
spread to other spaces in your hand or
that<00:03:00.130> infection<00:03:00.850> affected<00:03:01.600> those<00:03:01.780> sheets<00:03:02.080> so

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
that infection affected those sheets so

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.850 
that infection affected those sheets so
that<00:03:02.950> your<00:03:03.310> tendons<00:03:03.910> actually<00:03:04.660> froze<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.500> you

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
that your tendons actually froze and you

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.759 
that your tendons actually froze and you
couldn't<00:03:06.190> use<00:03:06.370> your<00:03:06.400> hand<00:03:06.790> properly<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.769> cats

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
couldn't use your hand properly and cats

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.470 
couldn't use your hand properly and cats
have<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.250> type<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.970> bacteria<00:03:10.420> called

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
have a type of bacteria called

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.539 
have a type of bacteria called
Pasteurella<00:03:11.200> in<00:03:11.590> their<00:03:11.799> mouths<00:03:11.980> so<00:03:12.250> when<00:03:12.459> you

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
Pasteurella in their mouths so when you

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.550 
Pasteurella in their mouths so when you
combine<00:03:12.910> that<00:03:12.940> with<00:03:13.209> these<00:03:13.750> essentially<00:03:14.440> like

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
combine that with these essentially like

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.630 
combine that with these essentially like
you<00:03:14.680> said<00:03:14.890> it's<00:03:15.010> almost<00:03:15.130> like<00:03:15.310> taking<00:03:15.430> a

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
you said it's almost like taking a

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.520 
you said it's almost like taking a
hypodermic<00:03:15.910> needle<00:03:16.209> objecting<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.290> deep

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
hypodermic needle objecting it deep

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.820 
hypodermic needle objecting it deep
underneath<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.580> skin<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:20.290> had<00:03:20.470> all<00:03:20.680> this

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
underneath the skin so you had all this

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.060 
underneath the skin so you had all this
done<00:03:20.890> very<00:03:22.019> involved<00:03:23.019> treatment<00:03:23.440> antibiotics

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
done very involved treatment antibiotics

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.009 
done very involved treatment antibiotics
in<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.250> hospital<00:03:24.700> for<00:03:24.850> a<00:03:24.880> week<00:03:25.030> surgery<00:03:25.720> how's

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
in the hospital for a week surgery how's

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.600 
in the hospital for a week surgery how's
your<00:03:26.200> hand<00:03:26.320> doing<00:03:26.500> now<00:03:26.709> it's<00:03:27.100> much<00:03:27.340> better<00:03:27.489> I

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
your hand doing now it's much better I

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.610 
your hand doing now it's much better I
couldn't<00:03:27.880> open<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.209> more<00:03:28.420> than<00:03:28.600> this<00:03:29.140> much<00:03:29.380> at

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
couldn't open it more than this much at

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.920 
couldn't open it more than this much at
first<00:03:29.799> but<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.160> am<00:03:30.340> we<00:03:30.970> went<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.269> four<00:03:31.510> weeks<00:03:31.720> of

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
first but I am we went to four weeks of

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.949 
first but I am we went to four weeks of
occupational<00:03:32.560> therapy<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:34.000> exercise<00:03:34.810> it

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
occupational therapy and it exercise it

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.200 
occupational therapy and it exercise it
called<00:03:35.260> hand<00:03:35.560> ballet<00:03:35.880> which<00:03:36.880> is<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:37.450> like<00:03:38.260> this

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
called hand ballet which is I like this

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.540 
called hand ballet which is I like this
and<00:03:39.270> then<00:03:39.420> flat<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.260> then<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.710> claw<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.400> then<00:03:41.520> a

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
and then flat and then a claw and then a

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.790
