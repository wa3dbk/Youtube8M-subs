inches wide and they have a 29 degree

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.240 
inches wide and they have a 29 degree
art<00:00:58.210> which<00:00:59.210> is<00:00:59.240> rare<00:00:59.630> most<00:00:59.930> UTV<00:01:00.500> ramps<00:01:00.890> just<00:01:01.100> go

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
art which is rare most UTV ramps just go

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.380 
art which is rare most UTV ramps just go
straight<00:01:01.520> down<00:01:01.700> so<00:01:01.970> you're<00:01:02.090> going<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:02.240> have

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
straight down so you're going to have

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.689 
straight down so you're going to have
like<00:01:02.570> a<00:01:02.600> 45<00:01:03.080> degree<00:01:03.470> climb<00:01:03.680> which<00:01:04.309> is<00:01:04.339> kind<00:01:04.670> of

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
like a 45 degree climb which is kind of

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.760 
like a 45 degree climb which is kind of
dangerous<00:01:05.059> when<00:01:05.269> you<00:01:05.360> pick<00:01:05.570> out<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.619> these

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
dangerous when you pick out so these

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.170 
dangerous when you pick out so these
grants<00:01:07.040> are<00:01:07.130> nice<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:07.549> wide<00:01:07.700> well<00:01:07.939> show<00:01:08.119> you

and what they melt is again this
it's<00:01:23.090> nice<00:01:23.299> because<00:01:23.479> it's<00:01:23.570> got<00:01:23.810> a<00:01:23.840> safety

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
it's nice because it's got a safety

hitch that way when you're up there you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.380 
hitch that way when you're up there you
don't<00:01:31.369> have<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.610> worry<00:01:31.789> about<00:01:31.909> them<00:01:32.090> sliding

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
don't have to worry about them sliding

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.959 
don't have to worry about them sliding
down<00:01:32.719> at<00:01:32.960> all<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:33.469> this<00:01:33.950> I<00:01:34.159> do<00:01:34.310> like<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.640> future

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
down at all so this I do like the future

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.480 
down at all so this I do like the future
of<00:01:35.060> that<00:01:35.229> one<00:01:36.229> thing<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:36.439> do<00:01:36.500> like<00:01:36.710> I<00:01:36.979> say<00:01:37.250> I<00:01:37.280> like

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
of that one thing I do like I say I like

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.969 
of that one thing I do like I say I like
to<00:01:37.609> fold<00:01:37.969> up<00:01:38.149> things<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:38.569> can<00:01:38.780> fold<00:01:39.590> my<00:01:39.799> upper

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
to fold up things you can fold my upper

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.319 
to fold up things you can fold my upper
arm<00:01:40.189> on<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.429> side<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.850> you're<00:01:40.939> set<00:01:41.179> to<00:01:41.210> go

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
arm on the side and you're set to go

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.090 
arm on the side and you're set to go
right<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.020> they're<00:01:42.110> really<00:01:42.439> easy<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.709> fold<00:01:42.860> up

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
right and they're really easy to fold up

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.459 
right and they're really easy to fold up
so<00:01:43.250> let's<00:01:43.579> go<00:01:43.729> ahead<00:01:43.819> and<00:01:43.969> see<00:01:44.959> if<00:01:44.990> Eric's

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
so let's go ahead and see if Eric's
