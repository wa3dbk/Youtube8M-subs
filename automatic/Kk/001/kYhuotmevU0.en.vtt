00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.440
 Good night guys, I'm here right now. 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.440
 know 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.139
 I like the band 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.090
 the interesting deal is that the fed 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.090
 exposed here is as follows 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:40.399
 he parking the truck and not 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.320
 has a demarcation of personnel for 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:47.300
 everything here at 45 degrees 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.699
 well in European style cabin stays clean 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.960
 side of track 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:57.799
 the business is that the fuel stations 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:03.260
 such as the post office did not do there 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:06.159
 is to organize and even the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.159
 truck parking 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:14.580
 a way to make the most of it 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.410
 the staff is what makes it clear and there for the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.410
 national oil agency that marks the 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:31.420
 makes the demarcations there new in the post makes the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:36.110
 authorization of station 10 to release 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.340
 to prepare a project and organize it 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.440
 because today the compositions 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:45.050
 large indication has on trucks of 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:47.840
 30 meters rhodan to the hills on the road to 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.470
 some skates then I started already I think 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.990
 need to be more organized 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:02:02.710
 worse a way to take advantage of the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.710
 space is good
