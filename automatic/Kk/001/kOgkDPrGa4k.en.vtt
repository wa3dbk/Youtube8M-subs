00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:13.099
 from the city 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.740
 making the holes in the city is an important part in the category 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.710
 this is where it is placed 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.060
 the capita of cerati after a fine cloth however the migration 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.230

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.849
 that be 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.050
 by the way this vibrates leads a very characteristic sound of the marimba 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.120
 Chiapaneca what do not have the saddest modern walls like chats 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.480
 although local control is reprimanded 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.700

 the Guatemalan one thousand to 100 thousand 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.820
 however the dialect of the holes is a little less 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.600

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.800
 Guatemalan 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.160

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.710
 and the sound or 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.600
 scientific and forensic 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.660
 we consider that the sound of the marimba chiapaneca is like 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.950
 chewing 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.890
 as more cheerful 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.120
 after the snack 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.120

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.550
 damages that are different 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.270
 my desire to be Argentine music is also a bit stronger 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.330
 when the girl graduates music with that comparison 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.090
 gustavo sanchez 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.100
 so I'm right here order 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.190
 in our country from 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.810
 there are different key places of states that that effect characterize by the 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.490
 music to more destinations like for example 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.030

 and sometimes st 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.120
