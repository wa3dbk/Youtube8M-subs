00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
wave and I also have a bit Strom we

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.690 
wave and I also have a bit Strom we
actually<00:04:57.840> moved<00:04:58.050> these<00:04:58.230> guys<00:04:58.470> up<00:04:58.710> I<00:04:58.890> also<00:04:59.370> have

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
actually moved these guys up I also have

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.340 
actually moved these guys up I also have
abyss<00:05:00.570> drama<00:05:01.010> and<00:05:02.060> that's<00:05:03.060> sending<00:05:03.840> one<00:05:04.170> face

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
abyss drama and that's sending one face

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.620 
abyss drama and that's sending one face
of<00:05:04.560> uni<00:05:04.919> I<00:05:04.950> control<00:05:05.640> to<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:05.940> graveyard<00:05:06.390> and

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
of uni I control to the graveyard and

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.510 
of uni I control to the graveyard and
then<00:05:06.780> destroy<00:05:07.140> all<00:05:07.320> spells<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:07.740> traps<00:05:07.800> on<00:05:08.460> the

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
then destroy all spells and traps on the

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.320 
then destroy all spells and traps on the
field

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
field

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.290 
field
so<00:05:10.960> this<00:05:11.199> also<00:05:11.470> would<00:05:11.860> be<00:05:12.009> good<00:05:12.220> for<00:05:12.490> different

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
so this also would be good for different

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.600 
so this also would be good for different
dimension<00:05:14.110> deep-sea<00:05:14.620> trench<00:05:14.650> and<00:05:15.250> I<00:05:15.460> have

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
dimension deep-sea trench and I have

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.379 
dimension deep-sea trench and I have
three<00:05:15.849> of<00:05:15.879> them<00:05:16.060> in<00:05:16.240> here<00:05:16.449> but<00:05:17.169> I<00:05:18.389> could

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
three of them in here but I could

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.119 
three of them in here but I could
probably<00:05:19.539> just<00:05:19.780> be<00:05:20.050> okay<00:05:20.319> with<00:05:20.349> two<00:05:20.680> but<00:05:20.889> three

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
probably just be okay with two but three

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.850 
probably just be okay with two but three
is<00:05:21.520> actually<00:05:22.180> I<00:05:22.210> think<00:05:22.330> is<00:05:22.750> best<00:05:23.289> to<00:05:23.530> stick

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
is actually I think is best to stick

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.920 
is actually I think is best to stick
with<00:05:24.069> and<00:05:24.930> then<00:05:27.180> just<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.300> other<00:05:28.479> common

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
with and then just the other common
