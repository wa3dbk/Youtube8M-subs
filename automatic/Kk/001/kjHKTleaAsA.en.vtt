 and everyone and everybody 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.270
 is welcome for this news 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.860
 can not speak and everyone 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.500
 is welcome for this new video 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.520
 hairstyle today for morgan address 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.150
 on Youtube 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.240
 I'm going to do and it's finally you 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.210
 show how I do an equivalent 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.250
 approximate of lady gaga's knot 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.630
 so it's me I think it's more 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.170
 pretty with a wick or a bang but 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.850
 in this case mameche freezout ya fait 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.050
 never what I want so in fact I 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.460
 take all the time paths or 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.590
 again I show you how 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.820
 we do for a result really 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.520
 perfect I had to make myself a 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.980
 blow-dry and with my hair it takes 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.399
 more than an hour so I confess I 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.840
 had the laziness 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.449
 but you will see the technique 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.100
 main and the idea so I start with 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.530
 a very very hot ponytail 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.940
 because I want that is not here 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.649
 like a headband a little behind but 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.879
 still if you want it to be 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.800
 behind or they are lower 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.059
 obviously you have to adapt but 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.870
 I really want to see who when 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.640
 we are in front and I put a whole 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.299
 little bit on the side and there I do a 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.860
 ponytail 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:18.110
 p the first thing knots like that and 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.180
 once we're here we're not going to go 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.729
 until the end we will stop at about 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.009
 leave between 10 and 15 cm of hair 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.470
 behind so we pull the hair see 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:32.150
 there we will not all go by pulling tyrant 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:36.110
 shot and let's see the ball a little 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.060
 so here we have this beautiful 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.409
 trick over the head 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.729
 so we take them a little step forward 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.610
 and there we will separate it in the middle what 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.530
 will give us both sides of a you 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.610
 can you see there it's hollow so we 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.820
 can put your fingers in for 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.619
 dismiss it at will so we have both 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.759
 sides of them as I tell you this is 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.759
 not say what because I did not do 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.460
 niro brushing and with the hair that 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.810
 stay behind we'll do the trick of 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.469
 middle ie that we will draw the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.820
 hair and put them in between and 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.160
 pass them below each 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.710
 hop side 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.950
 yes the main idea 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.970
 and so once you have that eh 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.700
 well you are doing well with your 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.580
 brushes your lake etc to make 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.960
 so that's nice game shows then 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.270
 I think it's not super nice to 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.900
 behind but you put tongs 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.290
 pasta etc 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.960
 you try to hide after too 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.640
 well what can be done so he is a 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.260
 little too much back compared to that 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.380
 I wanted to start but you have the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.210
 main technique so you should 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.260
 you see them geo I admit to my 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.820
 hair frankly it's not the top 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.790
 because they are like there are plenty of 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.820
 length the whole thing does not fit in the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.140
 we in the same way and as they are 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.040
 not flinching more is not very beautiful 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:58.810
 but I will still try to 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:03:01.120
 to do closer so in fact I the 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.320
 redo in time with in the other 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.350
 sense actually I leave the picture that I 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.910
 will go back p I leave the matches that 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.850
 will be in the middle to see this 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:17.970
 which is best hello and divides in 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:17.970
 two after hop 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.060
 mini just have to stand 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:43.170
 it's filthy it's not possible 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:45.120
 good and suddenly I'll go too 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.170
 try it behind like that mover the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.170
 three versions caution 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:37.289
 and so here is the third version of 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.849
 face good I confess I do not know I 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.740
 never hibernate 1 succeeds so 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.460
 here I gave you my technique I 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.310
 think with longer hair or 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.960
 more equalize or pike or more 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.580
 shiny whatever it is 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.400
 really pretty so do not hesitate 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.569
 to try it at home one of the three 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.190
 position where you want 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.599
 we can even do that with half 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.270
 hair for a half-tail etc 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:02.159
 and well if you get there send me your 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.879
 photos to miss blush @ gmail 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.280
 dot com 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:08.099
 I hope you like it pretty much 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.550
 address morgan I hope that ben I you have 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:12.930
 could have an idea of 2 how to do it and 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.699
 that you will be able to do it again at your place and 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.960
 that it would be great beautiful game makes you 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.849
 big kisses just while I'm there 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.069
 think on the eyes I wear the pigment 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.310
 mccabe look brown here 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:24.590
 in fact I wanted to make a makeup 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.110
 inspired league so a little fufu and 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.910
 everything and then in fact she is so 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.200
 for once she's so extreme 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.000
 in his makeups that whatever we 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.070
 do it before going to a debit so 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.510
 the stupid air is very very portable 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.130
 in relation to her so I told myself 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.500
 in the end no I just made a little 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.910
 taste here I do you grammys and 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.910
