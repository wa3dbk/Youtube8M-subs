find it so entertaining to try to take
shortcuts<00:01:17.500> on<00:01:17.980> a<00:01:18.010> dual<00:01:18.280> sport<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:18.940> just<00:01:19.540> beat

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
shortcuts on a dual sport and just beat

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.740 
shortcuts on a dual sport and just beat
the<00:01:20.230> traffic<00:01:20.440> by<00:01:20.860> doing<00:01:21.130> something<00:01:21.430> so<00:01:22.390> stupid

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
the traffic by doing something so stupid

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.980 
the traffic by doing something so stupid
it's<00:01:23.230> not<00:01:23.560> even<00:01:23.800> worth<00:01:24.010> it<00:01:24.220> and<00:01:24.580> like<00:01:25.030> three

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
it's not even worth it and like three

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.530 
it's not even worth it and like three
quarters<00:01:26.380> of<00:01:26.410> the<00:01:26.680> time<00:01:26.710> they<00:01:27.430> end<00:01:27.670> up<00:01:27.820> being

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
quarters of the time they end up being

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.770 
quarters of the time they end up being
faster<00:01:29.080> than<00:01:29.260> me<00:01:29.410> anyways

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
faster than me anyways

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.240 
faster than me anyways
so<00:01:31.780> overall<00:01:32.260> I'm<00:01:32.470> sure<00:01:32.710> I've<00:01:32.830> just<00:01:33.040> wasted

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
so overall I'm sure I've just wasted

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.930 
so overall I'm sure I've just wasted
time<00:01:33.670> but<00:01:34.260> further<00:01:35.260> 1<00:01:35.530> or<00:01:35.680> 2<00:01:35.890> times<00:01:36.130> that<00:01:36.550> I<00:01:36.610> did

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
time but further 1 or 2 times that I did

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.290 
time but further 1 or 2 times that I did
beat<00:01:37.180> them<00:01:37.710> would<00:01:40.560> totally<00:01:41.560> worth<00:01:41.770> it<00:01:41.979> oh<00:01:42.300> I

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
beat them would totally worth it oh I

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:59.030 
beat them would totally worth it oh I
can<00:01:43.690> do<00:01:43.780> better<00:01:43.930> than<00:01:44.080> that

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:12.119
