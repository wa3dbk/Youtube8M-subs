00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.160
Hi again everyone, Chris Tisdell here again.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.170
In this presentation I am going to continue
my series of videos that give a gentler introduction

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.500
to complex numbers.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.640
Now in previous presentations, I showed you
how to add and subtract complex numbers, and

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.789
also how to multiply a complex number with
a real number and I talked about the geometric

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.439
meaning of these operations.

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:35.020
In this presentation I am going to go one
step further and talk about how to multiply

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.800
two complex numbers together.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.000
So I will show you how to it, I will do an
example and I will also discuss the geometry,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.630
so you have some idea of how to visualize
what is happening with this multiplication.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.930
So let me share my screen with you and we
can get started.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:01.950
Okay, now multiplication of two complex numbers
together involves a natural distribution,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:15.729
as I will show you, and really rests on the
idea of this imaginary unit, i, satisfying

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.180
i^2 = –1.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.850
So let us talk about a quick example, I will
do one by hand in a minute.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:33.439
If z = 2+i and w = 1 + i, then what is the
product zw?

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:42.520
Okay well let us write it out in the Cartesian
form and you would distribute it in the ‘normal

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.329
way’, so that times that plus that times
that plus that times that plus that times

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.329
that.

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:55.100
Now, I have only drawn in two links here,
where you multiply the real parts together

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.009
and also the i terms together.

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.679
Now those two multiplications will give you
a real number because i^2 = –1.

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.030
The other terms will group together as well.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.890
So (2 * i) + (1 * i).

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.670
So here I have put those together because
I know they are just going to be a real number,

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.890
and I have grouped those together because
I know they will give me something involving

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.860
i.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.780
Now the first few times you do these problems
you might not want to do that, it is up to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.070
you, whatever you feel more comfortable with,
but this certainly will save you time, it

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.950
is quite pretty.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:46.420
So 2 + i^2 (where i^2 = –1) so 2 – 1 here
then I have got 2i + i, which gives me 3i

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.450
which will simplify down to a 1 + 3i.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:01.880
So for these two complex numbers, 2 + i and
1 + i, their product is 1 + 3i.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.290
I will do another example in a second but
let us just talk about the geometric interpretation

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.260
of multiplication.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:20.620
Now, here I claim the geometric interpretation
of multiplication of two complex numbers together

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.330
is seen through rotation and stretching or
compression.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.100
Let me show you what I mean with this example.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.680
Let us plot in the complex numbers z and w
in the complex plane.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:41.380
So I will go over 2 units and up 1 unit to
plot in my z point, and for w I will go over

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.840
1 unit and go up 1 unit.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.300
What about zw?

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.640
Well zw = 1 + 3i so over 1 and up 3.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:04.530
So what we are going to do now is just draw
a line segment from each of these points to

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.270
the origin.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:22.730
That will help me illustrate the geometry
a little bit better.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:36.730
Okay, so here we have z, we have w and we
have zw.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:51.560
Okay, now, first of all, the lengths: If I
compute the length of this point to the origin,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.790
using Pythagoras’ Theorem, and if I compute
the length of this point, again, by Pythagoras’

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.910
Theorem, I will get two values.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.020
And if I compute the length from this point
(the product) to the origin, this length will

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.650
be the product of those two lengths!

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:19.160
Okay, so the length of the segment associated
with w will be something like √2.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.440
The length of this line segment will be something
like √5.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:36.490
And the length of this line segment will be
something like √10.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.010
So √ 2 * √5 = √10.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.290
that is just using Pythagoras’ Theorem.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:49.550
So, the first bit of geometry here is that
if you multiply two complex numbers together,

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:58.949
then the product of their length gives you
the length of the new product.

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:05.550
And secondly, I can compute the angle to the
positive real axis of z and w just by using

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.680
trig.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:20.550
Now, the angle of z plus the angle associated
with w is going to be the angle of zw.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.699
So there is two bits of important information
there: The product of these lengths equals

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:31.580
to the length of the line segment associated
with the product of the two complex numbers,

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.220
and the two angles to the positive real axis
associated with each of these little line

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.360
segments of the complex numbers.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:45.740
If you add them together then you get the
angle of the product of the two complex numbers.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.740
PRETTY COOL!

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.870
Now I am not going to talk about that in too
much detail in this presentation because it

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.520
is an elementary one, but when you move on
to different forms of a complex numbers, we

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.370
are going to use those ideas all the time.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.389
The nice thing about knowing the geometry
of multiplication is that if you are given

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:09.110
two complex numbers and you draw them in the
complex plane, you kind of should know where

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:16.830
you should end up with the product, so you
can know when you make a mistake.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.560
So to me that is pretty cool and we will get
back to that a bit later.
