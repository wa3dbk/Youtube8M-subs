00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
plant tank and dividing off from selling

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.170 
plant tank and dividing off from selling
plants<00:04:20.530> as<00:04:20.890> well<00:04:20.919> it's<00:04:21.310> just<00:04:21.489> a<00:04:21.580> lot<00:04:21.760> easier<00:04:21.789> a

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
plants as well it's just a lot easier a

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.840 
plants as well it's just a lot easier a
lot<00:04:22.360> less<00:04:22.630> work<00:04:22.800> lot<00:04:23.800> less<00:04:23.979> water<00:04:24.280> change

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
lot less work lot less water change

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.920 
is I'll probably turn one or two more of
these<00:04:27.610> in<00:04:27.670> the<00:04:27.880> plant<00:04:28.120> tanks<00:04:28.450> as<00:04:28.570> well<00:04:28.600> maybe

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
these in the plant tanks as well maybe

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.460 
these in the plant tanks as well maybe
like<00:04:29.110> a<00:04:29.170> dwarf<00:04:29.470> plant<00:04:29.740> tank<00:04:29.980> up<00:04:30.280> there<00:04:31.230> and<00:04:32.230> put

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
like a dwarf plant tank up there and put

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.260 
like a dwarf plant tank up there and put
some<00:04:32.620> quite<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.160> few<00:04:33.400> live<00:04:33.610> plants<00:04:33.970> in<00:04:34.090> with<00:04:34.180> the

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
some quite a few live plants in with the

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.750 
some quite a few live plants in with the
ghost<00:04:34.450> shrimp<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:34.900> do<00:04:35.860> some<00:04:36.040> snails<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:36.580> go

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
ghost shrimp and do some snails and go

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.990 
ghost shrimp and do some snails and go
shrimpin<00:04:37.150> that<00:04:37.500> so<00:04:38.500> as<00:04:39.160> you<00:04:39.340> see<00:04:39.520> this<00:04:39.580> is<00:04:39.790> a

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
shrimpin that so as you see this is a

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000 
shrimpin that so as you see this is a
real<00:04:40.780> massive<00:04:41.320> had<00:04:41.410> to<00:04:41.500> repair<00:04:41.830> my<00:04:41.860> stare<00:04:42.480> but

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
real massive had to repair my stare but

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.680 
real massive had to repair my stare but
yeah<00:04:45.010> this<00:04:45.160> is<00:04:45.220> a<00:04:45.370> pretty<00:04:45.850> much<00:04:46.240> work<00:04:46.540> in

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
yeah this is a pretty much work in

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.320 
yeah this is a pretty much work in
progress<00:04:47.070> hopefully<00:04:48.070> become<00:04:48.340> a<00:04:48.370> studio<00:04:48.940> one

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
progress hopefully become a studio one

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.920 
progress hopefully become a studio one
time<00:04:49.600> for<00:04:50.170> the<00:04:50.350> future<00:04:50.740> of<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:51.930> more

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
time for the future of the more

professional<00:04:53.590> I'm<00:04:53.710> a<00:04:53.800> fish<00:04:54.040> guy<00:04:54.120> with<00:04:55.120> the

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
professional I'm a fish guy with the

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.080 
professional I'm a fish guy with the
backdrops<00:04:55.570> and<00:04:55.690> all<00:04:55.810> that<00:04:55.930> stuff<00:04:56.080> as<00:04:56.470> well<00:04:57.090> but

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
backdrops and all that stuff as well but

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.490 
backdrops and all that stuff as well but
actually<00:04:58.300> this<00:04:58.750> is<00:04:58.960> probably<00:04:59.230> going<00:04:59.350> to<00:04:59.440> be

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
actually this is probably going to be

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.400 
actually this is probably going to be
going<00:04:59.740> in<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:00.310> next<00:05:00.460> few<00:05:00.790> months<00:05:01.140> before<00:05:02.140> the

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
going in the next few months before the

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.980 
going in the next few months before the
baby's<00:05:02.710> born<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:03.450> putting<00:05:04.450> up<00:05:04.540> just<00:05:04.780> solid

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
baby's born and putting up just solid

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.920 
baby's born and putting up just solid
walls<00:05:05.790> be<00:05:06.790> a<00:05:06.820> lot<00:05:06.970> easier<00:05:07.000> but<00:05:07.630> this<00:05:07.780> was

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
walls be a lot easier but this was

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.300 
walls be a lot easier but this was
perfect<00:05:08.110> for<00:05:08.440> what<00:05:08.590> I<00:05:08.650> need<00:05:08.830> it<00:05:08.950> forward<00:05:09.250> to

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
perfect for what I need it forward to

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.970 
perfect for what I need it forward to
keep<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:09.550> heat<00:05:09.760> in<00:05:10.080> it's<00:05:11.080> keeping<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:11.710> heat

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
keep the heat in it's keeping the heat

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.810 
keep the heat in it's keeping the heat
constantly<00:05:12.670> at<00:05:12.790> 64<00:05:13.510> 266<00:05:14.470> so<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.550> heaters

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
constantly at 64 266 so the heaters

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.550 
constantly at 64 266 so the heaters
working<00:05:16.060> a<00:05:16.210> lot<00:05:16.510> less<00:05:16.780> and<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.230> electric

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
working a lot less and the electric

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.590 
working a lot less and the electric
bills<00:05:17.740> dropped<00:05:18.100> significantly<00:05:18.570> so<00:05:19.570> I

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
bills dropped significantly so I

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.620 
bills dropped significantly so I
definitely<00:05:20.020> can't<00:05:20.530> complain<00:05:20.950> there<00:05:21.630> so

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
definitely can't complain there so

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.150 
definitely can't complain there so
