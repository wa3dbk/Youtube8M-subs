00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.680
 ah 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.049
 ah 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.320
 Y 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.240
 hello everyone I'm can tell 754 average that 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.369
 I bring you a new battlefield video 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.140
 4 and good as you will have seen in the 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.090
 title let's talk a little about the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.210
 sniper ticket and at the end of 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.670
 video I'm going to give my opinion about 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.840
 a complaint or a question a question that 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.340
 has done for a long time that I have 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.280
 often heard about 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.930
 sniper voucher I do not know what of 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.410
 background are some clips using reflected 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.699
 with shooter m82 a3 and so it will be understood 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.760
 better what I want to explain at the end 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.320
 of the good video we go there to me as 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.089
 sure that many of you 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.530
 I have always been passionate about the figure 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.379
 sniper figure is worth in the 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.019
 war world that cold serene character 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.030
 calculator master of camouflage to which 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.460
 it is assigned a goal and eliminates it 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.210
 without being seen is worth causing a fear 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.610
 tremendous among all his enemies I do not know 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.890
 I really like watching documentaries of this 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.840
 style and these things and I've seen a lot 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.729
 about snipers and what 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.350
 almost all of them coincide 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.420
 protagonists who talk about them is 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.780
 that a sniper can only stop 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.500
 action 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.990
 I do not leave it is the figure that we have 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.790
 taught in video games we played them 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.920
 in movies they have also shown it to us 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.950
 and that's the image of the sniper that 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.869
 I have and that I had in my head 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.850
 I do not know when I started playing shooters 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.549
 online that I did in the call of duty 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.289
 modern warfare 2 I do not know with all my 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.179
 illusion and all the novice that I was 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.090
 welcomed refresh tight shooter and the 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:53.630
 battle and burst good heads os 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.579
 you can imagine how the theme was 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.100
 scared and without moving or over I started 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.500
 extreme with a colleague who already played and 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.630
 the truth that they gave me for all 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.630
 small maps killed me continuously 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.100
 and I did not give a quick one, I realized that 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.470
 that was not was not the role of 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.420
 sniper I was looking for and besides I do not know 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.190
 I did not do well at all that is to say that we have 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.660
 video the sniper and I started playing 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.730
 otherwise 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.970
 Now that I have discovered battlefield 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.740
 because I could not get back into the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.190
 head that sniper role like you 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.810
 I say and I do not know I like it much more not 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.640
 I know to get long shots 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.160
 distance or they can commit more in the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.410
 skin of a sniper I do not know how the 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.850
 of the video that I climbed of 10 kilometers 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.710
 Well, they are not happy that you can 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.680
 exercise that role of long sniper 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.660
 distance and surely the teams that 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.240
 play conquest together and these 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.740
 things your patrols have their francs 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.410
 which will be of great importance 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.630
 tactics for your equipment I imagine 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.940
 I also do not understand why we feel 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.760
 so bad when we kill a franc that 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.710
 is not far away to more than 500 meters that 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.630
 Uncle will kill us one or two at the most 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.280
 times throughout the game he has 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.560
 cured with a shot to the best of more than 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.240
 700 meters that is not easy I can not 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.490
 secure and if you have caught the rifle what 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.010
 you know that it is not easy and it is already 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.080
 Congratulations and keep playing no no 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.110
 to give him because he accepted us in the 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.190
 tail to 700 meters worth everything 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.190
 it is to be admired 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.420
 this normal card two or three times 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.830
 throughout the game and I do not think 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.050
 that neither in shooting at those 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.570
 distances you make your 30 to 0 and stick 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.130
 the hesitant what happens that I think the 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.680
 sniper rifle has caught very 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.660
 bad reputation because of the people and the 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.730
 way to use what they have is worth 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.340
 example between 7 with all the roofs 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.140
 there because people are caught something 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.930
 a lot of rock the strippers and sound 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.120
 the roofs to shoot at people who 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.920
 he's running down like bunnies the 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.709
 distance is less than 100 meters or 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.560
 a hundred and a few meters is worth but good 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.120
 also if you think about it on Monday gaiters and 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.650
 I gave him in that field surely 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.300
 would be the first one to get on the 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.580
 roof to have advantage that is to them 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.850
 they put roofs so they go up and people 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.950
 it goes up or is there 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.110
 another thing there are also many people who 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.060
 you can use going to the asses of the 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.790
 maps simply through the whole that 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.440
 behind the boxes sticking their heads 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.910
 and there to hit shots to everything that is 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.860
 approach with the corridor more straight than 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.840
 have on the screen because I do not know I think 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.240
 all these ways of playing harm 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.160
 a bit the image of the sniper but 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.840
 what was being commented now is very 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.970
 different from the role of the pure hyper that you 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.340
 I said before and I think we should not 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.530
 confuse it worth it you have to be clear with 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.910
 what kind of players are we playing 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.010
 just to use a weapon we have to 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.010
 sentence someone later also 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.420
 is the role of aggressive sniper 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.060
 with which I did not agree very much 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.370
 when I played call of duty it was 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.440
 a real nightmare if you have played 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.660
 you will surely know all the 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.400
 team contrary to Kristof and not you 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.830
 I could not move and it was very easy 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.050
 do quiz cope in a call of duty and what 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.640
 made everyone from iu was a weapon 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.290
 super powerful compared to 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.540
 any other there was no option when 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.730
 one knew how to do it minimally but here 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.010
 in battlefield at least in my opinion it is 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.410
 very very different then go to the attack with 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.820
 the franc hitting weeks is not kobe 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.240
 aiming super fast 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:16.390
 I think it requires some good eggs 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.210
 square and a great skill because it is 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.920
 very very difficult the truth that to me 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.660
 makes you want to try playing like this every 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.520
 instead of players who do it and you 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.680
 motivates so I'm going to try 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.480
 I also do not think it's as abusive as 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.150
 in call of duty as I say I do not know in peace and 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.210
 phil I think that take for example a 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.540
 run of 15 to cusco running jumping or 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.000
 going to the assault the truth that is at 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.710
 reach of few players I think that 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.270
 they are many because they play a lot 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.910
 of people but in proportion I think not 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.040
 They are worth so many think 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.080
 that will not go to the top with the rifle in 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.760
 battlefield 4 for many players is 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.510
 more a way of overcoming and 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.490
 Enjoy when things go well 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.380
 it's not to beat people up and 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.930
 have the best statistics in the world 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.540
 it is more something personal and of enjoyment of 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.370
 self because as I tell you it requires 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.460
 a lot of skill because it 's very 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.440
 difficult and good as I told you 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.450
 I've put these clips on you 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.520
 because I also wanted to comment on one thing 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.340
 As I told you, I 've heard many 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.230
 times that people complain question and 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.020
 is why they do not kill from a shot 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.760
 the sniper rifles and good for 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.690
 that I have put these clips and that is 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.510
 as you will have seen them I have put them 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.790
 background and a medium low player like me 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.620
 with the sniper rifle it can 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.080
 eliminate all these enemies from this 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.390
 way and get this 678 streak 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.210
 enemies without much worry and without 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.400
 much skill worth imagine what 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.320
 they would make players who drive very very 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.530
 well the rifle if I gave them is a weapon 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.120
 well during the 10 15 or 20 minutes that 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.850
 last a game and also with 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.400
 accessories to choose as I can 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.900
 make sure I know it would be I do not know this 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.530
 game would become an authentic 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.150
 nightmare it's worth it I know I could not even play 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:07.580
 it's just why I think 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.400
 that sniper rifles do not kill 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:14.570
 of a shot so they are not a 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:16.220
 game shit and good point decide if 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.020
 you want in the comments what 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.250
 you think of the sniper if there is 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.260
 to get everybody the same 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.630
 I think not and I think that the 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.340
 most of us think not and by the way 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.930
 I also wanted to thank you 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.210
 all those who always comment in the 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.220
 videos because I do not know for me you are many 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.050
 those who do it the truth and without a doubt 

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.460
 is the best of the channel for me it's worth 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:38.240
 your comments yours 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:40.760
 suggestions, critical ideas I like 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.960
 a lot and I want to thank you a lot 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.970
 because that tell me what they think 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.830
 snipers without anything I hope you 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.760
 have liked the video and see you in the 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.760
 next until later
