 the family is poster since its appearance 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.789

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.460

 harley davison since his appearance has 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.640
 there were a lot of new ones 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.009
 models and new ones have been incorporated 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.800
 creations and today we present you this 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:34.570
 1,200 just what is a motorcycle that we are 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.570
 its creators goes directly to the heart 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.510
 the brand is very clear about the importance 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.910
 This model that year after year is 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.130
 polishing detail you just have to see what 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.320
 really pretty that is attractive 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.690
 which results in this model also now 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.090
 offers enormous possibilities for 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.860
 that each custom user made his bike to 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.710
 your measurement and go making the model 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.260
 according to your own needs 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.840
 in this new x to 1200 taste trader 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.790
 series some exclusive elements that 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.440
 incorporates this year as they are the visor 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.869
 what's on the headlight or the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.090
 trapezoidal pilot equipped with diodes 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.350
 of LEDs that we are in the rear 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.350
 they are all from an invoice 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.409
 the engine keeps its portion of its 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.799
 personality is always a 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.020
 bicilíndrico in v to 45 degrees and has 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.240
 a husky voice as you heard when he 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.009
 is speaking you do not hear others by 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.420
 I 've had to stop this 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.819
 bicilíndrico in v is sending as 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.700
 always by rods and rockers and it's 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:44.670
 a vibrating motor has a touch a 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.500
 little rough and it's not too powerful 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.600
 yields about 70 horses 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.850
 approximately where we found the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.920
 kindness of this engine that is in its pair 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.950
 in its delivery of power from low 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.950
 revolutions 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.680
 this 1200 engine on the pistons does not 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.850
 they are too fat but they have 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.040
 a great career 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.630
 that's why it also pushes for work and every 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.429
 crankshaft turn translates into 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.649
 traction on asphalt so you have 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.690
 an idea at 2,500 revolutions is already 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.350
 giving 10 kilos of bread can burn 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.270
 nothing easily coming out of prepared 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.750
 it's harley davison even though it's from 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.600
 smaller families weigh more than 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.790
 250 kilos on the tires you ride 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.130
 are these kind of ball type with 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.930
 6-inch wheels and profile and profile 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.850
 high they give a touch a little peculiar the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.650
 true the fork has 31 bars 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.420
 millimeters and the truth is that in 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.160
 road especially when they are 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.200
 fast roads and radio turns 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.120
 wide and the asphalt is good behaves 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.430
 pretty well something else is already 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.890
 when irregularities or potholes appear 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.910
 on the road it was a bit rough on 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.910
 his behavior is another song 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.749
 the rear suspension the truth is that 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.579
 it can not be more traditional it takes a 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:03:00.790
 double shock absorber anchored directly 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.499
 from the chassis to the swingarm and how it comes 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.109
 being usual in family posters 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:07.569
 it does not have much travel is a 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.430
 rather dry suspension and the truth is 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.439
 that when we go two people on board 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.439
 makes it quite easily 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.569
 the seat for the pilot the truth is 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.359
 that this time has grown and is 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.219
 quite comfortable enough and it seems that 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:26.010
 it is also for the passenger who 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:28.019
 It has also grown and can have 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.510
 a good space but the reality is that 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.340
 if you notice you have a little way of 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.989
 slide backwards and nothing turns 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.819
 comfortable for the passenger who has to 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.950
 be making constant efforts to 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.230
 take us the footboards so advanced 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.359
 holding on to the pilot to not stop 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.519
 slip back the first 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.049
 accessory that we have to buy if 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.120
 we usually go with a passenger 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.120
 it is a backup so that it does not run off 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.959
 in march you are poster is a motorcycle made 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.080
 to enjoy walking and to show off 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.879
 of her on the road behaves very 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.430
 as well as at speeds 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.590
 moderate between 100 and 130 kilometers 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.750
 when the truth is that it is like a fish in 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.090
 the water and when we enter areas 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.069
 tacked because the pity is that the 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.650
 Footpegs rubbing excessively 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.260
 excessively soon and they put limits 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.699
 to our inclined ours that also 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.859
 serves to remind us that we are going to 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.710
 open a harley davison with the purest 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.680
 quiet custom style and without any 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.780
 sports claim on the other hand its 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.669
 brakes for good takes only a 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.650
 front disc that I think they have 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.010
 put so that we can admire your 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.750
 beautiful rim of new invoice and a 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.660
 rear disc also of quite 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.539
 diameter the work they do then 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.720
 they are simply enough for the 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:48.190
 benefits and good and personality and 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.610
 speed that we must maintain with 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.610
 this motorbike 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.890
 as a conclusion I will tell you that this new 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:00.680
 harley davidson sportster 1200 despite 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.570
 of your new electronic injection to 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.580
 Despite having a motor much more 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.850
 environmentally friendly one 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.840
 much cleaner engine despite its 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.060
 secondary transmission by belt 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.240
 notched that also softens a little 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.430
 the reactions of the motorcycle and the engine to 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.560
 despite all this remains a 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.470
 harley davison in state by a harley 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.840
 pure and rude davison that vibrates and that 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.260
 he has his personality that no one knows 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.960
 You can also remove now with its price 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.200
 of 11 thousand 900 euros can be the dream 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.780
 of many Carlists who can do it 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.400
 reality and become part of the 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.400
 great family of my bowler's bikes
