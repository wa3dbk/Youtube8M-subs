to<00:00:00.659> start<00:00:00.900> out<00:00:01.020> I<00:00:01.050> have<00:00:01.290> a<00:00:01.319> chilled<00:00:01.650> mixing

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
to start out I have a chilled mixing

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.740 
to start out I have a chilled mixing
glass<00:00:02.040> this<00:00:02.340> is<00:00:02.399> filled<00:00:02.730> with<00:00:02.879> water<00:00:03.120> this<00:00:03.689> is

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
glass this is filled with water this is

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.070 
glass this is filled with water this is
a<00:00:03.929> perfect<00:00:04.910> glass<00:00:05.910> water<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.810> great

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
a perfect glass water is a great

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.230 
a perfect glass water is a great
affordable<00:00:07.859> medium<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.580> practice<00:00:08.910> stirring

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
affordable medium to practice stirring

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.290 
affordable medium to practice stirring
with<00:00:09.530> the<00:00:10.530> idea<00:00:10.860> behind<00:00:11.070> stirring<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.849> you

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
with the idea behind stirring is you

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.030 
with the idea behind stirring is you
want<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.540> take<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.840> back<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.049> your<00:00:13.410> spoon<00:00:13.799> and

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
want to take the back of your spoon and

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.210 
want to take the back of your spoon and
you<00:00:14.130> want<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.089> orbit<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.690> around<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.680> outside

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
you want to orbit it around the outside

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.279 
you want to orbit it around the outside
of<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.760> glass<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.720> you're<00:00:18.840> essentially<00:00:19.199> going

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
of the glass so you're essentially going

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.769 
of the glass so you're essentially going
to<00:00:19.410> balance<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:20.580> back<00:00:20.850> part<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> spoon

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
to balance this back part of the spoon

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.120 
to balance this back part of the spoon
against<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:23.250> glass<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.910> entire<00:00:24.269> time<00:00:25.130> this

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
against the glass the entire time this

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.450 
against the glass the entire time this
is<00:00:26.310> done<00:00:26.519> by<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> simple<00:00:27.330> motion<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:28.460> twisting

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
is done by a simple motion of twisting

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.069 
is done by a simple motion of twisting
my<00:00:30.000> fingers<00:00:32.059> essentially<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.840> not

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
my fingers essentially and it's not

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.590 
my fingers essentially and it's not
wrist<00:00:34.380> at<00:00:34.559> all<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:34.890> all<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:36.210> way<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.570> I

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
wrist at all it's all in the way that I

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.560 
wrist at all it's all in the way that I
move<00:00:36.930> my<00:00:37.230> two<00:00:37.290> fingers<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.610> first<00:00:38.940> motion<00:00:39.239> is

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
move my two fingers the first motion is

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.619 
move my two fingers the first motion is
a<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.379> push<00:00:40.950> from<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.540> were

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
a is a is a push from if you were

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.619 
a is a is a push from if you were
looking<00:00:42.780> at<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> clock<00:00:43.980> from<00:00:44.760> 12<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.360> 6

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
looking at this as a clock from 12 to 6

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.680 
looking at this as a clock from 12 to 6
and<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.739> second<00:00:47.160> with<00:00:47.550> my<00:00:47.760> middle<00:00:48.030> finger<00:00:48.510> is

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
and the second with my middle finger is

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.049 
and the second with my middle finger is
from<00:00:49.530> 6<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.100> 12<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.379> index<00:00:52.379> finger<00:00:52.800> 12<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.789> 6

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
from 6 to 12 so index finger 12 to 6

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.319 
from 6 to 12 so index finger 12 to 6
middle<00:00:54.960> finger<00:00:56.030> 6<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.210> 12<00:00:57.890> that's<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.329> simple

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
middle finger 6 to 12 that's the simple

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.850 
middle finger 6 to 12 that's the simple
way<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.510> describe<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.170> eventually<00:01:03.500> it<00:01:04.500> gets<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
way to describe it eventually it gets a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.429 
way to describe it eventually it gets a
little<00:01:05.280> bit<00:01:05.700> more<00:01:06.000> integrated<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.900> not<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> 12

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
little bit more integrated to not a 12

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.149 
little bit more integrated to not a 12
and<00:01:07.619> 6<00:01:08.000> when<00:01:09.000> you're<00:01:09.240> stirring<00:01:09.920> whether<00:01:10.920> your

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
and 6 when you're stirring whether your

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.450 
and 6 when you're stirring whether your
spoon<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.299> up<00:01:12.900> high<00:01:13.229> which<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.100> don't<00:01:14.280> think

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
spoon is is up high which I don't think

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.730 
spoon is is up high which I don't think
is<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.610> best<00:01:14.939> or<00:01:15.840> all<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> way<00:01:16.259> down<00:01:16.530> below

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
is the best or all the way down below

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.940 
is the best or all the way down below
the<00:01:17.689> idea<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.229> move<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:20.759> ice<00:01:21.000> fluidly<00:01:21.950> even

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the idea is to move the ice fluidly even

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.440 
the idea is to move the ice fluidly even
quickly<00:01:23.570> but<00:01:24.570> you're<00:01:24.720> not<00:01:24.810> making<00:01:24.990> any<00:01:25.380> noise

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
quickly but you're not making any noise

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.569 
quickly but you're not making any noise
you're<00:01:27.450> not<00:01:27.600> every<00:01:28.350> time<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.770> add<00:01:28.950> j't<00:01:29.280> 8<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
you're not every time you add j't 8 the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.670 
you're not every time you add j't 8 the
ice<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.780> when<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.200> hear<00:01:31.290> these<00:01:31.439> sounds

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
ice like this when you hear these sounds

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.950 
ice like this when you hear these sounds
that's<00:01:32.549> creating<00:01:33.150> little<00:01:33.360> bubbles<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.930> your

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
that's creating little bubbles in your

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.120 
that's creating little bubbles in your
drink<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> don't<00:01:34.770> want<00:01:35.040> bubbles<00:01:36.110> want

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
drink and you don't want bubbles want

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.630 
drink and you don't want bubbles want
viscosity<00:01:39.680> so<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.829> being<00:01:41.009> said<00:01:41.100> that's<00:01:41.400> what

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
viscosity so that being said that's what

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.880 
viscosity so that being said that's what
I'm<00:01:41.700> gonna<00:01:41.790> do<00:01:41.970> when<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.119> actually<00:01:42.299> get<00:01:42.570> into

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
I'm gonna do when I actually get into

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.100 
I'm gonna do when I actually get into
mixing<00:01:43.890> my<00:01:44.009> martini<00:01:44.369> I'm<00:01:45.329> gonna<00:01:45.509> fill<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
mixing my martini I'm gonna fill the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.609 
mixing my martini I'm gonna fill the
mixing<00:01:46.500> glass<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:46.920> ice<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:49.020> always<00:01:49.380> want<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
mixing glass with ice you always want to

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.389 
mixing glass with ice you always want to
keep<00:01:49.860> your<00:01:50.009> glass<00:01:50.310> almost<00:01:51.210> completely<00:01:51.750> cold

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
keep your glass almost completely cold

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.830 
keep your glass almost completely cold
you<00:01:53.399> don't<00:01:53.579> add<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.090> don't<00:01:54.270> fill<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> glass

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
you don't add you don't fill the glass

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.950 
you don't add you don't fill the glass
with<00:01:54.869> ice<00:01:55.219> it'll<00:01:56.219> dilute<00:01:56.490> more<00:01:56.729> quickly<00:01:57.090> and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
with ice it'll dilute more quickly and

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.990 
with ice it'll dilute more quickly and
when<00:01:58.170> you're<00:01:58.290> stirring<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:59.490> essentially<00:01:59.880> you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
when you're stirring you essentially you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.359 
when you're stirring you essentially you
want<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.329> have<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> glass<00:02:00.689> where<00:02:01.229> your<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.920> heat

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
want to have a glass where your the heat

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.120 
want to have a glass where your the heat
of<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:02.549> hands<00:02:02.939> isn't<00:02:03.899> warming<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.320> glass<00:02:04.530> so

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
of your hands isn't warming the glass so

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.550 
of your hands isn't warming the glass so
the<00:02:05.280> idea<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.820> get<00:02:05.939> your<00:02:06.149> spoon<00:02:06.600> right<00:02:07.469> in

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the idea is to get your spoon right in

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.219 
the idea is to get your spoon right in
the<00:02:07.680> bottom<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.129> glass<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:09.629> turn<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
the bottom of the glass and to turn the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.230 
the bottom of the glass and to turn the
ice<00:02:11.450> making<00:02:12.450> as

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
ice making as
