00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 well hey people and welcome to my 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.809
 second tutorial from cydia i will 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.679
 show you today how you like the program 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.859
 gets installed and whatsapp 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.390
 messenger 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.920
 Of course I could do that in two 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.769
 tutorials make but I think so 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.769
 slightly unnecessary because I as a basic idea 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.279
 actually only whatsapp messenger as 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.590
 that you get as a tutorial 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.739
 wanted 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:38.040
 and since you're in favor of everything, I need it 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.579
 now all the same with it as it goes 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.579
 always on cydia 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.910
 and I wanted to say that again 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.340
 I do the tutorials all over the ipod 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.920
 So it will be called in this 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.820
 case that the tutorial is about how 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.229
 her whatsapp messenger about an ipod and 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.229
 the ipad gets 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.920
 unfortunately it takes me quite a long time 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.170
 mentioned in the last tutorial that 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.520
 to record via the display recorder 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:28.560
 I will record and I will 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.560
 desired also to do a tutorial 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:41.950
 then you go looking for oh yes for it 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:45.160
 but if you already make sense of the source 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.050
 iphone re.com has added then 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.710
 that is no problem with ins 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.940
 but if they are not 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.000
 added 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.710
 I'm going to the source again in the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.290
 description will pack that then you still 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:05.640
 could add if you still have them 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.640
 do not have then you look for her 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:19.380
 yes, install it here as 5 always on it 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.580
 click on install here up town 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.750
 would change with you then 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.160
 then you stand clicks 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.360
 get on install now 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:34.710
 confirm then it goes down and then 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:39.830
 you can also right about whatsapp 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.830
 messenger can you whats app 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:50.300
 download 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:55.080
 that does not come from the 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:57.660
 reasonable iphone re.com source but 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.790
 that's what cydia already has 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:08.340
 provided for free then goes 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:10.740
 You also have to install it and 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.390
 if you can then confirm 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:19.640
 you have downloaded everything too 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:23.160
 so far for in stars &amp; whatsapp messenger 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.720
 prepare these spots pad that will 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.240
 not as in the settings 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.980
 show up or just because it just 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.710
 there is the whatsapp messenger for that 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:41.880
 that's as if you were yours 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:46.670
 ipod around her in which that 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:59.100
 Operating system for the ipod and the ipad 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:04:03.120
 as a messenger that her 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.760
 whatsapp messenger on your ipad 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.110
 I work on an ipod or ipad 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.810
 do not know exactly how I say so 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.270
 now it's not right 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.370
 application if you can change something 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.190
 or something like that 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:21.870
 it's just it's running in, so to speak 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.560
 background yes and then if you are 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.010
 then 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.940
 Everything has finished loading down 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:44.520
 you go on install then you go up 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:48.060
 search and search there then you come here 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.630
 on whatsapp messenger then you go up 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.370
 download and I always recommend you 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.810
 to take magnet as this you have 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.720
 you do not come to any 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.970
 where you still have some 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.430
 Enter codes to download 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.810
 or so but then the download will be 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:12.300
 automatically started then if you that 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.960

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.960
