00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.820
Introduction

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.060
I was invited to a friend 's house on a winter' s day two years ago.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.700
We watched anime movies on his AV system.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.420
This is the first time I listened to the sound of the "back loaded horn".

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.100
Back loaded horn is a kind of speaker system.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:34.480
The sound behind the speaker comes out of a long pipe like a maze.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.640
I was fascinated by the warm sound

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.420
and its strange structure.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.120
So I made that maze.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.960
Design

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.200
First of all, I drew something like a design drawing.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.440
The important thing is the capacity of the "air chamber"

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.580
and the cross section of the exit "throat" of the sound.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.520
The length of "horn" should be as long as 1.5 meters or more.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.160
These three points are most important.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.560
The spread of the horn can be calculated, or it can depend on your aesthetic sense.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.300
Please repeat drafts until your satisfaction

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.520
and make details into drawings.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.360
Preparation

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.840
Prepare the board according to the drawing.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.420
It is easy to have big parts cut at the store.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.440
Porish the boards with sandpaper and

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.120
copy the design drawing on the boards.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.520
Mark the position where you hit the nail with a pin.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.320
Align the width of the board

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.600
to prevent sound leakage from the gap.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.660
Draw the Speaker hole with compass.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.700
Open a small hole with a drill, insert the jigsaw blade from there

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.800
and cut it as you draw the circle.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.880
Jigsaw is useful for making holes in the board.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.880
It can be used in various situations.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.840
These electric tools can be rented at the store.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.440
In the same way, open the hole of the terminal and

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:00.820
the preparation of the boards is over with this.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.640
Assembling

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.520
First, assemble the maze partially.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.380
This is the other one.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.440
Combining the two now will be like this.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.680
Apply the woodworkingbond and hit the nail before it moves.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.500
This board will stabilize if you arrange the heights by magazines or something.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.600
A corner triangle was attached

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.380
with bond and a stapler.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.440
And we will nail the maze to the side plate.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.440
Here I used a 2.5 cm casing nail.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.740
Hold the board with one hand and hit the nail with the other hand.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.700
Paint bond plenty so as not to leak sound.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.480
Wipe off if it goes outside.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.480
Completion is approaching.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.520
Solder the terminal and cable.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.300
Insert the cable from the hole on the back.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.620
Fix the terminal with screws.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.660
Connect the other end of the cable to the speaker.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.200
Finally, the other side plate is bonded, nailed and completed.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.240
Trial listening

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.180
It is the time of happy trial listening

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.100
Let's compare the sound from the speaker and the sound of the horn here.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.520
Sound from the speaker

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.440
Sound from the horn

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:11.460
The two sounds mixed and become the sound of "back loaded horn"

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.560
It is a device that uses the sound behind the speaker.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.200
That unique sound will be loved by many people in the future.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.640
Thank you for your viewing.
