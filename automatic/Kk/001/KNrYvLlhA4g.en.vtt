the very center of this cluster and then

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.680 
the very center of this cluster and then
we<00:03:56.430> take<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.760> Juno<00:03:57.000> spectrograph<00:03:57.540> and

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
velocities are much higher than what we

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.160 
velocities are much higher than what we
would<00:04:02.760> expect<00:04:02.880> just<00:04:03.390> from<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.660> stars<00:04:03.900> and

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
would expect just from the stars and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.810 
would expect just from the stars and
that<00:04:04.530> implies<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:04.980> there's<00:04:05.280> an<00:04:05.430> extra<00:04:05.700> man

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820

that implies that there's an extra man
of<00:04:05.940> moszer<00:04:06.360> which<00:04:06.630> is<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.530> means<00:04:07.770> that<00:04:07.920> we

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
of moszer which is it means that we

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.250 
of moszer which is it means that we
found<00:04:08.160> a<00:04:08.340> black<00:04:08.490> hole<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:09.080> what's<00:04:10.080> so<00:04:10.230> special

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
found a black hole and what's so special

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.320 
found a black hole and what's so special
about<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:10.830> black<00:04:11.070> hole<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.790> very<00:04:11.970> special

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
about this black hole the very special

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.670 
about this black hole the very special
thing<00:04:12.540> about<00:04:12.600> this<00:04:12.840> black<00:04:13.110> hole<00:04:13.140> is<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.440> it

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
thing about this black hole is that it

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.850 
thing about this black hole is that it
has<00:04:13.860> 40,000<00:04:14.580> solar<00:04:14.730> masses<00:04:15.000> in<00:04:15.390> size<00:04:15.630> so<00:04:16.470> that

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
has 40,000 solar masses in size so that

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.289 
has 40,000 solar masses in size so that
means<00:04:17.190> it's<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.400> lot<00:04:17.549> bigger<00:04:17.760> than<00:04:18.150> the

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
means it's a lot bigger than the

means it's a lot bigger than the
stellar-mass<00:04:18.630> black<00:04:18.750> holes<00:04:19.260> are<00:04:19.380> we<00:04:19.500> find<00:04:19.709> in

sizes<00:04:30.590> so<00:04:31.590> what's<00:04:31.920> the<00:04:32.010> big<00:04:32.160> deal<00:04:32.340> why<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.670> it

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
sizes so what's the big deal why is it

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.060 
sizes so what's the big deal why is it
so<00:04:32.940> important<00:04:33.360> well<00:04:33.900> first<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.500> all<00:04:34.680> this<00:04:34.890> is

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
so important well first of all this is

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.740 
so important well first of all this is
only<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.520> second<00:04:35.880> black<00:04:36.060> hole<00:04:36.240> that<00:04:36.360> we<00:04:36.480> find

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
only the second black hole that we find

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.750 
only the second black hole that we find
in<00:04:37.050> a<00:04:37.170> globular<00:04:37.350> cluster<00:04:37.530> so<00:04:38.220> that<00:04:38.400> is<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.580> very

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
in a globular cluster so that is a very

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.410 
in a globular cluster so that is a very
nice<00:04:38.940> reassuring<00:04:39.840> thing<00:04:40.560> but<00:04:41.310> also<00:04:41.490> we<00:04:42.210> know

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
nice reassuring thing but also we know

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.480 
nice reassuring thing but also we know
that<00:04:42.450> there<00:04:42.780> are<00:04:42.900> seeds<00:04:43.200> required<00:04:43.920> to<00:04:44.250> grow

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
that there are seeds required to grow

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.190 
that there are seeds required to grow
the<00:04:44.700> supermassive<00:04:45.150> black<00:04:45.480> holes<00:04:45.750> from

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
the supermassive black holes from

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.440 
the supermassive black holes from
scratch<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:46.800> if<00:04:47.610> we<00:04:47.730> find<00:04:47.940> many<00:04:48.150> of<00:04:48.240> these

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
scratch and if we find many of these

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.180 
scratch and if we find many of these
then<00:04:48.810> that<00:04:48.960> would<00:04:49.080> be<00:04:49.170> a<00:04:49.200> very<00:04:49.410> nice<00:04:49.590> source

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
then that would be a very nice source

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.160 
then that would be a very nice source
for<00:04:50.730> these<00:04:50.850> seeds<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.420> blow<00:04:51.600> to<00:04:51.870> grow<00:04:52.020> the

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
for these seeds to blow to grow the

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.260 
for these seeds to blow to grow the
supermassive<00:04:52.530> black<00:04:52.830> holes

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.670 

one<00:04:56.270> implication<00:04:56.539> of<00:04:56.870> this<00:04:56.990> discovery<00:04:57.500> is

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
one implication of this discovery is

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.680 
one implication of this discovery is
that<00:04:58.129> it<00:04:58.250> is<00:04:58.340> very<00:04:58.520> likely<00:04:58.819> that<00:04:59.360> Omega

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
that it is very likely that Omega

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.719 
that it is very likely that Omega
Centauri<00:04:59.870> is<00:05:00.379> not<00:05:00.680> a<00:05:00.889> globular<00:05:01.250> cluster<00:05:01.280> at

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
Centauri is not a globular cluster at

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.300 
Centauri is not a globular cluster at
all<00:05:01.879> but<00:05:02.479> rather<00:05:02.509> some<00:05:03.229> kind<00:05:03.259> of<00:05:03.500> dwarf<00:05:03.830> galaxy

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
all but rather some kind of dwarf galaxy

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.589 
all but rather some kind of dwarf galaxy
that<00:05:04.520> has<00:05:04.669> been<00:05:04.819> stripped<00:05:05.180> of<00:05:05.270> its<00:05:05.360> outer

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
that has been stripped of its outer

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.200 
that has been stripped of its outer
stars<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.379> dark<00:05:06.650> matter<00:05:06.889> as<00:05:07.250> some<00:05:07.699> scientists

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
stars and dark matter as some scientists

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.890 
stars and dark matter as some scientists
have<00:05:08.330> suspected<00:05:08.509> for<00:05:09.199> a<00:05:09.259> few<00:05:09.530> years<00:05:10.780> more<00:05:11.780> than

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
have suspected for a few years more than

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.020 
have suspected for a few years more than
two<00:05:12.110> thousand<00:05:12.590> years<00:05:12.620> after<00:05:13.220> Omega<00:05:13.849> Centauri

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
two thousand years after Omega Centauri

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.839 
two thousand years after Omega Centauri
was<00:05:14.479> wrongly<00:05:14.810> classified<00:05:15.440> as<00:05:15.590> a<00:05:15.620> star<00:05:15.979> it's

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
was wrongly classified as a star it's

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.260 
was wrongly classified as a star it's
true<00:05:17.210> nature<00:05:17.419> is<00:05:17.780> finally<00:05:18.319> coming<00:05:18.650> to<00:05:18.770> light

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
true nature is finally coming to light

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.719 
true nature is finally coming to light
but<00:05:20.270> I<00:05:20.300> wonder<00:05:20.720> does<00:05:21.409> Omega<00:05:21.800> Centauri<00:05:21.979> have

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
but I wonder does Omega Centauri have

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.930 
but I wonder does Omega Centauri have
more<00:05:23.030> surprises<00:05:23.240> in<00:05:23.599> store<00:05:23.720> for<00:05:24.139> us<00:05:24.789> this<00:05:25.789> is

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
more surprises in store for us this is

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.149 
more surprises in store for us this is
dr<00:05:26.180> j<00:05:26.210> signing<00:05:26.569> off<00:05:27.199> for<00:05:27.349> the<00:05:27.409> hubblecast<00:05:27.560> once

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.159 
dr j signing off for the hubblecast once

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:30.670 
dr j signing off for the hubblecast once
again<00:05:28.699> nature<00:05:28.880> has<00:05:29.539> surprised<00:05:29.960> us<00:05:30.110> beyond<00:05:30.530> our

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
again nature has surprised us beyond our

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.789 
again nature has surprised us beyond our
wildest<00:05:31.159> imagination
