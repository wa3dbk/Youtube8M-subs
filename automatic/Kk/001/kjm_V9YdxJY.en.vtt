00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
we're going to show you how to make this

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.040 
we're going to show you how to make this
block<00:00:30.550> today<00:00:30.970> and<00:00:31.269> the<00:00:31.449> first<00:00:31.689> thing<00:00:31.900> you'll

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
block today and the first thing you'll

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.520 
block today and the first thing you'll
need<00:00:32.199> is<00:00:32.529> lots<00:00:33.430> of<00:00:33.640> triangles<00:00:34.600> and<00:00:34.839> you'll

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
need is lots of triangles and you'll

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.640 
need is lots of triangles and you'll
notice<00:00:35.710> now<00:00:35.979> we<00:00:36.040> have<00:00:36.220> two<00:00:37.440> pairs<00:00:38.440> of

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
notice now we have two pairs of

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.520 
notice now we have two pairs of
triangles<00:00:39.430> and<00:00:39.610> they<00:00:40.510> each<00:00:40.839> have<00:00:41.290> the<00:00:41.470> same

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
triangles and they each have the same

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.469 
triangles and they each have the same
fabric<00:00:42.309> on<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.580> bottom<00:00:42.729> because<00:00:43.360> you're

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:43.479 
fabric on the bottom because you're

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:45.119 
fabric on the bottom because you're
going<00:00:43.570> to<00:00:43.659> see<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:43.989> back<00:00:44.170> of<00:00:44.350> this<00:00:44.440> block<00:00:44.799> is

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
going to see the back of this block is

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.530 
going to see the back of this block is
all<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.879> same<00:00:46.089> fabric<00:00:46.769> so<00:00:48.089> we'll<00:00:49.089> take<00:00:49.299> these

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
all the same fabric so we'll take these

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.979 
all the same fabric so we'll take these
two<00:00:49.949> sets<00:00:50.949> of<00:00:51.159> triangles<00:00:52.000> and<00:00:52.239> we're<00:00:52.809> going<00:00:52.930> to

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
two sets of triangles and we're going to

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.299 
two sets of triangles and we're going to
put<00:00:53.199> them<00:00:53.379> wrong<00:00:54.129> sides<00:00:54.940> or<00:00:55.269> back<00:00:55.629> sides

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
put them wrong sides or back sides

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.979 
put them wrong sides or back sides
together<00:00:57.309> so<00:00:57.940> that's<00:00:58.180> different<00:00:58.540> then

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
together so that's different then

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.140 
together so that's different then
reverse<00:00:59.440> in<00:00:59.680> your<00:00:59.830> head<00:01:00.040> we're<00:01:00.369> used<00:01:00.580> to<00:01:00.729> and

reverse in your head we're used to and

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.359 
reverse in your head we're used to and
we're<00:01:01.420> going<00:01:01.449> to<00:01:01.570> sew<00:01:01.900> with<00:01:02.680> a<00:01:02.920> half<00:01:03.549> inch<00:01:03.850> seam

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
we're going to sew with a half inch seam

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.859 
we're going to sew with a half inch seam
I'm<00:01:06.369> going<00:01:06.549> to<00:01:06.609> change<00:01:06.880> everything<00:01:07.450> up<00:01:07.630> for

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
I'm going to change everything up for

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.959 
I'm going to change everything up for
there's<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.409> little<00:01:09.039> bit<00:01:09.159> different<00:01:09.579> than<00:01:09.789> your

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
there's a little bit different than your

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.179 
there's a little bit different than your
normal<00:01:10.000> quilting<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.350> you<00:01:11.469> can<00:01:11.619> see<00:01:11.799> I've<00:01:11.950> put

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
normal quilting and you can see I've put

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.219 
normal quilting and you can see I've put
a<00:01:12.219> walking<00:01:13.060> foot<00:01:13.240> on<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.509> sewing<00:01:13.689> machine

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
a walking foot on the sewing machine

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.539 
a walking foot on the sewing machine
we're<00:01:14.619> actually<00:01:14.770> sewing<00:01:15.159> through<00:01:15.310> four

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
we're actually sewing through four

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.569 
we're actually sewing through four
layers<00:01:15.909> of<00:01:16.090> fabric<00:01:16.840> at<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.020> same<00:01:17.259> time<00:01:17.530> so<00:01:18.219> it

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
layers of fabric at the same time so it

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.310 
layers of fabric at the same time so it
would<00:01:18.729> it<00:01:19.090> does<00:01:19.329> help<00:01:19.539> a<00:01:19.630> little<00:01:19.780> bit<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.109> keep

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
would it does help a little bit to keep

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.719 
would it does help a little bit to keep
things<00:01:20.560> from<00:01:20.740> getting<00:01:20.890> stretched<00:01:21.369> and

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
things from getting stretched and

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.029 
things from getting stretched and
distorted<00:01:22.390> as<00:01:22.539> we<00:01:22.689> sew<00:01:22.869> and<00:01:23.590> we're<00:01:23.770> using

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
distorted as we sew and we're using

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.569 
distorted as we sew and we're using
homespun<00:01:24.880> fabric<00:01:25.390> because<00:01:25.750> it<00:01:25.990> will<00:01:26.770> fray

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
homespun fabric because it will fray

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.819 
homespun fabric because it will fray
nicely<00:01:28.270> rags<00:01:29.079> great<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.939> once<00:01:31.719> you<00:01:31.899> have<00:01:32.140> those

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
nicely rags great so once you have those

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.989 
nicely rags great so once you have those
sewn<00:01:33.429> together<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:35.170> open<00:01:35.799> it<00:01:35.890> up<00:01:36.100> then<00:01:36.820> we're

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:36.999 
sewn together and open it up then we're

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:40.200 
sewn together and open it up then we're
going<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.179> press<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.719> seams<00:01:38.079> open<00:01:38.999> I'm<00:01:39.999> just

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
going to press the seams open I'm just

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.389 
going to press the seams open I'm just
going<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.450> get<00:01:40.600> it<00:01:40.689> started<00:01:40.990> here<00:01:41.560> we're<00:01:42.219> used

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
going to get it started here we're used

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.130 
going to get it started here we're used
to<00:01:42.460> having<00:01:42.549> all<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:42.880> our<00:01:43.090> seams<00:01:43.390> hidden<00:01:43.840> on<00:01:44.049> the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
to having all of our seams hidden on the

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.749 
to having all of our seams hidden on the
back<00:01:44.289> side<00:01:44.590> of<00:01:44.619> our<00:01:44.829> quilts<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.280> this<00:01:45.399> is<00:01:45.549> one

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
back side of our quilts and this is one

back side of our quilts and this is one
where<00:01:45.939> all<00:01:45.969> the<00:01:46.420> seams<00:01:46.689> are<00:01:46.960> exposed<00:01:47.439> and<00:01:47.770> on

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
the front side of the quilt but it makes

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.630 
the front side of the quilt but it makes
a<00:01:50.140> great<00:01:50.259> texture<00:01:50.770> when<00:01:50.920> you're<00:01:51.039> done<00:01:51.159> so

okay<00:02:12.099> right<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.640> so<00:02:12.940> then<00:02:13.150> what<00:02:13.330> you're<00:02:13.510> going

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
okay right and so then what you're going

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.229 
okay right and so then what you're going
to<00:02:13.720> do<00:02:14.050> is<00:02:16.080> quilt<00:02:17.080> across<00:02:17.590> there<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.879> hold<00:02:19.090> it

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
to do is quilt across there to hold it

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.030 
to do is quilt across there to hold it
in<00:02:19.360> place<00:02:19.629> or<00:02:19.900> just<00:02:19.959> stitch<00:02:20.410> from<00:02:20.680> corner<00:02:21.010> to

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
in place or just stitch from corner to

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.920 
in place or just stitch from corner to
corner<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.640> we're<00:02:21.879> going<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.150> stitch<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
corner and we're going to stitch the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.390 
corner and we're going to stitch the
opposite<00:02:23.440> direction<00:02:23.709> of<00:02:23.890> our<00:02:23.980> seam<00:02:24.250> we're

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
opposite direction of our seam we're

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.100 
opposite direction of our seam we're
going<00:02:24.519> to<00:02:24.580> go<00:02:24.670> corner<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.150> corner<00:02:25.300> crust<00:02:25.780> and

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
going to go corner to corner crust and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.690 
going to go corner to corner crust and
since<00:02:26.920> red<00:02:27.280> quilts<00:02:27.670> are<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:29.140> more<00:02:29.709> relaxed<00:02:30.459> kind

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
since red quilts are a more relaxed kind

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.240 
since red quilts are a more relaxed kind
of<00:02:30.879> style<00:02:31.239> we<00:02:31.900> aren't<00:02:32.230> as<00:02:32.440> worried<00:02:33.069> about

helps so that you don't cut into the

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.030 
helps so that you don't cut into the
seam<00:03:26.170> allowance<00:03:26.470> because<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.709> don't<00:03:26.859> want<00:03:26.980> to

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
seam allowance because you don't want to

cut all the way through and what you go

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.250 
cut all the way through and what you go
in<00:03:29.079> and<00:03:29.319> do<00:03:29.470> is<00:03:29.709> just<00:03:30.370> clip<00:03:30.670> every<00:03:31.150> quarter<00:03:31.630> to

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
half inch like this all along every seam

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.729 
half inch like this all along every seam
allowance<00:03:37.329> a<00:03:37.630> lot<00:03:38.170> of<00:03:38.290> clipping<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.650> you'll

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
allowance a lot of clipping and you'll

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.319 
allowance a lot of clipping and you'll
notice<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.160> blades<00:03:39.459> and<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.760> scissors<00:03:40.030> are

really short and that helps you just

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.240 
really short and that helps you just
make<00:03:43.269> a<00:03:43.299> nice<00:03:43.540> grab<00:03:44.019> those<00:03:44.260> little<00:03:44.560> clips<00:03:44.829> into

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
make a nice grab those little clips into

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.129 
make a nice grab those little clips into
that<00:03:45.430> there<00:03:45.849> are<00:03:45.970> also<00:03:46.239> scissors<00:03:46.840> that<00:03:46.989> are

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
that there are also scissors that are

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.259
