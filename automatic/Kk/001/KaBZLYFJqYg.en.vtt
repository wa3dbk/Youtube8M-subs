00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
all of the you know system files which

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.309 
all of the you know system files which
have<00:03:50.829> been<00:03:50.980> dumped<00:03:51.430> like<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.730> kashi<00:03:51.969> files<00:03:52.480> or

the system error files and all of that

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.690 
the system error files and all of that
which<00:03:56.230> basically<00:03:56.739> do<00:03:57.040> not<00:03:57.189> contribute

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
which basically do not contribute

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.670 
which basically do not contribute
anything<00:03:57.969> to<00:03:58.329> your<00:03:58.569> device<00:03:58.870> but<00:03:59.109> rather<00:03:59.319> just

the process was done it told me that
round<00:04:16.299> about<00:04:16.570> 300<00:04:17.320> megabytes<00:04:17.739> of<00:04:18.120> memory

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
round about 300 megabytes of memory

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.800 
round about 300 megabytes of memory
space<00:04:19.870> was<00:04:20.109> cleared<00:04:20.500> out<00:04:20.709> after<00:04:21.639> deleting<00:04:22.449> all

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
space was cleared out after deleting all

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.159 
space was cleared out after deleting all
of<00:04:23.020> this<00:04:23.289> stuff<00:04:23.860> which<00:04:24.520> is<00:04:24.789> quite<00:04:25.539> a<00:04:25.599> lot<00:04:25.930> and

so<00:04:32.560> now<00:04:32.770> let's<00:04:32.800> talk<00:04:33.190> about<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.550> next<00:04:33.699> week

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
so now let's talk about the next week

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.999 
so now let's talk about the next week
we've<00:04:34.150> got<00:04:34.389> which<00:04:34.570> is<00:04:34.690> called<00:04:34.900> stride<00:04:35.229> as<00:04:35.889> you

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
we've got which is called stride as you

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.210 
we've got which is called stride as you
can<00:04:36.130> see<00:04:36.220> I've<00:04:36.340> got<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.610> long<00:04:36.849> swim<00:04:37.030> like<00:04:37.270> this

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
can see I've got a long swim like this

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.540 
can see I've got a long swim like this
so<00:04:39.220> I<00:04:39.250> can<00:04:39.340> put<00:04:39.729> a<00:04:39.789> pattern<00:04:40.509> password<00:04:41.139> and

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
so I can put a pattern password and

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.909 
so I can put a pattern password and
let's<00:04:42.550> see<00:04:42.729> what<00:04:43.169> settings<00:04:44.169> we've<00:04:44.320> got<00:04:44.530> in<00:04:44.710> the

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
let's see what settings we've got in the

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.850 
let's see what settings we've got in the
stride<00:04:45.250> you<00:04:46.120> know<00:04:46.240> tweak<00:04:46.539> ok<00:04:47.500> so<00:04:47.590> if<00:04:47.740> you've

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
stride you know tweak ok so if you've

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.320 
stride you know tweak ok so if you've
got<00:04:48.009> the<00:04:48.220> enables<00:04:48.639> right<00:04:48.849> of<00:04:48.970> course<00:04:49.120> it's

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
got the enables right of course it's

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.420 
got the enables right of course it's
going<00:04:49.479> to<00:04:49.539> enable<00:04:49.690> it<00:04:49.990> skip<00:04:50.620> pen<00:04:50.800> entry<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.370> an

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
going to enable it skip pen entry to an

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.430 
going to enable it skip pen entry to an
escape<00:04:51.699> your<00:04:51.909> passcode<00:04:52.509> entry<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.110> typical

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
escape your passcode entry the typical

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.920 
escape your passcode entry the typical
passcode<00:04:53.889> entry<00:04:54.250> where<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.240> enter<00:04:55.570> numbers

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
passcode entry where you enter numbers

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.589 
passcode entry where you enter numbers
and<00:04:56.289> multi<00:04:56.650> she<00:04:56.860> password<00:04:57.370> it's<00:04:57.580> gonna<00:04:57.759> be<00:04:58.570> a
