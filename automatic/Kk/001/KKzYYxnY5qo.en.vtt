00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
as well like I know it's like crazy like

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.130 
as well like I know it's like crazy like
like<00:03:24.730> theory<00:03:25.030> like<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.420> but<00:03:25.570> maybe<00:03:25.840> just

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
like theory like that but maybe just

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.080 
like theory like that but maybe just
because<00:03:26.470> that<00:03:26.980> eat<00:03:27.220> meals<00:03:27.459> meaning<00:03:27.820> that<00:03:27.910> he's

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
because that eat meals meaning that he's

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.580 
because that eat meals meaning that he's
been<00:03:28.239> supplying<00:03:28.690> him<00:03:28.930> or<00:03:29.049> power<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.440> could

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
been supplying him or power it could

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.320 
been supplying him or power it could
also<00:03:29.709> explain<00:03:30.010> why<00:03:30.130> he's<00:03:30.730> not<00:03:30.940> being<00:03:31.090> able<00:03:31.209> to

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
also explain why he's not being able to

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.150 
also explain why he's not being able to
use<00:03:31.360> dragon<00:03:31.959> force<00:03:32.200> as<00:03:32.380> much<00:03:32.530> as<00:03:32.739> well<00:03:32.890> since

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
use dragon force as much as well since

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160 
use dragon force as much as well since
you<00:03:33.700> see<00:03:33.880> like<00:03:34.030> God<00:03:34.269> Gio's<00:03:34.570> it<00:03:34.720> was<00:03:34.870> usually

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
all that back at that time I think

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.660

during<00:03:58.600> a<00:03:58.780> rash<00:03:58.989> on<00:03:59.230> say<00:03:59.440> so<00:03:59.500> it<00:04:00.250> their<00:04:00.459> bigs

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
during a rash on say so it their bigs

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.370 
during a rash on say so it their bigs
the<00:04:00.760> question<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.269> as<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.600> was<00:04:01.720> saying<00:04:01.930> with

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
the question and as I was saying with

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.960 
the question and as I was saying with
like<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.799> whole<00:04:02.950> power<00:04:03.250> of<00:04:03.400> stuff<00:04:03.670> and<00:04:03.790> stuff

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
like the whole power of stuff and stuff

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.090 
like the whole power of stuff and stuff
like<00:04:04.570> that<00:04:04.630> maybe<00:04:05.049> that<00:04:05.260> could<00:04:05.440> explain<00:04:05.769> a

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
like that maybe that could explain a

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.039 
like that maybe that could explain a
little<00:04:06.489> bit<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:06.880> it<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.060> mean<00:04:07.299> still<00:04:07.720> it<00:04:07.870> should

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
little bit of it I mean still it should

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.319 
little bit of it I mean still it should
have<00:04:08.170> more<00:04:08.320> legit<00:04:09.130> reasons<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:09.790> would<00:04:10.000> like<00:04:10.180> if

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
have more legit reasons I would like if

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:11.880 
have more legit reasons I would like if
here<00:04:10.540> actually<00:04:10.750> hit<00:04:11.049> it<00:04:11.079> more<00:04:11.380> towards<00:04:11.530> this

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
here actually hit it more towards this

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.650 
here actually hit it more towards this
or<00:04:12.070> something<00:04:12.220> let's<00:04:12.519> say<00:04:12.579> like<00:04:12.790> oh<00:04:12.970> you<00:04:13.239> had

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
or something let's say like oh you had

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.180 
or something let's say like oh you had
the<00:04:13.690> appeals<00:04:14.110> power<00:04:14.380> they<00:04:14.650> knew<00:04:14.829> or<00:04:14.950> something

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
the appeals power they knew or something

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.099 
the appeals power they knew or something
about<00:04:15.310> that<00:04:15.489> and<00:04:15.730> literally<00:04:16.450> comes<00:04:16.780> out<00:04:16.930> as

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
about that and literally comes out as

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.620 
about that and literally comes out as
fucking<00:04:17.440> igneel<00:04:17.829> like<00:04:18.400> I'm<00:04:19.090> guessing<00:04:19.479> maybe

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
fucking igneel like I'm guessing maybe

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.420 
fucking igneel like I'm guessing maybe
like<00:04:20.049> what<00:04:20.320> was<00:04:20.500> happening<00:04:20.799> was<00:04:20.950> that<00:04:20.979> evening

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
like what was happening was that evening

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.490 
like what was happening was that evening
was<00:04:21.609> supplying<00:04:21.970> natural<00:04:22.900> power<00:04:23.140> with<00:04:23.380> all

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
was supplying natural power with all

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.000 
was supplying natural power with all
this<00:04:23.590> time<00:04:23.830> so<00:04:24.130> he<00:04:24.280> was<00:04:24.370> acting

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
this time so he was acting

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.070 
this time so he was acting
able<00:04:25.370> to<00:04:25.490> like<00:04:25.610> win<00:04:25.880> against<00:04:26.120> us<00:04:26.300> by<00:04:26.480> then<00:04:26.630> who

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
able to like win against us by then who

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.320 
able to like win against us by then who
knows<00:04:27.320> like<00:04:27.560> he<00:04:27.920> probably<00:04:28.130> couldn't<00:04:28.460> control

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
knows like he probably couldn't control

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.540 
knows like he probably couldn't control
like<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.810> actual<00:04:30.290> driving<00:04:30.860> force<00:04:31.160> within<00:04:31.250> him

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
like the actual driving force within him

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.030 
like the actual driving force within him
because<00:04:32.030> of<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.180> igneous<00:04:32.450> body<00:04:32.900> was<00:04:33.590> into<00:04:33.890> in

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
because of the igneous body was into in

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.320 
because of the igneous body was into in
end<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.400> entire<00:04:34.640> time<00:04:34.880> so<00:04:34.940> I'm<00:04:35.180> guessing

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
end the entire time so I'm guessing

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.030 
end the entire time so I'm guessing
that's<00:04:35.600> why<00:04:35.720> he<00:04:35.780> always<00:04:36.110> had<00:04:36.230> had<00:04:36.380> a<00:04:36.410> medium

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
that's why he always had had a medium

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.280 
that's why he always had had a medium
when<00:04:37.520> him<00:04:37.700> it<00:04:37.940> would<00:04:38.210> it<00:04:38.330> in<00:04:38.480> like<00:04:38.690> you<00:04:39.050> get<00:04:39.260> to

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
when him it would it in like you get to

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.310 
when him it would it in like you get to
see<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:39.590> know<00:04:39.740> he<00:04:40.190> has<00:04:40.730> the<00:04:40.940> F<00:04:41.090> real<00:04:41.420> uyen<00:04:42.170> as

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
see you know he has the F real uyen as

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.870 
see you know he has the F real uyen as
well<00:04:42.470> that<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.860> golden<00:04:43.250> flame<00:04:43.460> they<00:04:43.670> had

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
well that the golden flame they had

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.060 
well that the golden flame they had
journey<00:04:44.240> get<00:04:44.540> 0<00:04:44.780> so<00:04:45.110> that's<00:04:45.590> why<00:04:45.710> I'm<00:04:45.770> guessing

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
journey get 0 so that's why I'm guessing

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.320 
journey get 0 so that's why I'm guessing
so<00:04:46.190> who<00:04:46.370> knows<00:04:46.550> maybe<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:46.940> answer<00:04:47.180> this<00:04:47.270> you

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
so who knows maybe the answer this you

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.120 
so who knows maybe the answer this you
may<00:04:47.540> be<00:04:47.600> my<00:04:47.810> better<00:04:48.020> controlled<00:04:48.410> drugs<00:04:48.920> or

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
may be my better controlled drugs or

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.890 
may be my better controlled drugs or
