functioning wiper my made it to 50,000
miles<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:16.260> was<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.680> end<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:17.010> it

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.689 

basically<00:00:21.500> situation<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.650> all<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.189> dirt<00:00:23.400> from

basically situation is all the dirt from

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.189 
basically situation is all the dirt from
the<00:00:24.449> road<00:00:24.630> salt

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
the road salt

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.380 
the road salt
whatever<00:00:25.529> correct<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.070> grime<00:00:26.250> goes<00:00:26.670> out<00:00:26.910> into

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
whatever correct and grime goes out into

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.480 
whatever correct and grime goes out into
the<00:00:27.599> shaft<00:00:27.840> right<00:00:28.230> here<00:00:28.529> there<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.250> little

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
the shaft right here there is a little

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.759 
the shaft right here there is a little
color<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.359> protection<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.109> goes<00:00:31.289> over<00:00:31.590> but

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
color of protection that goes over but

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.659 
color of protection that goes over but
it's<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.189> enough

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
it's not enough

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.150 
it's not enough
so<00:00:33.090> all<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.480> muck<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.050> guck<00:00:34.260> gets<00:00:34.739> down<00:00:34.950> in

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
so all this muck and guck gets down in

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.479 
so all this muck and guck gets down in
here<00:00:35.399> locks<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.239> shaft<00:00:36.510> up<00:00:36.950> wiper<00:00:37.950> stars<00:00:38.280> we

here locks the shaft up wiper stars we

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.430 
here locks the shaft up wiper stars we
were<00:00:38.670> slowly<00:00:38.910> then<00:00:39.239> stops<00:00:39.750> moving<00:00:40.230> all

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
were slowly then stops moving all

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
together I tried to clean it using gum

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.880 
together I tried to clean it using gum
out<00:00:44.809> some<00:00:45.809> solvent<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.469> down<00:00:46.620> there<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
out some solvent to get down there to

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.220 
out some solvent to get down there to
get<00:00:47.010> all<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.280> gunk<00:00:47.520> out<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.050> since<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.170> is

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
get all the gunk out but since this is

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.470 
get all the gunk out but since this is
sealed<00:00:49.710> all<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.100> way<00:00:50.309> through<00:00:50.670> nothing<00:00:51.270> goes

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
sealed all the way through nothing goes

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.450 
sealed all the way through nothing goes
through<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:52.050> just<00:00:52.260> sits<00:00:52.440> right<00:00:52.530> here<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.920> top<00:00:53.129> I

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
through it just sits right here on top I

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.920 
through it just sits right here on top I
tried<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.940> break<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.270> loose<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.600> putting<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
tried to break it loose like putting the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.709 
tried to break it loose like putting the
wrench<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> nut<00:00:55.699> inside<00:00:56.699> not<00:00:57.210> spin<00:00:57.510> it

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
wrench on the nut inside not spin it

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.830 
wrench on the nut inside not spin it
that<00:00:58.680> accomplished<00:00:59.370> absolutely<00:00:59.690> nothing<00:01:00.690> it

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
that accomplished absolutely nothing it

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.450 
that accomplished absolutely nothing it
was<00:01:01.020> totally<00:01:01.590> locked<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.090> drilled<00:01:03.989> holes

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
was totally locked so I drilled holes

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.590 
was totally locked so I drilled holes
one<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.090> bottom<00:01:07.760> one<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.119> opposite

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
one here the bottom one here on opposite

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.260 
one here the bottom one here on opposite
side<00:01:09.810> here<00:01:10.049> at<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> bottom<00:01:10.619> also<00:01:11.000> then<00:01:12.000> I

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
side here at the bottom also then I

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.359 
side here at the bottom also then I
flushed<00:01:12.689> through<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> gum<00:01:14.040> out<00:01:14.159> and

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
flushed through with the gum out and

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.200 
flushed through with the gum out and
guess<00:01:14.790> what

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
guess what

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.740 
guess what
all<00:01:15.570> Akasa<00:01:16.259> grit<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.100> grime<00:01:17.430> came<00:01:17.790> out<00:01:18.000> both

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
all Akasa grit and grime came out both

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.179 
all Akasa grit and grime came out both
sides<00:01:19.020> then<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.130> flushed<00:01:20.430> through<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:23.630> wd-40

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
sides then I flushed through with wd-40

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.070 
sides then I flushed through with wd-40
wd-40<00:01:26.189> kind<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.060> loosened<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.479> up<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.720> note<00:01:27.900> that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
wd-40 kind of loosened it up a note that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.960 
wd-40 kind of loosened it up a note that
I<00:01:28.170> can<00:01:28.200> actually<00:01:28.500> break<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.250> shaft<00:01:29.579> loose

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
I can actually break this shaft loose

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.870 
I can actually break this shaft loose
with<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.720> winch<00:01:31.220> all<00:01:32.220> right<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.729> how<00:01:32.759> I

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
with the winch all right this is how I

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.179 
with the winch all right this is how I
get<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.360> break<00:01:33.600> free<00:01:33.930> took<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.920> little<00:01:35.040> bit

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
get it to break free took a little bit

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.289 
get it to break free took a little bit
of<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.990> wd-40<00:01:37.430> sprayed<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.579> down<00:01:38.610> inside<00:01:39.150> the

of a wd-40 sprayed it down inside the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.330 
of a wd-40 sprayed it down inside the
shaft<00:01:39.329> right<00:01:40.140> here

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.240

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
she said it goes in now before it wasn't

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:58.490

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
this is when I put the winch on it to

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:15.600 
this is when I put the winch on it to
help<00:02:06.700> break<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.150> free<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.010> kind<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.310> helped
