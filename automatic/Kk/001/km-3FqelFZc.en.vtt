00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.080 
I'm joining from expert boxing right now
I'm<00:00:02.010> going<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.190> talk<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.490> you<00:00:02.580> guys<00:00:02.730> about

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
I'm going to talk to you guys about

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.510 
I'm going to talk to you guys about
aggressive<00:00:03.600> defense<00:00:04.220> so<00:00:05.220> there's<00:00:05.460> a

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
aggressive defense so there's a

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.740 
aggressive defense so there's a
difference<00:00:05.819> between<00:00:05.910> aggressive<00:00:06.270> defense

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
difference between aggressive defense

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.230 
difference between aggressive defense
and<00:00:06.960> passive<00:00:07.440> defense

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
and passive defense

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.039 
and passive defense
passive<00:00:09.240> defense<00:00:09.599> means<00:00:10.490> defending<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:12.049> not

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
passive defense means defending and not

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.509 
passive defense means defending and not
counting<00:00:13.440> back<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:13.889> you're<00:00:14.009> just<00:00:14.190> defending

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
counting back so you're just defending

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.390 
counting back so you're just defending
for<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.940> point<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.269> being<00:00:15.450> defensive<00:00:16.160> okay

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
for the point of being defensive okay

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.970 
for the point of being defensive okay
and<00:00:17.640> perhaps<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.420> defense<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.050> actually

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
and perhaps the defense is actually

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.279 
and perhaps the defense is actually
useless<00:00:20.300> okay<00:00:21.300> if<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.630> want<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.900> defend<00:00:22.170> a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
useless okay if you want to defend a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.810 
useless okay if you want to defend a
punch<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.769> want<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.039> keep<00:00:23.189> running<00:00:23.369> you

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
punch and you want to keep running you

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.700 
punch and you want to keep running you
don't<00:00:23.970> want<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.150> counter<00:00:24.449> back<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:25.529> don't

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
don't want to counter back you don't

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
aggressive defense is really the only

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.029 
aggressive defense is really the only
kind<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.239> defense<00:00:48.629> there<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.989> because<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
kind of defense there is because the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.549 
kind of defense there is because the
point<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.399> defense<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.260> be

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
point of defense is so that you can be

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.560 
point of defense is so that you can be
more<00:00:52.800> offensive<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.579> point<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.910> defense<00:00:54.329> is

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
more offensive the point of defense is

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.110 
more offensive the point of defense is
to<00:00:55.260> keep<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.920> range<00:00:56.160> allowing<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.879> to
