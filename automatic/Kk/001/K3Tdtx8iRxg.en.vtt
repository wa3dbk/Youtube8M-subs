00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:12.079
 waiting to move into the field si monte sant'angelo the department of 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:16.009
 Earth sciences is located in the historic center occupying spaces that already 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:17.179
 about a century ago 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.140
 were destined to the ancestors site of geology paleontology and geography 

00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:22.679
 mineralogy 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:27.800
 to the department * 62 among teachers and researchers to which are added staff 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.529
 administrative technician scholarship holders PhD students 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.850
 leaf elected to entertainment with an intense educational and training activity 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.110
 which flows into both the graduate courses geological sciences science and nature 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.490
 environmental sciences if in several doctorate courses in technical training courses 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.490
 higher refresher courses 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.010
 the activity of spacious research all the branches of earth science and the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.580
 their practical applications 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.760
 without forgetting the fundamental field study phase a walk to 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.010
 the workers will give us the opportunity to review the main lines of research 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.190
 the geology research groups of the sedimentary carbonate geology rocks 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.540
 structural deal with both dbs la rasiglia did make geography of 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.680
 Apennine rocky complexes of tectonic reconstructions that analyze 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.990
 the deformations so much on the scale microscopic scale 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.210
 there are many researchers who work on the ground in laboratories 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.330
 they shape the leaves of the new national geological map 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.890
 this is part of one of the largest scientific projects launched by me 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.210
 our country the kate program 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.980
 here also the Campania region is making a strong contribution to coordination and 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.590
 direction 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.940
 a working group is dedicated to the geology of Italian urban areas 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.310
 elaborating three-dimensional models of the subsoil that are of enormous importance 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.310
 for urban planning choices 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.170
 several researches in progress concern the dynamics of coastal areas 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.169
 characterization of protected coastal areas and defense of beaches 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.429
 a vs pertains to a European project for cost benefit analysis of the various 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.429
 types of defense of the equation today 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.849
 in the field of applied geology, criteria are also sought for 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.249
 the identification 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:26.349
 long open rock with pyroclastic coverage in the areas with the maximum 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.629
 susceptibility of origin are family lava flow in order to plan 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.989
 stabilization interventions only there where necessary 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.439
 mobile geophysical laboratory equipment for archeology allow 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:43.539
 the definition 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:47.969
 with non-invasive instructor techniques if you were of archaeological interest 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.829
 not that the analysis of the degradation conditions of architectural structures of 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.829
 artifacts of artistic interest 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.479
 A search for the electro seismic gold bar uses resistivity measurements 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:05.049
 and speed of waves on rock samples in different conditions of 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:05.919
 humidity 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:09.489
 this in order to develop geophysical techniques for porosity analysis 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.489
 of the water content of subsoil layers 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.619
 the scanning electron microscope capable of magnifying objects up to 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:28.560
 100,000 times to give graphs and maps of their chemical composition 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.769
 use a lot of palaeontological petrography research 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.799
 among the many applications to artificial mother the one for the research of 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.799
 asbestos fibers 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.939
 research conducted by geochemical mineralogy petrology workers 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:44.849
 concern 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.259
 the study of rocks natural phenomena 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:49.339
 monitoring of active volcanoes 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:51.719
 the genesis of mineral deposits 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.579
 the use of giolitti in agronomy medicine of the ceramic industry 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.689
 soil water pollution 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.689
 the degradation of monuments art works 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.840
 paleontology laboratories offer essential support for all of them 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:14.039
 departmental researches that require evaluations of cross-referencing 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:17.469
 or the reconstruction of the failed paleogeography environments 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.159
 function of archeology is increasing 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:29.159
 in the laboratory of making magnetism the signal recorded in old people read it 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.469
 used to construct a curve of the secular variations in the magnetic field 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:33.830
 terrestrial 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.309
 furthermore manofa rocks are dated 

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:40.639
 the flow direction of the pyroclastic flows we studied was determined 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.639
 sedimentary rock formations 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.500
 the pimples geomorphology collaborates defining seismic and landslide risks 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.570
 present in Campania identifying the main active faults by extinguishing 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.570
 slope promotion. over pyroclastic 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.949
 collaborating with archaeological superintendency, he also works to rebuild 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.189
 ancient landscapes and geological events occurred in historical times 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:18.899
 at the end of this rapid excursus we can observe that already today a lot 

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:21.969
 of the research carried out by the department responds to concrete needs 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:24.969
 industry the authority for public bodies 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.770
 certainly there are still very ample opportunities for profitable growth 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:30.990
 purpose collaborations
