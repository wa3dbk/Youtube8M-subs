 it is here in him 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.670
 Spain nowadays we have 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.380
 26 wild animals are waiting for the shipment also of the four 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.760
 lima turtles 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.780
 that we are going to reach 30 animals but we are working on the release of 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.369
 four how these animals get to more 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.469
 the majority in are handed over by the spa technical administration a 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.330
 puerto maldonado decade 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.490
 which are the ones who do the operations of confiscation of wild animals and 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.580
 others are for people who 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.680
 - They say they found them in the bush they are usually wanted 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.829
 let's say it's that the levels that you have here are all here up 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.840
 that they can recover and possible risks said 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.840
 well, let's not all say 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.980
 nor 50% because I started to see what happens and animals 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.440
 that come imprint or if you want to go domestic host of home and that is very 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.940
 difficult to free them 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.720
 Another animal type that due to its physical condition does not 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.490
 allows as the case botan May that has the room fractured a deer that 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.619
 They make it difficult because they can marry him 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:20.810
 Nawal eye winning is also complicated because they walk in groups of 90 60 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.859
 enter it in 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.439
 the group is also complicated then 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.549
 would also stay then let's say we could work with 40% 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.849
 to lead and the others would be part of environmental education 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:48.459
 pepe esteban cowen made an advantage increased June 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.170

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.329
 the party has not changed 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.139
 and a little bit so that the animals do not get bored of trade carlos mencos 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.229
 a really sweet halloween movie really bad 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:37.739
 is that the story is told that already prevented him from playing before the committee that 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:38.380

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.969
 misses 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:04.139

 heavy element hundred the tangible manifestation for amanda or past without 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:10.959

 that have centered kate mccann the left photo of the monkey choros 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:22.409

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.409
 for years 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.740
 they have a little bit to be that these areas I think is very good volunteering north 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.690
 is the purpose of extracting volunteering there we have the rooms 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.259
 the bathrooms for the boys 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.369

 who love coming to work to interact with them 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.639
 the valence stretch to satiety 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.349
 the new environments 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:10.089
 we make doors we build this little houses everything that is needed feed them 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:14.789
 disinfect and clean their environments and between them they were fascinated and dad 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.490
 for doing that work and with that help us to sustain the 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.289
 this is quite complicated 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.360
 the mayor 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.839
 immediately 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:29.569
 they will be less than half 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.569
 they also demand that others are also living 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.719
 gerardo hernandez 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.689

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:40.629
 after all those little animals stupor and because I know it's hard 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:45.729
 but in thing of a world that is a point between them and the fortress the old 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:52.029
 in receiving it in February the colonel aviator the old man who is 14 years old 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:54.919

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:22.959
 these days of middle class orange inclusive not only as volunteers 

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:27.919

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:29.319
 activist that glory 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:33.449
 Dende some boxes that played with photos of animals of planet 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:37.409
 how much it would cost them should come and take pictures be more urgent 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.309
 and to have 

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:44.669
 photos of animals from their own country and that can support us with 10 cents and 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:49.379
 a window box of a child was played nor are we diapers we use diapers to 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:50.310

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.490
 That bad milk from the middletons because it's the milk that we need 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.990
 In the case of ushcc laboratories we use electroral electrolytes at 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.430
 tekis farma how much the lab looks at how many companies could be put 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.810

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.340
 topic
