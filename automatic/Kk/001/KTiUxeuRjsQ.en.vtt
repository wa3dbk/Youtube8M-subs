a really really fine mesh strainer that

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.700 
a really really fine mesh strainer that
the<00:02:21.270> stuff<00:02:21.540> doesn't<00:02:21.750> go<00:02:21.990> through<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.620> then

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
the stuff doesn't go through and then

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.230 
the stuff doesn't go through and then
the<00:02:22.830> end<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.160> rinse<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.610> off<00:02:23.700> with<00:02:23.850> them<00:02:23.970> like

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
the end just rinse it off with them like

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.600 
the end just rinse it off with them like
why<00:02:24.450> didn't<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:24.750> use<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.990> all<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.200> time

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
why didn't you use that all the time

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.590 
why didn't you use that all the time
crazy<00:02:26.610> person

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
crazy person

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.830 
crazy person
so<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.680> guess<00:02:29.640> I'm<00:02:29.760> gonna<00:02:29.850> B's<00:02:30.120> another<00:02:30.480> bowl<00:02:30.720> to

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
so I guess I'm gonna B's another bowl to

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.370 
so I guess I'm gonna B's another bowl to
wash<00:02:30.990> it<00:02:31.230> they<00:02:31.410> also<00:02:31.590> suggested<00:02:32.930> I'm<00:02:33.930> putting

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
wash it they also suggested I'm putting

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.220

a<00:02:34.710> paper<00:02:35.580> towel<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.390> strainer<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.960> might

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
a paper towel in the strainer so I might

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.440 
a paper towel in the strainer so I might
try<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.440> too<00:02:37.830> but<00:02:38.580> somebody<00:02:39.060> else<00:02:39.240> said<00:02:39.420> that

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
try that too but somebody else said that

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.150

was a big mess and it was really hard to

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.760 
was a big mess and it was really hard to
like<00:02:41.400> get<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.760> all<00:02:41.880> out<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.440> whatever<00:02:43.440> blah
