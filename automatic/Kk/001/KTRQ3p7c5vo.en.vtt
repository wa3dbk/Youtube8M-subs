00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.850
 well here in madrid in this case is the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.610

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.320
 Fashion of young designers and us 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.430
 14 years ago when we started then in 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.410
 the Valencian community we stayed 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.730
 second we do not win and we do not come to this 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.859
 final to madrid because always the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.239
 Finals are made in Madrid from ann 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.129
 Then they invited us to do the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.150
 opening is also the prize 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.670
 national 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.650
 this business in 2014 and we make a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.810
 projection let's say a little bit of how 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.550
 started for young people who 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.810
 feel even if they do not earn a second 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.910
 prize a third party can get very far 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.130
 like us until today months before 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.740
 you are already opening stores in madrid if 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.350
 We opened the store last Thursday 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.270
 we inaugurate in Claudio Coello the number 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.640
 76 we open in the store in a 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.190
 space that is called Havana and we have 70 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.040
 square meters then of what is clothes 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.990
 measured and made you will have 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.300
 So much experience already in several parades 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.190
 for these young people that for many was 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.410
 the first time they are seeing their 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.930
 designs on a catwalk that is some 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.000
 advice for those nerves or nerves 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.520
 that they have to have for them is a 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.250
 showcase in madrid come rethinking 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.530
 a community comes against the illusion 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.770
 of the world with the collections are very 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.030
 very specialized artistic each 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.430
 It is true that it is not the most wearable but 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.619
 this is a contest and it's catwalk 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.210
 and here the big ones are born and I think that 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.850
 it's good that you have to give them the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.230
 advice to keep going that 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.360
 I insist that they win or not win they can 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.990
 get very far if you always read 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.880
 and when they have the 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.100
 on earth because nowadays there are good 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.410
 of everything and designed very stars that 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.090
 I say they are young and they think that 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.400
 are I get this equipment that little 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.020
 wants is that the contests are the best 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.710
 platform to make yourself known or there 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.970
 other means to watch contests like you 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.280
 I said we have introduced ourselves 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.110
 well then in valencia believe in 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.240
 valencia at the Valencian community level 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.370
 we have presented both the mode 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.480
 child fashion sweet fashion lady fashion 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.430
 gentleman 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.380
 we won that you give you rambo link 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.300
 because you have a support then you go 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.890
 also representing where you go 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.860
 then to the valencian community valencia 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.450
 then the catwalks of us by 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.060
 example the other day we made a parade 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.550
 of older people on Tuesday in Castellón and 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.460
 with 200 guests and he left 15 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.960
 all models over 65 and I 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.050
 mean you have to be on all sides 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.970
 and I think any contest is good 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.740
 everything adds up and although you do not always win 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.810
 you have in the curriculum the 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.060
 participated there is a lot of industry in the 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.380
 fashion and you have to support it more for your 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.090
 part that we're going to see on the catwalk 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.270
 Well, our part because we had 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.910
 asked that as there are 28 models 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.280
 28 looks to take a collection that 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.600
 we could do here all new then 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.060
 we could do it but to see 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.040
 Then we started a little bit of everything 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.720
 14 years old we always have two 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.550

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.550
