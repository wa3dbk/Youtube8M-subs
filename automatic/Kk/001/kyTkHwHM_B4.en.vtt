00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.490
 Hello my friends and welcome to the show 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.200
 I am Leonardo Bernzino and today we will be painting a fairy 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.170
 For the main shape, start with an unlocked circle 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.500
 We paint hair floating in water, hands, body and sin 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.810
 Now we define the main shape of the fish, we begin 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.000
 With fins 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.200
 The largest at the top and bottom 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.600
 And then the face 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.839
 When we get to the main lines, we start over and give it back 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.100
 Better shape 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.220
 Add texture lines, with pen strokes (quick pen strokes) 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.500
 It is important not to look harsh, I mean solid 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.220
 Decode through small circles to make a balanced sense 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.860
 This is for the head and the body, but the fins 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.000
 It will not be balanced, but it will be undulating 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.000
 As you notice i draw by mechanical pen (means pen type) 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.159
 With blue led (also type), this helps give a watery atmosphere 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.400
 And at sea 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.000
 Or as I wish (laughs) 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.500
 Nice ! 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.000
 Go back and work on it to make it better 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.100
 And draw other small fins, the end flap (meaning lines drawing) 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100
 I do not want to look like a rigid graphic (I want it full of motion) 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.300
 We plan the weight of the painting, and give some shadow to the body 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.280
 We do not want it to look like a rigid feature, so no 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.170
 The fins darken a lot 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.260
 If the fins are not very clear and appear to be chapped, then they will be given 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.000
 A sense of movement 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.230
 We draw an extended strand, through which freedom is made 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.020
 With a fish, this is a fairy 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.400
 The kind of cowboy is the Western shepherd in America 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.310
 Wonderful ! 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.000
 This is fun! 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.000
 Now we do some shading for hair and neck 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 And the body 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.420
 We form basics by shading and giving light 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.400
 It's like the magic of haha 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.720
 The tools you used are in detail 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.400
 In the video above 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.000
 From its waist down it will have a shape 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.760
 We draw guilt and shadow, this will make it look 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.200
 Closer down 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.560
 With a gum eraser or an ordinary eraser 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.000
 Draw some circles, which will be the beginning of a series of bubbles 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.720
 If I had not thought about it beforehand to make it empty 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.220
 From the beginning 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.440
