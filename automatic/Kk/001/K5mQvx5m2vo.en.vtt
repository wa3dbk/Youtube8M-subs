00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.369
 here my friends for the same hobby 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.439

 reading makeup tips have been me 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.410

 feminine actually make-up today 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.649

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.809
 that the brown black eye is all 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.750

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.590

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.140
 captivates me most is the makeup 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.149
 transformation with makeup 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.359
 to transform only one woman into several 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.359
 women 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.590
 and now I'll show you step by step 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.380
 For you of a makeup need the

 night and gets super cool and production of 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.800
 fur 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.130
 to start I'll apply this pre 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:29.250
 make-up with the entire movable eyelid 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:32.130
 They spread kisses too now I'm going 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.100
 pick up this color natura collective 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.920
 clearer will value enough soon 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.020
 below my eyebrow apply one 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.820
 here in the inner corner to 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.890
 enlighten people to create a speck of 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.780
 lusa 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.860
 the future compact to form the basis of 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.670
 my shadow 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.810
 I'm going to smoke the shade I applied 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.810

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.069
 choose another hand that a little bit 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.390
 I 'm going to deposit here in the 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.260
 outside corner 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.260

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.600
 evocation on top with the same movement 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.930
 to soften a little to see if the 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.580
 tip of my finger that I will apply 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.850
