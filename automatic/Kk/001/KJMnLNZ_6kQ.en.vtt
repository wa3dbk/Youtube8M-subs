so what I do is I yeah I check where his
movable<00:00:08.700> soft<00:00:09.240> tissue<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.900> it's<00:00:10.230> all<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.679> way

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
movable soft tissue is it's all the way

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.310 
movable soft tissue is it's all the way
up<00:00:10.800> here<00:00:10.980> all<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.240> way<00:00:12.330> up<00:00:12.450> here<00:00:14.059> no<00:00:15.109> you<00:00:16.109> can

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
up here all the way up here no you can

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.179 
up here all the way up here no you can
visualize<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.190> by<00:00:17.340> pulling<00:00:17.789> his<00:00:17.910> lip<00:00:18.270> up<00:00:19.199> so

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
visualize it by pulling his lip up so

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.010 
visualize it by pulling his lip up so
we're<00:00:20.279> talking<00:00:20.430> like<00:00:20.760> worthy<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.630> junction

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
we're talking like worthy the junction

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.679 
we're talking like worthy the junction
of<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.140> attached<00:00:22.560> yes<00:00:23.660> movable<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.980> and

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
of the attached yes movable is and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.570 
of the attached yes movable is and
originally<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:27.840> was<00:00:28.140> way<00:00:28.470> extended<00:00:28.920> that's

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
originally just was way extended that's

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.179 
originally just was way extended that's
why<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.910> denture<00:00:30.599> was<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:31.019> sitting<00:00:31.560> at<00:00:31.710> in

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
why the denture was not sitting at in

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.130 
why the denture was not sitting at in
his<00:00:32.630> mouth<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.430> we<00:00:35.430> need<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.790> trim<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.510> down<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
his mouth so we need to trim it down and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.280 
his mouth so we need to trim it down and
I<00:00:37.649> would<00:00:38.100> like<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.730> use<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.239> magic<00:00:39.420> marker<00:00:40.079> or

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
I would like to use the magic marker or

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.959 
I would like to use the magic marker or
a<00:00:40.350> permanent<00:00:40.829> marker<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.160> draw<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.670> line

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
a permanent marker to draw a line

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.580 
a permanent marker to draw a line
approximate<00:00:42.960> area<00:00:43.940> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.480> acrylic<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.559> I

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
approximate area of the acrylic that I

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.209 
approximate area of the acrylic that I
need<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.480> remove<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.140> visualize<00:00:49.500> how

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
need to remove so if you visualize how

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.700 
need to remove so if you visualize how
much<00:00:50.430> did<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.730> need<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.940> remove<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.690> then<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.500> go

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
much did I need to remove and then I go

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
much did I need to remove and then I go
ahead<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:52.980> remove<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.270> tried<00:00:54.539> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
ahead and remove it and then we tried it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.049 
ahead and remove it and then we tried it
again<00:00:55.010> drawing<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.190> line<00:00:56.370> gives<00:00:56.789> me<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
again drawing a line gives me a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.360 
again drawing a line gives me a
reference<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:58.559> exactly<00:00:59.010> how<00:00:59.340> much

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
reference so I know exactly how much

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.000 
reference so I know exactly how much
that<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.879> need<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.239> move<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.140> use<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
that I need to move do you use a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.479 
that I need to move do you use a
pressure<00:01:02.280> anything<00:01:02.699> payroll<00:01:03.180> -<00:01:03.390> or<00:01:04.489> waxing

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
pressure anything payroll - or waxing

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.399 
pressure anything payroll - or waxing
used<00:01:05.700> or<00:01:06.240> disclosing<00:01:07.110> wax<00:01:08.479> as<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.140> see

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
used or disclosing wax as you can see

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.830 
used or disclosing wax as you can see
right<00:01:10.799> there<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.280> go<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.580> got<00:01:11.610> some<00:01:11.880> at<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
right there we go we got some at that a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840 
right there we go we got some at that a
lot<00:01:13.049> around<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.619> flange<00:01:14.010> area<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.729> might

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
lot around the flange area you might

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.060 
lot around the flange area you might
just<00:01:14.970> put<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:16.290> did<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.590> top<00:01:16.860> all

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
just put it on it we did the top all

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.840 
just put it on it we did the top all
right<00:01:17.630> just<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.610> show

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.310 

all<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.119> down<00:01:24.360> that

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
all of this down that

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.670 
all of this down that
I<00:01:25.950> would<00:01:26.580> take<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.210> down<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.720> level<00:01:27.960> 1<00:01:28.260> and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
I would take it down to this level 1 and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.760 
I would take it down to this level 1 and
then<00:01:28.890> thin<00:01:29.160> it<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:29.430> making<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.000> out<00:01:30.330> to

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
then thin it out making it out to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.750 
then thin it out making it out to
there's<00:01:31.770> three<00:01:31.980> billing<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.550> or

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
there's three billing in this or

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.250 
there's three billing in this or
thickness<00:01:32.970> right<00:01:33.600> now<00:01:33.810> there<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.050> just<00:01:34.140> do

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
thickness right now there you just do

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.820 
thickness right now there you just do
the<00:01:34.400> one-eyed<00:01:35.400> milliner's<00:01:35.880> right<00:01:36.120> there<00:01:36.830> so

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
the one-eyed milliner's right there so

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.740 
the one-eyed milliner's right there so
we<00:01:37.920> do<00:01:39.320> so<00:01:40.320> we've<00:01:40.440> been<00:01:40.530> placed<00:01:40.800> in<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
we do so we've been placed in the

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.570 
we do so we've been placed in the
disclosing<00:01:42.750> wax<00:01:42.990> roll<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.470> up<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.890> then<00:01:44.340> just

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
disclosing wax roll it up and then just

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.350 
disclosing wax roll it up and then just
place<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:44.940> in<00:01:45.750> trollee<00:01:46.260> and<00:01:46.860> wherever<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.670> or

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
place it in trollee and wherever it's or

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.040 
place it in trollee and wherever it's or
extended<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.500> will<00:01:49.680> see<00:01:50.510> pressure<00:01:51.510> like<00:01:51.810> that

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
extended you will see pressure like that

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.620 
extended you will see pressure like that
okay<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.740> that's<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:53.790> area<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.479> need

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
okay and that's the area that you need

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.560 
okay and that's the area that you need
to<00:01:54.810> reduce<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.470> if<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.280> overextending<00:01:57.090> okay

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
to reduce it if it's overextending okay

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.650 
to reduce it if it's overextending okay
so<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> couple<00:01:58.170> techniques<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.890> check<00:01:59.160> for

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
so a couple techniques to check for

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.850 
so a couple techniques to check for
client<00:02:00.660> extension<00:02:01.170> which<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.410> very<00:02:01.590> essential

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
client extension which is very essential

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.640 
client extension which is very essential
and<00:02:02.460> that's<00:02:03.450> one<00:02:03.690> of<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.930> first<00:02:04.229> things<00:02:04.530> that

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
and that's one of the first things that

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.080 
and that's one of the first things that
you<00:02:04.920> need<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.280> look<00:02:06.090> at<00:02:06.390> when<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:08.030> try<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
you need to look at when you try the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.949 
you need to look at when you try the
insertion<00:02:09.959> delivery<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.160> ventures<00:02:11.959> so

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
insertion delivery of the ventures so

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.750 
insertion delivery of the ventures so
that<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.500> need<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.800> make<00:02:13.950> sure<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.400> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
that you need to make sure that the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.210 
that you need to make sure that the
French<00:02:15.330> are<00:02:15.540> not<00:02:15.780> overextended<00:02:16.650> or<00:02:16.860> under

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
French are not overextended or under
