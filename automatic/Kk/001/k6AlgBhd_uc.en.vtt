times<00:00:26.930> then<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.050> pass<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.500> tag<00:00:28.800> back<00:00:29.490> through

times then we pass the tag back through
the<00:00:29.880> first<00:00:30.150> loop<00:00:31.080> which<00:00:31.380> we've<00:00:31.560> made<00:00:32.809> now<00:00:33.809> I

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the first loop which we've made now I

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.889 
the first loop which we've made now I
could<00:00:34.260> pull<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.469> knot<00:00:34.800> tight<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.750> would

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
could pull that knot tight and it would

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.950 
could pull that knot tight and it would
be<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:38.210> half-blood<00:00:39.210> not<00:00:39.450> an<00:00:39.600> unlocked

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
be a half-blood not an unlocked

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.780 
be a half-blood not an unlocked
half-blood<00:00:40.530> that's<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> lot<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.370> anglers

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
half-blood that's what a lot of anglers

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.830 
half-blood that's what a lot of anglers
use<00:00:42.980> unfortunately<00:00:46.610> what<00:00:47.610> happens<00:00:48.030> if<00:00:48.329> you're

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
use unfortunately what happens if you're

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.350 
use unfortunately what happens if you're
using<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.410> new<00:00:49.770> fishing<00:00:50.039> line<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:51.120> is

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
using a new fishing line like this is

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.160 
using a new fishing line like this is
and<00:00:51.920> new<00:00:52.920> hooks<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:54.030> knot<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.480> slip<00:00:54.750> undone

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and new hooks that knot can slip undone

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.080 
and new hooks that knot can slip undone
I'm<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.340> exert<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.699> little<00:00:56.879> bit<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I'm just going to exert a little bit of

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.279 
I'm just going to exert a little bit of
pressure<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.449> there<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.840> we'll<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.020> see

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
pressure on there and we'll just see

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.639 
pressure on there and we'll just see
what<00:00:58.320> happens<00:00:59.210> it's<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.420> moving<00:01:00.840> yet<00:01:01.020> oh<00:01:01.230> yes

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
what happens it's not moving yet oh yes

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.770 
what happens it's not moving yet oh yes
there<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.010> goes

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
there it goes

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.890 
there it goes
yes<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:05.330> if<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.689> angler<00:01:07.080> has<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.260> trophy<00:01:07.830> fish

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
yes and if this angler has a trophy fish

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.250 
yes and if this angler has a trophy fish
all<00:01:09.900> you'd<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.140> left<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.670> is<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:12.260> little

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
all you'd be left with is that little

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.010 
all you'd be left with is that little
squiggly<00:01:13.799> bit<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> end<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:15.540> try<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> few

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
squiggly bit on the end and I try a few

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.429 
squiggly bit on the end and I try a few
fish<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.229> show<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.960> so<00:01:18.960> what<00:01:19.140> we're<00:01:19.320> going

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
fish to show for it so what we're going

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.609 
fish to show for it so what we're going
to<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.770> we're<00:01:20.460> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.880> tie<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.170> locked

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
to do we're going to tie a locked

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.530 
to do we're going to tie a locked
half-blood<00:01:23.490> which<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> prevent

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
half-blood which is going to prevent

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.310 
half-blood which is going to prevent
that<00:01:24.689> happening<00:01:25.970> once<00:01:26.970> again<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:28.020> thread<00:01:28.290> the

that happening once again we thread the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.710 
that happening once again we thread the
eye<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> hook<00:01:31.340> wrap<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.400> tag<00:01:32.759> around<00:01:33.570> the

main line do that four times we pass the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.170 
main line do that four times we pass the

tag back up through the first wrap we

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.050 
tag back up through the first wrap we

made catch that between thumb and middle

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.859 
made catch that between thumb and middle
finger<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> left<00:01:45.630> hand<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:47.360> we<00:01:48.360> begin<00:01:48.689> to

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
finger of the left hand and we begin to

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.420 
finger of the left hand and we begin to
close<00:01:49.079> up<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.439> knot<00:01:49.590> until<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.009> transfer

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
close up the knot until the transfer

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.539 
close up the knot until the transfer
sloop<00:01:51.000> appears<00:01:51.869> clearly<00:01:52.860> at<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> top<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.460> the

sloop appears clearly at the top of the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.990 
sloop appears clearly at the top of the
knot<00:01:53.729> then<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:55.350> take<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> tag<00:01:56.009> push<00:01:56.850> it

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
knot then we take the tag push it

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.929 
knot then we take the tag push it
through<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.360> loop<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:58.310> lock<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.490> knot<00:01:59.640> what

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
through the loop to lock the knot what

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.179 
through the loop to lock the knot what
it<00:02:00.030> does<00:02:00.270> actually<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.810> add<00:02:01.049> another<00:02:01.290> friction

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
it does actually is add another friction

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.670 
it does actually is add another friction
component<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.420> knot<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.380> causes

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
component to the knot and that causes

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.310 
component to the knot and that causes
our<00:02:04.979> not<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.280> lock<00:02:05.750> just<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.930> little<00:02:07.140> bit<00:02:07.229> of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
pressure on the tag to take that slack

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.890 
pressure on the tag to take that slack
out<00:02:10.819> pull<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:11.940> up<00:02:12.030> tight<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.750> there's

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
out pull it up tight and there's

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.670 
out pull it up tight and there's
absolutely

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
