 I have already turned out shine 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.390

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.930

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.830
 I decided how to take it beige to me 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.939
 colors will be like a puzzle 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.070
 this still thomas virtual memo 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.560
 microwave of course we need 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.079
 knife cotton buds many are no longer 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.479
 necessarily but basically let's now 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.260
 I will show you how to do it I will give you 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.650
 the kitchen we take our mask 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.380
 we take very carefully and sat on it 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.210
 sits let's better miss 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.210
 parents answer like this 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.300
 i am now 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.490
 science 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:46.860
 Idritsa pick out 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:51.060
 now show you about the taste you lack 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:55.769
 can not develop for the length I take i 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.190
 now swim now i will put here 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.190
 So 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.060
 therefore 3 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:13.010
 For now, then it will work for Moscow 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:13.010
 minute to minute eyes and put on a skirt 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:23.300
 now she did not skate you and I will show you 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.300
 the result here is all we had it all 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:37.040
 get me neatly here 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:40.590
 Normal Fondant Pieces Five Lipstick 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.070
 to get a hefty memo 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.810
 come here and fudge itself and not now 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.280
 light falls here it is transparent wait 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.690
 so that the fudge dried up 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.340
 and if you do in such things then you 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.740
 should put in two hours 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:04.140
 but I prefer a refrigerator so she 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:10.140
 hardens it quickly in this already 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:13.130
 or the lid is closed turns out very 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.600
 even cool fudge such caps 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.620
 a bun you can decorate with something 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.140
 I will not do it at your discretion 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.790
 fear oh no she is somewhere 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:27.950
 strongly now on saint that me on 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:31.800
 lamp lamp is on the holy axis 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:34.440
 10 here you will not be minutes 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.800
 fifteen twenty twenty two hours just 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.140
 so I do not think so convenient for everyone 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:45.090
 faster well, who is not very fast possible 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.540
 here can do sweets for two hours 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.170
 which advice in the fridge for leasing in 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.840
 the fridge, too, what then murzik 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.150
 better in the fridge I left in 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.450
 a refrigerator and who needs a quick 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.000
 Fudge you can just do here 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.670
 and replacing 20 you get fudge she 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.490
 then it will harden and be more white 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.610
 when I'll cover you, I'll show 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:18.629
 I got it turned out fudge 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:21.210
 it flows out here and there it is ok 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:27.659
 Smell delicious very very great 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:34.550
 right here is frozen that his squaw and such 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:39.360
 arrange them useful need very little 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.650
 if you see he took and she doesn't care 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.870
 gone sits on lips 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.979
 she's just great fudge me 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:50.069

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:52.680
 I advise you well, it's all around until the swami 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.930
