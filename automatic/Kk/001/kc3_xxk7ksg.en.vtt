00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
that he's really supposed to be a little

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.060 
that he's really supposed to be a little
more<00:00:43.410> lighted<00:00:44.129> up<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:45.559> that<00:00:46.559> light<00:00:46.829> is

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
more lighted up and that light is

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.720 
more lighted up and that light is
actually<00:00:49.039> let's<00:00:50.039> count<00:00:50.280> what<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.489> looks<00:00:50.610> like

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
actually let's count what it looks like

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.439 
actually let's count what it looks like
in<00:00:50.910> low<00:00:51.120> light<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.610> it's<00:00:54.000> kind<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.270> hard<00:00:54.420> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
in low light so it's kind of hard to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.709 
in low light so it's kind of hard to
tell<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.160> it<00:00:56.160> looks<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.610> lot<00:00:57.030> darker<00:00:57.329> than

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
tell but it it looks a lot darker than

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.990 
tell but it it looks a lot darker than
it<00:00:57.750> does<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.199> video<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.129> pointing

it does on the video so just pointing

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.680 
it does on the video so just pointing
that<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.649> it's<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:01.980> really<00:01:02.160> dark

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
little bit scratched up and my phone

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.740 
little bit scratched up and my phone
exactly<00:01:53.369> why<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.670> think<00:01:53.820> these<00:01:54.149> are<00:01:54.210> might<00:01:54.600> be

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
exactly why I think these are might be

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.050 
exactly why I think these are might be
fakes<00:01:55.040> it's<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.189> not<00:01:56.340> really<00:01:56.640> tightly

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
fakes it's just not really tightly

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.709 
fakes it's just not really tightly
sealed<00:01:57.390> because<00:01:57.930> everything<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.590> fell<00:01:58.829> out

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
sealed because everything just fell out

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.569 
sealed because everything just fell out
what<00:02:00.719> another<00:02:00.930> thing<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.290> thought<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
what another thing I thought is the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.940 
what another thing I thought is the
velcro<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.390> keeps<00:02:03.719> coming<00:02:04.020> off<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.770> just

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
velcro on it keeps coming off is it just

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.830 
velcro on it keeps coming off is it just
like<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.280> glued<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.790> there<00:02:05.820> that's<00:02:06.630> not

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
like it's glued in there that's not

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.029 
like it's glued in there that's not

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
imitated and cheap so maybe it will

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.220 
imitated and cheap so maybe it will
maybe<00:04:45.520> fake<00:04:45.820> get<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.270> beats<00:04:46.540> in<00:04:47.020> their

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
stayer pair of studios that came out

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.550 
stayer pair of studios that came out

after the monster and dr. Dre breakup so

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.240 
after the monster and dr. Dre breakup so

no and also you can see that there's

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.450 
no and also you can see that there's
actually<00:06:09.700> the<00:06:09.850> serial<00:06:10.240> number<00:06:11.280> it's<00:06:12.280> been

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
actually the serial number it's been

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.000 
actually the serial number it's been
edged<00:06:12.640> in<00:06:12.850> there<00:06:13.140> and<00:06:14.140> you<00:06:14.440> know<00:06:14.560> off<00:06:14.680> sound

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
edged in there and you know off sound

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.830 
edged in there and you know off sound
call<00:06:15.280> it<00:06:15.520> just<00:06:15.700> doesn't<00:06:16.030> have<00:06:16.480> quite<00:06:16.750> the

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
call it just doesn't have quite the

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.690 
call it just doesn't have quite the
sound<00:06:17.230> quality<00:06:17.590> that<00:06:17.620> I<00:06:17.800> was<00:06:17.980> expecting<00:06:18.520> I

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
sound quality that I was expecting I

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.220 
sound quality that I was expecting I
thought<00:06:19.000> it'd<00:06:19.120> sound<00:06:19.300> better<00:06:19.540> if<00:06:19.840> these<00:06:20.050> are

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.230 
thought it'd sound better if these are

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.290 
thought it'd sound better if these are
real<00:06:20.410> and<00:06:20.620> they're<00:06:21.310> not<00:06:21.490> really<00:06:21.940> too

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
real and they're not really too

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.940 
real and they're not really too
comfortable<00:06:22.930> i<00:06:23.140> warmth<00:06:23.740> maybe

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
comfortable i warmth maybe

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.610 
comfortable i warmth maybe
in<00:06:25.340> an<00:06:25.460> hour<00:06:25.610> and<00:06:25.970> my<00:06:26.030> ears<00:06:26.420> were<00:06:26.720> pretty<00:06:27.260> sore

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
in an hour and my ears were pretty sore

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.460 
in an hour and my ears were pretty sore
I<00:06:27.920> don't<00:06:28.880> know<00:06:28.970> if<00:06:29.030> that's<00:06:29.180> just<00:06:29.270> the<00:06:29.480> make<00:06:29.720> if

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
I don't know if that's just the make if

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.290 
I don't know if that's just the make if
just<00:06:30.740> because<00:06:31.010> they're<00:06:31.160> fake<00:06:31.460> but<00:06:31.970> they

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
just because they're fake but they

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.850 
just because they're fake but they
really<00:06:32.570> just<00:06:32.810> aren't<00:06:33.080> that<00:06:33.200> comfortable<00:06:33.500> and

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
really just aren't that comfortable and

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.070 
really just aren't that comfortable and
don't<00:06:33.950> sound<00:06:34.280> quite<00:06:34.370> as<00:06:34.490> good<00:06:34.850> as<00:06:35.180> the<00:06:35.570> real

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080
