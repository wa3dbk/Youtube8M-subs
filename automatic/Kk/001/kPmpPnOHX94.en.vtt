00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 hi guys i'm still and a25 first 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.559
 today I will show another trick of 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.349
 magic that this time with the cards again 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.139
 but that is not so much with the cards there is e 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.720
 concerns a pack of cards that this 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.810
 here I take it out of its custody 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.599
 see this here is his case 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:30.990
 you have empty completely empty made by 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.669
 I didn't do it myself and so did you 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.260
 take your deck of cards 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:40.649
 ok and see how and the beam in the deck 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.989
 made just right perfect but that 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.860
 if you still take the deck of cards 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:53.340
 ok it's turned upside down again now 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:55.829
 you still have to take and insert in the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.050
 boulder in the container so in this 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.170
 Serit way and well so well inserted into 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.170
 we 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:16.590
 what changes because now it is completely 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:18.659
 the deck of cards is gone 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.930
 completely disappeared rate is 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:27.909
 completely empty the box you see 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:34.630
 empty void completely 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:36.789
 it is completely empty as it is 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.979
 don't be scared enough simple 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.929
 you basically have to do nothing then 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.530
 how do you do this trick which 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:50.319
 then first you need a bunch of 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:53.020
 cards so those who rigged because 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.179
 so rich this deck of cards instead 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.700
 our own card of ours 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:01.479
 environment open it so cut the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:06.459
 part below and the part here not 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:11.110
 see this because this serves because 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:12.220
 you can show the sides here but 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.640
 currently be careful not to 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.549
 see back below 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.680
 the box and I did them in the middle 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:24.090
 you can also do it once 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.940
 was some felt-tip pens with cardboard 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.640
 so at the beginning the team at the beginning 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.870
 when I refer it to heaven so no 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.290
 I insert it you have it in this way 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.660
 so you see here you see here without doing 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.859
 his suspected paolo, take up again 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:49.060
 this one on the other side practically 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:51.910
 and very gently the bouquet of 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.500
 cards then that is rigged go 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.989
 insert into the container deck 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.209
 the box of cock and net that has disappeared 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.599
 a reality and what this is what one does 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.239
 see when really inserted from behind 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.630
 this is what we see then and then 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.180
 show what to examine as you do 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.489
 check that it is empty to be able to do so 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.069
 then you can watch to make check a 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.069
 who do you want that is completely empty 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.410
 but just check what time it seems to us 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.600
 it seems that inter is not there 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.810
 nothing seems like before but reality 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.560
 we kids know very well that al 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:41.200
 its interior contains and that bunch of 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.200
 dermatitis expensive cards here 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.280

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:56.330
