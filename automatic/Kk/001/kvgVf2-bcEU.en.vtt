00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 hi friends from youtube i am 2 393 today les 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.120
 I bring a pancake and pasta the episode 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.070
 lost part dies we started 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.200
 noticed that foxx has a strange way 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.960
 to list the chapters of the simpsons 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.550
 do not count some making the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.520
 total number of episodes be 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.210
 inconsistent the reason for this is a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.500
 Lost episode of the first season 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.599
 find details about this 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.310
 episode is complicated to any member 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.320
 of the staff that worked in the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.600
 program back then he likes to talk 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.640
 of it according to what has been achieved 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.340
 collect the lost episode was 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.280
 written entirely by Matt groening the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.800
 production number of the episode was 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.129
 706 and subtitle bar dies episode 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.379
 marked as 706 the depression of liza 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.090
 was produced later and he was awarded the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.149
 Bar production code dies for 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.160
 disguise the existence of this in a 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.809
 fan convention I managed to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.820
 marc follow after I talk to the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.410
 public and eventually I had the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.080
 opportunity to talk to him alone 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.369
 while leaving the building I do not know 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.900
 It bothered him to follow him 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.760
 I was probably 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.370
 giving the typical encounter with a fan 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.070
 obsessed when I mentioned the episode 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.560
 lost however his face was stripped 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.840
 full color when I asked if I 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.150
 I could give some details he took a 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.370
 piece of paper wrote something on it and I 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.310
 I hand him over then he asked me not to 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.200
 I was going to talk about it again on paper 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.090
 I had written down the address of a site 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.970
 web that I prefer not to disclose for reasons 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.830
 that I will relate in a moment I introduced the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.600
 address in my search engine and I entered a 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.030
 site that was completely black 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.060
 except for a yellow line of text 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.910
 a download link I clicked on it and 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.040
 a file started to be downloaded once 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.260
 that the download had finished my 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.570
 computer went crazy was the worst 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.060
 virus that had seen restore the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.610
 system did not serve the whole computer 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.220
 had to be formatted before doing 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.890
 this however I copied the file in a 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.080
 I gave in, try to open it on my computer 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.780
 clean and as I suspected it was a 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.090
 episode of the simpson episode 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.370
 started like everyone else but with 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.380
 a pretty poor animation quality 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.480
 if you have seen the animation 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.630
 for a lovely night it was similar 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.360
 the first part was very normal but the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.580
 characters were a bit out of it 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.950
 homero looked more angry marjÃ©s was 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.020
 I saw depressed Lisa looked anxious and 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.420
 bart seemed to be full of genuine anger 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.980
 and I hate their parents 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.740
 the episode was about the family 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.600
 I was going on a plane trip to the end of 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.690
 the first part the plane was 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.540
 taking off part was flying as it 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.640
 I would expect him however when the 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.630
 plane was raised about 30 meters by 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.870
 on earth 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.940
 bard broke a window and was sucked 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.770
 at the beginning of the program he maintained 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.810
 the idea that the animated style of 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.150
 world of the simpsons represented the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.820
 real life and that death made everything come back 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.340
 more realistic this was used in that 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.190
 episode the image of the corpse of bart 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.530
 It was barely recognizable taking advantage of 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.320
 I did not have to move they drew a picture 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.390
 almost photographic of his corpse the 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.670
 The first part ended with a shot of the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.280
 bart's corpse when the 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.370
 second part homero marge lisa were 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.349
 sitting at the table crying 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.750
 the crying did not seem to end 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.420
 becoming more painful and sounding each 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.180
 more realistic time a better performance 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.370
 what would be expected the animation began 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.129
 to decay even more as they cried and 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.680
 I could hear background murmurs 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.140
 characters could barely distinguish the 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.180
 image was long and blurred as 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.819
 deformed shadows painted in colors 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.129
 bright there were faces looking through the 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.989
 window blinking again and again for 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.299
 that there was no certainty of who 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.269
 were the crying followed by all the 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.340
 part two the last part began 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.280
 with a scrap specifying that there was 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.010
 spent a year homero marge lisa were 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.709
 extremely thin still sitting on 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.099
 the table there was no trace of magic from the 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:10.040
 pets decided to visit the tomb of 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.989
 bart springfield was deserted already 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.299
 as they walked through the cemetery 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.940
 the environment became more and more dilapidated 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.760
 all the houses looked abandoned 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.769
 when they reached the grave the body of 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.780
 bartz was just lying in front of 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.010
 his gravestone looking like the time 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.680
 previous 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.990
 the family started crying again 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.420
 eventually they stopped and only 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.370
 they were staring at bart the 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.230
 camera focused on the face of homer 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.630
 According to other sources 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.850
 Homer says a joke in this part but 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.740
 it was not audible in the version that I saw no 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.320
 you could understand what homero was 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.940
 saying the camera did a take 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.000
 panoramic before the episode 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.650
 finished the tombstones in the background had 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.080
 the names of each guest celebrity 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.640
 to the simpsons in them even from 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.750
 some of which nobody had heard 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:02.180
 speak for 1989 they all had written the 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.250
 date of death for those who already 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.560
 they died as michael jackson and george 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.320
 harrison dates coincided with the 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.300
 day in which they died it occurred to me 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.700
 something after seeing the episode for the first 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.590
 Once the dates could be used in the 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.630
 tombstones to predict the death of 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.400
 celebrities invited to the simpsons that 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.590
 they were still alive and there was something strange 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.870
 with most of those who had not yet 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.240
 dead all their deaths were 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.550
 indicated under the same date comment 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.250
 like and subscribe bye bye 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.490

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.490
