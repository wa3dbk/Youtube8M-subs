00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
just released into the Australian market

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.740 
just released into the Australian market
only<00:00:23.130> just<00:00:23.369> released<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.910> ICAST<00:00:24.330> show<00:00:24.539> so

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
only just released it the ICAST show so

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.179 
only just released it the ICAST show so
it's<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> first<00:00:25.109> time<00:00:25.260> we've<00:00:25.529> had<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.800> we've

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
it's the first time we've had it we've

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.769 
it's the first time we've had it we've
had<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> female<00:00:26.609> marketer<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.330> market<00:00:27.660> now

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
had a female marketer in the market now

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.240 
had a female marketer in the market now
for<00:00:27.810> 12<00:00:28.199> months<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.769> guy<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
for 12 months but this guy is the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.460 
for 12 months but this guy is the
two-speed<00:00:29.670> version<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.750> runs<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.260> same

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
two-speed version so it runs the same

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.139 
two-speed version so it runs the same
shift<00:00:31.740> system<00:00:31.949> as<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> Santiago's<00:00:32.969> you've

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
shift system as the Santiago's you've

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.760 
shift system as the Santiago's you've
got<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> push<00:00:33.570> button<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.140> low<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.530> twist

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
got a push button for low and a twist

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.560 
got a push button for low and a twist
turn<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.250> high<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.760> very<00:00:35.910> easy<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.390> use

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
turn for high so it's very easy to use

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.030 
turn for high so it's very easy to use
and<00:00:36.780> very<00:00:36.840> easy<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.230> manage<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.770> shift

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
and very easy to manage that shift

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.220 
and very easy to manage that shift
system<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:39.000> lever<00:00:39.239> drag<00:00:39.540> system<00:00:39.930> will<00:00:40.110> give

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
system the lever drag system will give

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.799 
system the lever drag system will give
you<00:00:40.350> 12<00:00:40.620> kilos<00:00:41.040> at<00:00:41.190> strike<00:00:41.460> 20<00:00:42.030> kilos<00:00:42.420> at<00:00:42.570> full

you 12 kilos at strike 20 kilos at full
and<00:00:43.170> still<00:00:43.440> give<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.710> for<00:00:43.890> free<00:00:43.920> school<00:00:44.190> there

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
and still give you for free school there

are machine body and machine side plate

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.639 
are machine body and machine side plate
so<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.969> full<00:00:48.180> alloy<00:00:48.480> machined<00:00:48.989> there<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.620> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
so it's a full alloy machined there on a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.260 
so it's a full alloy machined there on a
stainless<00:00:49.950> main<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.610> stainless<00:00:50.969> pinion

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
stainless main and the stainless pinion

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.610 
stainless main and the stainless pinion
gear<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.660> getting<00:00:51.809> exceptional<00:00:52.230> strength

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
gear so you getting exceptional strength

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.770 
gear so you getting exceptional strength
out<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.980> those<00:00:53.160> gearing's<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.300> two-speed

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
out of those gearing's the two-speed

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840 
out of those gearing's the two-speed
system<00:00:55.230> unlike<00:00:55.620> most<00:00:55.829> two-speed<00:00:56.340> still<00:00:56.610> stays

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
system unlike most two-speed still stays

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.389 
system unlike most two-speed still stays
fairly<00:00:57.120> high<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.109> 6.1<00:00:58.620> at<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> high<00:00:59.070> speed

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
fairly high it's a 6.1 at the high speed

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.819 
fairly high it's a 6.1 at the high speed
and<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.609> 3.1<00:01:00.210> at<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> low<00:01:00.570> speed<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:00.899> even<00:01:01.739> at

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
and a 3.1 at the low speed so even at

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.349 
and a 3.1 at the low speed so even at
the<00:01:01.920> low<00:01:02.100> speed<00:01:02.460> you're<00:01:02.760> still<00:01:02.969> getting<00:01:03.120> over

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the low speed you're still getting over

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.649 
the low speed you're still getting over
a<00:01:03.539> metre<00:01:03.780> along<00:01:04.110> their<00:01:04.439> turn<00:01:05.479> there's<00:01:06.479> two

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
a metre along their turn there's two

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.960 
a metre along their turn there's two
sizes<00:01:07.140> available<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> 20<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:08.880> do

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
sizes available this is the 20 and we do

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.580 
sizes available this is the 20 and we do
a<00:01:09.000> 30<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:09.510> well<00:01:09.540> which<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.990> slightly<00:01:10.320> larger

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
a 30 as well which is a slightly larger

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.950 
a 30 as well which is a slightly larger
real<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.460> 20<00:01:11.760> will<00:01:11.880> hold<00:01:12.030> around<00:01:12.119> 600<00:01:12.750> metres

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
real the 20 will hold around 600 metres

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.960 
real the 20 will hold around 600 metres
of<00:01:13.080> 50<00:01:13.320> pound<00:01:13.530> braid<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.250> 30<00:01:14.490> holds<00:01:14.880> around

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
of 50 pound braid the 30 holds around

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.450 
of 50 pound braid the 30 holds around
600<00:01:15.540> metres<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.810> 80<00:01:15.990> pound<00:01:16.259> braid<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.860> you've

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
600 metres of 80 pound braid so you've

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.039 
600 metres of 80 pound braid so you've
got<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> lot<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.820> capacity<00:01:18.420> there<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> can

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
got a lot of capacity there so you can

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.359 
got a lot of capacity there so you can
get<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.500> fish<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.860> deep<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:20.250> it

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
get down and fish the deep with it

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.249 
get down and fish the deep with it
because<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> spool<00:01:21.659> design<00:01:21.990> they're

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
because of the spool design they're

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.859 
because of the spool design they're
actually<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> very<00:01:22.830> narrow<00:01:23.130> spool<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.060> but

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
actually a very narrow spool is on but

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.660 
actually a very narrow spool is on but
you<00:01:24.990> get<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.290> big<00:01:25.530> capacity<00:01:26.130> there<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.549> it's

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
you get that big capacity there but it's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.130 
you get that big capacity there but it's
very<00:01:26.729> easy<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.240> manage<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:27.810> your<00:01:27.960> thumb

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
very easy to manage it with your thumb

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.810 
very easy to manage it with your thumb
as<00:01:28.320> well<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:28.860> you're<00:01:29.009> dropping<00:01:29.369> jigs<00:01:29.579> down

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
as well so if you're dropping jigs down

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.280 
as well so if you're dropping jigs down
you<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> good<00:01:30.450> feel<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.170> you're

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
you can get a good feel on it and you're
