00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.510
 Hi my mandate is jojo and 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.879
 welcome to this video for the 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.349
 android users to explain to you 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.009
 how to change the frequency of your 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.740
 smartphone 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.570
 this trick will allow you according to 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.700
 your use of winning the 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.200
 battery or make it faster 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.770
 your device in all 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.780
 circumstances 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.570
 I propose here two applications 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.450
 that I found on the plextor 7 cpu which 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.610
 is paying the price of 1 euro 79 and cpu 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.929
 tuner which is free but you have 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.420
 also in app purchases 

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:36.530
 so what you need to know is that the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.179
 difference between the two is that 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.219
 this cpu is for me a little more 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.780
 practical and offers you more 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.089
 features relative to these countries 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.920
 and an hour after downloading a 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.079
 of its api question it will be necessary to accept 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.370
 the super user rights it's up to 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.499
 to say that your device must be road 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.850
 and if that is not the case you will do 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:54.229
 an internet search to find out 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.179
 how to road and your smartphone 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.979
 and for those who have a f4 it will suffice 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:01.550
 to go follow the video that will be in the 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:03.769
 description of the video in these countries and 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.579
 an hour are you going to go in extreme 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.380
 then after you go cochet 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.360
 advanced users and after by the 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.640
 next you will be able to change the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.409
 maximum and minimum frequency that is 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.939
 just here 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.530
 now we will go into this cpu 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.189
 you see the presentation is good 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.100
 different 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.270
 but these two applications to the group the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.530
 feature that interests us 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.250
 change the maximum and minimum frequency 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.250
 what it is 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.110
 basically for those who want to keep 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.120
 of the battery you have to change the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.590
 maximum frequency obviously for 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.600
 some devices must not go down 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.970
 too low if not your device balaguÃ© 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.800
 hugely good apart with the s4 I the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.690
 put it to my guys by doing that 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.740
 the device still remains fast and 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.540
 I turn to gain a lot of autonomy 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.280
 to give you an example in one 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.560
 day I consume 30% in use 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.270
 with facebook twitter mail internet 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.110
 survey g and I also see some sms 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.110
 during the day 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.479
 for those who want to have a device 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.609
 faster you have to increase the 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.689
 minimum frequency of course he 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.579
 do not put it to the maximum 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.799
 all the time because the lifespan of 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.410
 your smartphone will take a sacred 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.489
 stroke 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.930
 in any case I hope this video 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.849
 you liked it we find ourselves in a 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.799
 next video to ios or android on my 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.799
 facebook page and twitter hi 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.969
 Yes
