00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.520 
we back you up all the way even through
all<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.090> struggles<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.780> feel<00:02:24.110> like<00:02:24.200> I'm<00:02:24.320> going

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
all the struggles I feel like I'm going

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.340 
all the struggles I feel like I'm going
places<00:02:24.770> you<00:02:25.670> should<00:02:25.880> be<00:02:25.970> proud

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
places you should be proud

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.539 
places you should be proud
