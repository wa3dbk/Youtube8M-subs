possible<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:57.149> be<00:01:57.210> able<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.750> use

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
possible that they be able to use

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.200 
possible that they be able to use
lightning<00:01:58.560> outright<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.640> I'd<00:01:59.880> be<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> fan<00:02:00.180> of

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
lightning outright and I'd be a fan of

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.340 
lightning outright and I'd be a fan of
that<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:00.509> only<00:02:00.689> because<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.930> love<00:02:01.170> lightning

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
that if only because I love lightning

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.590 
that if only because I love lightning
cables<00:02:01.799> if<00:02:01.890> only<00:02:02.159> because<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:03.180> they're

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
cables if only because it's they're

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.749 
cables if only because it's they're
reversible<00:02:04.049> eventually<00:02:04.890> all<00:02:04.920> USB<00:02:05.280> cables

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
reversible eventually all USB cables

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.190 
reversible eventually all USB cables
will<00:02:05.850> be<00:02:05.939> reversible<00:02:06.450> before<00:02:06.719> right<00:02:06.869> now<00:02:06.899> I'm

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
will be reversible before right now I'm

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.510 
will be reversible before right now I'm
very<00:02:07.350> happy<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.799> Apple's<00:02:08.129> kind<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.369> leading

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
very happy that Apple's kind of leading

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.940 
very happy that Apple's kind of leading
that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
that

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.949 
that
charge<00:02:09.129> all<00:02:09.429> right<00:02:10.239> so<00:02:10.450> let's<00:02:10.599> go<00:02:10.780> ahead<00:02:10.810> and

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
charge all right so let's go ahead and

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.470 
charge all right so let's go ahead and
pop<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.319> out<00:02:11.709> of<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.069> plastic<00:02:12.370> if<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.849> can<00:02:13.209> oh

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
pop this out of the plastic if I can oh

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.750 
pop this out of the plastic if I can oh
yeah<00:02:13.720> there<00:02:14.680> we<00:02:14.769> go<00:02:15.959> this<00:02:16.959> is<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.670> what<00:02:18.670> we

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
yeah there we go this is it and what we

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.729 
yeah there we go this is it and what we
have<00:02:18.910> is<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.150> little<00:02:19.569> brick<00:02:19.690> very<00:02:20.140> very<00:02:20.379> very

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
have is this little brick very very very

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.440 
have is this little brick very very very
lightweight<00:02:21.209> could<00:02:22.209> easily<00:02:22.720> fit<00:02:22.870> in<00:02:22.989> a<00:02:23.019> pocket

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
lightweight could easily fit in a pocket

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.410 
lightweight could easily fit in a pocket
feels<00:02:25.450> like<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.720> metallic<00:02:26.380> exterior<00:02:27.420> plastic

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
feels like a metallic exterior plastic

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.320 
feels like a metallic exterior plastic
interior<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.319> I<00:02:29.950> do<00:02:30.010> believe<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.790> yes<00:02:31.030> it

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
interior and I do believe that yes it

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.680 
interior and I do believe that yes it
kind<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.540> pops<00:02:31.720> open<00:02:31.959> like<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.230> little<00:02:32.500> book<00:02:32.709> you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
kind of pops open like a little book you

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.890 
kind of pops open like a little book you
have<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:35.700> charge<00:02:36.700> indicator<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.299> the<00:02:37.390> top<00:02:37.750> by

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
have the charge indicator on the top by

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.570 
have the charge indicator on the top by
pressing<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.260> button<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:39.010> get<00:02:39.160> some<00:02:39.370> lights

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
pressing a button you get some lights

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.690 
pressing a button you get some lights
that<00:02:39.819> illuminate<00:02:39.849> and<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:42.310> awesome

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
that illuminate and this is the awesome

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.940 
that illuminate and this is the awesome
part<00:02:42.880> instead<00:02:43.209> of<00:02:43.330> having<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.599> deal<00:02:43.840> with

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
part instead of having to deal with

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.180 
part instead of having to deal with
separate<00:02:44.950> cables<00:02:46.319> if<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.530> cables<00:02:47.890> are<00:02:47.980> built

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
separate cables if the cables are built

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.690 
separate cables if the cables are built
into<00:02:48.489> this<00:02:49.269> particular<00:02:49.540> device<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.670> the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
into this particular device so the

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.830 
into this particular device so the
cables<00:02:52.120> pop<00:02:52.299> out<00:02:52.510> you've<00:02:53.049> got<00:02:53.079> a<00:02:53.650> regular<00:02:54.250> USB

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
cables pop out you've got a regular USB

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.600 
cables pop out you've got a regular USB
connector<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:56.049> believe<00:02:56.470> type<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.829> and<00:02:57.010> then<00:02:57.579> a

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
connector I believe type a and then a

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.640 
connector I believe type a and then a
lightning<00:02:58.150> adapter<00:02:58.510> on<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.900> other<00:02:59.049> side<00:02:59.260> yay

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
lightning adapter on the other side yay

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.520 
lightning adapter on the other side yay
now<00:03:00.370> if<00:03:00.430> only<00:03:00.519> we<00:03:00.700> can<00:03:00.940> get<00:03:01.060> lightning<00:03:01.530> built

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
now if only we can get lightning built

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.539 
now if only we can get lightning built
in<00:03:02.709> on<00:03:02.890> those<00:03:03.040> uh<00:03:03.660> case<00:03:04.660> attachments<00:03:05.549> still

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
in on those uh case attachments still

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.390 
in on those uh case attachments still
this<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.269> something<00:03:07.630> that<00:03:07.780> may<00:03:08.500> be<00:03:09.220> something

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
this is something that may be something

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.059 
this is something that may be something
in<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.299> want<00:03:10.510> if<00:03:10.720> only<00:03:11.200> because<00:03:11.829> you're

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
in that you want if only because you're

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.289 
in that you want if only because you're
the<00:03:12.160> type<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.340> person<00:03:12.430> who<00:03:12.640> wants<00:03:12.760> an<00:03:12.910> external

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
the type of person who wants an external

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.620 
the type of person who wants an external
battery<00:03:13.540> pack<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:15.069> don't<00:03:15.700> want<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:15.880> carry

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
battery pack and you don't want to carry

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.140 
battery pack and you don't want to carry
separate<00:03:17.139> cables<00:03:17.500> which<00:03:17.859> can<00:03:18.069> be<00:03:18.160> messy<00:03:18.370> I

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
separate cables which can be messy I

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.569 
separate cables which can be messy I
would<00:03:19.750> much<00:03:19.780> prefer<00:03:20.489> carrying<00:03:21.489> around

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
would much prefer carrying around

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.210 
would much prefer carrying around
something<00:03:22.030> like<00:03:22.150> this<00:03:22.590> because<00:03:23.590> it's<00:03:24.040> got

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
something like this because it's got

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.520 
something like this because it's got
everything<00:03:24.459> I<00:03:24.609> need<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.630> cable<00:03:25.870> is<00:03:26.109> important

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
everything I need the cable is important

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.229 
everything I need the cable is important
the<00:03:26.980> battery<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.400> important<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.180> do

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
the battery is important and I do

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.759 
the battery is important and I do
believe<00:03:28.750> if<00:03:29.139> i<00:03:29.230> look<00:03:29.440> at<00:03:29.650> this<00:03:29.769> box<00:03:30.160> this<00:03:30.940> kit

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
believe if i look at this box this kit

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.069 
believe if i look at this box this kit
see<00:03:32.769> her<00:03:32.889> yeah<00:03:33.220> it<00:03:33.819> goes<00:03:33.970> up<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.150> 12,000

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
see her yeah it goes up to 12,000

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.150 
see her yeah it goes up to 12,000
milliamp<00:03:35.859> hours<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:37.660> course<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:38.170> higher

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
milliamp hours and of course the higher

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.129 
milliamp hours and of course the higher
the<00:03:39.670> longer<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.299> battery<00:03:40.540> will<00:03:40.750> last<00:03:40.780> the

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
the longer the battery will last the

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.840 
the longer the battery will last the
more<00:03:41.319> it<00:03:41.470> could<00:03:41.560> charge<00:03:41.769> devices<00:03:42.130> look<00:03:42.730> at

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
more it could charge devices look at

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.160 
more it could charge devices look at
