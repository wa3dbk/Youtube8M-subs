why<00:00:15.420> stop<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.929> takes<00:00:16.109> always<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.830> finance

why stop it takes always in the finance

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.810 
why stop it takes always in the finance
I<00:00:18.990> think<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.100> one<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.340> spells<00:00:20.609> are<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
I think the one that spells are the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.220 
I think the one that spells are the
difference<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.390> talking<00:00:21.720> tax<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.109> other

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
difference for talking tax and other

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.340 
difference for talking tax and other
things<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.800> like<00:00:23.640> Ranger<00:00:24.000> sign<00:00:24.240> they<00:00:24.869> rarely

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
things is like Ranger sign they rarely

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.849 
things is like Ranger sign they rarely
trade<00:00:26.150> rarely<00:00:27.150> make<00:00:27.330> big<00:00:27.630> big<00:00:28.199> adjustments

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
trade rarely make big big adjustments

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.470 
trade rarely make big big adjustments
and<00:00:28.980> when<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.160> comes<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.429> players<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.300> they

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
and when it comes to players and is they

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:39.350 
and when it comes to players and is they
lose<00:00:30.960> their<00:00:31.199> Leicester<00:00:35.570> yes<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.910> think<00:00:38.969> you

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
lose their Leicester yes and I think you

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.490 
lose their Leicester yes and I think you

after a bad conference and the secret
there<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.820> think<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.149> for<00:01:01.050> talking<00:01:01.410> Texas<00:01:01.739> they

there I think for for talking Texas they

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860

just<00:01:02.070> never<00:01:02.190> made<00:01:02.489> any<00:01:02.699> big<00:01:02.879> big<00:01:03.390> movements

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
just never made any big big movements

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.320 
just never made any big big movements
and<00:01:04.140> they<00:01:05.070> they<00:01:05.580> ended<00:01:05.760> up<00:01:05.880> trusting<00:01:06.060> each

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and they they ended up trusting each

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.570 
and they they ended up trusting each
other<00:01:06.540> more<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.130> you<00:01:08.130> know<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.369> this

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
other more and you know this this

conference coach coach Norman enter the
picture<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.520> think<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.880> me<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.450> gave

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
picture and I think that me that gave

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
picture and I think that me that gave
them<00:01:12.810> an<00:01:12.930> extra<00:01:13.140> boost

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
them an extra boost

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.870 
them an extra boost

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
you know coach Todd is a great coach but

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.280

coach<00:01:17.880> Norman<00:01:18.689> brings<00:01:18.900> something<00:01:19.110> different

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
coach Norman brings something different

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170 
coach Norman brings something different
to<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.650> table<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.189> that's<00:01:20.850> why<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.090> think

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
to the table and that's why I think

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.609 
to the table and that's why I think
they'll<00:01:21.509> still<00:01:21.750> win<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> champion

I want to touch on do minimal changes

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.370 
I want to touch on do minimal changes
now<00:01:26.399> talking<00:01:26.820> that's<00:01:26.970> compared<00:01:27.329> to<00:01:27.390> other

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.279 
now talking that's compared to other
teams<00:01:28.710> who<00:01:28.920> make<00:01:29.100> constant<00:01:29.579> changes<00:01:30.289> in

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
teams who make constant changes in

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:32.929 
teams who make constant changes in
Denali<00:01:31.680> until<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.100> fix<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.520> look<00:01:32.729> at<00:01:32.820> this

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
Denali until we fix it so look at this

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.819 
Denali until we fix it so look at this
in<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.119> much<00:01:33.240> money<00:01:33.630> they<00:01:34.470> bother<00:01:34.890> me<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.579> way

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
in a much money they bother me in a way

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.109 
in a much money they bother me in a way
they<00:01:37.829> make<00:01:38.039> other<00:01:38.189> teams<00:01:38.490> look<00:01:38.670> bad<00:01:38.880> because

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
they make other teams look bad because

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.600 
they make other teams look bad because
like<00:01:39.929> I<00:01:39.960> said<00:01:40.170> some<00:01:40.590> teams<00:01:40.890> panic<00:01:41.310> cuz<00:01:41.429> they're

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
like I said some teams panic cuz they're

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.190 
like I said some teams panic cuz they're
not<00:01:41.789> winning<00:01:42.149> so<00:01:42.299> they<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.630> make<00:01:42.780> changes

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
not winning so they have to make changes

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.469 
not winning so they have to make changes
whereas<00:01:43.830> politics<00:01:44.490> they<00:01:45.030> don't<00:01:45.210> need<00:01:45.299> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
whereas politics they don't need to

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.719 
whereas politics they don't need to
change<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.990> think<00:01:46.079> when<00:01:46.320> they<00:01:46.439> made<00:01:46.679> that<00:01:47.009> those

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
change I think when they made that those

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.940 
change I think when they made that those
that<00:01:48.240> last<00:01:48.539> move<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:49.020> think<00:01:49.200> which<00:01:49.289> was<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.560> key

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
that last move I think which was the key

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.340 
that last move I think which was the key
move<00:01:50.130> when<00:01:50.340> they<00:01:50.429> got<00:01:50.549> Ryan<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.270> Kevin<00:01:51.750> they

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
move when they got Ryan and Kevin they

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.630 
move when they got Ryan and Kevin they
knew<00:01:52.500> they<00:01:52.619> were<00:01:52.679> set<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.189> next<00:01:53.310> five

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
knew they were set for the next five

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.050 
knew they were set for the next five
years

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
years

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.449 
years
and<00:01:54.329> we're<00:01:54.810> entering<00:01:54.959> the<00:01:55.619> latter<00:01:56.009> part<00:01:56.310> of

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
and we're entering the latter part of

but Jimmy was telling me also

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.550 
but Jimmy was telling me also
now<00:02:57.060> even<00:02:57.389> during<00:02:57.540> practice<00:02:57.959> coach<00:02:58.170> Norman

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
now even during practice coach Norman

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.890 
now even during practice coach Norman
would<00:02:58.620> run<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> lot<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.549> their<00:02:59.670> drills<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.389> you

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
would run a lot of their drills and you

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.569 
would run a lot of their drills and you
know<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.410> think<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:02.010> major<00:03:02.160> thing<00:03:02.310> that

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
know that I think the major thing that

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.449 
know that I think the major thing that
the<00:03:03.120> coach<00:03:03.840> Norman<00:03:04.260> gave<00:03:04.920> them<00:03:05.069> was<00:03:05.190> there<00:03:05.370> is

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
the coach Norman gave them was there is

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.140 
the coach Norman gave them was there is

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
defensive scheme and some offensively

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.940 
defensive scheme and some offensively
but<00:03:08.420> other<00:03:08.900> than<00:03:09.019> that<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.470> know<00:03:09.500> it's<00:03:09.739> still
