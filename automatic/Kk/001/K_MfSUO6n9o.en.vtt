really<00:00:53.649> nice<00:00:53.800> there's<00:00:54.129> not<00:00:54.280> not<00:00:54.879> a<00:00:54.940> line<00:00:55.300> in<00:00:55.660> it

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
really nice there's not not a line in it

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.529 
really nice there's not not a line in it
and<00:00:56.070> they've<00:00:57.070> also<00:00:57.280> scraped<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:58.000> table<00:00:58.390> which

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
and they've also scraped the table which

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.009 
and they've also scraped the table which
makes<00:00:58.780> it<00:00:58.930> really<00:00:58.960> nice<00:00:59.320> for<00:00:59.379> easy<00:01:00.039> oil<00:01:01.019> flow

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
makes it really nice for easy oil flow

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.090 
makes it really nice for easy oil flow
as<00:01:02.289> well<00:01:03.219> as<00:01:03.460> also<00:01:03.730> here<00:01:04.390> on<00:01:04.539> the<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.890> ways

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
as well as also here on the the ways

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.460 
as well as also here on the the ways
it's<00:01:06.580> also<00:01:06.789> scraped<00:01:07.300> and<00:01:07.630> in<00:01:07.929> very<00:01:08.229> nice

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
it's also scraped and in very nice

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.160 
it's also scraped and in very nice
condition<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:10.270> can<00:01:10.420> hear<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.690> head<00:01:10.869> sounds

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
condition you can hear the head sounds

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.249 
condition you can hear the head sounds
great

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:25.290 

absolutely<00:01:17.259> no<00:01:17.410> problems<00:01:17.830> at<00:01:17.979> all<00:01:24.179> I'm<00:01:25.179> go

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
absolutely no problems at all I'm go

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:35.390 
absolutely no problems at all I'm go
ahead<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:25.599> put<00:01:25.720> it<00:01:25.840> in<00:01:25.869> a<00:01:26.020> high<00:01:26.200> speed

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.060 

that's<00:01:36.400> that's<00:01:36.790> maximum<00:01:37.510> right<00:01:37.720> there<00:01:38.070> it's

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
that's that's maximum right there it's

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.000 
that's that's maximum right there it's
in<00:01:39.160> my<00:01:39.310> speed<00:01:39.720> we'll<00:01:40.720> go<00:01:40.840> ahead<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.170> put<00:01:41.890> the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
in my speed we'll go ahead and put the

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.110 
in my speed we'll go ahead and put the
auto<00:01:42.190> feet<00:01:42.460> on<00:01:42.640> now

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.590 

Oh

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.160 

but<00:01:50.200> in<00:01:50.320> Reverse<00:01:50.860> there<00:01:51.040> you<00:01:51.159> go<00:01:52.170> automatic

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
but in Reverse there you go automatic

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.719 
but in Reverse there you go automatic
down<00:01:53.350> feat<00:01:53.650> it<00:01:53.770> will<00:01:53.890> stop<00:01:54.100> once<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.460> gets<00:01:54.640> to

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
down feat it will stop once it gets to

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.890 
down feat it will stop once it gets to
the<00:01:54.909> point<00:01:55.920> move<00:01:56.920> your<00:01:57.100> piece<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.600> can<00:01:58.750> use

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
the point move your piece you can use

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.840 
the point move your piece you can use
the<00:01:59.080> power<00:01:59.710> table<00:02:00.310> if<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.520> need<00:02:00.700> to

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
the power table if you need to

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.679 
the power table if you need to
reorganize<00:02:01.240> where<00:02:01.750> you're<00:02:01.900> at

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
reorganize where you're at

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:12.960 
reorganize where you're at
it's<00:02:04.689> got<00:02:04.869> variable<00:02:05.380> speed<00:02:05.680> on<00:02:05.890> it

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.850 

as<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.690> can<00:02:13.810> see<00:02:13.990> everything<00:02:14.350> on<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.590> machine

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
as you can see everything on the machine

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.260 
as you can see everything on the machine
runs<00:02:15.100> really<00:02:15.340> well<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:17.700> sharp<00:02:18.700> is<00:02:18.820> an<00:02:18.910> import

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
runs really well a sharp is an import

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.700 
runs really well a sharp is an import
brand<00:02:19.480> but<00:02:19.720> it's<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.930> good<00:02:20.110> import<00:02:20.470> brand

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
brand but it's a good import brand

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.330 
brand but it's a good import brand
they're<00:02:21.070> known<00:02:21.220> for<00:02:21.250> heavier<00:02:21.730> duty<00:02:22.060> stuff

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
they're known for heavier duty stuff

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.620 
they're known for heavier duty stuff
what<00:02:24.340> else<00:02:24.520> are<00:02:24.610> we<00:02:24.640> gonna<00:02:24.760> show<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.090> here

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
what else are we gonna show you here

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.290 
what else are we gonna show you here
I<00:02:26.370> guess<00:02:27.370> we'll<00:02:27.520> show<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.730> another<00:02:28.000> feed

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
I guess we'll show you another feed

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.650 
I guess we'll show you another feed
cycle<00:02:29.700> they<00:02:30.700> have<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.120> different<00:02:31.450> feed

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
cycle they have the different feed

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.440 
cycle they have the different feed
speeds<00:02:32.020> right<00:02:32.230> here<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:34.120> is<00:02:34.270> pretty

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
speeds right here this is pretty
