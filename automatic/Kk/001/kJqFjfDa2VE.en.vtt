00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
guys this is it if you're a generator

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.100 
guys this is it if you're a generator
you<00:00:23.039> got<00:00:23.280> to<00:00:23.400> get<00:00:23.550> out<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.820> your<00:00:23.910> head<00:00:24.120> you<00:00:24.900> can

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
you got to get out of your head you can

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.380 
you got to get out of your head you can
no<00:00:25.320> longer<00:00:25.350> make<00:00:25.800> decisions<00:00:26.580> based<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.180> what

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
no longer make decisions based on what

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.300 
no longer make decisions based on what
you<00:00:27.539> think<00:00:27.570> not<00:00:28.440> what<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.830> think

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
you think not what you think

you think not what you think
and<00:00:29.400> not<00:00:29.789> what<00:00:29.970> everybody<00:00:30.330> else<00:00:30.690> thinks<00:00:31.170> you

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and not what everybody else thinks you

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.920 
and not what everybody else thinks you
have<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.920> learn<00:00:32.160> about<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.000> sacral<00:00:33.449> lifeforce

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
have to learn about the sacral lifeforce

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.790 
have to learn about the sacral lifeforce
which<00:00:34.170> resides<00:00:34.860> within<00:00:35.280> within<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.449> body<00:00:36.800> it

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
which resides within within your body it

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.180 
which resides within within your body it
is<00:00:37.859> a<00:00:38.070> response<00:00:38.880> mechanism<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> response

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
is a response mechanism it is a response

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.280 
is a response mechanism it is a response
mechanism<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.120> regenerates<00:00:42.870> its<00:00:43.050> life

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
mechanism that regenerates its life

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.979 
mechanism that regenerates its life
force<00:00:43.670> regenerates<00:00:44.670> itself<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:45.180> more<00:00:45.450> power

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
force regenerates itself with more power

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.500 
force regenerates itself with more power
every<00:00:46.470> time<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:47.040> respond<00:00:47.579> correctly<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
every time you respond correctly to the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.250 
every time you respond correctly to the
environment

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
environment

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.639 
environment
now<00:00:49.920> reason<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.360> aura<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:52.140> open

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
now reason for this is your aura is open

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.080 
now reason for this is your aura is open
in<00:00:52.770> developing<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.550> like<00:00:53.700> a<00:00:53.730> black<00:00:54.059> hole

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
in developing it's like a black hole

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.630 
in developing it's like a black hole
that's<00:00:54.750> pulling<00:00:55.020> light<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
that's pulling light to you so that the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.580 
that's pulling light to you so that the
right<00:00:56.820> things<00:00:57.030> are<00:00:57.149> already<00:00:57.600> coming<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.350> you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
right things are already coming to you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.830 
right things are already coming to you
every<00:00:58.829> time<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.700> take<00:00:59.969> off<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.390> your<00:01:00.450> mind

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
every time you take off with your mind

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.869 
every time you take off with your mind
to<00:01:01.050> go<00:01:01.170> do<00:01:01.500> something<00:01:01.950> you<00:01:02.250> think<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.670> should

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
to go do something you think you should

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.179 
to go do something you think you should
be<00:01:03.030> doing<00:01:03.390> or<00:01:03.510> you'd<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:05.039> are

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
be doing or you'd like to do you are

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.100 
be doing or you'd like to do you are
pulling<00:01:05.579> yourself<00:01:05.729> off<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.420> frequency<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
pulling yourself off the frequency and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.600 
pulling yourself off the frequency and
missing<00:01:07.469> the<00:01:07.560> thing<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:07.920> coming<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.430> you

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
missing the thing that's coming for you

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.380 
missing the thing that's coming for you
so<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.719> generator<00:01:10.560> you've<00:01:11.190> got<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.909> learn<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
so as a generator you've got to learn to

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.520 
so as a generator you've got to learn to
wait<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:13.500> respond<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.869> waiting<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.049> respond

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
wait to respond and waiting to respond

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.740 
wait to respond and waiting to respond
at<00:01:16.799> first<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.580> feel<00:01:17.760> so<00:01:18.180> rigid

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
at first it's going to feel so rigid

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.490 
at first it's going to feel so rigid
it's<00:01:19.260> going<00:01:19.440> to<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.650> such<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> pain<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.940> ass

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
it's going to be such a pain in the ass

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.649 
it's going to be such a pain in the ass
because<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.650> hurts<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.790> hurts<00:01:23.820> because<00:01:24.330> you've

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
because it hurts it hurts because you've

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.469 
because it hurts it hurts because you've
got<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.960> break<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.439> momentum<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.070> your<00:01:26.100> mind

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
got to break the momentum of your mind

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.020 
got to break the momentum of your mind
but<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.049> become<00:01:28.500> proficient<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.760> your

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
but as you become proficient with your

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.570 
but as you become proficient with your
art<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> generator<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.830> will<00:01:32.010> develop<00:01:32.280> this

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
art as a generator you will develop this
