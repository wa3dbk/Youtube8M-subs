00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.969
 hi poppy water not everyone knows but by 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.830
 default display Macbooks aimakov 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.859
 and whether other Apple devices shows 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.250
 absolutely not the image that they 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.170
 must shows and it is very easy 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.250
 fix it needs to be calibrated 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.349
 monitor for this we go in 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.809
 system settings in the monitors section and 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.910
 select the color tab and here I have already 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.600
 there is a calibrated profile but you 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.379
 it will not be just choose your profile 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.300
 and click calibrate and then open 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.360
 monitor calibration assistant in 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.870
 which tick the expert mode 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.149
 and go through all the points in each of 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.210
 which we will need to achieve 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:02.879
 so that the apple coincided with the background on which 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.760
 she painted this can be achieved 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:11.400
 by dragging dragging 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:17.009
 left and right slider and so about and 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.439
 going through all the points we get 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.000
 much better image i 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.830
 I will not save because I already have 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.710
 it is calibrated but you are the result 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.810
 these actions will get much more 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.979
 high-quality and realistic image 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.979
 on your monitor
