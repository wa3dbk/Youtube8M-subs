oh well it was a nice level anyway like
like<00:02:17.310> let's<00:02:17.550> say<00:02:17.760> another<00:02:18.050> concept<00:02:19.050> as<00:02:19.230> well

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
like let's say another concept as well

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.090 
like let's say another concept as well
but<00:02:21.510> yeah<00:02:21.660> maybe<00:02:22.260> maybe<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.680> could<00:02:22.800> be<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.890> bit

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100

but yeah maybe maybe it could be a bit
more<00:02:23.370> challenge<00:02:23.610> but<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.790> guess<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.420> doesn't

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
more challenge but I guess it doesn't

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.900 
more challenge but I guess it doesn't
have<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.170> necessarily<00:02:25.200> be<00:02:25.680> like<00:02:26.010> hard<00:02:26.610> level

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
have to necessarily be like hard level

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.729 
have to necessarily be like hard level
start<00:02:27.690> fund<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:30.480> just<00:02:30.720> end<00:02:30.870> on<00:02:30.989> this<00:02:31.200> such<00:02:31.709> a

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
start fund and just end on this such a

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.990 
start fund and just end on this such a
short<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.940> know<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:34.110> can<00:02:34.350> do<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.910> mm-hmm

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
short you know and I can do that mm-hmm

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.400 
short you know and I can do that mm-hmm
I<00:02:36.260> think<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.320> Sun<00:02:37.470> put<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:39.019> all<00:02:40.019> right

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
I think the Sun put on all right

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.770 
I think the Sun put on all right
sense<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.830> research<00:02:41.100> team<00:02:41.430> left<00:02:41.700> figured<00:02:42.690> I

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
sense a research team left figured I

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.280 
sense a research team left figured I
would<00:02:42.930> do<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.380> level<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:44.250> main<00:02:44.519> its<00:02:45.330> treehouse

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
would do a level of main its treehouse

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.540 
would do a level of main its treehouse
of<00:02:46.500> funds<00:02:46.739> it's<00:02:47.160> not

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
of funds it's not

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.830 
of funds it's not
I<00:02:47.580> never<00:02:48.090> uploaded<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:50.420> level<00:02:51.420> portal

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
I never uploaded it to the level portal

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.440 
I never uploaded it to the level portal
I<00:02:52.130> don't<00:02:53.130> know<00:02:53.250> I'm<00:02:53.489> not<00:02:53.550> actually<00:02:53.850> sure<00:02:54.090> why<00:02:54.420> I

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
I don't know I'm not actually sure why I

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.600 
I don't know I'm not actually sure why I
didn't<00:02:54.780> actually<00:02:55.160> maybe<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.220> shouldn't<00:02:56.519> think

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
didn't actually maybe I shouldn't think

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.729 
didn't actually maybe I shouldn't think
it<00:02:56.760> was<00:02:56.850> good<00:02:56.970> enough<00:02:57.180> for<00:02:57.440> something<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.560> don't

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
it was good enough for something I don't

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.800 
it was good enough for something I don't
know<00:02:58.800> but<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.670> figured<00:02:59.910> that<00:02:59.940> play<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.690> know

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
know but I figured that play it you know

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.960 
know but I figured that play it you know
just<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:01.140> fella<00:03:01.620> some<00:03:01.739> time<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.069> also<00:03:02.370> just

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
just a fella some time and also just

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.390 
just a fella some time and also just
show<00:03:03.209> off<00:03:03.329> a<00:03:03.390> lot<00:03:03.600> well<00:03:03.720> guess<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.890> level<00:03:05.310> that

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
show off a lot well guess the level that

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.460 
show off a lot well guess the level that
never<00:03:05.640> was
