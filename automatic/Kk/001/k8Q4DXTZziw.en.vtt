00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
States Germany and also Italy but was

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.910 
States Germany and also Italy but was
really<00:00:27.430> significant<00:00:28.060> about<00:00:28.180> this<00:00:28.660> map<00:00:29.199> favela

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
really significant about this map favela

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.910 
really significant about this map favela
as<00:00:30.400> a<00:00:30.760> favela<00:00:30.940> is<00:00:31.480> played<00:00:31.960> in<00:00:32.230> Brazil

as a favela is played in Brazil

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.880 
as a favela is played in Brazil
so<00:00:33.579> Brazil<00:00:33.819> is<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.510> most<00:00:34.780> accomplished<00:00:35.559> team

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
so Brazil is the most accomplished team

so Brazil is the most accomplished team
in<00:00:36.129> FIFA<00:00:36.609> World<00:00:36.789> Cup<00:00:37.089> history<00:00:37.329> they<00:00:38.109> want<00:00:38.379> five

titles and the current champion is beam

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.889 
titles and the current champion is beam
but<00:00:42.039> what<00:00:42.280> is<00:00:42.370> really<00:00:42.609> cool<00:00:43.059> about<00:00:43.089> this<00:00:43.600> is

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
but what is really cool about this is

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.950 
but what is really cool about this is
that<00:00:44.379> the<00:00:44.530> 2014<00:00:45.489> World<00:00:45.789> Cup<00:00:45.850> is<00:00:46.329> currently

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
this year and the second thing on this

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.669 
this year and the second thing on this
map<00:00:52.299> I<00:00:52.479> want<00:00:52.690> you<00:00:52.839> I<00:00:52.870> guess<00:00:53.139> you<00:00:53.409> have<00:00:53.649> the

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
map I want you I guess you have the

map I want you I guess you have the
ability<00:00:54.249> to<00:00:54.489> play<00:00:54.729> soccer<00:00:55.089> on<00:00:55.510> favela<00:00:56.049> which

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
ability to play soccer on favela which

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:58.680 
ability to play soccer on favela which
is<00:00:56.829> pretty<00:00:57.010> cool<00:00:57.280> how<00:00:57.699> they<00:00:57.909> referencing<00:00:58.569> the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
is pretty cool how they referencing the

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.410 
is pretty cool how they referencing the
FIFA<00:00:59.139> World<00:00:59.319> Cup<00:00:59.469> and<00:01:00.159> also<00:01:00.670> you<00:01:00.729> can<00:01:01.059> actually

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
FIFA World Cup and also you can actually

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.599 
FIFA World Cup and also you can actually
play<00:01:01.629> soccer<00:01:02.019> on<00:01:02.319> favela<00:01:02.799> but<00:01:03.399> the<00:01:03.489> only

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
play soccer on favela but the only

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.520 
play soccer on favela but the only
downside<00:01:04.210> about<00:01:04.239> this<00:01:04.750> you<00:01:05.049> can<00:01:05.229> actually

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
downside about this you can actually

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.560 
downside about this you can actually
kick<00:01:06.009> the<00:01:06.189> ball<00:01:06.399> called<00:01:06.789> duty<00:01:07.090> in<00:01:07.299> order<00:01:07.390> to

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
kick the ball called duty in order to

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.779 
kick the ball called duty in order to
play<00:01:07.750> soccer<00:01:08.079> but<00:01:08.829> you<00:01:08.950> can<00:01:09.130> you<00:01:09.460> can<00:01:09.640> use

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
play soccer but you can you can use

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.870 
play soccer but you can you can use
other<00:01:10.030> techniques<00:01:10.899> for<00:01:11.200> call<00:01:11.619> duty<00:01:11.890> wise<00:01:12.189> such

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
other techniques for call duty wise such

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.149 
other techniques for call duty wise such
as<00:01:13.090> using<00:01:13.509> your<00:01:13.539> knife<00:01:13.840> or<00:01:14.259> using<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.950> riot

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.069 
as using your knife or using the riot
shields<00:01:15.609> so<00:01:16.030> technically<00:01:16.509> you<00:01:16.719> can<00:01:16.869> actually

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
shields so technically you can actually

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:18.240 
shields so technically you can actually
played<00:01:17.619> soccer

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
played soccer

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.010
