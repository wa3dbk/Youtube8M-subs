mark<00:00:03.300> one<00:00:03.509> thinks<00:00:03.840> of<00:00:03.960> north<00:00:04.680> korea<00:00:04.979> is

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
mark one thinks of north korea is

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.429 
mark one thinks of north korea is
completely<00:00:05.550> sort<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:05.850> locked<00:00:06.060> down<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.689> very

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:07.439 
completely sort of locked down and very

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:09.709 
completely sort of locked down and very
difficult<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:08.010> for<00:00:08.730> even<00:00:08.969> North<00:00:09.150> Koreans<00:00:09.599> to

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
difficult to for even North Koreans to

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.660 
difficult to for even North Koreans to
move<00:00:09.960> about<00:00:10.080> but<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:11.010> seems<00:00:11.280> there's<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.550> bit

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
move about but it seems there's a bit

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.460 
move about but it seems there's a bit
more<00:00:11.820> flexibility<00:00:12.450> than<00:00:12.540> perhaps<00:00:13.170> we

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:13.470 
more flexibility than perhaps we

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.140 
more flexibility than perhaps we
understood<00:00:13.890> yeah<00:00:14.580> clearly<00:00:14.880> much<00:00:15.120> more

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
understood yeah clearly much more

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.029 
understood yeah clearly much more
flexibility<00:00:15.809> were<00:00:16.049> than<00:00:16.470> what<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.859> either

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
flexibility were than what the either

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.220 
flexibility were than what the either
were<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.279> West<00:00:17.490> thinks<00:00:18.390> usually<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.840> North

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
were the West thinks usually of North

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.439 
were the West thinks usually of North
Korea<00:00:19.530> its<00:00:20.010> new<00:00:20.280> so<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:20.670> not<00:00:20.789> something<00:00:21.240> that

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
Korea its new so it's not something that

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.779 
Korea its new so it's not something that
has<00:00:21.779> been<00:00:21.810> going<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.230> for<00:00:22.289> four<00:00:22.650> years<00:00:22.830> but<00:00:23.610> we

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
has been going on for four years but we

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.900 
has been going on for four years but we
have<00:00:23.910> missed<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.600> change<00:00:25.440> over<00:00:26.100> the<00:00:26.190> past<00:00:26.220> 24

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
have missed this change over the past 24

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.910 
have missed this change over the past 24
months<00:00:26.940> let's<00:00:27.690> say<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.080> first<00:00:28.439> thing<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.710> see

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
months let's say the first thing you see

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.679 
months let's say the first thing you see
you<00:00:29.520> notice<00:00:29.789> when<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.060> arrive<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.570> have

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
you notice when you arrive you have

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.959 
you notice when you arrive you have
traffic<00:00:31.320> jams<00:00:31.470> for<00:00:31.980> instance<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.609> you<00:00:32.820> have

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
traffic jams for instance so you have

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.690 
traffic jams for instance so you have
more<00:00:33.750> people<00:00:33.870> having<00:00:34.260> cars<00:00:34.500> until<00:00:35.280> now<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.670> was

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
more people having cars until now it was

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.840 
more people having cars until now it was
a<00:00:35.880> big<00:00:36.809> street<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.380> nobody<00:00:37.710> driving<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.730> it

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
a big street with nobody driving in it

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.250 
a big street with nobody driving in it
you<00:00:39.180> see<00:00:39.390> sky<00:00:41.239> skyscraper<00:00:42.239> scrapers<00:00:42.630> big

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
you see sky skyscraper scrapers big

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.049 
you see sky skyscraper scrapers big
buildings<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.829> bit<00:00:43.950> like<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.219> Dubai<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
buildings a bit like in Dubai the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.970 
buildings a bit like in Dubai the
difference<00:00:45.360> there<00:00:45.630> it's<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.350> army<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.860> is

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
difference there it's the army that is

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.459 
difference there it's the army that is
building<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.489> visa<00:00:48.480> big<00:00:48.780> buildings<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:49.320> they

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
building the visa big buildings but they

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.830 
building the visa big buildings but they
do<00:00:49.530> exist<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.460> thought<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.850> North<00:00:51.510> Korean

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
do exist but we thought the North Korean

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.330 
do exist but we thought the North Korean
economy<00:00:52.020> was<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> floor<00:00:52.770> was<00:00:53.040> the<00:00:53.190> money

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
economy was on the floor was the money

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.490 
economy was on the floor was the money
coming<00:00:53.640> from<00:00:53.670> its<00:00:54.329> again<00:00:54.780> i<00:00:54.809> think<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.350> a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
coming from its again i think it's a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.160 
coming from its again i think it's a
it's<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:56.520> mistake<00:00:56.700> we<00:00:57.030> make<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.870> there<00:00:58.050> is

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
it's a mistake we make that there is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.020 
it's a mistake we make that there is
some<00:00:58.379> money<00:00:58.530> north<00:00:58.829> korea<00:00:59.100> there<00:00:59.610> is<00:00:59.700> more<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
that's one good way they found two to

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:29.959 
that's one good way they found two to
bring<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.679> in<00:01:28.799> but<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.099> use<00:01:29.279> the<00:01:29.459> word<00:01:29.579> share

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:31.339 
bring it in but you use the word share
that<00:01:30.240> means<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.689> actually<00:01:31.020> people<00:01:31.139> are

00:01:31.339 --> 00:01:31.349 
that means that actually people are

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:33.709 
that means that actually people are
allowed<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.520> small<00:01:32.789> way<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:32.999> be<00:01:33.209> capitalists

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
country down but again I think the the

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.680 
country down but again I think the the
key<00:06:30.259> challenge<00:06:30.709> for<00:06:30.949> for<00:06:31.159> him<00:06:31.310> you<00:06:31.459> say<00:06:31.699> he's

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
key challenge for for him you say he's

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.879 
key challenge for for him you say he's
elsewhere<00:06:33.169> he

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 
elsewhere he

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:35.800 
elsewhere he
what<00:06:34.460> is<00:06:34.580> tries<00:06:34.759> to<00:06:34.909> do<00:06:35.030> we<00:06:35.150> always<00:06:35.389> think<00:06:35.599> in

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
what is tries to do we always think in

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.140 
what is tries to do we always think in
terms<00:06:35.960> of<00:06:36.199> personality<00:06:36.680> cult<00:06:37.280> so<00:06:37.789> we<00:06:37.939> see

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
terms of personality cult so we see

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.149
