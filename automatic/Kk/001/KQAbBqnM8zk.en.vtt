the best smelling pizza I've ever
my<00:01:59.340> life<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.409> cheenies<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> little

my life so the cheenies is a little

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.679 
my life so the cheenies is a little
overdone<00:02:02.219> there's<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.210> little<00:02:03.329> too<00:02:03.509> much

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
cheese for this I think he agrees it's a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.540 
cheese for this I think he agrees it's a
little<00:02:06.450> uneven<00:02:06.630> side<00:02:07.289> but<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.770> mean<00:02:07.950> that's<00:02:08.129> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
little uneven side but I mean that's the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.070 
little uneven side but I mean that's the
point<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> deep<00:02:09.179> dish<00:02:09.390> I'm<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.869> get<00:02:10.050> a

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
point of the deep dish I'm and you get a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.100 
point of the deep dish I'm and you get a
lot<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.739> get<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.039> thick<00:02:11.370> thickness<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.510> mean

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
lot you get that thick thickness I mean

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.660 
lot you get that thick thickness I mean
it<00:02:13.260> really<00:02:13.379> wouldn't<00:02:13.860> be<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.220> same<00:02:14.400> without

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
it really wouldn't be the same without

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.520 
it really wouldn't be the same without
it<00:02:15.000> because<00:02:15.150> they<00:02:15.269> be<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:15.630> crust<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.349> then

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
it because they be just crust and then

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.550 
it because they be just crust and then
sauce<00:02:16.860> pepperoni<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.700> be<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.819> little<00:02:18.060> weird<00:02:18.560> so

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
sauce pepperoni and be a little weird so

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.380 
sauce pepperoni and be a little weird so
it<00:02:19.709> needs<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.069> be<00:02:20.190> cheesy<00:02:20.459> but<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:21.000> guess<00:02:21.180> it's

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
it needs to be cheesy but I guess it's

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.880 
it needs to be cheesy but I guess it's
just<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.569> cheese<00:02:21.870> that's<00:02:22.140> kind<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.440> tasting

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
just the cheese that's kind of tasting

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.589
