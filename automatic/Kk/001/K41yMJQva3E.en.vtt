00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 how you like these 3d applications in big 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.990
 could make the little one show after 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.450
 we in this video for the big one 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.960
 application needs her pins 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.230
 lighter scissors cooking and sewing needle 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.850
 hand mars a trick mark a big one 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.660
 residue and a substance on which the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.980
 application is then sewn on 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.650
 but now I have every hawk up 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.869
 42 inches long and 5 inches wide 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.000
 the clamshell so together that in 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.480
 uk gives and then get stuck if there is one 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.870
 needle one at a centimeter after 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.870
 admitted 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.910
 we concluded stretched to air 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.620
 The Nazi would not like to be with them 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.699
 we just separate with the 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.850
 case shows a bit different 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.960
 works very well with plastic tape 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.079
 they melt a bit 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.790
 then they can not fray anymore 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.790
 then bark me senate addition apart 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.879
 we turn the country to the right so 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.440
 The almost gave them then we are stuck 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.530
 Now a few mark needle 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.810
 So if the seam is here in the break of 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.369
 the other side 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.069
 then we could do it again and again 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.560
 put the needle exactly over the and then 

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:20.770
 we can on one side known 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.390
 the one pudding and here only 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.440
 on one side so not here too 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.210
 but only on one edge 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.080
 and now we get these cards the 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.880
 we beat 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.319
 they are also meant as a marker only 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.319
 we'll get them inside now 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.060
 there we can also get a needle 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.289
 stuck and then it falls over it so 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.659
 so it looks like 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.820
 Here we leave the edges round again 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.719
 and here we develop ourselves again 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.549
 fixed that here the edges really nice 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.109
 beaten into 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.850
 You can see that as well as you can 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:00.420
 a nice ironed and here they are 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.759
 still nice and voluminous now 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.219
 voluminous leaf ironed with the trick 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:11.230
 marca we now draw a square 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:14.470
 which is 10 x 10 cm tall then we do 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.400
 with markings each 35 cm from the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.400
 corner away 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.819
 then we can do ours now 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:24.219
 take in a restrained country 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.590
 I would start here at the bottom 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:28.569
 edge and here the mark we 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.840
 have shown that after where 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.040
 we're going to arrest the country here 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.159
 pinning it too 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.959
 then we turn it from a second this 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.930
 ironed edges show us quite well 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:46.329
 that's right in here right back 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.829
 continue turning when all four are infected 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.209
 Let's go to the sewing machines we 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:55.629
 take each one from here to here 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.790
 we sew pretty well now knew 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.139
 we sewed all four sides here 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.299
 middle is now still with a few hand 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.700
 Stichen is a first and the pinned 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.790
 side together and then over it the and 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.790
 the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.920
 then you can make it so pluck up and 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.250
 our nation is done in big now 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.680
 we'll show you how to get smaller 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.910
 you need a pinch lighter for that 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.400
 a scissors garni needle one-handed measure 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.250
 trick brand at ritz tied the two 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.420
 centimeters wide and 14 inches long and 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.570
 again a fabric on the the 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.240
 sewed on the application we will take 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.610
 The 14 centimeter-long wall plug it 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:49.940
 also together again at the one 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.720
 centimeter after adding signal together 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.540
 we can do it a bit now 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.100
 cut back and then we melt 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.100
 the again with the lighter 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.340
 then we turn it and here we go 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.770
 actually or equal to the big one 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.500
 encourage us here when it comes here 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.920
 is in the break on the other side one 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.230
 needle 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.330
 then the needles meet exactly the seam 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.430
 then let's go be back 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.780
 then we form half of the 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.460
 then we have these two edges 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:28.090
 You can put them together again 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:33.620
 and then you can do it all together 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:36.470
 we then iron it again until 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.330
 fixed here again and here is again 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.180
 let's go around then we can 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.880
 stick out again and then you can 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.690
 to accept it is now a 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.820
 square of three centimeters has it 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.560
 Small is we do not take that with the 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.450
 Sewing machine like the big but per 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.130
 Just hand with small stitches 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.130
 accept it all around here 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.610
 Maybe I do not want to be completely in 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.360
 start the corner but so 0 5 cm from 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.360
 the ceiling removed 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.460
 Now I sewed it all around 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.090
 then I'm stuck with that right now 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:24.860
 catch here in the middle then I take 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:27.460
 everything with and the opposite 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:33.050
 the two together 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:35.540
 joy the other two then put 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.480
 I'm just in the rows of me again 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:42.910
 is out the back and then for 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.910
 next here with 12 stitches and 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.650
 completed our application is in small
