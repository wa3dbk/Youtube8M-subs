00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:07.030
 Hi guys! Today let's see how to make this swan with paper 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.869
 to make our swan, we take a square sheet 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:17.869
 fold the sheet along the diagonal of the square 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.390
 we do the same on the other side too 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.460
 once we have drawn our diagonals, we turn the sheet 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.460
 and fold it in half 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.910
 both on one side 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.910
 than on the other 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.670
 we approach these two sides in this way 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.150
 we got a smaller square 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.270
 now let's put our square 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.230
 in this way, then the part that opens upwards 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:01.230
 and let's bend this side at the center 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.520
 let us do the same in this part 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:22.909
 fold 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.099
 this triangle 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.339
 upward 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:32.619
 and open up 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:36.299
 now 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.749
 we bring this part down, opening 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:44.049
 then as we open 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:51.049
 let's go to bend 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:27.499
 ok, we have to repeat the same thing on the other side too; so let's turn 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.089
 the paper 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:39.089
 from the side that opens we make the fold 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:53.639
 bend this triangle upwards 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.329
 then we open everything 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:58.719
 we take 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.569
 a single sheet 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.019
 we bring it down. 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.799
 and as we carry it down, let's go to bend 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:15.799
 following the lines we have created 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.749
 ok 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:41.289
 so if we open, we see that this tip is downwards 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:48.289
 so let's go and bend this side towards the center 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.759
 turn 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:11.759
 let us do the same in this part 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:31.449
 now let's take one side 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:37.379
 and we take it to the other side 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:42.659
 we turn, we do the same also on this side 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:49.659
 ok, let's go and fold well 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.150
 we bring 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:58.150
 a tip 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.469
 down 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:07.999
 until you touch the other pointed bets on this side 

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:14.569
 and also from here 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:17.800
 down 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.569
 we rotate 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.039
 we fold again 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:25.999
 both from here 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:32.999
 that from this side 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:38.460
 now holding the below 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.889
 we lower 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:46.050
 this side 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:53.050
 we also lower this other side 

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:55.559
 this that 

00:06:55.559 --> 00:07:02.559
 is the tail 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:14.270
 and also our head that we are going to model to give shape 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.639
 and here is our swan 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:41.639
 It has been realized 

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:50.119
