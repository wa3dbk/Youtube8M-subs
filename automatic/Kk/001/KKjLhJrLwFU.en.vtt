00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
to be named obj wall and your player has

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.880 
to be named obj wall and your player has
to<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.340> named<00:00:44.520> obj<00:00:44.940> player<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.860> then<00:00:46.860> the

to be named obj player and then the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.770 
to be named obj player and then the
bullet<00:00:47.280> has<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.460> be<00:00:47.610> named<00:00:47.760> obj<00:00:48.239> underscore

enemy bullet so here image B equals zero

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.910 
enemy bullet so here image B equals zero
so<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.910> means<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.360> not<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:55.050> flashing

there's a tutorial by someone called the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.399 
there's a tutorial by someone called the
POG<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.310> think<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.420> look<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.869> find<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.259> but

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
POG I think you look you can find it but

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.020 
POG I think you look you can find it but
basically<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:49.979> take<00:01:50.220> your<00:01:50.460> sprite<00:01:50.790> and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
basically you just take your sprite and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.389 
basically you just take your sprite and
instead<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.450> having<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.840> right<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:53.130> go<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
instead of having just right you go to

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.789 
instead of having just right you go to
animation<00:01:54.770> rotate<00:01:55.770> rotate<00:01:56.759> clockwise<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:58.140> it

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
animation rotate rotate clockwise and it

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.410 
animation rotate rotate clockwise and it
basically<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.219> rotates<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.090> every

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
basically just rotates it in every

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.330 
basically just rotates it in every
single<00:02:00.630> degree<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.380> then<00:02:02.219> yeah

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
single degree and then yeah

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.370 
single degree and then yeah
and<00:02:03.729> then<00:02:03.880> it<00:02:03.970> does<00:02:04.180> something<00:02:04.810> like<00:02:04.960> that<00:02:05.140> oh

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
and then it does something like that oh

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.620 
and then it does something like that oh
yeah<00:02:06.220> another<00:02:06.369> thing<00:02:06.520> is<00:02:06.939> when<00:02:07.360> you<00:02:07.450> go<00:02:07.600> to

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
yeah another thing is when you go to

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.580 
yeah another thing is when you go to
hear<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.709> point<00:02:09.580> of<00:02:09.789> center<00:02:10.209> has<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.750> be<00:02:10.899> like

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
hear the point of center has to be like

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.729 
hear the point of center has to be like
on<00:02:11.770> top<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.130> his<00:02:12.250> head<00:02:12.540> or<00:02:13.540> something<00:02:14.440> or<00:02:14.680> were

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
on top of his head or something or were

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.150 
on top of his head or something or were
you<00:02:14.860> one<00:02:15.040> that's<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.400> pivot<00:02:15.730> point<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.780> turn

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
you one that's the pivot point to turn

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.740 
you one that's the pivot point to turn
another<00:02:18.160> thing<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:19.030> animation<00:02:19.569> and<00:02:19.690> you

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
another thing is in animation and you

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.540 
another thing is in animation and you
need<00:02:19.930> image<00:02:20.290> speed<00:02:20.530> equals<00:02:20.860> zero<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.190> he<00:02:21.280> stops

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
need image speed equals zero so he stops

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.210 
need image speed equals zero so he stops
shooting<00:02:21.790> after<00:02:22.090> he<00:02:22.420> shot<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:23.110> then<00:02:23.650> alarm

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
shooting after he shot and then alarm

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.839 
shooting after he shot and then alarm
zero

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
zero

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.229 
zero
he<00:02:25.630> goes<00:02:25.840> can<00:02:26.500> shoot<00:02:26.860> EKOS<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:28.060> that's

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
he goes can shoot EKOS so that's

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.309 
he goes can shoot EKOS so that's
basically<00:02:29.080> when<00:02:29.590> he<00:02:29.860> shoots<00:02:30.760> here<00:02:31.269> he<00:02:32.140> says

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
basically when he shoots here he says

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.509 
basically when he shoots here he says
can't<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.650> default<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.069> he's<00:02:33.250> not<00:02:33.340> like

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
can't you default so he's not like

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.130 
can't you default so he's not like
shooting<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.849> big<00:02:34.000> long<00:02:34.269> line<00:02:34.510> he's<00:02:34.870> actually

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
shooting a big long line he's actually

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.800 
shooting a big long line he's actually
shooting<00:02:35.319> reasonable<00:02:35.709> speed<00:02:36.269> yeah<00:02:37.299> so<00:02:37.630> here's

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
shooting reasonable speed yeah so here's

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.110 
shooting reasonable speed yeah so here's
alarm<00:02:38.110> zero<00:02:38.410> if<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:39.130> don't<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:39.519> a<00:02:39.549> one<00:02:39.790> zero

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
alarm zero if you don't have a one zero

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.370 
alarm zero if you don't have a one zero
you<00:02:40.420> can<00:02:40.540> change<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:40.900> whatever<00:02:41.049> you<00:02:41.260> want

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
you can change it to whatever you want

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.850 
you can change it to whatever you want
and<00:02:41.590> that's<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.220> pace<00:02:42.760> 10<00:02:43.209> is<00:02:43.390> okay<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:44.200> it's

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
and that's the pace 10 is okay so it's

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.979 
and that's the pace 10 is okay so it's
my<00:02:45.130> good<00:02:45.340> speed<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:45.940> then<00:02:46.480> down<00:02:46.660> here<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:46.959> just

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
my good speed and then down here is just

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.930 
my good speed and then down here is just
a<00:02:47.170> PHP<00:02:47.410> small<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:47.890> ones<00:02:48.069> destroy<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.640> then<00:02:48.790> you

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
a PHP small the ones destroy so then you

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.860 
a PHP small the ones destroy so then you
can<00:02:49.090> kill<00:02:49.299> it<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:51.459> yeah<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:51.819> think<00:02:51.880> that<00:02:52.090> about

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
can kill it so yeah I think that about

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.360 
can kill it so yeah I think that about
covers<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.440> we<00:02:53.560> can<00:02:53.680> test<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.250> can

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
covers that we can test it and I can

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:02.030 
covers that we can test it and I can
show<00:02:54.549> you<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.730> looks<00:02:54.880> like

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.039
