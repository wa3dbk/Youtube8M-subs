 Traveling through overheating has problems 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.660
 especially in the warm summer months, system crashes pile up 

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:12.569
 In such cases, liters almost always present a heat problem 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:15.569
 because if the outside temperatures rise it will of course also in the 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:17.599
 inside of her PC Wehrmacht 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.349
 because CPU video card or hard disk is too warm will install the system and 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.859
 Crashes are commonplace in this case they should be the temperature 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.859
 Check your CPU graphics card and hard drive 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:34.019
 all current MA discarded hard drives are of the one piece the from 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:37.329
 Analysis program Pippis belongs to can be read 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.040
 To read the values, you know the symbol Voltage Temperature and Fan 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.910
 the tool gives you an accurate temperature control for CPU times 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.820
 so far and hard disk as sporadic system crashes should make them so 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.660
 first check the temperature of your hardware 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.050
 From this temperature it becomes critical in the system the CPU temperature 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.880
 the truth sees the clock depends on the particular make 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.050
 For example, Intel CPUs tend to be luckier than Arm processors 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.980
 go 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.760
 on Schuberts its manufacturing manufacturers find they lost their process 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.170
 and values 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.120
 the hard disks temperature 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.850
 a temperature of 40 degrees is normal the animals hard disk however formerly 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.310
 50 degrees, they should install a barrel of Brent Crude 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.280
 the GPU temperatures 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.810
 Graphics cores in 2d mode, for example, that application as good as 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.990
 never and reach there often a temperature of 40 degrees he is at 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.200
 Use of elaborate 3d application increases the temperature 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.820
 Graphics others under full load around the 80 degrees hot some drove the hundred 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.470
 Degree 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.990
 At temperatures over 80 degrees, it is urgent customers to 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.940
 improve 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.810
 German Food and Roll Tour 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.290
 a drop in temperature from success of 30 to 40 degrees is normal 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.960
 even at a value of 50 degrees, there is no reason to worry 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.540
 Petersmann Seibert but who more than 50 degrees, the Zinstal wants the kindergarten 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.880
 Systems lead 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.430
 the temperature rises after the load of the system therefore they should 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.800
 Also check temperature when running a benchmark test 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.599
 or have an elaborate 3d applications use
