it<00:03:21.970> is<00:03:22.420> but<00:03:23.200> in<00:03:23.320> those<00:03:23.440> days<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.890> wasn't<00:03:24.070> really

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
it is but in those days it wasn't really

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.520 
it is but in those days it wasn't really
that<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:25.390> tough<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:25.930> think<00:03:26.200> there<00:03:26.290> were<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.380> lot

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
that that tough I think there were a lot

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.500 
that that tough I think there were a lot
of<00:03:26.560> people<00:03:26.800> because<00:03:27.430> they<00:03:27.580> didn't<00:03:27.850> play<00:03:28.000> 22

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
years you know 12 years with one teams

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.980 
years you know 12 years with one teams
it<00:03:30.970> was<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.120> pretty<00:03:31.330> good<00:03:31.510> run<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:32.680> was<00:03:33.870> maybe<00:03:34.870> I

it was a pretty good run I was maybe I

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.470 
it was a pretty good run I was maybe I
was<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.200> oddity<00:03:35.710> as<00:03:36.010> far<00:03:36.280> as<00:03:36.400> playing<00:03:37.240> that

middle<00:06:12.010> of<00:06:12.130> the<00:06:12.190> blade<00:06:12.810> while<00:06:13.810> I<00:06:13.870> was

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
middle of the blade while I was

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.590 
middle of the blade while I was
practicing<00:06:14.560> but<00:06:15.100> it<00:06:15.220> didn't<00:06:15.550> just<00:06:16.000> cracked<00:06:16.270> on

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
practicing but it didn't just cracked on

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.910 
practicing but it didn't just cracked on
the<00:06:16.720> background<00:06:17.170> it<00:06:17.260> didn't<00:06:17.470> break<00:06:17.620> all<00:06:17.830> the

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
the background it didn't break all the

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.310 
the background it didn't break all the
way<00:06:18.010> through<00:06:18.330> so<00:06:19.330> part<00:06:19.600> of<00:06:19.660> the<00:06:19.720> lamination

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
way through so part of the lamination

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.950 
way through so part of the lamination
was<00:06:20.470> cracked<00:06:20.740> anyway<00:06:21.640> it<00:06:21.970> stayed<00:06:22.210> in<00:06:22.330> an<00:06:22.600> event

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
was cracked anyway it stayed in an event

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.080 
was cracked anyway it stayed in an event
position<00:06:23.920> and<00:06:24.070> I<00:06:24.160> said<00:06:24.370> I've<00:06:24.700> only<00:06:24.880> got<00:06:25.060> one

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
position and I said I've only got one

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.730 
position and I said I've only got one
stick<00:06:25.450> up<00:06:25.660> here<00:06:25.870> we<00:06:25.990> got<00:06:26.170> about<00:06:26.350> fifteen

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
stick up here we got about fifteen

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.880 
stick up here we got about fifteen
minutes<00:06:26.890> of<00:06:27.130> practice<00:06:27.280> left<00:06:27.760> so<00:06:28.590> as<00:06:29.590> I<00:06:29.770> was

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890 
minutes of practice left so as I was

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.550 
minutes of practice left so as I was
leaving<00:06:30.250> the<00:06:30.280> ice<00:06:30.460> I<00:06:30.700> kind<00:06:31.690> of<00:06:31.810> I<00:06:32.050> saw<00:06:32.260> puck

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
leaving the ice I kind of I saw puck

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.990 
leaving the ice I kind of I saw puck
sitting<00:06:32.860> there<00:06:33.040> I<00:06:33.070> slammed<00:06:33.430> it<00:06:33.580> against<00:06:33.880> the

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
sitting there I slammed it against the

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.900 
sitting there I slammed it against the
board's<00:06:34.330> and<00:06:34.990> it<00:06:35.110> was<00:06:35.260> a<00:06:35.290> different<00:06:35.800> feel<00:06:36.040> I've

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
board's and it was a different feel I've

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.150 
board's and it was a different feel I've
ever<00:06:37.120> had<00:06:37.210> before<00:06:37.390> of<00:06:37.870> the<00:06:38.530> puck<00:06:38.710> leaving<00:06:39.040> the

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
ever had before of the puck leaving the

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.150 
ever had before of the puck leaving the
stick<00:06:39.430> and<00:06:40.090> the<00:06:40.840> six<00:06:41.230> still<00:06:41.440> didn't<00:06:41.710> break<00:06:41.770> so

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
stick and the six still didn't break so

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.460 
stick and the six still didn't break so
after<00:06:42.490> we<00:06:42.580> finished<00:06:42.910> practice<00:06:43.330> I<00:06:43.480> I<00:06:43.540> started

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
after we finished practice I I started

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.650 
after we finished practice I I started
thinking<00:06:44.950> about<00:06:45.070> it<00:06:45.340> and<00:06:45.730> eventually<00:06:46.330> started

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
thinking about it and eventually started

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.470 
thinking about it and eventually started
bending<00:06:46.840> the<00:06:47.080> sticks<00:06:47.320> myself<00:06:47.740> and<00:06:48.400> we<00:06:49.270> broke<00:06:49.450> a

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:49.480 
bending the sticks myself and we broke a

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.610 
bending the sticks myself and we broke a
fuel<00:06:50.160> in<00:06:51.160> that<00:06:51.730> in<00:06:52.090> the<00:06:52.290> transition<00:06:53.290> of<00:06:53.410> trying

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
fuel in that in the transition of trying

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.590 
fuel in that in the transition of trying
to<00:06:53.650> figure<00:06:53.860> out<00:06:54.040> how<00:06:54.190> to<00:06:54.250> do<00:06:54.460> this<00:06:54.610> eventually

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
to figure out how to do this eventually

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.650 
to figure out how to do this eventually
we<00:06:56.590> learn<00:06:57.100> how<00:06:57.280> to<00:06:57.310> do<00:06:57.520> it<00:06:57.640> and<00:06:58.000> of<00:06:58.330> course<00:06:58.360> they

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:58.660 
we learn how to do it and of course they

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.710 
we learn how to do it and of course they
make<00:06:58.840> them<00:06:59.020> out<00:06:59.140> of<00:06:59.200> that<00:06:59.350> way<00:06:59.470> no<00:07:03.540> Stan<00:07:04.540> we

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 
make them out of that way no Stan we

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.390 
make them out of that way no Stan we
don't<00:07:04.870> all<00:07:04.960> get<00:07:05.080> a<00:07:05.140> chance<00:07:05.200> to<00:07:05.590> to<00:07:06.070> write<00:07:06.250> our

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 
I try to live that philosophy and

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.320 
I try to live that philosophy and
hopefully<00:07:33.730> I've<00:07:33.850> lived<00:07:34.030> it

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:34.330 
hopefully I've lived it
