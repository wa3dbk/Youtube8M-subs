00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
business then yeah I developed a

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.640 
business then yeah I developed a
protocol<00:00:14.509> using<00:00:15.509> me<00:00:15.719> it's<00:00:15.960> called<00:00:16.199> Himalayan

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
protocol using me it's called Himalayan

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.019 
protocol using me it's called Himalayan
salt<00:00:16.920> stem<00:00:17.220> cells<00:00:17.580> okay<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.840> uses<00:00:19.080> these

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
salt stem cells okay and it uses these

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.060 
salt stem cells okay and it uses these
these<00:00:21.029> are<00:00:21.210> stone<00:00:21.779> massage<00:00:22.410> stones<00:00:22.800> they're

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
these are stone massage stones they're

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.660 
these are stone massage stones they're
it's<00:00:23.279> all<00:00:23.430> salt<00:00:23.760> hand<00:00:24.630> carved<00:00:25.050> from<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.800> salt

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
it's all salt hand carved from the salt

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.099 
it's all salt hand carved from the salt
that<00:00:27.090> comes<00:00:27.150> from<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> Himalayas<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:29.029> I

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
that comes from the Himalayas and I

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.660 
that comes from the Himalayas and I
created<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.230> protocol<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:34.370> supports<00:00:35.370> and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
created a protocol that supports and

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.959 
created a protocol that supports and
nourishes<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.600> central<00:00:37.050> nervous<00:00:37.140> system

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
nourishes the central nervous system

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.880 
nourishes the central nervous system
what<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.000> found<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:39.660> these<00:00:40.140> massage<00:00:40.620> those

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
what I found with these massage those

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.830 
what I found with these massage those
with<00:00:41.340> salt<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.820> general<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> very

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
with salt in general is that is a very

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.170 
with salt in general is that is a very
strong<00:00:43.170> profound<00:00:43.590> impact<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> meridians

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
strong profound impact on the meridians

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.840 
strong profound impact on the meridians
and<00:00:45.390> reflex<00:00:46.050> points<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.440> our<00:00:46.590> body<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.610> this

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
and reflex points of our body so this

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.810 
and reflex points of our body so this
protocol<00:00:48.360> integrates<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:50.219> thermal<00:00:50.610> therapy

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
protocol integrates the thermal therapy

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.869 
protocol integrates the thermal therapy
we<00:00:51.539> don't<00:00:51.690> keep<00:00:51.899> them<00:00:52.140> but<00:00:53.070> they<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.340> get<00:00:53.610> worn

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
we don't keep them but they do get worn

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.540 
we don't keep them but they do get worn
open<00:00:54.449> integrates<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.350> thermal<00:00:55.710> therapy<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
open integrates the thermal therapy and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.479 
open integrates the thermal therapy and
Chinese<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.480> Koreans<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.680> reflex<00:00:59.190> points

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
Chinese and Koreans and reflex points

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.099 
Chinese and Koreans and reflex points
and<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.270> actually<00:01:00.420> massage<00:01:00.809> what

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
and so you can actually massage what

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.000 
and so you can actually massage what
those<00:01:01.260> are<00:01:01.500> what<00:01:03.049> it<00:01:04.049> really<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.470> feels<00:01:04.650> great

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
those are what it really it feels great

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.270 
those are what it really it feels great
oh<00:01:05.900> it<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.049> smooth<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.500> stuff<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
oh it is smooth and stuff like that and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.100 
oh it is smooth and stuff like that and
you<00:01:08.400> think<00:01:08.430> salt<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.150> because<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.689> hard<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
you think salt is because it be hard and

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.500 
you think salt is because it be hard and
stuff<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:10.740> yeah<00:01:11.520> yeah<00:01:12.150> no<00:01:12.330> these

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
stuff like that but yeah yeah no these

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.929 
stuff like that but yeah yeah no these
are<00:01:12.659> well<00:01:12.810> these<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:13.520> rounded<00:01:14.520> off<00:01:14.640> actually

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
are well these are rounded off actually

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.580 
are well these are rounded off actually
this<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.479> could<00:01:15.630> use<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> little<00:01:16.049> standing<00:01:16.470> on

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
this one could use a little standing on

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.080 
this one could use a little standing on
the<00:01:16.680> sides<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.159> little<00:01:17.189> bit<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.759> that's<00:01:17.909> what

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the sides a little bit and that's what

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.929 
the sides a little bit and that's what
we<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.390> if<00:01:19.080> they<00:01:19.290> get<00:01:19.500> rough<00:01:19.740> especially<00:01:20.520> here

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
we do if they get rough especially here

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.850 
we do if they get rough especially here
in<00:01:20.970> Florida<00:01:21.060> cuz<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> lot<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.560> humidity

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
in Florida cuz we have a lot of humidity

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.649 
in Florida cuz we have a lot of humidity
yeah<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.700> sometimes<00:01:23.939> they'll<00:01:24.330> get<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> little

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
yeah so sometimes they'll get a little

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.280 
yeah so sometimes they'll get a little
rough<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.530> sanded<00:01:25.710> oh<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.220> said<00:01:27.290> just

I have stones I've been using for like

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.480 
I have stones I've been using for like
seven<00:01:33.590> eight<00:01:33.650> I've<00:01:33.800> been<00:01:33.950> doing<00:01:34.159> this<00:01:34.250> about

nothing<00:02:02.540> really<00:02:02.690> can<00:02:02.960> live<00:02:03.110> on<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:03.380> anyway

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
nothing really can live on it anyway

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.300 
nothing really can live on it anyway
I<00:02:03.969> still<00:02:04.719> recommend<00:02:04.990> wiping<00:02:05.679> them<00:02:05.829> in<00:02:06.219> between

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
I still recommend wiping them in between

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.100 
I still recommend wiping them in between
and<00:02:07.760> at<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.000> end<00:02:08.119> of<00:02:08.180> the<00:02:08.300> day<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.540> can<00:02:08.899> put

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
and at the end of the day you can put

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.290 
and at the end of the day you can put
them<00:02:09.290> in<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.530> bowl<00:02:09.770> of<00:02:09.830> water<00:02:10.280> like<00:02:11.030> white

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
them in a bowl of water like white

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.700 
them in a bowl of water like white
vinegar<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:12.250> oils<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.990> then<00:02:15.140> wipe<00:02:15.410> them<00:02:15.590> off

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
vinegar and oils and then wipe them off

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.550 
vinegar and oils and then wipe them off
immediately<00:02:16.150> put<00:02:17.150> them<00:02:17.240> back<00:02:17.360> on<00:02:17.420> dry<00:02:18.290> heat

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
immediately put them back on dry heat

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.860 
immediately put them back on dry heat
chips<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.220> then<00:02:19.760> they'll<00:02:20.240> last<00:02:20.450> indefinitely

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
chips and then they'll last indefinitely

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.350 
chips and then they'll last indefinitely
that<00:02:21.710> way<00:02:21.920> but<00:02:22.250> they<00:02:22.340> won't<00:02:22.580> disintegrate<00:02:22.850> or

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
that way but they won't disintegrate or

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.870 
that way but they won't disintegrate or
anything<00:02:23.540> else<00:02:23.810> latest<00:02:24.440> in<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.620> great<00:02:24.800> part<00:02:25.070> so

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
I like to heat him up that way because

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.979 
I like to heat him up that way because
it<00:03:41.340> keeps<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.760> energy<00:03:41.879> pure<00:03:42.359> we<00:03:42.540> heat<00:03:42.719> them<00:03:42.810> up

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
it keeps the energy pure we heat them up

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.679 
it keeps the energy pure we heat them up
against<00:03:43.349> a<00:03:43.560> slab<00:03:44.430> of<00:03:44.459> salt<00:03:44.879> and<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.480> salt

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
against a slab of salt and the salt

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.080 
against a slab of salt and the salt
conducts<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.739> heat<00:03:46.769> all<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.189> way<00:03:47.280> across<00:03:47.549> and

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
conducts the heat all the way across and

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.569 
conducts the heat all the way across and
then<00:03:48.349> we<00:03:49.349> place<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.739> stones<00:03:49.980> on<00:03:50.159> top<00:03:50.189> of<00:03:50.459> that

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
then we place the stones on top of that
