first<00:00:16.170> effort<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:16.830> we're<00:00:16.920> going<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.070> unbox<00:00:17.220> it

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
first effort so we're going to unbox it

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.410 
first effort so we're going to unbox it
and<00:00:17.730> see<00:00:18.300> how<00:00:18.480> they<00:00:18.630> did<00:00:18.810> with<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.080> unit<00:00:20.420> for

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
and see how they did with this unit for

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.090 
and see how they did with this unit for
those<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.779> aren't<00:00:22.020> familiar<00:00:22.140> with<00:00:22.949> the

Wireless<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.500> here<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.860> actual<00:00:47.219> unit<00:00:48.680> it's

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
Wireless so here is the actual unit it's

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.119 
Wireless so here is the actual unit it's
it's<00:00:50.789> definitely<00:00:51.239> small<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.559> very

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
it's definitely small this is the very

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.279 
it's definitely small this is the very
first<00:00:53.340> time<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.579> actually<00:00:54.329> take<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> look<00:00:55.020> at<00:00:55.170> it

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
first time I actually take a look at it

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.410 
first time I actually take a look at it
of<00:00:55.410> course<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.920> these<00:00:56.160> are<00:00:56.399> my<00:00:56.610> genuine<00:00:57.030> first

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
of course so these are my genuine first

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.840 
of course so these are my genuine first
impressions<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.260> guess<00:00:58.379> I'll<00:00:58.530> turn<00:00:58.649> it

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
impressions and I guess I'll turn it

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.200 
impressions and I guess I'll turn it
right-side<00:00:59.850> up<00:01:00.590> interesting<00:01:02.120> definitely<00:01:03.120> got

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
right-side up interesting definitely got

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.850 
right-side up interesting definitely got
a<00:01:03.239> nice<00:01:03.390> size<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.260> feels<00:01:04.439> quite<00:01:04.589> light

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
a nice size to it it feels quite light

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.190 
a nice size to it it feels quite light
at<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.040> moment<00:01:05.070> but<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.700> large<00:01:06.479> chunk<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.080> of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
at the moment but this large chunk is of

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.780 
at the moment but this large chunk is of
course<00:01:07.439> where<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> battery<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.310> probably

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
course where the battery is probably

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.120 
course where the battery is probably
going<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.320> we'll<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.590> set<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.979> aside

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
going to go so we'll just set that aside

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.580 
going to go so we'll just set that aside
for<00:01:11.340> right<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.150> see<00:01:12.299> what<00:01:12.420> else<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.810> in

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
for right now and see what else is in

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:26.960 
for right now and see what else is in
the<00:01:14.040> box<00:01:23.900> little<00:01:24.900> box<00:01:25.140> here<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.520> bit<00:01:26.880> of

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the box little box here this is a bit of

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.880 
the box little box here this is a bit of
a<00:01:27.030> chaotic<00:01:27.330> unboxing<00:01:28.049> because<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.740> is

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
a chaotic unboxing because this is

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.530 
a chaotic unboxing because this is
probably<00:01:29.159> one<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> larger<00:01:30.119> things<00:01:30.360> I've

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
probably one of the larger things I've

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.170 
probably one of the larger things I've
actually<00:01:30.720> unboxed<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.640> here<00:01:32.939> is

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
actually unboxed so what we have here is

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.940 
actually unboxed so what we have here is
the<00:01:33.840> battery<00:01:34.049> take<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> quick<00:01:35.479> peek<00:01:36.479> at<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.950> so

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
the battery take a quick peek at that so

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.350 
the battery take a quick peek at that so
it<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:39.890> let<00:01:40.890> me<00:01:40.950> see<00:01:41.040> here<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> four<00:01:41.820> thousand

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it is a let me see here a four thousand

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.789 
it is a let me see here a four thousand
milliamp<00:01:42.630> battery<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.470> actually<00:01:43.770> a

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
milliamp battery so it's actually a

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.359 
milliamp battery so it's actually a
fairly<00:01:44.070> sizable<00:01:44.670> battery<00:01:45.590> for<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.979> mobile

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
fairly sizable battery for a mobile

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.819 
fairly sizable battery for a mobile
device<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:48.060> even<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.479> laptop<00:01:48.689> I've<00:01:49.170> had<00:01:49.409> some

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
device or even a laptop I've had some

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.710 
device or even a laptop I've had some
laptops<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.399> aren't<00:01:50.790> uh<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.450> aren't<00:01:51.689> that

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
laptops that aren't uh that aren't that

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.530 
laptops that aren't uh that aren't that
that<00:01:52.439> big<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.770> terms<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.130> battery<00:01:53.280> capacity<00:01:53.579> so

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
that big in terms of battery capacity so

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.200 
that big in terms of battery capacity so
this<00:01:54.930> should<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.200> sort<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.740> snap<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.310> here

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
this should just sort of snap on here

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.929 
this should just sort of snap on here
I'm<00:01:58.130> assuming<00:01:59.130> unless<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.579> course<00:01:59.640> I'm

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
I'm assuming unless of course I'm

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.090 
I'm assuming unless of course I'm
getting<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.469> getting<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.649> wrong<00:02:03.920> this<00:02:04.920> is

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
getting it getting it wrong this is

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.760 
getting it getting it wrong this is
definitely<00:02:05.399> an<00:02:05.610> interesting<00:02:06.770> interesting

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
definitely an interesting interesting

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.800 
definitely an interesting interesting
approach<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.239> battery<00:02:09.629> it

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
approach to the to the battery it

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.500 
approach to the to the battery it
doesn't<00:02:10.080> seem<00:02:10.259> like<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.619> really<00:02:11.270> very<00:02:12.270> easy

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
doesn't seem like it's really very easy

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.070 
doesn't seem like it's really very easy
to<00:02:12.690> get

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
to get

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.540 
to get
so<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.260> might<00:02:13.470> actually<00:02:13.650> have<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:13.950> explore<00:02:14.490> that

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
so I might actually have to explore that

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.670 
so I might actually have to explore that
a<00:02:15.030> little<00:02:15.300> bit<00:02:15.630> later<00:02:15.870> let<00:02:16.140> me<00:02:16.230> just<00:02:16.350> try<00:02:16.440> one

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
a little bit later let me just try one

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.950 
a little bit later let me just try one
more<00:02:16.830> time<00:02:17.130> here<00:02:20.120> well<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.180> don't<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.630> don't<00:02:21.690> want

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
more time here well I don't I don't want

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.330 
more time here well I don't I don't want
to<00:02:22.020> force<00:02:22.260> anything<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.920> certainly<00:02:23.070> don't

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
to force anything and I certainly don't

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.190 
to force anything and I certainly don't
want<00:02:23.520> break<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:24.000> device<00:02:24.450> because<00:02:24.810> it's<00:02:25.110> all

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
want break this device because it's all

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.470 
want break this device because it's all
alone<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.620> me<00:02:25.740> from<00:02:25.950> Microsoft<00:02:26.460> so<00:02:26.670> we<00:02:27.330> will

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
alone to me from Microsoft so we will

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.210 
alone to me from Microsoft so we will
just<00:02:27.660> set<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.020> aside<00:02:28.080> for<00:02:28.440> now<00:02:29.330> we<00:02:30.330> have<00:02:31.220> an

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
just set that aside for now we have an

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.930 
just set that aside for now we have an
AC<00:02:32.840> power<00:02:33.840> adapter<00:02:34.170> here<00:02:34.890> along<00:02:35.640> with<00:02:35.850> the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
AC power adapter here along with the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.780 
AC power adapter here along with the
cable<00:02:36.450> now<00:02:37.140> one<00:02:37.530> thing<00:02:37.710> I'll<00:02:37.920> I'll<00:02:38.310> definitely

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
cable now one thing I'll I'll definitely

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.240 
cable now one thing I'll I'll definitely
say<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:40.020> doesn't<00:02:40.350> impress<00:02:40.560> me<00:02:40.620> right<00:02:41.040> off

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
say that it doesn't impress me right off

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.490 
say that it doesn't impress me right off
the<00:02:41.460> bat<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.240> it's<00:02:42.630> always<00:02:42.900> such<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.080> shame

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
the bat is that it's always such a shame

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.290 
the bat is that it's always such a shame
you<00:02:43.770> know<00:02:43.830> when<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.190> have<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.700> device<00:02:45.240> that's

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
you know when you have a device that's

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.570 
you know when you have a device that's
designed<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.990> be<00:02:46.110> extremely<00:02:46.580> portable

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
designed to be extremely portable

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.550 
designed to be extremely portable
extremely<00:02:48.240> mobile<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.750> then<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.230> end<00:02:49.380> up

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
extremely mobile and then you end up

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.100 
extremely mobile and then you end up
with<00:02:49.740> a<00:02:49.770> big<00:02:50.040> clunky<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:51.120> know<00:02:51.270> power

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
with a big clunky you know power

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.960 
with a big clunky you know power
recharger<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.190> this<00:02:53.490> is<00:02:53.640> something<00:02:53.940> that

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
recharger that this is something that

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.660 
recharger that this is something that
you'd<00:02:54.150> expect<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.540> see<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:55.320> know<00:02:55.440> with<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.740> 15

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
you'd expect to see you know with a 15

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.670 
you'd expect to see you know with a 15
inch<00:02:56.880> notebook<00:02:57.600> not<00:02:58.020> something<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.530> you

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
inch notebook not something that you

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.320 
inch notebook not something that you
would<00:02:58.800> expect<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.220> see<00:02:59.340> with<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.670> highly<00:03:00.150> mobile

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.449 
would expect to see with a highly mobile
device<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:01.080> definitely<00:03:01.500> think<00:03:01.800> Samsung<00:03:02.310> should

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
device I definitely think Samsung should

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.770 
device I definitely think Samsung should
have<00:03:02.580> put<00:03:02.730> some<00:03:02.880> more<00:03:03.000> effort<00:03:03.150> into<00:03:03.510> making

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
have put some more effort into making

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.000 
have put some more effort into making
this<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:05.360> just<00:03:06.360> simply<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.990> smaller<00:03:07.680> power

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
this a just simply a smaller power

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.100 
this a just simply a smaller power
supply<00:03:08.490> and<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.150> looks<00:03:09.300> like<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.630> connector

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
supply and it looks like the connector

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.010 
supply and it looks like the connector
is<00:03:10.610> well<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.700> looks<00:03:11.880> relatively<00:03:12.450> standard<00:03:12.870> but

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
is well it looks relatively standard but

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.060 
is well it looks relatively standard but
of<00:03:13.110> course<00:03:13.320> this<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.620> probably<00:03:13.860> gonna<00:03:13.980> be

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
of course this is probably gonna be

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.350 
of course this is probably gonna be
something<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.580> only<00:03:14.640> works<00:03:15.000> with<00:03:15.209> this

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
something that only works with this

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.540 
something that only works with this
device<00:03:15.750> because<00:03:16.020> that's<00:03:16.200> what<00:03:16.550> these

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
device because that's what these

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.400 
device because that's what these
manufacturers<00:03:18.300> tended<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.050> do<00:03:19.200> unfortunately

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
manufacturers tended to do unfortunately

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.150 
manufacturers tended to do unfortunately
we<00:03:20.340> have<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.690> brief<00:03:21.690> guide<00:03:22.080> here<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.010> looks

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
we have a brief guide here and it looks

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.420 
we have a brief guide here and it looks
like<00:03:23.340> we<00:03:23.489> have<00:03:23.640> some<00:03:23.850> software<00:03:24.800> media<00:03:25.800> and<00:03:26.250> a

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
like we have some software media and a

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.940 
like we have some software media and a
system<00:03:26.820> recovery<00:03:27.420> disk<00:03:27.720> now<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.410> unit<00:03:28.769> does

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
system recovery disk now this unit does

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.509 
system recovery disk now this unit does
actually<00:03:29.459> run<00:03:29.730> Windows<00:03:30.510> Vista<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:31.340> can<00:03:32.340> see

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
actually run Windows Vista you can see

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.460 
actually run Windows Vista you can see
there<00:03:32.700> there's<00:03:32.910> actually<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.300> little<00:03:33.540> Windows

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
there there's actually a little Windows

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.740 
there there's actually a little Windows
Vista<00:03:34.700> logo<00:03:35.700> now<00:03:35.880> it<00:03:36.000> just<00:03:36.150> as<00:03:36.269> Windows<00:03:36.570> Vista

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
Vista logo now it just as Windows Vista

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.449 
Vista logo now it just as Windows Vista
on<00:03:36.989> it<00:03:37.140> it<00:03:37.320> doesn't<00:03:37.590> actually<00:03:37.650> say<00:03:37.860> certified

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
on it it doesn't actually say certified

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.520 
on it it doesn't actually say certified
for<00:03:38.670> Vista<00:03:39.030> so<00:03:39.570> I'm<00:03:39.660> not<00:03:39.810> entirely<00:03:40.110> sure<00:03:40.320> what

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
for Vista so I'm not entirely sure what

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.370 
for Vista so I'm not entirely sure what
the<00:03:40.680> implications<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.519> that<00:03:41.790> are<00:03:42.300> although<00:03:42.900> I

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
the implications of that are although I

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.350 
the implications of that are although I
have<00:03:43.620> been<00:03:43.650> told<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.250> this<00:03:44.400> particular<00:03:44.970> unit

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
have been told that this particular unit

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.870 
have been told that this particular unit
will<00:03:45.510> actually<00:03:45.930> run<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.470> full<00:03:47.160> version<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.640> Aero

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
will actually run a full version of Aero

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.479 
will actually run a full version of Aero
so<00:03:48.180> that's<00:03:48.360> always<00:03:48.570> interesting<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.170> know<00:03:49.489> in

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
so that's always interesting to know in

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.910 
so that's always interesting to know in
terms<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.150> hardware<00:03:51.720> looks<00:03:52.350> like<00:03:52.560> we<00:03:52.709> have

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
terms of the hardware looks like we have

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.330 
terms of the hardware looks like we have
a<00:03:52.950> USB<00:03:53.910> port<00:03:54.120> up<00:03:54.750> top<00:03:55.080> here<00:03:55.350> we<00:03:56.190> have<00:03:56.220> a

a USB port up top here we have a

a USB port up top here we have a

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
headphone jack there is I believe a

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.370 
headphone jack there is I believe a

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
mistake and I'm not 100% sure it's not

we have a hardware menu button on the
side<00:04:10.620> here<00:04:10.920> we<00:04:10.950> have<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.820> keyboard<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:13.260> basic

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
interface left and right I'm assuming

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.570 
interface left and right I'm assuming
this<00:04:16.410> is<00:04:16.560> gonna<00:04:16.709> be<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.830> left<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.130> right<00:04:17.310> mouse

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
this is gonna be a left and right mouse

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.300 
this is gonna be a left and right mouse

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
clicks down at the bottom here we

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.969 
clicks down at the bottom here we
actually<00:04:20.640> have<00:04:20.790> a<00:04:20.820> headphone<00:04:21.630> jack<00:04:21.690> I'm<00:04:22.650> sorry

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
actually have a headphone jack I'm sorry

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.490 
actually have a headphone jack I'm sorry
a<00:04:23.130> microphone<00:04:23.669> input<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:24.450> I<00:04:24.690> believe<00:04:25.260> I'm

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
a microphone input and I believe I'm

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.290 
a microphone input and I believe I'm
seeing<00:04:25.740> too

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
seeing too

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.809 
seeing too
here<00:04:26.539> so<00:04:26.720> it's<00:04:26.870> probably<00:04:27.139> going<00:04:27.349> to<00:04:27.409> be<00:04:27.819> you

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:28.819 
here so it's probably going to be you

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:30.969 
here so it's probably going to be you
know<00:04:28.909> multiple<00:04:29.330> multiple<00:04:29.930> inputs<00:04:30.440> for<00:04:30.680> echo

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
know multiple multiple inputs for echo

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.119 
know multiple multiple inputs for echo
cancellation<00:04:31.960> down<00:04:32.960> at<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.199> bottom<00:04:33.409> here<00:04:33.979> I

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:34.129 
cancellation down at the bottom here I

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:36.369 
cancellation down at the bottom here I
have<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:34.659> stylist<00:04:35.659> that's<00:04:35.960> a<00:04:36.050> little<00:04:36.259> bit

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:36.379 
have a stylist that's a little bit

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.649 
have a stylist that's a little bit
difficult<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.860> get<00:04:37.039> out<00:04:37.190> so<00:04:37.550> this<00:04:38.150> is<00:04:38.270> actually

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:38.659 
difficult to get out so this is actually

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:40.719 
difficult to get out so this is actually
I<00:04:38.930> guess<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.560> touchscreen<00:04:40.159> device<00:04:40.430> that'll

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
I guess a touchscreen device that'll

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:41.890 
I guess a touchscreen device that'll
that'll<00:04:40.909> show<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.240> how<00:04:41.449> little<00:04:41.629> I<00:04:41.870> actually

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
that'll show you how little I actually

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.200 
that'll show you how little I actually
knew<00:04:42.319> about<00:04:42.349> it<00:04:42.650> when<00:04:42.740> I<00:04:42.770> first<00:04:43.039> unboxed<00:04:43.789> it<00:04:43.940> I

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
knew about it when I first unboxed it I

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.510 
knew about it when I first unboxed it I
did<00:04:44.780> not<00:04:44.930> actually<00:04:45.139> realize<00:04:45.680> that<00:04:45.919> it<00:04:46.039> had<00:04:46.250> a

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
did not actually realize that it had a

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.040 
did not actually realize that it had a
touchscreen<00:04:47.270> I<00:04:47.449> thought<00:04:47.659> that<00:04:47.840> it<00:04:47.960> was

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
touchscreen I thought that it was

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.770 
touchscreen I thought that it was
actually<00:04:48.199> all<00:04:48.620> driven<00:04:48.919> by<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:50.330> keyboard

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
actually all driven by the keyboard

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.100 
actually all driven by the keyboard
input<00:04:51.050> here<00:04:51.530> um<00:04:51.949> just<00:04:52.039> as<00:04:52.699> a<00:04:52.729> way<00:04:52.940> in<00:04:53.780> terms<00:04:53.930> of

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
input here um just as a way in terms of

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.510 
input here um just as a way in terms of
a<00:04:54.169> background<00:04:54.560> I've<00:04:54.710> always<00:04:54.919> been<00:04:55.069> interested

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
a background I've always been interested

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.909 
a background I've always been interested
in<00:04:55.610> um<00:04:55.849> pcs<00:04:56.240> but<00:04:56.419> the<00:04:56.539> price<00:04:56.780> point<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.289> these

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
in um pcs but the price point and these

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.770 
in um pcs but the price point and these
sort<00:04:58.159> of<00:04:58.220> battery<00:04:58.639> life<00:04:58.849> just<00:04:59.180> never<00:04:59.449> really

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
sort of battery life just never really

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.480 
sort of battery life just never really
appealed<00:05:00.050> to<00:05:00.229> me<00:05:00.319> so<00:05:00.590> I<00:05:00.620> sort<00:05:00.979> of<00:05:01.129> would<00:05:01.340> always

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
appealed to me so I sort of would always

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.890 
appealed to me so I sort of would always
take<00:05:01.759> a<00:05:01.789> look<00:05:02.030> at<00:05:02.180> them<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.479> then<00:05:02.599> kind<00:05:02.840> of

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
take a look at them and then kind of

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.629 
take a look at them and then kind of
skip<00:05:03.289> over<00:05:03.500> and<00:05:03.830> think<00:05:04.069> well<00:05:04.250> I'll<00:05:04.400> try<00:05:04.520> the

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
skip over and think well I'll try the

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.520 
skip over and think well I'll try the
next<00:05:04.819> generation<00:05:05.419> so<00:05:05.599> I<00:05:05.840> was<00:05:06.169> really

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
next generation so I was really

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.379 
next generation so I was really
intrigued<00:05:06.949> when<00:05:07.129> Microsoft<00:05:08.000> offered<00:05:08.300> just

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
intrigued when Microsoft offered just

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.209 
intrigued when Microsoft offered just
sent<00:05:08.599> me<00:05:08.659> this<00:05:08.780> unit<00:05:09.169> to<00:05:09.620> take<00:05:09.770> a<00:05:09.800> look<00:05:10.069> at

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:10.219 
sent me this unit to take a look at

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:11.559 
sent me this unit to take a look at
because<00:05:10.550> I<00:05:10.580> wanted<00:05:10.909> to<00:05:11.030> actually<00:05:11.180> get<00:05:11.449> some

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569 
because I wanted to actually get some

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:14.559 
because I wanted to actually get some
hands-on<00:05:11.930> time<00:05:12.259> with<00:05:12.620> it<00:05:12.849> over<00:05:13.849> on<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:14.090> side

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:19.719 
here we have a power button and a whole
button<00:05:17.330> so<00:05:17.569> when<00:05:17.719> the<00:05:18.219> power<00:05:19.219> button<00:05:19.490> is<00:05:19.550> put

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
oh there we go

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.230 
oh there we go
so<00:05:51.139> as<00:05:51.229> you<00:05:51.349> can<00:05:51.469> see<00:05:51.529> the<00:05:52.520> stand<00:05:52.819> actually

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
so as you can see the stand actually

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.719 
so as you can see the stand actually
just<00:05:53.419> extends<00:05:53.990> out<00:05:54.110> the<00:05:54.259> back<00:05:54.469> and<00:05:54.770> then<00:05:55.279> you

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
just extends out the back and then you

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.820 
just extends out the back and then you
can<00:05:55.940> of<00:05:56.090> course<00:05:56.360> set<00:05:56.750> the<00:05:56.870> device<00:05:57.199> down<00:05:57.529> and

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
can of course set the device down and

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.249 
can of course set the device down and
use<00:05:58.580> it<00:05:58.759> for<00:05:59.419> watching<00:05:59.750> videos<00:06:00.080> or

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:00.259 
use it for watching videos or

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:01.629 
use it for watching videos or
interacting<00:06:00.889> with<00:06:00.919> it<00:06:01.159> that's<00:06:01.370> actually<00:06:01.460> a

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
interacting with it that's actually a

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.869 
interacting with it that's actually a
pretty<00:06:01.819> good<00:06:02.000> angle<00:06:02.539> for<00:06:03.190> the<00:06:04.190> screen<00:06:04.639> to<00:06:04.759> be

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:04.879 
pretty good angle for the screen to be

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:07.869 
pretty good angle for the screen to be

second<00:06:28.200> huh<00:06:29.280> interesting

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
second huh interesting

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.430 
second huh interesting
well<00:06:31.000> the<00:06:31.510> battery<00:06:31.780> looks<00:06:31.930> like<00:06:32.110> it's<00:06:32.290> on

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
well the battery looks like it's on

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.890 
well the battery looks like it's on
there<00:06:32.710> it<00:06:33.400> looks<00:06:33.700> like<00:06:33.940> it<00:06:34.090> is<00:06:34.300> completely

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
there it looks like it is completely

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.960 
there it looks like it is completely
flush<00:06:35.530> it's<00:06:36.130> interesting<00:06:36.370> though<00:06:36.700> there<00:06:36.850> was

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
flush it's interesting though there was

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.450 
flush it's interesting though there was
no<00:06:37.090> sort<00:06:37.300> of<00:06:37.390> satisfying<00:06:38.110> click<00:06:38.590> to<00:06:39.190> put<00:06:39.370> the

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
no sort of satisfying click to put the

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.980 
no sort of satisfying click to put the
battery<00:06:39.820> on<00:06:40.000> so<00:06:40.180> that's<00:06:40.330> why<00:06:40.450> I<00:06:40.480> wasn't<00:06:40.690> sure

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
battery on so that's why I wasn't sure

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.450 
battery on so that's why I wasn't sure
if<00:06:41.110> that<00:06:41.260> was<00:06:41.410> actually<00:06:41.590> what<00:06:41.980> it<00:06:42.100> was<00:06:42.220> I<00:06:42.340> was

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
if that was actually what it was I was

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.850 
if that was actually what it was I was
supposed<00:06:42.550> to<00:06:42.760> be<00:06:42.880> doing<00:06:43.030> uh<00:06:43.710> Samsung<00:06:44.710> might

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
supposed to be doing uh Samsung might

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.200 
supposed to be doing uh Samsung might
want<00:06:45.040> to<00:06:45.070> work<00:06:45.220> on<00:06:45.400> that<00:06:45.520> design<00:06:45.820> a<00:06:45.850> little<00:06:46.060> bit

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
want to work on that design a little bit

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.580 
want to work on that design a little bit
but<00:06:46.480> at<00:06:46.600> any<00:06:46.750> rate<00:06:46.810> looks<00:06:47.110> like<00:06:47.260> it<00:06:47.380> works

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
but at any rate looks like it works

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
but at any rate looks like it works
pretty<00:06:48.040> well<00:06:48.390> so<00:06:49.390> that<00:06:49.600> is<00:06:49.780> the<00:06:49.960> unboxing<00:06:50.610> and
