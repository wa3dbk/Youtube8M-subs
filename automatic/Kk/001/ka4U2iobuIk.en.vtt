00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
what's up you do is an art in here when

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.920 
what's up you do is an art in here when
I<00:00:04.740> did<00:00:05.009> you<00:00:05.160> two<00:00:05.370> was<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.609> good<00:00:06.000> reside<00:00:06.480> yes<00:00:06.750> I

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
I did you two was a good reside yes I

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.150 
I did you two was a good reside yes I
know<00:00:06.990> he<00:00:07.350> didn't<00:00:07.500> want<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.710> mention<00:00:07.859> his<00:00:08.130> name

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
know he didn't want to mention his name

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.480 
know he didn't want to mention his name
here<00:00:09.019> look<00:00:10.019> back<00:00:10.260> here<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:10.710> some<00:00:10.980> data<00:00:11.219> and

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
here look back here on some data and

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.430 
here look back here on some data and
found<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.150> happened<00:00:12.690> again<00:00:12.929> in<00:00:13.200> two

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
found that it happened again in two

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.160 
found that it happened again in two
thousand<00:00:13.980> seven<00:00:14.160> or<00:00:14.519> before<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:15.330> august<00:00:15.870> two

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
thousand seven or before in august two

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.400 
thousand seven or before in august two
thousand<00:00:16.650> seven<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.100> same<00:00:17.340> thing<00:00:17.699> shows<00:00:18.029> up

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
thousand seven the same thing shows up

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.960 
thousand seven the same thing shows up
and<00:00:19.670> the<00:00:20.670> ceiling<00:00:21.060> will<00:00:21.240> do<00:00:21.420> little<00:00:21.570> faster

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
and the ceiling will do little faster

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.640 
and the ceiling will do little faster
you<00:00:23.970> can<00:00:24.150> see<00:00:24.390> there's<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.750> lens<00:00:26.630> reflection

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
you can see there's a lens reflection

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.640 
you can see there's a lens reflection
follows<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.920> could<00:00:29.220> proceed<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:30.650> triangle

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
follows that could proceed that triangle

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.459 
follows that could proceed that triangle

the lens of the telescope or behind the
glass<00:01:05.040> cover<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.700> covers<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.119> whole<00:01:06.330> fine<00:01:06.750> you

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
glass cover that covers a whole fine you

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.460 
glass cover that covers a whole fine you
know<00:01:07.820> before<00:01:08.820> looks<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.229> got

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
know before looks like it's and they got

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.490 
know before looks like it's and they got
it<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.740> their<00:01:11.010> our<00:01:11.250> thing<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.720> honor

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
it on their our thing here to honor

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.630 
it on their our thing here to honor
under<00:01:14.280> internal<00:01:15.180> reflections<00:01:16.340> they<00:01:17.340> show

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
under internal reflections they show

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.630 
under internal reflections they show
that<00:01:18.170> hitman<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.619> know<00:01:19.770> they<00:01:20.009> show<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
that hitman you know they show it in the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.179 
that hitman you know they show it in the
center<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.570> looks<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.380> lot<00:01:22.500> different<00:01:22.560> but

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
center here it looks a lot different but

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.429 
center here it looks a lot different but
you<00:01:23.340> know<00:01:23.460> still<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.909> see<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> round<00:01:24.509> lens

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
you know still you see the round lens

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.999 
you know still you see the round lens
reflection<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> image<00:01:27.869> that's<00:01:28.740> that's

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
reflection in the image that's that's

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.590 
reflection in the image that's that's
what<00:01:29.189> we're<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.759> know<00:01:29.880> when<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.150> always<00:01:30.390> do

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
what we're so you know when I always do

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.340 
what we're so you know when I always do
so<00:01:31.579> that's<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.759> what<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.390> know<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.930> said<00:01:34.320> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
so that's just what you know I said it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.289 
so that's just what you know I said it
just<00:01:34.770> different<00:01:35.220> angles<00:01:35.579> at<00:01:35.700> different<00:01:36.060> times

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
just different angles at different times

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.960 
just different angles at different times
of<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.430> what<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.790> is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
of the you know so it is what it is

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.170 
of the you know so it is what it is
there<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.259> know<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.579> 2007<00:01:41.579> identical

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
there it is you know in 2007 identical

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.039 
there it is you know in 2007 identical
to<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.509> see<00:01:42.869> now<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:45.030> sure<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.630> smaller

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
to what we see now you sure get smaller

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.880 
to what we see now you sure get smaller
as<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.909> as<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.240> one<00:01:48.479> did<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.990> eventually<00:01:49.860> we

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
as it as this one did and eventually we

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.149 
as it as this one did and eventually we
should<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.460> able<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.729> see<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.119> round

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
should be able to see this round

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.050 
should be able to see this round
reflection<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.850> lens

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
reflection of the lens

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.660 
reflection of the lens
in<00:01:56.060> there<00:01:56.270> too<00:01:56.740> so<00:01:57.740> this<00:01:57.890> is<00:01:57.920> happen<00:01:58.370> before

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
in there too so this is happen before

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.880 
in there too so this is happen before
you<00:01:59.090> know<00:01:59.270> they<00:01:59.690> don't<00:01:59.720> have<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.170> archived<00:02:00.590> as

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
you know they don't have it archived as

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.310 
you know they don't have it archived as
it<00:02:01.100> as<00:02:01.280> this<00:02:01.640> but<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:02.270> know<00:02:02.420> it's<00:02:02.570> again<00:02:02.810> here

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
it as this but you know it's again here

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.090 
it as this but you know it's again here
it<00:02:03.410> is<00:02:03.500> in<00:02:03.680> 2007<00:02:05.230> don't<00:02:06.230> want<00:02:06.410> debunk<00:02:06.830> just

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
it is in 2007 don't want debunk just

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.910 
it is in 2007 don't want debunk just
want<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.370> get<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.550> truth<00:02:07.820> man<00:02:08.060> face<00:02:08.960> love<00:02:09.320> big
