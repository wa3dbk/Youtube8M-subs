self-propelled a lawnmower got this a
few<00:00:11.070> weeks<00:00:11.490> ago<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:12.360> oil<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.719> already<00:00:12.870> filthy

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
few weeks ago the oil is already filthy

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.049 
few weeks ago the oil is already filthy
I'll<00:00:13.530> just<00:00:13.679> replace<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.309> oil<00:00:14.340> three<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.030> a

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
I'll just replace the oil three and a

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.490 
I'll just replace the oil three and a
half<00:00:15.240> days<00:00:15.509> ago<00:00:15.830> so<00:00:17.510> that's<00:00:18.510> roughly<00:00:18.690> new<00:00:19.109> now

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
half days ago so that's roughly new now

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.900 
half days ago so that's roughly new now
ah<00:00:21.109> there<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.170> go

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
ah there we go

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.460 
ah there we go
the<00:00:23.910> only<00:00:24.090> problem<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.779> mower<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.199> one<00:00:25.380> of

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
the only problem is this mower is one of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.200 
the only problem is this mower is one of
the<00:00:25.560> bolts<00:00:25.949> holding<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.400> engine<00:00:26.699> are<00:00:26.789> snapped

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the bolts holding the engine are snapped

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.160 
the bolts holding the engine are snapped
off<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.539> it's<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.720> bit<00:00:27.840> loose<00:00:28.760> you<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:29.789> see<00:00:30.170> just

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
off so it's a bit loose you can see just

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.610 
off so it's a bit loose you can see just
a<00:00:31.349> bit<00:00:32.180> I'm<00:00:33.180> got<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> rear<00:00:33.690> bagger<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.469> right

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
a bit I'm got a rear bagger on it right

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.180 
a bit I'm got a rear bagger on it right
now

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
now

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.190 
now
I<00:00:35.219> had<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.670> side<00:00:35.910> back<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.690> think<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.050> one

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
I had the side back but I think this one

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.950 
I had the side back but I think this one
actually<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.559> comes<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:38.129> more<00:00:38.309> clippings

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
actually that comes up more clippings

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.190 
actually that comes up more clippings
I'm<00:00:39.960> not<00:00:40.140> really<00:00:40.290> sure<00:00:40.559> about<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.989> I'm<00:00:42.989> gonna

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
I'm not really sure about that I'm gonna

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.880 
I'm not really sure about that I'm gonna
set<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.440> camera<00:00:43.800> down<00:00:43.829> really<00:00:44.250> quick<00:00:45.890> here

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
set the camera down really quick here

00:00:46.890 --> 00:01:38.670 
set the camera down really quick here
because<00:00:47.219> last<00:00:47.460> time

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.080 

and<00:01:39.680> it<00:01:39.830> sometimes<00:01:40.040> just<00:01:40.430> stalls<00:01:40.700> like<00:01:40.940> that

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
and it sometimes just stalls like that

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.980 
and it sometimes just stalls like that
for<00:01:41.300> no<00:01:41.390> reason

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
for no reason

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.330 
for no reason
yeah<00:01:42.710> power<00:01:43.100> drive<00:01:43.460> does<00:01:43.700> not<00:01:44.060> work<00:01:45.160> engine<00:01:46.160> is

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
yeah power drive does not work engine is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.320 
yeah power drive does not work engine is
loose<00:01:47.140> incredibly<00:01:48.140> as<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.160> rod<00:01:49.520> knock<00:01:49.850> blows

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
loose incredibly as a rod knock blows

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.370 
loose incredibly as a rod knock blows
blue<00:01:50.659> smoke<00:01:50.990> at<00:01:51.140> times<00:01:52.060> surprisingly<00:01:53.380> there's

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
blue smoke at times surprisingly there's

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.499 
blue smoke at times surprisingly there's
no<00:01:54.619> move<00:01:54.890> deflector<00:01:55.550> on<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.790> muffler<00:01:56.210> so<00:01:56.420> it

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
no move deflector on the muffler so it

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.810 
no move deflector on the muffler so it
actually<00:01:56.690> makes<00:01:57.080> bed<00:01:57.530> quite<00:01:57.950> real<00:01:58.130> warm<00:01:58.520> back

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
actually makes bed quite real warm back

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.950 
actually makes bed quite real warm back
here<00:01:59.410> but<00:02:00.610> yeah<00:02:01.610> there's<00:02:02.060> no<00:02:02.210> deflector<00:02:02.690> on<00:02:02.720> it

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
here but yeah there's no deflector on it

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.950 
here but yeah there's no deflector on it
so<00:02:03.700> miracle<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.790> doesn't<00:02:05.060> melt<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.450> bag<00:02:05.600> I'll

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
so miracle it doesn't melt the bag I'll

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.900 
so miracle it doesn't melt the bag I'll
catch<00:02:06.170> it<00:02:06.200> on<00:02:06.470> fire<00:02:06.740> but<00:02:07.070> it<00:02:07.280> doesn't<00:02:08.050> um<00:02:09.910> got

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
catch it on fire but it doesn't um got

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
which it actually works ok for though

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.180 
which it actually works ok for though
they're<00:02:59.930> odd<00:03:00.110> not<00:03:00.410> seems<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.829> be<00:03:00.950> getting

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.150 
as you can see because the carburetor is
not<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.470> correct<00:03:06.769> carburetor<00:03:09.160> the

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
not the correct carburetor the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.560 
not the correct carburetor the
carburetor<00:03:10.670> originally<00:03:11.180> was<00:03:11.299> supposed<00:03:11.329> to

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
carburetor originally was supposed to

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.210 
carburetor originally was supposed to
have<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.750> little<00:03:11.959> thing<00:03:12.230> for<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.500> primer<00:03:12.920> bulb

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
have a little thing for a primer bulb

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.259 
have a little thing for a primer bulb
there<00:03:15.160> but<00:03:16.160> that's<00:03:16.370> long<00:03:16.610> gone<00:03:16.670> because<00:03:17.180> the

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
there but that's long gone because the

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.479 
there but that's long gone because the
car<00:03:17.450> bird<00:03:17.600> is<00:03:17.690> completely<00:03:18.140> trashed<00:03:18.489> trim

car bird is completely trashed trim
getting<00:03:19.760> water<00:03:20.030> in<00:03:20.299> it<00:03:20.450> so<00:03:20.799> I<00:03:21.799> had<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.130> put<00:03:22.280> a

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
getting water in it so I had to put a

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.979 
getting water in it so I had to put a
different<00:03:22.430> carbon<00:03:22.850> on<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.120> have<00:03:23.269> no<00:03:23.420> air<00:03:23.600> filter

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989
