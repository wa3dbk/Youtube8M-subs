00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.299
 huge themes dear friends of swami I pull 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.210
 would we have fresh answers today 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.240
 developers you know when to wait yet 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.110
 one nation and also when will be japanese 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.840
 Chinese sa and Fri-sa and many more 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.890
 interesting sit back we 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.640
 getting started 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.489
 and the first question is dangling tanks bags and 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.870
 antennas on tanks havok whether it is on what 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.050
 the answer was given that it can be implemented 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.610
 as with halka and without him to me then 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.910
 the question arises why it is not yet 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.970
 we realize if you need a robe to 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.470
 narrowing I'm not unearthly 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.900
 Now developers want to recycle 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.030
 completely concept perks to 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.100
 get rid of the problems of the current approach 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.190
 that is, we have unused perks 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.480
 and we have difficulty with lack 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.979
 certain crew members when 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.360
 transplanting tank from tank and about 0 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.820
 variability when pumping but this is 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.880
 Opinions the same developer more simply 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.130
 perks will be extensively reviewed 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.360
 it is the concept itself 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.070
 and at the moment the developers are already 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.510
 working on a full replacement option 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.020
 crew and 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.200
 perks here it surprised me earlier 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.460
 they said that the lamp will initially give 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.500
 radio operator and that will need to be re 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.450
 pump and so on and so forth and 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.390
 Now developers are not easy 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.760
 replace a little bit of reconciliation and add a new one 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.300
 they want to completely change the concept 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.740
 truth which way 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.080
 and so on unfortunately not reported on 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.150
 question why not just ban 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.700
 shooting his own was up to answer what 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.610
 developers still ponder a lot this 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.950
 option that is theoretically they can 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.320
 like to turn the team kill and at 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.200
 we were not when your artov you 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.150
 shoots but and so on if that means 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.420
 one on one side is good on the other 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.820
 parties for some it's bad its 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.160
 opinion can write comments on 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.920
 opinion of developers online now 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.700
 more than last year was the same 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.060
 the time of the upcoming snow maps 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.520
 and the sand will not be fine right second 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.080
 level almost no ride in random 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.600
 judging by the statistics 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.610
 Well, for example , I also have a Jedi police 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.190
 it barely rolls out just b 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.410
 streams will be asked or a couple of vidos 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.760
 gift tank write and so he me 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.560
 really worth their street 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.890
 why well because it does not want to small 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.850
 levels play here again my opinion 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.970
 why developers don't want 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.080
 integrate with steam unfortunately 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.420
 exact answer 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.730
 there was no assault replied that in common to 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.370
 question if the developers have passed lbz 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.250
 there was an answer there and there are even guys with 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.080
 spot 70 plus man if you know 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.630
 such nick off me to myself 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.800
 Interesting also the developers decided 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:17.760
 a little frank and said that 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.270
 over the past few years has been tremendous 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.310
 flow 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.920
 players in principle there are now but 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.650
 some of them are just 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.600
 fell off due to the presence of the pedobier of 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.730
 there is a man started to play met 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.590
 Pedobira met Pedobier two times three 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.330
 four and every time pedobir killed him 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.010
 I killed I killed Tobi zasveta something else there 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.040
 somehow a shorter person is just 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.820
 bored and he leaves the game never 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.310
 reaching the sixth families 8.9 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:47.100
 that is, you are not a player developer 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.890
 such a lot has fallen off a lot and it 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.020
 a big problem of tanks that is bad 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.000
 threshold of entry into the game that person 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.430
 should perry suffer a pedobier of then 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.040
 to pump higher still has to merge 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.380
 before you even understand the essence of this game 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.780
 this problem was as before 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.510
 there is so now but according to 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.110
 developers stream of newbies less for 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.600
 all the time 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.200
 he did not become only more 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.480
 loved remains on their own opinion this 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.310
 extensive topic can express in 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.919
 comments honestly be interesting 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.720
 read 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.910
 they were further asked whether 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.310
 They have such a thing that will make 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.370
 the game is the necessary variety for what they are 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.840
 answered all sorts of pieces there by 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.960
 about chateau 20 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.990
 in drochat and implemented but the interface and 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.910
 only partially short most 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.400
 the main work is done but the interface 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.410
 not yet fully end why patch from two 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.760
 numbers we will have to wait for summer 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.460
 my stoves 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.280
 I was also told by the developers that 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.710
 beginners will soon be new normal 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.130
 tutorial truth when again not 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.740
 said about the graphics developers 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.470
 claim that the current maximum 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.000
 the value of the players already in the floor is nothing if 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.620
 certainly not considered old wretched 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.970
 vegetation over it 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.370
 they are already working on the distribution 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.720
 maps by levels the developers claim 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:19.200
 that the cards were chosen according to the article and very 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.450
 long analyzed still prepare well 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.230
 when the patch will release there already and 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:27.150
 see the same guys developers 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.670
 of course will continue to add 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.680
 functionality from mods to game like 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.420
 It was a sun and a mini-card as it was with 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.770
 recharge timer in sight but at 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:42.090
 overall we still seem to be waiting for a lot of things 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.750
 also e75 leaders unfortunately closest 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.450
 patches 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.640
 will not be well for some reason decided not 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.710
 put it not in the first wave 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.960
 aqua priority then away 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:58.330
 i.e. this is at least 34 from 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:02.050
 Poland the next new nation will be 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.270
 Available in 2016, but not yet 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.940
 reportedly this is not czechoslovakia not 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.060
 confuse it at all new nation that is 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:14.289
 sixteenth year something else new 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:19.710
 the scale of a certain will be waiting for us also 2016 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:22.090
 waiting for Chinese and Japanese sa and pt sa 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.460
 tank physics significantly reworked 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.520
 after the general tests in the spring of this year 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:31.810
 and as you know now goes actively already 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:34.150
 The second general physics test chart will be 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.190
 improve and further wargaming 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:40.180
 works well, support beliviks 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:42.190
 11 and 12 and multi-core so much they 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.289
 i'm already working this multi core 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.389
 I do not even remember in the end we are all and 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:47.669
 no way can see however 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:49.810
 developers want first 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:50.470
 focus on engine optimization 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.389
 havok 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.400
 and are considering adding 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:57.310
 smoke curtains 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.560
 if it can be realized technically 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.560
 Well, I already think there would be a desire 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.610
 realize powerful k-sec 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.729
 multi- turbo multi barreled stis 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:09.000
 most likely in the tanks will not be exactly as 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:12.789
 and new technology classes 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.370
 Perhaps there will be a clan chat but an idea 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:18.190
 requires a thorough study of how 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.650
 say the developers themselves and more guys have 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:25.150
 me for you a little insider info 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.960
 some rumors cry and 10 goes out 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.820
 Tuesday 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.759
 if developers don't change plans 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:33.009
 if there is a change then maybe thursday 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:35.620
 well, or even later 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:38.320
 as they claim crying is obtained 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:41.050
 very extensive therefore not excluded 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.940
 delays but what's up with that? 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.550
 forget of course subscribe to 

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.030
 channel and put like this is the best 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.009
 reward 

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.349
 and also leave your comments and 

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:54.870
 opinions and see advertising because we are their 

00:07:50.349 --> 00:07:54.870
 or good luck to you and happily
