00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.499 
grip a lot so the blade edge is always
pointing<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.189> my<00:01:29.280> knuckles<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.360> is

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
pointing to my knuckles and this is

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.420 
pointing to my knuckles and this is
actually<00:01:30.960> one<00:01:31.140> thing<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.530> think<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.979> lot<00:01:32.369> of

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
actually one thing that I think a lot of

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.490 
actually one thing that I think a lot of
knives<00:01:32.670> fail<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.450> because<00:01:33.810> they<00:01:34.229> used<00:01:34.409> to

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
knives fail to because they used to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.010 
knives fail to because they used to
somebody<00:01:34.770> holding<00:01:35.009> him<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.549> or

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
somebody holding him like this or

somebody holding him like this or
holding<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.140> like<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.400> more

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
holding it like this for that more

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.940 
holding it like this for that more
tactical<00:01:39.240> feel<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.840> look<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.530> night<00:01:40.770> feels

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
tactical feel and look this night feels

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.920 
tactical feel and look this night feels
good<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.520> variety<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:42.060> different<00:01:42.240> holds<00:01:42.810> as

the blade geometry is pretty substantial
for<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.400> let's<00:02:29.580> take<00:02:29.670> some<00:02:29.820> bigger

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
for this so let's take some bigger

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.280 
for this so let's take some bigger
chunks<00:02:30.360> off<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:30.810> can<00:02:30.930> show<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.110> guys<00:02:31.230> how

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
chunks off so I can show you guys how

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.210 
chunks off so I can show you guys how
well<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:31.650> thing<00:02:31.710> bites<00:02:31.980> into<00:02:32.220> stuff<00:02:34.220> say

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
well this thing bites into stuff say

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.450 
well this thing bites into stuff say
that's<00:02:35.340> pretty<00:02:35.580> successful<00:02:40.070> but<00:02:41.070> at<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.250> same

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
that's pretty successful but at the same

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.910 
that's pretty successful but at the same
time<00:02:41.670> if<00:02:41.880> we<00:02:42.030> wanted<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.330> do<00:02:42.890> something<00:02:43.890> a

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
time if we wanted to do something a

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.270 
time if we wanted to do something a
little<00:02:43.950> bit<00:02:44.160> more<00:02:44.460> controlled<00:02:48.950> we're<00:02:49.950> able<00:02:50.100> to

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
little bit more controlled we're able to

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.440 
little bit more controlled we're able to
do<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.550> as<00:02:50.730> well<00:02:55.730> this<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.850> established<00:02:57.330> with

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
do that as well this is established with

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.570 
do that as well this is established with
good<00:02:57.720> blade<00:02:57.959> geometry<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.800> mean<00:02:59.160> that's<00:02:59.310> pretty

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
good blade geometry I mean that's pretty

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.699 
good blade geometry I mean that's pretty
pretty<00:03:00.150> good<00:03:00.360> off<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.510> top<00:03:00.840> now<00:03:01.500> with<00:03:01.650> the

the craftsmanship and these blades are

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.470 
the craftsmanship and these blades are
pretty<00:03:13.950> awesome<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.430> chorus<00:03:14.730> season<00:03:15.030> this<00:03:15.360> is
