 It is also written on the package but ultra-thin ultra-light case 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:18.600
 This I can think Na's fashionable but I know this bumper case 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:22.490
 Where to stop is this way You can fashion with one point 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.600
 It was with that I will be but I know this red in accessories 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.800
 By mood because it comes with a green this two-color Tteyuu gray called Silver 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.430
 Can be changed 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.149
 It is recommended for such people because I think that there are people that there are a lot of flashy cases and they don't like it 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.149
 Yes yes 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.040

 Just put on a quick holo foil sound simple hmm 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:53.380
 And this is a material but it's interesting again 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:01:00.460
 pr 90 It is using something special material and what kind of features this has 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:04.790
 It seems that it is used for the frame of the glasses in shape memory and so on and off 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:10.580
 I so keep this shape properly song so I thought the shape does not change 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.670
 I read yeah, for example weird pressure and Gune bend even if this shape is properly 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.619
 That way of remembering 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.009
 I think it's interesting to say that the case is good 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.659

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:26.200

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.690
 Do not worry about that with a number that seems to be broken 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.110
 I will keep remembering and hitting this shape as it is 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.630
 It is a cross 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.140
 I think I Naa hard to push in some but first, I know let's take a look at the fine point side 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.290

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:49.680
