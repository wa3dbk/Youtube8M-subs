00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:09.340
 or the impression that you always have of 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.800
 the people I think is the 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.380
 kindness that were with me 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.140
 truth the only thing I knew over there was 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.380
 the stadium and the truth a stadium that 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.640
 it's good and it 's nice and the 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.650
 true that 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.990
 the kindness of the people makes you feel 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.990
 like at home and you're welcome 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.290
 and the best I do not know if I'm in the best 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.570
 moment the truth lately I have not 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.420
 played so much with the selection I did not have 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.809
 a lot of participation but good 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.670
 I think I can be able to exploit football 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.699
 what I want and what people want 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.230
 see and well I have the confidence that I 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.949
 have given I think that that will be 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.540
 quite positive to be able to 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.000
 prove because the truth that always 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.339
 I have been committed not with people 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.150
 but with myself I have my own 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:05.659
 goals and the commitment that I have is is 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.000
 with me not with besides I want me 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.320
 I want to be for to play obviously 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.590
 I know I have to fight a job and that 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.360
 I have to give my best effort but 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.159
 obviously I want I want to play I want 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.220
 be the protagonist in the team I want 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.220
 I want to be someone by name then 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.700
 let's try to work to the fullest 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.700
 always and 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.229
 and the truth is that if I believe that always 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.659
 get with a person that you know that 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.539
 you get along well it 's better than getting there alone 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.509
 obviously I will not be around all day 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:46.220
 with him not so much like that anymore but obviously 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.530
 when at some time you feel 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.000
 sad or something because you have with whom 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.460
 talk with someone you have 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.970
 trust and that will get us through 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.970
 to the two 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.190
 yes with my wife and my baby nothing more 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.230
 not until Saturday 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.580
 while to pachuca some 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.800
 and my wife is from here in pachuca 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.100
 then everything I think all the 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.880
 vacation would return to pachuca 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.190
 better they believe that I can give the 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.760
 wide that joao moutinho gave then I 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.610
 I think that also commits me 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.860
 and it makes me take that risk and that 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.370
 adventure of being someone important in 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.810
 the team I always said it for me 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.420
 it's an honor to go to the national team and a 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.850
 pride then if they follow me 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.200
 calling me without problems I'll go 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.660
 right now I only think about being well 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.920
 with the club and doing things right there 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.640
 and God will tell what will happen later 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.120
 obviously like any other player 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.310
 you aspire to like you to play to be 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.580
 champion to be a protagonist in the team 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.280
 be a leader be a player 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.130
 important I think diego and I 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.800
 we have the same goals of reaching 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.290
 play win a position and 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:14.040
 and good as I tell you to put the name of 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:17.239
 Mexico on high and keep moving forward 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.010
 for four years I prefer to think about 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.819
 worry about playing and earn me a 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.819
 put and do it 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.350
 to all my classmates 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.980
 and all this 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.980
 all right
