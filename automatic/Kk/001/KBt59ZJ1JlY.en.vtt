00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
example of insurance that you have a

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.570 
example of insurance that you have a
better<00:00:12.960> understanding<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.650> what<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:13.889> means

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
better understanding of what that means

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.689 
better understanding of what that means
after<00:00:15.450> each<00:00:15.599> player<00:00:15.929> has<00:00:16.199> placed<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.710> bet<00:00:17.010> let's

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
after each player has placed a bet let's

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.179 
after each player has placed a bet let's
say<00:00:17.940> each<00:00:18.090> player<00:00:18.449> has<00:00:18.840> put<00:00:19.170> down<00:00:19.410> two<00:00:19.830> chips

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
say each player has put down two chips

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.550 
say each player has put down two chips
let's<00:00:21.000> go<00:00:21.210> ahead<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.600> do<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.810> just<00:00:22.289> for<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
let's go ahead and do that just for the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.960 
let's go ahead and do that just for the
sake<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.830> example<00:00:23.490> each<00:00:23.699> player<00:00:24.210> has<00:00:24.570> bet<00:00:24.840> two

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
sake of example each player has bet two

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.779 
sake of example each player has bet two
for<00:00:26.970> their<00:00:27.570> hand<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.800> they<00:00:28.949> keep<00:00:29.189> these<00:00:29.400> chips

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
for their hand so they keep these chips

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.209 
for their hand so they keep these chips
to<00:00:29.910> themselves<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.869> these<00:00:31.590> cards<00:00:32.040> these

table
insurance<00:00:57.660> essentially<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> two-to-one

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
insurance essentially is a two-to-one

odds the chances of my having a 10
underneath<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.969> Ace<00:01:03.149> or<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.629> blackjack

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
underneath the Ace or a blackjack

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.179 
underneath the Ace or a blackjack
natural<00:01:05.159> are<00:01:05.630> fairly<00:01:06.630> high<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.890> offer

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
natural are fairly high so I offer

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.429 
natural are fairly high so I offer
insurance<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:09.119> everybody<00:01:09.540> else<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> table

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
insurance to everybody else at the table

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.899 
insurance to everybody else at the table
however<00:01:12.350> insurance<00:01:13.350> very<00:01:13.950> often<00:01:14.430> doesn't<00:01:14.729> pay

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
however insurance very often doesn't pay

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.050 
however insurance very often doesn't pay
out<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:15.930> not<00:01:16.140> always<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.590> good<00:01:16.830> option

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
out so it's not always a good option

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.280 
out so it's not always a good option
unless<00:01:18.060> you're<00:01:18.299> very<00:01:18.330> confident<00:01:19.080> about<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
unless you're very confident about the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.100 
unless you're very confident about the
hand<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:21.240> let's<00:01:21.509> say<00:01:21.750> for

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
hand that you have so let's say for

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.760 
hand that you have so let's say for
example<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:24.360> Queen<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> five<00:01:25.140> wanted<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
example the Queen and the five wanted to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.560 
example the Queen and the five wanted to
take<00:01:25.979> insurance<00:01:26.549> because<00:01:26.970> they<00:01:27.150> thought<00:01:27.390> that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
take insurance because they thought that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.109 
take insurance because they thought that
I<00:01:27.600> probably<00:01:27.960> had<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> twenty<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:29.070> they<00:01:29.909> will

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
I probably had a twenty one they will

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.780 
I probably had a twenty one they will
pay<00:01:30.420> half<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.470> amount<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.280> they<00:01:32.490> have

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
pay half of the amount that they have

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.710 
pay half of the amount that they have
out<00:01:33.829> one<00:01:34.829> chip<00:01:35.189> they<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.850> two<00:01:36.119> chips<00:01:36.450> out

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
out one chip they have two chips out

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.640 
out one chip they have two chips out
there<00:01:37.439> insurance<00:01:37.650> bet<00:01:38.310> will<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.579> one<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:40.200> I

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
there insurance bet will be one so if I

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.069 
there insurance bet will be one so if I
do<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> blackjack<00:01:41.909> they<00:01:42.570> get<00:01:42.840> their

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
do have a blackjack they get their

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.710 
do have a blackjack they get their
insurance<00:01:43.229> back<00:01:43.950> if<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.000> not<00:01:45.360> have<00:01:45.659> a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
insurance back if I do not have a

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.590 
insurance back if I do not have a
blackjack<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.619> take<00:01:47.460> their<00:01:47.790> insurance<00:01:48.329> money

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
blackjack I take their insurance money

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.300 
blackjack I take their insurance money
so<00:01:49.350> let's<00:01:49.619> see<00:01:49.829> what<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.070> have

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
so let's see what we have

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.160 
so let's see what we have
I<00:01:51.530> do<00:01:52.530> indeed<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.340> blackjack<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.810> they<00:01:55.020> get

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
I do indeed have a blackjack so they get

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.490 
I do indeed have a blackjack so they get
to<00:01:55.350> keep<00:01:55.619> their<00:01:55.950> insurance<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.509> now<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.229> go

to keep their insurance and now we go
