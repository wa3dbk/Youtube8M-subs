00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.410 
stain but yeah I think it's a stain it's
a<00:01:54.869> bomb<00:01:55.680> stain<00:01:56.369> that's<00:01:56.700> what<00:01:56.939> it's<00:01:57.090> called<00:01:57.299> so

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
a bomb stain that's what it's called so

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.649 
a bomb stain that's what it's called so
it's<00:01:58.229> not<00:01:58.829> drying<00:01:59.219> at<00:01:59.430> all<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.240> feels<00:02:00.479> good

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
it's not drying at all and it feels good

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.480 
it's not drying at all and it feels good
on<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> lips<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.680> does<00:02:01.890> last<00:02:02.100> at<00:02:02.369> least

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
on the lips and it does last at least

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.100 
on the lips and it does last at least
two<00:02:02.759> or<00:02:02.880> three<00:02:02.939> hours<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.630> thought<00:02:03.960> that's

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
two or three hours so I thought that's

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.170 
two or three hours so I thought that's
pretty<00:02:04.320> good<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.860> love<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.189> color<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:06.030> a

pretty good and I love this color it's a

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.580 
pretty good and I love this color it's a
great<00:02:06.360> color<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.750> I've<00:02:06.869> got<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.350> another

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
great color and I've got it in another

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.990 
great color and I've got it in another
color<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.640> rosy<00:02:09.119> pink<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:11.580> that's<00:02:11.760> it
