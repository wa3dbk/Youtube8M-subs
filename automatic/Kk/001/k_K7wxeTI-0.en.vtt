this<00:00:26.519> alley<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.000> winner<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.599> previous

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
this alley the winner of the previous

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.019 
this alley the winner of the previous
match<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.740> think<00:00:29.130> he<00:00:29.310> played<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.580> little<00:00:29.730> safe

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
match so I think he played a little safe

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.609 
match so I think he played a little safe
got<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> lot<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.660> speed<00:00:30.840> up<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.140> he<00:00:31.230> wouldn't<00:00:31.500> go

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
got a lot of speed up so he wouldn't go

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.380 
got a lot of speed up so he wouldn't go
through<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.949> nose<00:00:34.670> he<00:00:35.670> left<00:00:35.880> himself<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.210> very

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
through the nose he left himself a very

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.700

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
ever had we have 14 tournaments on the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.390 
ever had we have 14 tournaments on the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.660 
I think 14 of them are a hundred
thousand<00:04:07.140> or<00:04:07.260> better<00:04:07.410> so<00:04:07.680> it's<00:04:08.250> getting<00:04:08.520> up

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
thousand or better so it's getting up

attack<00:06:38.770> on<00:06:39.099> June<00:06:39.250> 20th<00:06:39.639> and<00:06:39.880> he<00:06:39.970> told<00:06:40.210> me<00:06:40.360> the

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 
attack on June 20th and he told me the

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:42.360 
attack on June 20th and he told me the
only<00:06:40.630> thing<00:06:40.930> that<00:06:41.050> he<00:06:41.169> does<00:06:41.349> not<00:06:41.560> have<00:06:41.800> back<00:06:42.130> is

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
only thing that he does not have back is

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.370 
only thing that he does not have back is
his<00:06:42.610> speed<00:06:42.910> and<00:06:43.360> I<00:06:43.449> think<00:06:43.720> that<00:06:43.870> is<00:06:44.020> one<00:06:44.199> of<00:06:44.229> the

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
his speed and I think that is one of the

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.320 
his speed and I think that is one of the
reasons<00:06:44.710> why<00:06:44.919> this<00:06:44.979> ball<00:06:45.370> hooked<00:06:45.639> by<00:06:45.820> the<00:06:45.880> 7

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
reasons why this ball hooked by the 7

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.899 
reasons why this ball hooked by the 7
