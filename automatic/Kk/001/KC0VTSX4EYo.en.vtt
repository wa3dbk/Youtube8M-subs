00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
the visuals in this game have a model

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.830 
the visuals in this game have a model
railroad<00:00:11.520> style<00:00:11.820> field<00:00:12.150> what<00:00:12.510> inspiration

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
railroad style field what inspiration

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.720 
railroad style field what inspiration
did<00:00:13.350> model<00:00:13.710> trains<00:00:14.070> play<00:00:14.430> in<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.640> development

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
did model trains play in the development

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.590 
did model trains play in the development
of<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.390> game<00:00:15.600> yeah<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.460> big<00:00:18.420> inspiration

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
of this game yeah so a big inspiration

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.450 
of this game yeah so a big inspiration
in<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.080> sim<00:00:19.260> city<00:00:19.410> was<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.070> kind<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.369> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
in the sim city was the kind of the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.400 
in the sim city was the kind of the
aesthetic<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.940> little<00:00:21.300> model<00:00:21.900> worlds<00:00:22.260> and

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
aesthetic of little model worlds and

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.830 
aesthetic of little model worlds and
there's<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.590> bunch<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.250> reasons<00:00:23.790> for<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.210> one

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
there's a bunch of reasons for that one

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.670 
there's a bunch of reasons for that one
of<00:00:24.900> them<00:00:25.020> is<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.230> think<00:00:25.440> it's<00:00:25.530> a<00:00:25.560> really

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
of them is I just think it's a really

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.230 
of them is I just think it's a really
beautiful<00:00:25.860> look<00:00:26.280> you<00:00:26.520> know<00:00:26.610> so<00:00:26.790> part<00:00:27.030> of<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.150> is

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
beautiful look you know so part of it is

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.240 
beautiful look you know so part of it is
just<00:00:27.390> sensual<00:00:27.870> it's<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:28.680> that's<00:00:29.039> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
just sensual it's just that's the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.580 
just sensual it's just that's the
aesthetic<00:00:29.670> bit<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.690> I<00:00:30.780> thought<00:00:30.930> would<00:00:31.320> be

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
aesthetic bit that I thought would be

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.440 
aesthetic bit that I thought would be
moving<00:00:32.010> and<00:00:32.400> would<00:00:32.489> be<00:00:32.580> beautiful<00:00:32.940> but

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
moving and would be beautiful but

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.049 
moving and would be beautiful but
another<00:00:33.600> part<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.900> it<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.080> more<00:00:34.320> conceptual<00:00:35.059> if

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
another part of it is more conceptual if

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.020 
another part of it is more conceptual if
you<00:00:36.210> look<00:00:36.360> at<00:00:36.449> how<00:00:37.100> model<00:00:38.100> makers<00:00:38.550> if<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.940> look

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
you look at how model makers if you look

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.570 
you look at how model makers if you look
at<00:00:39.090> our<00:00:39.150> model<00:00:39.390> makers<00:00:39.690> compress<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.980> stylize

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
at our model makers compress and stylize

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.119 
at our model makers compress and stylize
the<00:00:42.120> buildings<00:00:42.900> that<00:00:43.589> they<00:00:43.739> make<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:43.949> their

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the buildings that they make in their

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.979 
the buildings that they make in their
model<00:00:44.400> worlds<00:00:44.730> you'll<00:00:45.210> see<00:00:45.330> they're

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
model worlds you'll see they're

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.210 
model worlds you'll see they're
stripping<00:00:46.320> out<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> lot<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:46.860> stuff<00:00:46.920> that's

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
stripping out a lot of this stuff that's

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.490 
stripping out a lot of this stuff that's
really<00:00:47.460> boring<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.420> compare<00:00:48.839> a<00:00:48.870> real

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
really boring so compare a real

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.160 
really boring so compare a real
warehouse<00:00:50.460> space<00:00:50.790> for<00:00:51.000> example<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.540> the<00:00:52.050> real

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
warehouse space for example in the real

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.630 
warehouse space for example in the real
world<00:00:52.409> like<00:00:52.620> at<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.830> Port<00:00:53.159> of<00:00:53.190> Oakland<00:00:53.489> down

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
world like at the Port of Oakland down

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.320 
world like at the Port of Oakland down
the<00:00:53.729> road<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:54.710> 21<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:55.949> see<00:00:56.040> in<00:00:56.519> in<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
the road here 21 that you see in in a

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.360 
the road here 21 that you see in in a
model<00:00:57.900> railroad<00:00:58.199> landscape<00:00:58.559> you'll<00:00:59.190> see<00:00:59.280> that

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
model railroad landscape you'll see that

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.180 
model railroad landscape you'll see that
all<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.580> boring<00:00:59.879> stuff<00:01:00.030> has<00:01:00.629> been<00:01:00.960> elided<00:01:01.559> and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
all the boring stuff has been elided and

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.530 
all the boring stuff has been elided and
you're<00:01:02.309> left<00:01:02.460> with<00:01:02.610> only<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.089> interesting

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
you're left with only the interesting

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.360 
you're left with only the interesting
pieces<00:01:03.720> you<00:01:03.900> know<00:01:03.989> loading<00:01:04.379> docks<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.280> you're

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
pieces you know loading docks and you're

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.340 
pieces you know loading docks and you're
left<00:01:05.549> with<00:01:05.790> places<00:01:06.450> where<00:01:06.570> trucks<00:01:06.840> pull<00:01:07.200> in

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
left with places where trucks pull in

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.300 
left with places where trucks pull in
and<00:01:07.560> you're<00:01:07.650> left<00:01:07.770> with<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:07.979> stuff<00:01:08.159> that's

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and you're left with the stuff that's

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.160 
and you're left with the stuff that's
that<00:01:09.030> does<00:01:09.240> stuff<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.810> you're<00:01:09.900> left<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
that does stuff and you're left for the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.840 
that does stuff and you're left for the
stuff<00:01:10.320> that's<00:01:10.470> interesting<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.920> look<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.190> so<00:01:11.790> I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
stuff that's interesting to look at so I

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.039 
stuff that's interesting to look at so I
was<00:01:11.970> really<00:01:12.150> inspired<00:01:12.270> by<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.720> way<00:01:12.899> that

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
was really inspired by the way that

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.990 
was really inspired by the way that
those<00:01:13.170> guys<00:01:13.409> who've<00:01:14.340> been<00:01:14.369> doing<00:01:14.610> that's<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
those guys who've been doing that's the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.590 
those guys who've been doing that's the
stuff<00:01:15.149> for<00:01:15.539> years<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.020> know<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.710> century

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600

abstract and simplify and kind of

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.590 
abstract and simplify and kind of
crystallized<00:01:20.610> what's<00:01:20.939> important<00:01:21.360> about<00:01:21.450> a

crystallized what's important about a
given<00:01:21.860> you<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:22.979> element<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.430> factory<00:01:23.820> or<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it to the things that you care about you

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.590 
it to the things that you care about you
know<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.219> viewer<00:01:29.579> that's<00:01:30.149> a<00:01:30.240> big<00:01:30.359> chunk<00:01:30.509> of

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
the inspiration how have advances in

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.940 
the inspiration how have advances in
technology<00:01:33.539> since<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.960> last<00:01:34.140> game<00:01:34.409> opened

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
technology since the last game opened

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.859 
technology since the last game opened
things<00:01:35.250> up<00:01:35.490> creatively<00:01:36.149> for<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.479> team<00:01:36.689> with

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
things up creatively for the team with

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.399 
things up creatively for the team with
this<00:01:36.990> team<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.859> the<00:01:38.429> last<00:01:38.609> game<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.090> did

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
this team so the last game that we did

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.359 
this team so the last game that we did
the<00:01:40.409> last<00:01:40.439> MTD<00:01:40.890> game<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.189> did<00:01:41.310> was

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the last MTD game that we did was

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.490 
the last MTD game that we did was
SimCity<00:01:41.700> 4<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.119> was<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.899> know<00:01:42.929> like<00:01:43.140> really

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
SimCity 4 that was you know like really

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.289 
SimCity 4 that was you know like really
ten<00:01:43.740> years<00:01:43.950> ago<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.640> were<00:01:45.030> working<00:01:45.179> on

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
ten years ago and so we were working on

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.520 
ten years ago and so we were working on
it<00:01:45.420> for<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.539> couple<00:01:45.570> years<00:01:45.719> prior<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.380> it's

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
it for a couple years prior so it's

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.950 
it for a couple years prior so it's
really<00:01:46.679> like<00:01:46.890> 12<00:01:47.670> years<00:01:47.789> ago<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.539> we<00:01:48.929> started

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
really like 12 years ago that we started

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.679 
really like 12 years ago that we started
the<00:01:49.229> development<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.679> SimCity<00:01:50.070> 4<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.570> mean

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
the development of SimCity 4 and I mean

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.599 
the development of SimCity 4 and I mean
12<00:01:51.990> years<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.499> computer<00:01:52.979> time<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.189> mean<00:01:53.490> we're

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
12 years in computer time I mean we're

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.139 
12 years in computer time I mean we're
talking<00:01:53.729> about<00:01:53.939> Stone<00:01:54.299> Age<00:01:54.479> really<00:01:55.249> so<00:01:56.249> when

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
talking about Stone Age really so when

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.599 
talking about Stone Age really so when
we<00:01:57.240> did<00:01:57.390> some<00:01:57.509> CD<00:01:57.719> for<00:01:57.929> 3d<00:01:58.859> hardware<00:01:59.039> was<00:01:59.280> just

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
we did some CD for 3d hardware was just

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.910 
we did some CD for 3d hardware was just
in<00:01:59.700> its<00:01:59.820> infancy<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:01.049> had<00:02:01.469> no<00:02:01.499> way<00:02:01.890> of

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
in its infancy so we had no way of

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.010 
in its infancy so we had no way of
making<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.579> fully<00:02:02.939> dynamic<00:02:03.119> 3d<00:02:03.659> environment

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
making a fully dynamic 3d environment

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.330 
making a fully dynamic 3d environment
that<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.170> could<00:02:04.259> just<00:02:04.320> move<00:02:04.530> through<00:02:04.829> where

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
that you could just move through where

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.950 
that you could just move through where
everything<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.939> game<00:02:06.090> was<00:02:06.450> alive<00:02:06.719> you

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
everything in the game was alive you

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.950 
everything in the game was alive you
know<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.229> since<00:02:07.829> 84<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.460> sin<00:02:09.240> city<00:02:09.420> 3000<00:02:09.869> that

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
know so since 84 and sin city 3000 that

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.120 
know so since 84 and sin city 3000 that
I<00:02:10.020> with<00:02:10.140> director<00:02:10.380> Quran<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.800> well<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.069> even

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
I with director Quran as well and even

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.550 
I with director Quran as well and even
SimCity<00:02:11.520> 2000<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> work<00:02:12.210> done

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
SimCity 2000 that I work done

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.479 
SimCity 2000 that I work done
well<00:02:13.250> sega<00:02:13.670> saturn<00:02:13.849> report<00:02:14.239> back<00:02:14.450> outside<00:02:15.489> we

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
well sega saturn report back outside we

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.830 
well sega saturn report back outside we
had<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.670> do<00:02:16.760> sprites<00:02:17.090> we<00:02:17.390> basically<00:02:17.599> had<00:02:17.780> to

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
had to do sprites we basically had to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.390 
had to do sprites we basically had to
have<00:02:17.930> like<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.110> little<00:02:18.260> paint<00:02:18.530> engine<00:02:18.920> that

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
have like a little paint engine that

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.740 
have like a little paint engine that
would<00:02:19.550> put<00:02:19.730> down<00:02:19.880> sprites<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.330> then<00:02:20.480> snap<00:02:20.720> the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
would put down sprites and then snap the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.150 
would put down sprites and then snap the
sprites<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.290> right<00:02:21.410> order<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.800> you

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
sprites in the right order and you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.320 
sprites in the right order and you
couldn't<00:02:22.400> really<00:02:22.580> afford<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.910> touch<00:02:23.120> those

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
couldn't really afford to touch those

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.140 
couldn't really afford to touch those
sprites<00:02:23.660> in<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.470> rendering<00:02:24.739> because<00:02:25.220> because

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
sprites in the rendering because because

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.580 
sprites in the rendering because because
read<00:02:26.390> wrong<00:02:26.540> them<00:02:26.750> all<00:02:26.840> was<00:02:26.959> really<00:02:27.200> expensive

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
read wrong them all was really expensive

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.500 
read wrong them all was really expensive
so<00:02:27.920> we<00:02:28.010> kind<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.280> like<00:02:28.400> cash<00:02:28.670> this<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.390> whole

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
so we kind of like cash this the whole

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.240 
so we kind of like cash this the whole
screen<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.080> then<00:02:30.170> just<00:02:30.349> give<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.709> static

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
screen and then just give you the static

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.009 
screen and then just give you the static
page<00:02:31.489> of<00:02:31.730> sprites<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.120> then<00:02:32.630> we<00:02:32.750> do<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.900> little

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
page of sprites and then we do a little

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.210 
page of sprites and then we do a little
dirty<00:02:33.230> rectangles<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:33.890> show<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.130> where

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
dirty rectangles and show you where

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.070 
dirty rectangles and show you where
stuff<00:02:34.459> was<00:02:34.489> moving<00:02:34.849> its<00:02:35.300> new<00:02:35.390> SimCity<00:02:35.569> we're

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
stuff was moving its new SimCity we're

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.089 
stuff was moving its new SimCity we're
taking<00:02:36.230> advantage<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.590> modern<00:02:36.800> graphics

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
taking advantage of modern graphics

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.520 
taking advantage of modern graphics
hardware<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:37.849> you<00:02:37.940> can<00:02:38.060> fly<00:02:38.390> in<00:02:38.569> you<00:02:39.050> can<00:02:39.319> go

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
hardware so you can fly in you can go

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.500 
hardware so you can fly in you can go
down<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.739> ground<00:02:40.010> level<00:02:40.130> look<00:02:40.519> around<00:02:40.819> we<00:02:41.360> can

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
down to ground level look around we can

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.380 
down to ground level look around we can
render<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.900> know<00:02:42.319> 10,000<00:02:43.160> Sims<00:02:43.849> walk<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.269> run

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
render you know 10,000 Sims walk and run

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.090 
render you know 10,000 Sims walk and run
from<00:02:44.540> her<00:02:44.660> thousands<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.230> cars<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.980> know

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
from her thousands of cars you know

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.070 
from her thousands of cars you know
forests<00:02:46.610> going<00:02:46.819> up<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.060> horizon<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.959> we

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
forests going up to the horizon and we

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.750 
forests going up to the horizon and we
can<00:02:48.200> all<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.620> can<00:02:48.739> all<00:02:48.860> be<00:02:48.890> live<00:02:49.130> I'm<00:02:49.430> week<00:02:49.580> and

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
can all it can all be live I'm week and

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.160 
can all it can all be live I'm week and
we<00:02:49.880> can<00:02:49.910> dynamically<00:02:50.450> move<00:02:50.660> all<00:02:50.780> these<00:02:50.900> things

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
we can dynamically move all these things

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.800 
we can dynamically move all these things
so<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:52.370> factories<00:02:52.880> of<00:02:52.910> animated<00:02:53.390> parts<00:02:53.690> and

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
so so factories of animated parts and

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.030 
so so factories of animated parts and
you<00:02:53.870> can<00:02:54.019> see<00:02:54.230> that<00:02:54.260> they're<00:02:54.500> working<00:02:54.650> because

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
you can see that they're working because

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.470 
you can see that they're working because
all<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.340> animated<00:02:55.640> parts<00:02:55.850> are<00:02:55.970> doing<00:02:56.239> stuff

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
all the animated parts are doing stuff

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.360 
all the animated parts are doing stuff
so<00:02:57.049> on<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.200> graphic<00:02:57.560> side<00:02:57.739> I<00:02:57.769> mean<00:02:58.069> it's<00:02:58.190> night

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
so on the graphic side I mean it's night

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.530 
so on the graphic side I mean it's night
day<00:02:58.580> where<00:02:58.849> the<00:02:58.940> world's<00:02:59.209> moved<00:02:59.540> on

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
day where the world's moved on

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.259 
day where the world's moved on
tremendously<00:03:00.530> since<00:03:00.799> the<00:03:01.700> sprite<00:03:01.970> engines

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
tremendously since the sprite engines

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.509 
tremendously since the sprite engines
that<00:03:02.450> we<00:03:02.540> had<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:02.750> use<00:03:02.780> in<00:03:03.110> SimCity<00:03:03.680> 4<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:04.160> then

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
that we had to use in SimCity 4 and then

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.820 
that we had to use in SimCity 4 and then
just<00:03:05.239> in<00:03:05.390> terms<00:03:05.569> of<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.989> CPU<00:03:06.319> horsepower<00:03:06.709> we

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
just in terms of the CPU horsepower we

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.470 
just in terms of the CPU horsepower we
can<00:03:06.950> bring<00:03:07.099> to<00:03:07.130> bear<00:03:07.220> no<00:03:07.819> previous<00:03:08.060> SimCity's

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
can bring to bear no previous SimCity's

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
to do instead of that it's now it's a

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.710 
to do instead of that it's now it's a
bottom-up<00:03:55.220> simulation<00:03:55.790> for<00:03:56.269> all<00:03:56.450> the

interactions of all them compose the

interactions of all them compose the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
simulations of all so the simulation

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.140 
simulations of all so the simulation
emerges<00:04:03.859> out<00:04:04.069> of<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.370> interaction<00:04:04.819> of<00:04:04.880> people

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
emerges out of the interaction of people

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.069 
emerges out of the interaction of people
cars<00:04:05.660> people<00:04:06.049> buildings<00:04:06.850> trees<00:04:07.850> maps<00:04:08.600> and<00:04:08.989> so

cars people buildings trees maps and so

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.660 
cars people buildings trees maps and so
