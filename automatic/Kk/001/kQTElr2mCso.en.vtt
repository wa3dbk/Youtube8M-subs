here<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.800> brain<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.340> not<00:00:47.550> warm<00:00:47.910> enough<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.329> be

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
here your brain is not warm enough to be

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.240 
here your brain is not warm enough to be
ready<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:48.899> such<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> difficult<00:00:49.590> question<00:00:49.739> such

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
need to do first is warm up that brain

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.470 
need to do first is warm up that brain
with<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> little<00:00:54.840> brain<00:00:55.620> ganas<00:00:58.820> you<00:00:59.820> see<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
with a little brain ganas you see if you

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.790 
with a little brain ganas you see if you
thought<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.870> title<00:01:01.170> sequence<00:01:01.350> was<00:01:01.680> gonna

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
thought the title sequence was gonna

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.439 
thought the title sequence was gonna
start<00:01:02.129> again<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.730> were<00:01:02.910> completely

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the train a is going 50 miles per hour

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.450 
the train a is going 50 miles per hour
while<00:01:49.350> train<00:01:49.740> B<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.340> going<00:01:50.640> 50<00:01:51.030> qualm

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
while train B is going 50 qualm

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.190 
while train B is going 50 qualm
there's<00:01:51.670> an<00:01:51.790> hour<00:01:51.940> assuming<00:01:52.540> there's<00:01:52.720> no<00:01:52.780> wind

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
there's an hour assuming there's no wind

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.990 
there's an hour assuming there's no wind
and<00:01:53.409> both<00:01:53.650> trains<00:01:54.070> left<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.400> station<00:01:54.460> at<00:01:54.909> the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
and both trains left the station at the

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.090 
and both trains left the station at the
same<00:01:55.210> time<00:01:55.510> what<00:01:55.930> is<00:01:56.140> most<00:01:56.470> likely<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.920> be

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
same time what is most likely to be

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.770 
same time what is most likely to be
yelled<00:01:57.310> out<00:01:57.430> by<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.610> passengers<00:01:58.210> on<00:01:58.420> train<00:01:58.750> a

yelled out by the passengers on train a

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.060 
yelled out by the passengers on train a
is<00:01:59.260> it<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.740> all<00:02:00.159> of<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.610> above<00:02:00.909> B<00:02:01.450> help<00:02:02.080> see<00:02:02.680> no

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
is it a all of the above B help see no

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.899 
is it a all of the above B help see no
or<00:02:04.000> D<00:02:04.240> let<00:02:04.540> go<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:05.440> mean<00:02:06.070> I<00:02:06.159> how<00:02:06.460> am<00:02:06.520> I<00:02:06.640> supposed

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
or D let go I mean I how am I supposed

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.800 
or D let go I mean I how am I supposed
to<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.330> guess<00:02:07.960> C<00:02:08.890> so<00:02:09.220> close<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.850> answers<00:02:10.209> B<00:02:10.479> C

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
to I guess C so close the answers B C

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.360 
to I guess C so close the answers B C
and<00:02:10.989> D<00:02:11.170> actually<00:02:11.680> would<00:02:11.920> have<00:02:12.040> been<00:02:12.190> correct

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
and D actually would have been correct

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.250 
and D actually would have been correct
if<00:02:12.610> we<00:02:12.730> were<00:02:12.819> talking<00:02:13.120> about<00:02:13.209> train<00:02:13.540> B<00:02:13.810> because

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
if we were talking about train B because

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.750 
if we were talking about train B because
it's<00:02:14.410> probably<00:02:14.860> filled<00:02:15.130> with<00:02:15.280> foreigners

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
it's probably filled with foreigners

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.220 
it's probably filled with foreigners
being<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.150> they<00:02:16.270> measure<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.690> kilometers

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
being that they measure in kilometers

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.199 
being that they measure in kilometers
however<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.800> question<00:02:18.010> was<00:02:18.370> about<00:02:18.489> train<00:02:18.970> a

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
however the question was about train a

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.030 
however the question was about train a
measured<00:02:19.720> in<00:02:19.840> miles<00:02:20.110> per<00:02:20.500> hour<00:02:20.590> which<00:02:20.830> means

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
measured in miles per hour which means

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.010 
measured in miles per hour which means
most<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.640> passengers<00:02:21.880> were<00:02:22.360> Americans

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
most of the passengers were Americans

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.509 
most of the passengers were Americans
and<00:02:23.110> those<00:02:23.319> are<00:02:23.530> not<00:02:23.709> what<00:02:23.890> Americans<00:02:24.370> would

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
and those are not what Americans would

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.610 
and those are not what Americans would
say<00:02:24.730> in<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:25.000> scenario<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.840> mean<00:02:26.050> even<00:02:26.350> with

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
say in that scenario I mean even with

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.110 
say in that scenario I mean even with
that<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:27.070> all<00:02:27.190> that's<00:02:27.340> left<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:27.940> letter

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
that that all that's left is the letter

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.759 
that that all that's left is the letter
A<00:02:28.209> all<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.900> above<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.410> there's<00:02:29.530> nothing

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
A all of the above and there's nothing

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.130 
A all of the above and there's nothing
else<00:02:29.860> above<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.519> so<00:02:30.850> wrong<00:02:31.209> again<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.810> answer

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
else above it so wrong again the answer

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.650 
else above it so wrong again the answer
is<00:02:32.380> actually<00:02:32.800> a<00:02:33.130> all<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:34.000> above<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.600> have

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
is actually a all of the above you have

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.810 
is actually a all of the above you have

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
to think outside of the box with box you

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.509 
to think outside of the box with box you
see<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.000> correct<00:02:37.390> answers<00:02:37.780> were<00:02:38.019> e<00:02:38.290> who<00:02:39.100> cares

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519
