00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
that position I don't see the the

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.380 
that position I don't see the the

Minnesota Vikings Chicago Bears beating
the<00:01:43.869> detroit<00:01:44.380> lions<00:01:44.409> are<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:44.950> second<00:01:45.369> place

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
the detroit lions are the second place

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.999 
the detroit lions are the second place
in<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.909> NFC<00:01:46.270> north<00:01:46.720> so<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.229> i<00:01:47.470> do<00:01:47.710> believe

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
in the NFC north so I i do believe

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.469 
in the NFC north so I i do believe
they're<00:01:48.250> gonna<00:01:48.369> probably<00:01:48.729> improve<00:01:49.180> on<00:01:49.360> the

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
they're gonna probably improve on the

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.600 
they're gonna probably improve on the
record<00:01:49.899> but<00:01:50.590> I<00:01:50.649> don't<00:01:50.979> think<00:01:51.100> they<00:01:51.220> could<00:01:51.310> beat

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
record but I don't think they could beat

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.179 
record but I don't think they could beat
out<00:01:51.790> Bay<00:01:52.390> Packers<00:01:52.780> for<00:01:52.990> first<00:01:53.350> place<00:01:53.560> let<00:01:54.100> me
