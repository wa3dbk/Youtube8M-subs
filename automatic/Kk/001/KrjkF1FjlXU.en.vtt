00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.590 
system can kind of understand what we're
doing<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:48.980> let's<00:00:49.760> get<00:00:49.880> started<00:00:50.150> now<00:00:50.270> we<00:00:50.420> don't

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
doing so let's get started now we don't

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.020 
doing so let's get started now we don't
focus<00:00:51.440> on<00:00:51.770> shooting<00:00:51.980> babies<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:52.550> infants<00:00:52.880> we

studio<00:00:54.860> but<00:00:55.490> I<00:00:55.520> have<00:00:55.790> done<00:00:56.000> my<00:00:56.180> fair<00:00:56.210> share<00:00:56.420> and

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
studio but I have done my fair share and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.569 
studio but I have done my fair share and
there's<00:00:56.960> two<00:00:57.230> very<00:00:57.770> noticeable<00:00:58.160> things<00:00:58.430> that

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
there's two very noticeable things that

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.480 
there's two very noticeable things that
I<00:00:58.610> always<00:00:58.820> kind<00:00:59.420> of<00:00:59.510> see<00:00:59.750> with<00:01:00.110> infants<00:01:00.650> number

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
I always kind of see with infants number

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.580 
I always kind of see with infants number
one<00:01:01.670> is<00:01:01.820> that<00:01:01.850> their<00:01:02.329> skin<00:01:02.720> tones<00:01:02.990> are<00:01:03.170> often<00:01:03.470> a

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
one is that their skin tones are often a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.229 
one is that their skin tones are often a
little<00:01:03.740> bit<00:01:03.920> more<00:01:04.100> on<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.400> pink<00:01:04.699> side<00:01:04.909> and

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
little bit more on the pink side and

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.270 
little bit more on the pink side and
number<00:01:05.930> two<00:01:06.140> is<00:01:06.320> that<00:01:06.350> because<00:01:06.770> their<00:01:06.950> skin

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
number two is that because their skin

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.219 
number two is that because their skin
hasn't<00:01:07.640> quite<00:01:07.880> fully<00:01:08.180> developed

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
hasn't quite fully developed

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.380 
hasn't quite fully developed
it's<00:01:09.590> rather<00:01:09.829> thin<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:10.549> you<00:01:10.610> can<00:01:10.759> see<00:01:11.030> quite<00:01:11.270> a

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
it's rather thin and you can see quite a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.300 
it's rather thin and you can see quite a
bit<00:01:11.570> of<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:12.049> veins<00:01:12.290> underneath<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.890> skin<00:01:13.130> so

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
bit of the veins underneath the skin so

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.069 
bit of the veins underneath the skin so
we<00:01:13.970> need<00:01:14.119> to<00:01:14.180> make<00:01:14.299> sure<00:01:14.360> that<00:01:14.570> we<00:01:14.659> address

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
we need to make sure that we address

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.420 
we need to make sure that we address
these<00:01:15.229> two<00:01:15.470> things<00:01:15.770> when<00:01:15.979> we<00:01:16.040> create<00:01:16.310> our

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
these two things when we create our

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.520 
these two things when we create our
preset<00:01:16.880> now<00:01:17.090> as<00:01:17.240> always<00:01:17.750> when<00:01:18.409> you're

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
creating a new preset we always

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.310 
creating a new preset we always
recommend<00:01:20.510> that<00:01:20.690> you<00:01:20.780> use<00:01:20.810> an<00:01:20.990> image<00:01:21.080> that's

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
recommend that you use an image that's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.649 
recommend that you use an image that's
properly<00:01:21.800> exposed<00:01:22.220> that<00:01:22.880> way<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.300> exposure

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
properly exposed that way the exposure

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.360 
properly exposed that way the exposure
adjustments<00:01:24.200> are<00:01:24.320> based<00:01:24.680> on<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:24.979> proper

adjustments are based on a proper

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.980 
adjustments are based on a proper
exposure<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:26.000> not<00:01:26.240> because<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.690> image<00:01:26.900> is

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
exposure and not because the image is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.770

are built in the standard four preset
and<00:03:23.680> with<00:03:23.769> white<00:03:23.980> balance<00:03:24.340> we<00:03:24.849> want<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.150> dial

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
and with white balance we want to dial

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.899 
and with white balance we want to dial
that<00:03:25.480> in<00:03:25.659> on<00:03:25.810> each<00:03:26.019> a<00:03:26.200> image<00:03:26.859> itself<00:03:27.219> with

that in on each a image itself with

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.159 
that in on each a image itself with
exposure<00:03:28.269> you<00:03:28.450> can<00:03:28.599> choose<00:03:28.840> whether<00:03:29.049> or<00:03:29.109> not

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
exposure you can choose whether or not

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.689 
exposure you can choose whether or not
you<00:03:29.260> want<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.620> include<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:30.069> if<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:30.519> do

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
you want to include that if you do

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:31.770 
you want to include that if you do
include<00:03:30.940> it<00:03:31.120> it's<00:03:31.239> going<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.389> zero<00:03:31.659> out<00:03:31.720> the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
include it it's going to zero out the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.089 
include it it's going to zero out the
exposure<00:03:32.049> with<00:03:32.319> every<00:03:32.500> image<00:03:32.799> that<00:03:33.010> you

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
exposure with every image that you

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.430 
exposure with every image that you
select<00:03:33.519> if<00:03:33.819> you<00:03:34.359> don't<00:03:34.569> select<00:03:34.780> it<00:03:35.049> it<00:03:35.169> won't

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
select if you don't select it it won't

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.319 
select if you don't select it it won't
adjust<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.159> exposure<00:03:36.489> it'll<00:03:36.819> just<00:03:37.000> apply<00:03:37.269> the

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
adjust the exposure it'll just apply the

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.300 
adjust the exposure it'll just apply the
overall<00:03:37.780> effect<00:03:38.109> I'm<00:03:38.680> gonna<00:03:38.859> keep<00:03:39.040> it<00:03:39.190> on

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
overall effect I'm gonna keep it on

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.800 
overall effect I'm gonna keep it on
there<00:03:39.489> because<00:03:39.729> I<00:03:39.760> like<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.209> keep<00:03:40.389> exposure

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
there because I like to keep exposure

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.929 
there because I like to keep exposure
because<00:03:41.139> it<00:03:41.229> tells<00:03:41.500> me<00:03:41.709> where<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.669> image

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:42.939 
because it tells me where the image

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:44.670 
because it tells me where the image
exposure<00:03:43.269> should<00:03:43.510> be<00:03:43.689> for<00:03:44.229> this<00:03:44.349> image<00:03:44.590> to

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
exposure should be for this image to

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.659 
exposure should be for this image to
tell<00:03:44.889> me<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.129> basically<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.519> image

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
tell me that basically the image

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.670 
tell me that basically the image
exposure<00:03:46.060> should<00:03:46.269> be<00:03:46.389> set<00:03:46.659> to<00:03:46.900> correct

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
exposure should be set to correct

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.250 
exposure should be set to correct
exposure<00:03:48.239> alright<00:03:49.239> so<00:03:49.479> we're<00:03:49.930> gonna<00:03:49.989> hit

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
exposure alright so we're gonna hit

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.439 
exposure alright so we're gonna hit
create<00:03:50.620> at<00:03:50.739> this<00:03:50.919> point<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.819> should<00:03:52.030> pop<00:03:52.239> in

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
create at this point it should pop in

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.170 
create at this point it should pop in
right<00:03:52.479> there<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:54.340> actually<00:03:54.430> added<00:03:54.849> a<00:03:54.939> dash

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
right there and I actually added a dash

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.460 
right there and I actually added a dash
and<00:03:55.389> we<00:03:55.419> didn't<00:03:55.629> need<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.840> add<00:03:55.930> a<00:03:55.959> dash<00:03:56.169> let's

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
and we didn't need to add a dash let's

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.229 
and we didn't need to add a dash let's
remove<00:03:57.009> that<00:03:57.189> -<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:57.549> it's<00:03:57.699> consistent<00:03:58.209> with

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
remove that - so it's consistent with

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.330 
remove that - so it's consistent with
the<00:03:58.359> other<00:03:58.449> ones<00:03:58.840> and<00:03:59.109> there<00:03:59.979> we<00:04:00.069> go

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
the other ones and there we go

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.469 
the other ones and there we go
I<00:04:00.370> just<00:04:00.609> clicked<00:04:00.819> right<00:04:01.030> click<00:04:01.269> and<00:04:01.449> hit

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:01.479 
I just clicked right click and hit

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:02.990 
I just clicked right click and hit
rename<00:04:01.900> in<00:04:02.019> case<00:04:02.199> you<00:04:02.319> guys<00:04:02.409> missed<00:04:02.709> that

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
alright so we're done with our preset

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.390 
alright so we're done with our preset
let's<00:04:05.079> check<00:04:05.290> out<00:04:05.439> the<00:04:05.590> before<00:04:05.979> and<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.370> after

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
let's check out the before and the after

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.179 
let's check out the before and the after
here's<00:04:06.819> the<00:04:06.970> before<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.560> here<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:09.009> after

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:09.189 
here's the before and here is the after

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.670 
here's the before and here is the after
we<00:04:10.090> still<00:04:10.329> have<00:04:10.509> you<00:04:10.750> know<00:04:10.780> babies<00:04:11.199> oftentimes

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
we still have you know babies oftentimes

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.140 
we still have you know babies oftentimes
they'll<00:04:11.859> be<00:04:11.979> a<00:04:12.009> little<00:04:12.280> more<00:04:12.459> pink<00:04:12.729> in<00:04:12.849> certain

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
they'll be a little more pink in certain

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.819 
they'll be a little more pink in certain
areas<00:04:13.540> and<00:04:13.750> so<00:04:13.900> if<00:04:14.079> we<00:04:14.229> wanted<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.530> correct

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
areas and so if we wanted to correct

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.379 
areas and so if we wanted to correct
this<00:04:14.979> we<00:04:15.129> would<00:04:15.250> need<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.400> actually<00:04:15.609> brush<00:04:16.180> in

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
this we would need to actually brush in

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.990 
this we would need to actually brush in
a<00:04:16.479> little<00:04:16.720> more<00:04:16.870> warming<00:04:17.380> kind<00:04:18.310> of<00:04:18.400> tones<00:04:18.639> into

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
a little more warming kind of tones into

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.120 
a little more warming kind of tones into
that<00:04:19.120> area<00:04:19.479> but<00:04:20.109> it's<00:04:20.470> kind<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:20.650> beyond<00:04:20.919> at

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
that area but it's kind of beyond at

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.560 
that area but it's kind of beyond at
this<00:04:21.250> tutorial<00:04:21.669> so<00:04:21.789> we'll<00:04:21.940> skip<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.210> for<00:04:22.509> now

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
this tutorial so we'll skip that for now

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.870 
this tutorial so we'll skip that for now
let's<00:04:23.409> go<00:04:23.620> over<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.919> actual<00:04:24.370> settings<00:04:24.759> so<00:04:24.849> you

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
let's go over the actual settings so you

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.270 
let's go over the actual settings so you
guys<00:04:25.060> kind<00:04:25.240> of<00:04:25.270> know<00:04:25.509> what<00:04:25.840> was<00:04:25.990> done<00:04:26.229> now<00:04:26.979> over

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
guys kind of know what was done now over

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.159 
guys kind of know what was done now over
on<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.490> base<00:04:27.729> the<00:04:28.300> basic<00:04:28.630> adjustments<00:04:28.990> here

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
on the base the basic adjustments here

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.260 
on the base the basic adjustments here
on<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.440> tones<00:04:29.710> we<00:04:30.430> basically<00:04:30.699> pull<00:04:31.030> down<00:04:31.180> the

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
on the tones we basically pull down the

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.670 
on the tones we basically pull down the
highlights<00:04:31.659> and<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.840> whites<00:04:32.110> we've<00:04:32.440> brought

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
highlights and the whites we've brought

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.930 
highlights and the whites we've brought
up<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.919> shadows<00:04:33.250> in<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.430> blacks<00:04:33.669> a<00:04:33.789> little

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
up the shadows in the blacks a little

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.820 
up the shadows in the blacks a little
bit<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:34.180> this<00:04:34.300> kind<00:04:34.509> of<00:04:34.599> pulls<00:04:35.080> all<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.620> tones

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
bit and this kind of pulls all the tones

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.250 
bit and this kind of pulls all the tones
in<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:36.310> reduces<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.360> shadows<00:04:37.779> and<00:04:37.990> the

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
in and reduces the shadows and the

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.040 
in and reduces the shadows and the
highlights<00:04:38.289> over<00:04:39.039> skin<00:04:39.279> tones

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
highlights over skin tones

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.629 
highlights over skin tones
we<00:04:40.410> have<00:04:40.590> then<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:40.919> reduced<00:04:41.220> clarity<00:04:41.580> to

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
we have then and reduced clarity to

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.400 
we have then and reduced clarity to
negative<00:04:41.910> 25<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:42.599> we<00:04:42.660> brought<00:04:42.900> vibrance<00:04:43.379> and

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
negative 25 and we brought vibrance and

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.189 
negative 25 and we brought vibrance and
everything<00:04:43.710> back<00:04:43.919> down<00:04:44.129> to<00:04:44.370> zero<00:04:44.879> going<00:04:45.810> on<00:04:46.020> to

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
everything back down to zero going on to

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.159 
everything back down to zero going on to
our<00:04:46.319> tone<00:04:46.560> curve<00:04:47.210> we've<00:04:48.210> basically<00:04:48.479> added<00:04:49.080> a

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
our tone curve we've basically added a

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.860 
our tone curve we've basically added a
contrast<00:04:49.919> adding<00:04:50.190> s-curve<00:04:50.759> and<00:04:51.000> we've<00:04:51.629> added

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
contrast adding s-curve and we've added

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.480 
contrast adding s-curve and we've added
a<00:04:52.050> little<00:04:52.229> bit<00:04:52.409> of<00:04:52.500> reds<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:52.979> a<00:04:53.099> little<00:04:53.310> bit<00:04:53.400> of

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
a little bit of reds and a little bit of

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.430 
a little bit of reds and a little bit of
greens<00:04:53.819> to<00:04:54.090> this<00:04:54.180> curve<00:04:54.449> while<00:04:54.810> pulling<00:04:55.259> down

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
greens to this curve while pulling down

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.589 
greens to this curve while pulling down
just<00:04:55.710> a<00:04:55.800> little<00:04:55.830> bit<00:04:56.280> of<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.520> blues<00:04:56.789> and<00:04:57.060> this

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
just a little bit of the blues and this

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.230 
just a little bit of the blues and this
gives<00:04:57.870> it<00:04:57.960> that<00:04:58.139> overall<00:04:58.590> warming<00:04:58.949> tone<00:04:59.370> now

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
gives it that overall warming tone now

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.580 
gives it that overall warming tone now
moving<00:05:00.810> down<00:05:00.870> from<00:05:00.990> there<00:05:01.289> we<00:05:01.409> have<00:05:01.560> our

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
moving down from there we have our

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.790 
moving down from there we have our
detail<00:05:02.099> with<00:05:02.909> our<00:05:03.180> extra<00:05:03.900> softening<00:05:04.409> what<00:05:04.620> has

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
detail with our extra softening what has

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.469 
detail with our extra softening what has
happened<00:05:05.159> basically<00:05:05.460> is<00:05:05.580> it's<00:05:05.759> done<00:05:06.000> a<00:05:06.030> little

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
happened basically is it's done a little

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.200 
happened basically is it's done a little
bit<00:05:06.599> of<00:05:06.750> detail<00:05:07.340> adjustments<00:05:08.340> here<00:05:08.550> we<00:05:09.060> have

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
bit of detail adjustments here we have

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.879 
bit of detail adjustments here we have

the same standard sharpening setting as

just<00:05:14.759> a<00:05:14.940> tiny<00:05:15.150> bit<00:05:15.360> more<00:05:15.690> now<00:05:16.500> at<00:05:16.650> 30<00:05:17.009> with

just a tiny bit more now at 30 with
these<00:05:17.490> close-up<00:05:17.759> portraits<00:05:18.270> you're<00:05:18.419> not

these close-up portraits you're not

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:20.749 
these close-up portraits you're not
going<00:05:18.720> to<00:05:18.780> notice<00:05:18.930> any<00:05:19.259> loss<00:05:19.800> in<00:05:19.830> detail<00:05:20.550> but

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
going to notice any loss in detail but

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.550 
going to notice any loss in detail but
you<00:05:20.880> will<00:05:21.060> notice<00:05:21.389> the<00:05:21.569> skin<00:05:21.900> and<00:05:22.139> the<00:05:22.259> pores

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
you will notice the skin and the pores

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.469 
you will notice the skin and the pores
will<00:05:23.250> be<00:05:23.280> quite<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.610> bit<00:05:23.759> softer<00:05:24.150> so<00:05:24.300> it's<00:05:24.419> a

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
will be quite a bit softer so it's a

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.629 
will be quite a bit softer so it's a
great<00:05:24.750> overall<00:05:25.169> look<00:05:25.380> there<00:05:25.620> with<00:05:26.430> lens

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
great overall look there with lens

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:27.830 
great overall look there with lens
vidiian<00:05:26.909> we<00:05:27.000> have<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.210> standard<00:05:27.539> amount<00:05:27.690> of

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
vidiian we have the standard amount of

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.659 
vidiian we have the standard amount of
30<00:05:28.110> with<00:05:28.470> the<00:05:28.500> midpoint<00:05:29.009> of<00:05:29.069> 30<00:05:29.310> and<00:05:29.550> that

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
30 with the midpoint of 30 and that

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.120 
30 with the midpoint of 30 and that
creates<00:05:30.030> our<00:05:30.180> standard<00:05:30.720> kind<00:05:31.319> of<00:05:31.380> uniform

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
creates our standard kind of uniform

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.709 
creates our standard kind of uniform
edged<00:05:32.340> edge<00:05:32.550> brightness<00:05:33.060> that<00:05:33.240> we<00:05:33.389> have<00:05:33.539> in<00:05:33.659> a

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:33.719 
edged edge brightness that we have in a

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:34.879 
edged edge brightness that we have in a
standard<00:05:34.020> import<00:05:34.380> preset

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
to another image and let's check it out

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.129 
to another image and let's check it out
so<00:05:38.520> here's<00:05:38.759> another<00:05:39.060> baby<00:05:39.569> portrait<00:05:40.020> and

so here's another baby portrait and
let's<00:05:40.259> apply<00:05:40.530> this<00:05:40.590> from<00:05:41.129> here<00:05:41.310> on<00:05:41.400> out

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
let's apply this from here on out

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:43.369 
let's apply this from here on out
basically<00:05:42.270> all<00:05:42.419> you<00:05:42.539> should<00:05:42.659> be<00:05:42.690> adjusting<00:05:43.229> is

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:43.379 
basically all you should be adjusting is

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:44.689 
basically all you should be adjusting is
really<00:05:43.680> just<00:05:43.919> the<00:05:44.009> temperature<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:44.639> the

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 
really just the temperature and the

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:46.640 
really just the temperature and the
exposure<00:05:45.090> so<00:05:45.539> we're<00:05:45.659> gonna<00:05:45.750> select<00:05:45.960> that<00:05:46.319> and

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
exposure so we're gonna select that and

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.800 
exposure so we're gonna select that and
I<00:05:47.280> actually<00:05:47.340> really<00:05:47.729> like<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.330> warmth<00:05:48.659> on

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
I actually really like the warmth on

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:49.969 
I actually really like the warmth on
this<00:05:48.930> image<00:05:49.199> it's<00:05:49.380> a<00:05:49.440> little<00:05:49.620> bit<00:05:49.710> on<00:05:49.770> the<00:05:49.860> warm

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
this image it's a little bit on the warm

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.830 
this image it's a little bit on the warm
side<00:05:50.190> but<00:05:50.370> I<00:05:50.400> kind<00:05:50.669> of<00:05:50.729> dig<00:05:50.909> that<00:05:51.060> look<00:05:51.389> anyway

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
side but I kind of dig that look anyway

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.659 
side but I kind of dig that look anyway
I'm<00:05:52.289> gonna<00:05:52.500> bring<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:52.949> exposure<00:05:53.219> down<00:05:53.460> just

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
I'm gonna bring the exposure down just

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.059 
I'm gonna bring the exposure down just
one<00:05:53.940> little<00:05:54.330> click<00:05:54.750> just<00:05:55.529> to<00:05:55.620> pull<00:05:55.830> it<00:05:55.919> back<00:05:56.009> a

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:56.069
