00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
years ago was for speculation hopefully

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.319 
years ago was for speculation hopefully
by<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.099> time<00:02:56.189> you<00:02:56.700> close<00:02:56.970> on<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.299> property

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
by the time you close on the property

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.990 
by the time you close on the property
it's<00:02:57.870> going<00:02:58.109> up<00:02:58.230> substantially<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.129> again<00:02:59.760> if

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
it's going up substantially and again if

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.119 
it's going up substantially and again if
we<00:03:00.209> go<00:03:00.390> back<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.930> year<00:03:01.079> 2000<00:03:01.799> up<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.040> the

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
we go back to the year 2000 up to the

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.190 
we go back to the year 2000 up to the
year<00:03:02.250> two<00:03:02.400> thousand<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:02.879> six<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.750> was

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
year two thousand and six this was

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.780 
year two thousand and six this was
definitely<00:03:04.590> something<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.400> could<00:03:05.639> happen

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
definitely something that could happen

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.030 
definitely something that could happen
you<00:03:06.450> end<00:03:06.480> up<00:03:06.690> buying<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.349> a<00:03:07.739> couple<00:03:07.920> years

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
you end up buying and a couple years

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.619 
you end up buying and a couple years
later<00:03:08.220> when<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:08.609> closes<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.090> values<00:03:09.510> have

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
later when it closes the values have

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.720 
later when it closes the values have
gone<00:03:09.690> up<00:03:10.019> but<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.739> think<00:03:10.980> we've<00:03:11.129> hit<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.430> plateau

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
gone up but I think we've hit a plateau

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.910 
gone up but I think we've hit a plateau
at<00:03:12.150> this<00:03:12.299> point<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:12.840> if<00:03:13.170> we<00:03:13.290> take<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.500> look<00:03:13.769> at

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
at this point and if we take a look at

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.800 
at this point and if we take a look at
the<00:03:14.040> actual<00:03:14.250> values<00:03:14.700> how<00:03:15.030> quickly<00:03:15.420> will<00:03:15.629> they

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
the actual values how quickly will they

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.410 
the actual values how quickly will they
go<00:03:15.989> up<00:03:16.170> moving<00:03:16.650> forward<00:03:17.069> if<00:03:17.250> we<00:03:17.970> are<00:03:18.090> at<00:03:18.269> the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
go up moving forward if we are at the

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.479 
go up moving forward if we are at the

marketplace two years from now can you

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.250 
marketplace two years from now can you
really<00:03:23.489> make<00:03:23.609> that<00:03:23.909> much<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.269> profit<00:03:24.480> keep

really make that much of a profit keep

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.780 
really make that much of a profit keep
in<00:03:25.409> mind<00:03:25.439> you<00:03:25.650> have<00:03:25.680> closing<00:03:26.099> costs<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.519> in

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
in mind you have closing costs and in

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.099 
in mind you have closing costs and in
the<00:03:26.849> Toronto<00:03:27.030> area<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:27.599> have<00:03:27.629> to<00:03:27.930> land

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
the Toronto area you have to land

the Toronto area you have to land
transfer<00:03:28.590> taxes<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:29.609> ultimately<00:03:29.849> there's<00:03:30.750> a

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
transfer taxes so ultimately there's a

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.449 
transfer taxes so ultimately there's a

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
lot of costs going out and if you're

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.580 
lot of costs going out and if you're
carrying<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.909> property<00:03:33.389> then<00:03:33.989> again<00:03:34.139> it's

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
carrying the property then again it's

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.830 
carrying the property then again it's
money<00:03:34.889> out<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.069> your<00:03:35.220> own<00:03:35.280> pocket<00:03:35.449> now<00:03:36.449> one

other thing that we didn't add is the
