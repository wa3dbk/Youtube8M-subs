turn it on it should still sound like
it's<00:00:54.780> off<00:00:55.789> because<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.000> not<00:00:57.120> tight<00:00:57.329> enough

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
what I actually starts doing is it

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.910

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
raising the tension to the bottom head

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.230 
raising the tension to the bottom head
making<00:02:10.380> it<00:02:10.470> higher<00:02:10.680> in<00:02:10.890> pitch<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.400> also<00:02:11.940> the

making it higher in pitch and also the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.670 
making it higher in pitch and also the
wires<00:02:12.570> get<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.020> tight<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.410> they<00:02:13.530> don't

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
wires get so tight that they don't

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.950 
wires get so tight that they don't
really<00:02:13.920> want<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.220> ring<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.610> anymore<00:02:14.820> so<00:02:15.480> you're

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
really want to ring it anymore so you're

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.430 
really want to ring it anymore so you're
creating<00:02:16.650> kind<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.220> tight<00:02:17.720> sound<00:02:18.720> that's<00:02:19.170> a

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
creating kind of a tight sound that's a

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.470 
creating kind of a tight sound that's a
choking<00:02:20.040> sound<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.790> if<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.030> like<00:02:21.240> that

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
choking sound and if you like that

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.720 
choking sound and if you like that
that's<00:02:21.750> fine<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.410> don't<00:02:22.920> personally<00:02:23.100> like<00:02:23.370> it

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
that's fine I don't personally like it

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.370 
that's fine I don't personally like it
and<00:02:24.360> I'll<00:02:24.480> show<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.630> something<00:02:25.110> else<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.320> that

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
and I'll show you something else in that

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.110 
and I'll show you something else in that
in<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> moment<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:26.190> started<00:02:26.910> with<00:02:26.970> an

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
in a moment so we started with an

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.400 
in a moment so we started with an
extreme<00:02:27.510> tension<00:02:29.660> lack<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.840> tension<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.230> guess

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
extreme tension lack of tension I guess

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.730 
extreme tension lack of tension I guess
so<00:02:31.860> now<00:02:31.980> I'm<00:02:32.070> going<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.250> make<00:02:32.370> an<00:02:32.520> extreme

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
so now I'm going to make an extreme

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.480 
so now I'm going to make an extreme
tension<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.160> it's<00:02:35.250> going<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.430> be

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
tension to this so it's going to be

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:43.310 
tension to this so it's going to be
really<00:02:35.640> high<00:02:36.020> really<00:02:37.020> tight<00:02:41.660> now<00:02:42.660> now<00:02:43.020> this

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
really high really tight now now this

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.760 
really high really tight now now this
drum<00:02:43.830> which<00:02:44.100> would<00:02:44.250> be<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.370> drum<00:02:44.640> set<00:02:44.820> drum<00:02:45.150> or<00:02:45.360> a

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
drum which would be a drum set drum or a

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.230 
drum which would be a drum set drum or a
concert<00:02:46.770> or<00:02:46.920> orchestral<00:02:47.610> drum<00:02:47.790> sounds<00:02:48.120> like

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
concert or orchestral drum sounds like

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.640 
concert or orchestral drum sounds like
it's<00:02:48.360> marching<00:02:48.720> snare<00:02:48.840> drum<00:02:49.170> now<00:02:49.320> it's<00:02:49.500> so

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.959 

I'm<00:03:51.829> not<00:03:52.010> affecting<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.400> pitch<00:03:52.640> of<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.849> drum

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:52.969 
I'm not affecting the pitch of the drum

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:54.339 
I'm not affecting the pitch of the drum
really<00:03:53.299> cuz<00:03:53.569> I'm<00:03:53.689> not<00:03:53.780> putting<00:03:54.079> a<00:03:54.139> whole<00:03:54.170> lot

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
really cuz I'm not putting a whole lot

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.119 
really cuz I'm not putting a whole lot
of<00:03:54.379> tension<00:03:54.739> on<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:54.889> bottom<00:03:55.040> head<00:03:55.430> down<00:03:55.939> here

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
these here waters Brocade is there

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.980 
these here waters Brocade is there
they're<00:04:22.130> decent<00:04:22.340> shape<00:04:22.699> but<00:04:23.419> sometimes<00:04:23.810> you

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
they're decent shape but sometimes you

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.659 
they're decent shape but sometimes you
might<00:04:24.110> get<00:04:24.289> some<00:04:24.560> that<00:04:24.740> are<00:04:24.860> loose<00:04:25.070> from<00:04:25.520> time

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
might get some that are loose from time

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.550 
might get some that are loose from time
to<00:04:25.789> time<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.840> so<00:04:27.139> you<00:04:27.169> might<00:04:27.349> have<00:04:27.500> to

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
to time and so you might have to

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.080 
to time and so you might have to
overcompensate<00:04:27.979> by<00:04:28.430> making<00:04:28.699> this<00:04:28.789> a<00:04:28.849> little

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
overcompensate by making this a little

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.120 
overcompensate by making this a little
tighter<00:04:29.300> but<00:04:30.289> there's<00:04:30.470> tricks<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:30.949> stuff

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
tighter but there's tricks and stuff

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
tighter but there's tricks and stuff
that<00:04:31.160> you<00:04:31.370> can<00:04:31.490> do<00:04:31.580> with<00:04:31.699> that<00:04:31.820> that'll

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
that you can do with that that'll

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.370 
that you can do with that that'll
probably<00:04:32.240> show<00:04:32.509> you<00:04:32.570> in<00:04:32.750> some<00:04:32.900> other<00:04:33.020> videos

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
probably show you in some other videos

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.589 
probably show you in some other videos
but<00:04:34.310> before<00:04:34.669> is<00:04:34.759> what<00:04:34.970> you're<00:04:35.090> concerned<00:04:35.360> for

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
but before is what you're concerned for

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.360 
but before is what you're concerned for
today<00:04:35.840> it's<00:04:36.410> because<00:04:36.680> this<00:04:36.860> rests<00:04:37.190> on<00:04:37.280> the

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
today it's because this rests on the

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.439 
today it's because this rests on the
bottom<00:04:37.639> head<00:04:37.820> you<00:04:37.910> don't<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.180> make<00:04:38.240> it<00:04:38.360> too

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
bottom head you don't to make it too

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
if it's too tight you won't hear the
