00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
it push-pull split it puts on mass but

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.460 
it push-pull split it puts on mass but
it<00:00:33.940> also<00:00:34.060> helps<00:00:34.390> get<00:00:34.510> you<00:00:34.630> ripped<00:00:35.020> this<00:00:35.350> is

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
what I use most of the time throughout

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.530 
what I use most of the time throughout
the<00:00:37.510> year<00:00:37.630> so<00:00:38.140> how<00:00:38.260> it<00:00:38.380> works<00:00:38.410> is<00:00:39.180> first<00:00:40.180> day

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
the year so how it works is first day

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.780 
the year so how it works is first day
one<00:00:40.870> is<00:00:41.140> a<00:00:41.710> push<00:00:42.190> day

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
one is a push day

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.330 
one is a push day
all<00:00:43.570> right<00:00:43.780> meaning<00:00:43.990> you<00:00:44.470> use<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.920> muscles

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
all right meaning you use the muscles

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.650 
all right meaning you use the muscles
the<00:00:45.520> upper<00:00:45.550> body<00:00:45.910> muscles<00:00:46.420> that<00:00:46.540> are

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
the upper body muscles that are

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.200 
the upper body muscles that are
responsible<00:00:46.690> for<00:00:47.290> pushing<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.610> then<00:00:48.760> that's

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
responsible for pushing and then that's

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.640 
responsible for pushing and then that's
a<00:00:49.390> chest<00:00:50.340> shoulders<00:00:51.340> triceps<00:00:52.290> all<00:00:53.290> of<00:00:53.560> those

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
a chest shoulders triceps all of those

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.700 
a chest shoulders triceps all of those
muscles<00:00:54.000> work<00:00:55.000> together<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:55.690> they<00:00:56.080> all<00:00:56.290> push

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
muscles work together and they all push

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.930 
muscles work together and they all push
you<00:00:57.100> know<00:00:57.160> I'm<00:00:57.280> saying<00:00:57.490> like<00:00:57.700> when<00:00:57.850> you're

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
you know I'm saying like when you're

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.900 
you know I'm saying like when you're
doing<00:00:58.180> push-ups<00:00:59.050> or<00:00:59.590> bench<00:00:59.830> press<00:01:00.160> you<00:01:00.790> know

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
doing push-ups or bench press you know

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.310 
doing push-ups or bench press you know
you're<00:01:01.120> pushing<00:01:01.450> and<00:01:01.840> it<00:01:01.960> works<00:01:02.140> those

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
you're pushing and it works those

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.619 
you're pushing and it works those
muscles<00:01:02.800> on<00:01:02.980> and<00:01:03.220> then<00:01:03.460> they<00:01:03.640> -<00:01:03.700> we're<00:01:04.509> going

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
muscles on and then they - we're going

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.780 
muscles on and then they - we're going
to<00:01:04.689> work<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.960> pull<00:01:05.259> muscles<00:01:05.590> which<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:06.280> a<00:01:06.310> back

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
to work the pull muscles which is a back

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.710 
to work the pull muscles which is a back
and<00:01:07.950> biceps<00:01:08.950> all<00:01:09.520> right<00:01:09.790> and<00:01:10.000> we'll<00:01:10.509> probably

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
and biceps all right and we'll probably

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.560 
and biceps all right and we'll probably
go<00:01:10.990> abs<00:01:11.259> in<00:01:11.619> on<00:01:11.860> that<00:01:12.009> day<00:01:12.220> -<00:01:12.280> on<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.119> pulled<00:01:13.390> a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
go abs in on that day - on the pulled a

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.679 
go abs in on that day - on the pulled a
just<00:01:14.350> cut<00:01:14.590> this<00:01:14.740> all<00:01:15.280> right<00:01:15.400> and<00:01:16.179> then<00:01:16.390> on<00:01:16.509> day

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
just cut this all right and then on day

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.550 
just cut this all right and then on day
three<00:01:17.079> is<00:01:17.320> legs<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:19.210> it's<00:01:19.359> just<00:01:19.450> all<00:01:19.689> legs<00:01:20.020> you

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
three is legs so it's just all legs you

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.109 
three is legs so it's just all legs you
know<00:01:20.679> this<00:01:20.920> one<00:01:21.100> we're<00:01:21.219> going<00:01:21.310> squats<00:01:21.759> lunges

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
know this one we're going squats lunges

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.569 
know this one we're going squats lunges
jump<00:01:22.689> squats<00:01:22.990> plyometrics<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:24.219> know<00:01:24.340> and<00:01:24.460> all

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
jump squats plyometrics you know and all

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.459 
jump squats plyometrics you know and all
that<00:01:24.609> the<00:01:25.600> reason<00:01:25.749> this<00:01:25.960> is<00:01:26.140> such<00:01:26.320> an

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
that the reason this is such an

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.830 
that the reason this is such an
effective<00:01:26.950> way<00:01:27.579> to<00:01:27.609> work<00:01:27.880> out<00:01:28.090> is<00:01:28.359> because

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
effective way to work out is because

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.569 
effective way to work out is because
when<00:01:29.499> you're<00:01:29.590> working<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:29.979> push<00:01:30.219> muscle

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
when you're working to push muscle

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.249 
when you're working to push muscle
together<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:31.329> were<00:01:31.450> going<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.659> pull<00:01:31.869> muscles

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
together you were going to pull muscles

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.690 
together you were going to pull muscles
together<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:32.740> you're<00:01:32.829> working<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:33.069> leg<00:01:33.310> muscle

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
together and you're working a leg muscle

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.760 
together and you're working a leg muscle
together<00:01:33.969> they<00:01:34.630> all<00:01:34.810> have<00:01:35.020> equal<00:01:35.259> time<00:01:35.499> to

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
together they all have equal time to

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.069 
together they all have equal time to
recover<00:01:36.399> right<00:01:36.939> because<00:01:37.479> you<00:01:37.600> can't<00:01:37.899> you

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
recover right because you can't you

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.440 
recover right because you can't you
can't<00:01:38.380> really<00:01:38.649> work<00:01:39.009> your<00:01:39.189> chest<00:01:39.549> without

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
can't really work your chest without

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.059 
can't really work your chest without
working<00:01:40.780> your<00:01:41.319> shoulders<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.889> your<00:01:42.039> triceps

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
working your shoulders and your triceps

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.539 
working your shoulders and your triceps
so<00:01:43.030> when<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.329> work<00:01:43.479> them<00:01:43.630> all<00:01:43.780> together<00:01:44.549> they

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
so when you work them all together they

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.429 
so when you work them all together they
all<00:01:45.759> recover<00:01:46.329> together<00:01:46.719> at<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:46.960> same<00:01:47.139> time

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
all recover together at the same time

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.929 
all recover together at the same time
let's<00:01:47.979> say<00:01:48.039> you're<00:01:48.189> doing<00:01:48.249> let's<00:01:48.729> say<00:01:48.819> you're

did the same thing weight and he would

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.120 
did the same thing weight and he would
rest<00:03:31.239> do<00:03:31.810> those<00:03:32.260> three<00:03:32.470> days<00:03:32.590> in<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.769> row<00:03:32.920> any

more rest and then start over I like
this<00:03:35.290> program<00:03:35.500> because<00:03:35.860> it's<00:03:36.400> flexible<00:03:36.970> like

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
this program because it's flexible like

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.420 
this program because it's flexible like
my<00:03:37.330> five-day<00:03:37.900> split<00:03:38.320> then<00:03:38.830> I<00:03:38.920> talked<00:03:39.130> about<00:03:39.340> it
