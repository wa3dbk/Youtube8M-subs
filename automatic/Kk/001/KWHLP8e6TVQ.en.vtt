preview team but Willie knows there's
little<00:07:27.040> time<00:07:27.280> for<00:07:27.310> celebration<00:07:28.410> we've<00:07:29.410> done

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:29.620 
little time for celebration we've done

well<00:07:29.830> so<00:07:30.130> far<00:07:30.190> but<00:07:31.090> the<00:07:31.270> challenges<00:07:31.900> are<00:07:32.080> here

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:34.949 

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:39.149 

good<00:07:35.949> eat<00:07:36.150> but<00:07:37.150> not<00:07:37.180> insurmountable<00:07:38.159> there's

00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:39.159 
good eat but not insurmountable there's

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:41.189 
good eat but not insurmountable there's
much<00:07:39.400> to<00:07:39.580> be<00:07:39.610> done<00:07:39.699> but<00:07:40.330> the<00:07:40.449> creation<00:07:40.840> of<00:07:41.110> the

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 
much to be done but the creation of the
