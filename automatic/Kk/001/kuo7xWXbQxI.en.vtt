then to let it dry I just stick it into

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.479 
then to let it dry I just stick it into
some<00:00:48.789> styrofoam<00:00:49.499> so<00:00:50.499> again<00:00:50.769> you<00:00:50.890> want<00:00:51.069> to<00:00:51.159> bend

roll<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.600> 16th<00:01:13.600> of<00:01:13.720> an<00:01:13.810> inch<00:01:13.930> or<00:01:14.290> less<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:14.890> you

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
roll to 16th of an inch or less and you

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.250 
roll to 16th of an inch or less and you
want<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:15.730> make<00:01:15.850> sure<00:01:16.030> that<00:01:16.240> you<00:01:16.390> dust<00:01:16.840> the

want to make sure that you dust the
daisy<00:01:17.950> cutter'<00:01:18.490> well<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.990> this<00:01:20.200> particular

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
daisy cutter' well with this particular

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.190 
daisy cutter' well with this particular
cutter<00:01:21.580> especially<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.330> larger<00:01:22.720> size<00:01:22.930> daisy

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
cutter especially the larger size daisy

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.650 
cutter especially the larger size daisy
cutter<00:01:23.530> sometimes<00:01:24.430> it's<00:01:24.790> difficult<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.390> get<00:01:25.600> a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
cutter sometimes it's difficult to get a

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.260 
cutter sometimes it's difficult to get a
clean<00:01:26.020> cut<00:01:26.050> so<00:01:26.980> I<00:01:27.010> usually<00:01:27.580> turn<00:01:27.760> it<00:01:27.880> upside

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
clean cut so I usually turn it upside

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.270 
clean cut so I usually turn it upside
down<00:01:28.300> and<00:01:28.840> kind<00:01:29.050> of<00:01:29.140> press<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.830> gum<00:01:30.040> paste

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
down and kind of press the gum paste

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.660 
down and kind of press the gum paste
into<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:31.120> cutter<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.630> then<00:01:32.140> you<00:01:32.560> can<00:01:32.800> use<00:01:33.340> it

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
into the cutter and then you can use it

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.690 
into the cutter and then you can use it
to<00:01:34.360> pull<00:01:34.900> any<00:01:35.170> excess<00:01:35.620> gum<00:01:35.830> paste<00:01:36.010> away<00:01:36.400> and

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
to pull any excess gum paste away and

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.090 
to pull any excess gum paste away and
then<00:01:37.120> I<00:01:37.150> usually<00:01:37.360> use<00:01:37.750> a<00:01:37.780> modeling<00:01:38.590> tool<00:01:38.830> to

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
then I usually use a modeling tool to

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.190 
then I usually use a modeling tool to
gently<00:01:39.400> press<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:40.000> petals<00:01:40.390> out<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:41.020> the

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
gently press the petals out of the

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.340 
gently press the petals out of the
cutter<00:01:41.410> so<00:01:42.040> that<00:01:42.640> they<00:01:42.940> release<00:01:43.510> cleanly<00:01:44.110> and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
cutter so that they release cleanly and

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.470 
cutter so that they release cleanly and
notice<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:44.980> I'm<00:01:45.100> doing<00:01:45.280> this<00:01:45.520> on<00:01:45.730> a<00:01:46.120> shaping

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
notice that I'm doing this on a shaping

time once it's on the shaping foam you
want<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:54.670> use<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.850> ball<00:01:55.210> tool<00:01:55.510> to<00:01:56.110> gently

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
want to use a ball tool to gently

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.100 
want to use a ball tool to gently
elongate<00:01:57.250> each<00:01:57.610> petal<00:01:58.090> of<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.540> Daisy<00:01:58.750> and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
elongate each petal of the Daisy and

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.170 
elongate each petal of the Daisy and
again<00:01:59.980> I<00:02:00.010> have<00:02:00.190> sped<00:02:00.460> up<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.610> video<00:02:00.790> because

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
again I have sped up the video because

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
again I have sped up the video because
this<00:02:01.300> can<00:02:01.540> be<00:02:01.659> a<00:02:01.720> little<00:02:01.810> bit<00:02:01.930> time-consuming

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
this can be a little bit time-consuming

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.560 
this can be a little bit time-consuming
but<00:02:03.159> what<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.460> need<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:03.670> notice<00:02:04.090> is<00:02:04.300> that<00:02:04.330> I'm

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
but what you need to notice is that I'm

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.620 
but what you need to notice is that I'm
working<00:02:04.990> from<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.380> center<00:02:05.740> of<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.550> Daisy<00:02:06.850> to

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
working from the center of the Daisy to

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.290 
working from the center of the Daisy to
the<00:02:07.990> outer<00:02:08.200> tip<00:02:08.709> of<00:02:08.950> each<00:02:09.220> petal<00:02:09.580> and<00:02:09.909> it's

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
the outer tip of each petal and it's

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.780 
the outer tip of each petal and it's
just<00:02:10.539> you're<00:02:10.960> gently<00:02:11.620> pressing<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.640> ball

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
just you're gently pressing the ball

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.860 
just you're gently pressing the ball
tool<00:02:13.090> into<00:02:13.540> them

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
tool into them

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.940 
tool into them
the<00:02:14.260> Daisy<00:02:14.470> pedal<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.099> elongate<00:02:15.879> it<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:17.200> then

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
the Daisy pedal to elongate it and then

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.460 
the Daisy pedal to elongate it and then
once<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.400> have<00:02:18.640> each<00:02:18.970> Daisy<00:02:19.300> pedal<00:02:19.810> elongated

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
once you have each Daisy pedal elongated

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.970 
once you have each Daisy pedal elongated
you<00:02:20.980> want<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.220> take<00:02:21.400> your<00:02:21.519> veining<00:02:22.150> tool<00:02:22.390> and

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
you want to take your veining tool and

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
it a slightly gentle curve to make it

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.100 
it a slightly gentle curve to make it
look<00:02:36.099> a<00:02:36.250> bit<00:02:36.280> more<00:02:36.459> realistic<00:02:37.299> and<00:02:37.540> here<00:02:38.080> I

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
look a bit more realistic and here I

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.500 
look a bit more realistic and here I

making daisies you can either just do a

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.339 
making daisies you can either just do a
single<00:03:47.620> Daisy<00:03:48.310> shape<00:03:48.849> or<00:03:49.060> if<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:49.930> want<00:03:50.109> to<00:03:50.200> cut

out two Daisy shapes and have like a
double<00:03:52.660> layer<00:03:52.930> Daisy<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.859> process<00:03:54.250> is

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
double layer Daisy the process is

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.610 
double layer Daisy the process is
exactly<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:55.000> same<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:56.139> just<00:03:56.319> want<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.500> make

and then use a veining tool to add the

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.060 
and then use a veining tool to add the
center<00:04:57.450> line<00:04:57.690> down<00:04:57.720> each<00:04:58.140> petal<00:04:58.410> and<00:04:58.680> with

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
center line down each petal and with

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.010 
center line down each petal and with
this<00:04:59.280> you're<00:04:59.490> going<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.670> move<00:05:00.060> from<00:05:00.450> the<00:05:00.780> tip

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
this you're going to move from the tip

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.020 
this you're going to move from the tip
of<00:05:01.170> each<00:05:01.320> petal<00:05:01.650> into<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.280> center<00:05:02.700> of<00:05:02.910> the

of each petal into the center of the

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.720 
of each petal into the center of the
Daisy<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.660> if<00:05:04.590> you<00:05:04.800> dry<00:05:05.100> them<00:05:05.310> in<00:05:05.550> these

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
Daisy and if you dry them in these

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.910 
Daisy and if you dry them in these
flower<00:05:06.000> form<00:05:06.450> or<00:05:06.570> cups<00:05:06.780> it<00:05:07.260> gives<00:05:07.530> them<00:05:07.740> a

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
flower form or cups it gives them a

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.520 
flower form or cups it gives them a
little<00:05:08.070> bit<00:05:08.430> more<00:05:08.690> shape<00:05:09.690> and<00:05:09.990> makes<00:05:10.320> them

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
little bit more shape and makes them

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.760 
little bit more shape and makes them
look<00:05:10.560> more<00:05:10.830> realistic<00:05:12.110> same<00:05:13.110> thing<00:05:13.440> with

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
look more realistic same thing with

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.100 
look more realistic same thing with
doing<00:05:14.190> a<00:05:14.520> two<00:05:14.580> layer<00:05:14.970> Daisy<00:05:15.270> you<00:05:15.840> want<00:05:16.020> to

doing a two layer Daisy you want to

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.100 
doing a two layer Daisy you want to
position<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.890> top<00:05:17.370> Daisy<00:05:17.700> so<00:05:18.240> that<00:05:18.690> its

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
position the top Daisy so that its

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.250 
position the top Daisy so that its
petals<00:05:19.500> lie<00:05:20.100> in<00:05:20.460> between<00:05:20.700> the<00:05:21.390> petals<00:05:21.570> of<00:05:21.960> the

petals lie in between the petals of the
bottom<00:05:22.530> Daisy<00:05:22.770> that<00:05:23.130> makes<00:05:23.340> it<00:05:23.460> look<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.670> bit

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
bottom Daisy that makes it look a bit

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.390

more realistic and you're going to dry

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.400 
more realistic and you're going to dry
them<00:05:26.670> in<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:27.150> flower<00:05:27.480> for<00:05:27.810> more<00:05:27.930> cups<00:05:28.140> and

different<00:05:57.180> sizes<00:05:57.570> of<00:05:57.810> daisies<00:05:58.470> so<00:05:58.950> I've<00:05:59.280> shown

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
different sizes of daisies so I've shown

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.910 
different sizes of daisies so I've shown
you<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.850> largest<00:06:00.180> and<00:06:00.570> the<00:06:01.080> smallest<00:06:01.260> and

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
you the largest and the smallest and

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.860 
you the largest and the smallest and
this<00:06:02.190> is<00:06:02.310> the<00:06:02.400> middle<00:06:02.670> in<00:06:02.790> my<00:06:03.180> opinion<00:06:03.630> the

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
this is the middle in my opinion the

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.420 
this is the middle in my opinion the
middle<00:06:04.140> sized<00:06:04.350> cutters<00:06:04.710> are<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:04.920> easiest<00:06:05.250> to

middle sized cutters are the easiest to

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.400 
middle sized cutters are the easiest to
work<00:06:05.640> with<00:06:05.700> but<00:06:06.360> it<00:06:06.480> really<00:06:06.600> just<00:06:06.720> depends<00:06:07.170> on

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
work with but it really just depends on

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.070 
work with but it really just depends on
what<00:06:08.100> you're<00:06:08.370> doing<00:06:08.400> and<00:06:08.940> what<00:06:09.150> size<00:06:09.390> you<00:06:09.690> need

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080

I<00:07:14.699> want<00:07:15.329> to<00:07:15.629> pass<00:07:16.409> them<00:07:16.769> through<00:07:17.039> steam<00:07:17.909> to

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
I want to pass them through steam to

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.589 
I want to pass them through steam to
just<00:07:18.569> help<00:07:18.749> set<00:07:19.079> the<00:07:19.259> colors<00:07:19.619> and<00:07:20.269> the<00:07:21.269> easiest

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 
just help set the colors and the easiest

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:23.989 
just help set the colors and the easiest
way<00:07:21.779> I<00:07:21.809> found<00:07:22.259> to<00:07:22.409> do<00:07:22.619> that<00:07:22.649> is<00:07:22.860> to<00:07:23.339> boil<00:07:23.789> an

00:07:23.989 --> 00:07:23.999 
way I found to do that is to boil an

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:26.119 
way I found to do that is to boil an
electric<00:07:24.449> kettle<00:07:24.629> and<00:07:24.959> then<00:07:25.439> once<00:07:25.889> it's

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:26.129 
electric kettle and then once it's

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:27.829 
electric kettle and then once it's
boiled<00:07:26.369> and<00:07:26.729> they're<00:07:26.849> steam<00:07:27.119> rising<00:07:27.629> from<00:07:27.659> the

00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:27.839 
boiled and they're steam rising from the

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:30.139 
boiled and they're steam rising from the
spout<00:07:28.139> just<00:07:28.619> kind<00:07:28.829> of<00:07:28.919> gently<00:07:29.249> pass<00:07:29.699> the

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:30.149 
spout just kind of gently pass the

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:32.449 
spout just kind of gently pass the
flower<00:07:30.479> through<00:07:30.929> the<00:07:31.139> steam<00:07:31.409> briefly<00:07:31.949> not

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:32.459 
flower through the steam briefly not

00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:34.189 
flower through the steam briefly not
long<00:07:32.610> enough<00:07:32.819> to<00:07:32.969> melt<00:07:33.179> it<00:07:33.360> or<00:07:33.479> anything<00:07:33.629> but

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199 
long enough to melt it or anything but

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:36.379 
long enough to melt it or anything but
just<00:07:34.409> enough<00:07:34.679> to<00:07:34.829> gently<00:07:35.189> steam<00:07:35.639> the<00:07:36.059> petals

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:36.389 
just enough to gently steam the petals

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.209 
just enough to gently steam the petals
and<00:07:36.539> then<00:07:36.989> the<00:07:37.110> easiest<00:07:37.499> way<00:07:37.739> to<00:07:37.769> clean<00:07:38.039> up

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:38.219 
and then the easiest way to clean up

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:41.029 
and then the easiest way to clean up
your<00:07:38.339> luster<00:07:38.669> dust<00:07:38.819> is<00:07:39.059> to<00:07:39.629> just<00:07:40.139> cut<00:07:40.619> your<00:07:40.769> wax
