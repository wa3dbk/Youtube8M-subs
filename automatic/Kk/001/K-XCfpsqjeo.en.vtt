 it's amazing friends I have like 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.240
 I have always told the protector a 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.240
 carbon fiber skin but despite 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.250
 that I have the carbon fiber skin in 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.130
 bona well to what is our iphone 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.800
 fact we can check on the banks in 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.410
 bonn to good this case are of the 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.570
 ultra ting calls what do i mean with 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.720
 ultra ting or they're not going to 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.430
 add any kind of volume to 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.830
 our iphone if you bought the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.390
 iphone 5 because it's super thin because 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.520
 it's the thinnest phones there 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.740
 in the market, you will be able to continue 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.530
 keeping this from your phone of your 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.750
 iPhone you will love this case 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.030
 Protect your phone in case of falls 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.209
 what do I mean in case of falls if 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.920
 it falls in the corners ok because here it is 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.190
 where they focus on this type of covers 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.410
 they focus on the edges but if it falls 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.700
 on the bottom or flat 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.330
 they put 7-2 up here because it would be very 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.890
 normal 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.840
 has no protection in the part of 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.220
 above we can see that it does not have any 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.140
 kind of protection in the part of 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.650
 up and in the bottom part the best 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.500
 would be to put a skin or a protector 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.420
 like those of skin or me and good friends 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.130
 the truth that this foundation feels 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.740
 incredible and we can see that put to a 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.390
 I used to cut a single cut to 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.540
 the top part where we will be able to 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.100
 enter our power button a cut 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.510
 only for the bottom part what 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.720
 we found our speakers 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.780
 raining connector and our 3.5 jack and 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.840
 a unique cut for what are our 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.610
 volume buttons and vibrated ok we 're not going 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.430
 to have problems to enter them already 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.080
 which are too big cuts in the 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.130
 back side we have nothing and 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.050
 in the camera 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.170
 we just found the color green and 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.209
 let's take a picture again for 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.250
 see what works and we have activated 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.250
 the flash and let's take a picture 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.020
 and ready it works wonders we do not have 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.030
 no problem we can see that there is no 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.190
 no interference in what are the 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.739
 color is not green or anything the 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.140
