those four characters we're chosen and
they're<00:01:49.750> actually<00:01:49.900> sitting<00:01:50.320> around<00:01:50.619> the

to<00:02:23.920> do<00:02:24.130> get<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:25.180> other<00:02:25.420> two<00:02:25.720> players<00:02:26.590> here<00:02:26.980> one

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
to do get the other two players here one

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.170 
to do get the other two players here one
of<00:02:27.430> them<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:28.239> guess<00:02:28.480> monkey<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.549> there's<00:02:31.060> a

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
of them to guess monkey and so there's a

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.020 
of them to guess monkey and so there's a
timer<00:02:31.450> here<00:02:31.720> there's<00:02:31.959> one<00:02:32.110> for<00:02:32.320> 10<00:02:32.560> 20<00:02:33.250> or<00:02:33.519> 30

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
timer here there's one for 10 20 or 30

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.330 
timer here there's one for 10 20 or 30
seconds<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:35.590> when<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.830> gate<00:02:35.980> when<00:02:36.220> it

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
seconds and so when the gate when it

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.250 
seconds and so when the gate when it
when<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.610> timer<00:02:36.850> starts<00:02:37.330> either<00:02:37.989> one<00:02:38.230> of

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
when the timer starts either one of

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.509 
when the timer starts either one of
these<00:02:38.380> guys<00:02:38.530> can<00:02:38.739> start<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.130> doesn't<00:02:39.370> matter

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
these guys can start it doesn't matter

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.699 
these guys can start it doesn't matter
who<00:02:39.700> they're<00:02:40.209> trying<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.600> get<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.200> other

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
who they're trying to get the other

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.580 
who they're trying to get the other
people<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.100> say<00:02:42.820> monkey<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.600> Philippe<00:02:44.410> might

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
people to say monkey so Philippe might

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.250 
people to say monkey so Philippe might
start<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.010> say<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.810> might<00:02:46.930> go<00:02:47.080> back

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
start and say this and it might go back

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.229 
start and say this and it might go back
and<00:02:47.440> forth<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:48.220> know<00:02:48.370> saying<00:02:48.790> this<00:02:49.000> so

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
and forth you know saying this so

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.360 
and forth you know saying this so
Philippe<00:02:49.510> might<00:02:49.660> say<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:50.200> Don<00:02:50.920> Juan<00:02:51.160> might

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
Philippe might say this Don Juan might

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.949 
Philippe might say this Don Juan might
say<00:02:51.580> is<00:02:51.989> Philippe<00:02:52.989> might<00:02:53.170> say<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:54.390> animal<00:02:55.390> that

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
say is Philippe might say a animal that

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.920 
say is Philippe might say a animal that
eats<00:02:56.459> bananas<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:58.060> boom<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.660> if<00:02:58.750> they've

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
eats bananas and boom and if they've

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.130 
eats bananas and boom and if they've
guessed<00:02:59.200> Bennett<00:02:59.650> monkeys<00:03:00.489> then<00:03:01.239> then<00:03:01.870> they

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
guessed Bennett monkeys then then they

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.199 
guessed Bennett monkeys then then they
each<00:03:02.290> would<00:03:02.440> get<00:03:02.590> some<00:03:02.739> chips<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.700> have<00:03:03.970> 10

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
each would get some chips so you have 10

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.050 
each would get some chips so you have 10
20<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.660> 30<00:03:04.720> seconds<00:03:05.320> different<00:03:05.709> timers<00:03:06.220> so<00:03:06.940> if

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
20 and 30 seconds different timers so if

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.150 
20 and 30 seconds different timers so if
they<00:03:07.209> did<00:03:07.450> ten<00:03:08.049> seconds<00:03:08.530> it's<00:03:08.680> gonna<00:03:08.830> start

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
they did ten seconds it's gonna start

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.300 
they did ten seconds it's gonna start
it's<00:03:09.370> gonna<00:03:09.519> blink<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:11.290> get<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:11.530> select<00:03:11.709> what

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
it's gonna blink you get to select what

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.039 
it's gonna blink you get to select what
you<00:03:12.430> want<00:03:12.610> ten<00:03:12.940> twenty<00:03:13.269> or<00:03:13.390> thirty<00:03:13.570> seconds

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
you want ten twenty or thirty seconds

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.990 
you want ten twenty or thirty seconds
after<00:03:14.140> you<00:03:14.530> get<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.769> see<00:03:15.070> what<00:03:15.580> you're<00:03:15.700> looking

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
after you get to see what you're looking

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.880 
after you get to see what you're looking
at<00:03:16.150> if<00:03:16.690> you're<00:03:16.900> really<00:03:17.140> confident<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:17.709> could

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
at if you're really confident you could

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.270 
at if you're really confident you could
do<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.100> in<00:03:18.220> ten<00:03:18.400> seconds<00:03:18.970> then<00:03:19.860> you<00:03:20.860> know<00:03:21.010> you

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
do it in ten seconds then you know you

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.890 
do it in ten seconds then you know you
do<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.489> for<00:03:21.610> ten<00:03:21.760> seconds<00:03:22.180> if<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.450> get<00:03:22.630> them<00:03:22.780> to

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
do it for ten seconds if you get them to

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.409 
do it for ten seconds if you get them to
guess<00:03:23.109> before<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.620> ten<00:03:23.799> seconds<00:03:24.220> over<00:03:24.579> then

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
guess before the ten seconds over then

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.110 
guess before the ten seconds over then
you<00:03:25.540> get<00:03:25.690> three<00:03:25.989> chips<00:03:26.380> if<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:27.220> do<00:03:27.459> 20<00:03:27.700> second

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
you get three chips if you do 20 second

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.390 
you get three chips if you do 20 second
it's<00:03:28.450> two<00:03:28.629> chips<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.200> if<00:03:29.590> it's<00:03:29.709> 30<00:03:29.950> seconds

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
it's two chips and if it's 30 seconds

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.550 
it's two chips and if it's 30 seconds
it's<00:03:30.549> one<00:03:30.790> chip<00:03:31.090> so<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.810> longer<00:03:32.170> time<00:03:32.349> you

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
it's one chip so the longer time you

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.589 
it's one chip so the longer time you
take<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:32.799> do<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.310> less<00:03:33.459> chips<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:33.849> get<00:03:34.000> now

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
take to do it the less chips you get now

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.229 
take to do it the less chips you get now
if<00:03:34.750> you<00:03:34.840> get<00:03:35.170> it<00:03:36.010> right<00:03:36.310> if<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.879> other<00:03:37.000> people

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
if you get it right if the other people

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.990 
if you get it right if the other people
guess<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.659> you<00:03:38.260> get<00:03:38.500> those<00:03:38.709> many<00:03:38.890> chips<00:03:39.250> if<00:03:39.940> you

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
guess it you get those many chips if you

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.910 
guess it you get those many chips if you
don't<00:03:40.599> get<00:03:40.780> them<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.080> guess<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:41.620> have<00:03:41.769> to

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
don't get them to guess it you have to

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.559 
don't get them to guess it you have to
pay<00:03:42.190> that<00:03:42.220> many<00:03:42.640> chips<00:03:42.940> now<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.269> can<00:03:43.450> never

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
pay that many chips now you can never

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.960 
pay that many chips now you can never
have<00:03:43.750> negative<00:03:44.200> chips<00:03:44.440> so<00:03:45.040> if<00:03:45.280> I<00:03:45.430> went<00:03:45.610> for<00:03:45.819> 10

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
have negative chips so if I went for 10

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.300 
have negative chips so if I went for 10
seconds<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.659> I'm<00:03:47.440> going<00:03:47.680> for<00:03:47.829> three<00:03:48.010> chips

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
seconds and I'm going for three chips

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.039 
seconds and I'm going for three chips
and<00:03:48.519> they<00:03:48.579> didn't<00:03:48.790> say<00:03:48.940> it<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.450> I<00:03:49.540> had<00:03:49.690> nothing

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
and they didn't say it and I had nothing

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.569 
and they didn't say it and I had nothing
I<00:03:50.170> don't<00:03:50.260> lose<00:03:50.440> anything<00:03:50.680> but<00:03:50.920> if<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.129> had<00:03:51.340> three

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
I don't lose anything but if I had three

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.910 
I don't lose anything but if I had three
chips<00:03:51.849> and<00:03:52.090> I<00:03:52.569> said<00:03:52.780> ten<00:03:52.989> seconds<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:53.560> I<00:03:53.650> get

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
chips and I said ten seconds and I get

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.740 
chips and I said ten seconds and I get
it<00:03:54.010> then<00:03:54.099> they<00:03:54.190> lose<00:03:54.370> three<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:55.510> that's<00:03:55.659> how

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
it then they lose three and that's how

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.789 
it then they lose three and that's how
it's<00:03:55.870> played<00:03:56.049> then<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.290> next<00:03:56.500> person<00:03:56.590> would

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
sometimes during the game you get to

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.440 
sometimes during the game you get to
pick<00:05:47.620> who<00:05:47.830> your<00:05:47.980> partner<00:05:48.370> is<00:05:48.400> because<00:05:49.060> as<00:05:49.270> the

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
pick who your partner is because as the

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.420 
pick who your partner is because as the
game<00:05:49.600> goes<00:05:49.780> on<00:05:49.990> you'll<00:05:50.230> find<00:05:50.590> which<00:05:50.920> people<00:05:51.310> do
