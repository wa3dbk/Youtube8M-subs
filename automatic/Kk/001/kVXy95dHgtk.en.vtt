00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 for all 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.540
 today I'm going to teach 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.639
 tasty and summery of the world in 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.139
 the two options of this iced coffee the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.940
 version for those who want to keep their 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.770
 line in the summer and what good 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.289
 really do not care much this is 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.760
 a latte a touch of vanilla what 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.310
 first thing they do is take for granted a 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.310
 cup to give him some ice 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.250
 a little coffee and the councilors that 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.780
 do it well strong because good 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.220
 obviously the ones to put more little things 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.500
 what are you going to put more aguaditas 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.560
 then you put south coffee more or less like 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.180
 a third of the glass now let's put 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.220
 the milk is in almond milk not 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.350
 has any type of sugar so it's 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.350
 super healthy 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.910
 a little touch of vanilla and this to the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.890
 portions as you like if you like 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.329
 If you like pretty little and gave 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.860
 a sweet touch of course 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.960
 we need a lot that adult we are going to 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.570
 use agave honey which is natural sugar 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.930
 this is also going to be considering how 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.059
 Sweet like it or not, of course, a 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.059
 straw popote that says mexico 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.930
 now we go for a much more loaded one 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.100
 sweeter than you are going to have a lot 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.350
 energy to be on the beach what 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.270
 first we're going to give the candy this 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.220
 It's also going to be good if you like it a lot 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.170
 If you do not like me I'll go crazy and I'll 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.050
 turn the glass into a source of 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.300
 candy 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.300
 Now let's put the crime 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.290
 now let's put a third of glass of 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.440
 coffee and now we go with vanilla cream 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.570
 that will be already loaded with sweet until 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.910
 arribita we complete the glass now 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.860
 we put whipped cream and well they can 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.790
 return the pizzas and put a lot because 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.790
 I like it a lot 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.040
 and to put a little touch of color 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.850
 let's finish this with a little bit of 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.850
 cocoa powder 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.960
 a little bit 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.530
 I hope you liked it
