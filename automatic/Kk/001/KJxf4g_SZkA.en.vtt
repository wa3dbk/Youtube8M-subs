00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.219 
and i know it was another community i
believe<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> rockies<00:01:12.840> or<00:01:12.990> something

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
believe in like the rockies or something

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.719 
believe in like the rockies or something
like<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.619> past<00:01:13.830> permits<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.430> people<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
like that the past permits for people to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.910 
like that the past permits for people to
shoot<00:01:14.880> drones<00:01:15.150> down<00:01:15.450> yes<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.650> it's

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
shoot drones down yes you know so it's

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.950 
shoot drones down yes you know so it's
across<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.880> nation<00:01:18.210> people<00:01:18.360> are<00:01:18.509> showing<00:01:18.689> we

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
across the nation people are showing we

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.149 
across the nation people are showing we
do<00:01:19.080> not<00:01:19.229> want<00:01:19.409> them<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.619> their<00:01:19.710> towns<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.130> I

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
do not want them in their towns and I

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.679 
do not want them in their towns and I
think<00:01:20.340> that's<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.549> differences<00:01:21.060> as<00:01:21.210> most<00:01:21.509> of

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
think that's the differences as most of

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.149 
think that's the differences as most of
this<00:01:21.810> when<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.170> talk<00:01:22.380> about<00:01:22.409> drones<00:01:22.920> in

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
this when we talk about drones in

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.710 
this when we talk about drones in
airspace<00:01:23.580> motive<00:01:23.939> most<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.330> will<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.689> be

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
airspace motive most of that will not be

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.270 
airspace motive most of that will not be
in<00:01:24.990> Mar<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.409> these<00:01:25.799> sort<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> large
