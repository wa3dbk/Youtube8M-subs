being totally into it it wasn't

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.460

something<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:08.570> don't<00:01:09.570> think<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.990> had<00:01:10.229> any

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
something that I don't think I had any

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.960 
something that I don't think I had any
other<00:01:10.500> choice<00:01:13.159> looking<00:01:14.159> back<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.939> was

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
other choice looking back on it it was

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.120 
other choice looking back on it it was
just<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.540> way<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> was<00:01:16.170> meant<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.500> go<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
just the way I was meant to go on to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.030 
just the way I was meant to go on to
leave<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:18.020> because<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.259> was<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> hard<00:01:19.740> road

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
leave that because it was a hard road

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.080 
leave that because it was a hard road
and<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.340> don't<00:01:20.369> think<00:01:20.729> anybody<00:01:21.119> would've<00:01:23.090> chose

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
to play along with those records because

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.280 
to play along with those records because

obviously everybody plays in different
keys<00:05:24.670> so<00:05:25.670> I<00:05:25.700> think<00:05:25.940> thing<00:05:26.150> you<00:05:26.270> gotta<00:05:26.450> do<00:05:26.690> is<00:05:26.720> go

keys so I think thing you gotta do is go

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.090 
keys so I think thing you gotta do is go
out<00:05:27.170> and<00:05:27.200> buy<00:05:27.440> five<00:05:28.190> or<00:05:28.400> six<00:05:28.670> keys<00:05:28.970> an<00:05:29.480> a<00:05:29.920> B<00:05:30.920> flat

wanna play the chromatic harmonica I
suggest<00:05:50.360> that<00:05:50.480> you<00:05:50.600> start<00:05:50.870> with<00:05:51.110> the<00:05:51.260> 12<00:05:51.560> hole

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
suggest that you start with the 12 hole

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.730 
suggest that you start with the 12 hole
instead<00:05:53.360> of<00:05:53.480> the<00:05:53.710> the<00:05:54.710> 64<00:05:55.870> because<00:05:56.870> it's<00:05:57.620> a

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
instead of the the 64 because it's a

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.860 
instead of the the 64 because it's a
little<00:05:57.950> bit<00:05:58.160> easier<00:05:58.340> to<00:05:58.790> get<00:05:59.000> around<00:05:59.300> on<00:05:59.600> this

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
little bit easier to get around on this

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.370 
little bit easier to get around on this
one

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
one

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.340 
one
Faysal<00:06:01.310> holes<00:06:01.520> are<00:06:01.820> closer<00:06:02.540> together<00:06:02.810> it's<00:06:03.260> a

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
Faysal holes are closer together it's a

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.350 
Faysal holes are closer together it's a
little<00:06:03.620> smaller<00:06:03.980> art<00:06:04.340> that's<00:06:04.610> not<00:06:04.850> quite<00:06:05.150> as

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
little smaller art that's not quite as

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.570 
little smaller art that's not quite as
as<00:06:05.570> a<00:06:06.550> massive<00:06:07.550> as<00:06:07.730> the<00:06:07.760> 64<00:06:08.950> yard<00:06:09.950> I<00:06:10.070> started

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
as a massive as the 64 yard I started

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.330 
as a massive as the 64 yard I started
out<00:06:10.730> playing<00:06:10.910> the<00:06:11.180> small<00:06:11.570> part<00:06:12.190> tried<00:06:13.190> to

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
out playing the small part tried to

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.970 
out playing the small part tried to
change<00:06:13.580> over<00:06:13.940> to<00:06:14.030> this<00:06:14.240> after<00:06:14.690> 20<00:06:15.050> years<00:06:15.080> or<00:06:15.560> 15

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
change over to this after 20 years or 15

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.030 
change over to this after 20 years or 15
years<00:06:16.180> kind<00:06:17.180> of<00:06:17.300> have<00:06:17.480> a<00:06:17.510> problem<00:06:17.800> adapting<00:06:18.800> to

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
years kind of have a problem adapting to

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.770 
years kind of have a problem adapting to
it<00:06:19.190> because<00:06:19.580> it's<00:06:19.970> it's<00:06:20.300> actually<00:06:20.510> a

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
it because it's it's actually a

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.900 
it because it's it's actually a
different<00:06:20.990> instrument<00:06:21.560> you<00:06:21.830> know<00:06:21.980> and<00:06:22.250> all

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 
different instrument you know and all

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.810 
different instrument you know and all
the<00:06:23.270> scales<00:06:23.630> are<00:06:23.930> different<00:06:24.490> it's<00:06:25.490> different

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
the scales are different it's different

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.860 
the scales are different it's different
the<00:06:26.240> way<00:06:26.390> in<00:06:26.570> the

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
the way in the

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.860 
the way in the
your<00:06:27.590> mouth<00:06:27.770> around<00:06:28.100> it<00:06:28.520> and<00:06:28.870> everything

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
your mouth around it and everything

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.350 
your mouth around it and everything
about<00:06:30.080> it<00:06:30.139> is<00:06:30.320> just<00:06:30.350> different<00:06:30.830> so<00:06:31.190> if<00:06:31.820> you're

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
about it is just different so if you're

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.180 
about it is just different so if you're
gonna<00:06:32.480> try<00:06:32.780> and<00:06:32.960> play<00:06:33.110> that<00:06:33.380> eventually<00:06:33.889> don't

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
gonna try and play that eventually don't

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.100 
gonna try and play that eventually don't
then<00:06:34.490> just<00:06:34.520> put<00:06:34.940> it<00:06:35.030> off<00:06:35.180> start<00:06:35.690> with<00:06:35.900> that

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
then just put it off start with that

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.800 
then just put it off start with that
play<00:06:36.440> that<00:06:36.470> as<00:06:36.800> much<00:06:37.010> as<00:06:37.040> you<00:06:37.190> played<00:06:37.550> this<00:06:37.810> I

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
play that as much as you played this I

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.170 
play that as much as you played this I
think<00:06:39.650> that<00:06:39.889> was<00:06:40.220> one<00:06:40.400> of<00:06:40.430> the<00:06:40.580> great<00:06:40.760> things<00:06:41.000> I

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180

a little bit there's so much more and he

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.450 
a little bit there's so much more and he
he<00:06:47.600> would<00:06:47.750> put<00:06:47.960> me<00:06:48.110> on<00:06:48.229> that<00:06:48.260> big<00:06:48.680> heart<00:06:48.949> you

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
he would put me on that big heart you

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:52.940 
know a lot more than I thought myself to

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.820 
know a lot more than I thought myself to
pick<00:06:53.090> it<00:06:53.270> up<00:06:53.360> he'd<00:06:53.660> put<00:06:53.900> it<00:06:54.020> into<00:06:54.260> my<00:06:54.380> hands
