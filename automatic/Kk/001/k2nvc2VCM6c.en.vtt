00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:16.289
 Hi all 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:18.990
 then better not to have to fly 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.349
 we're all going to do it says the things that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.980
 we have brought from portaventura and good 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.460
 I hope you like it 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.410
 we started 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.410
 so you will see 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.550
 this is my thought of portaventura se is 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.590
 the crazy buddy bird 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.930
 and I'll catch it especially because I 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.930
 I liked it a lot, I liked it 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.199
 I liked d 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.199
 of those who had 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:01.530
 I liked it a lot and that's why I fucked him and 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.320
 there we have a doll once 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.650
 palms that in a game got me my 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.980
 brother tried I got it and I got it 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.680
 present 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.850
 and it comes 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.650
 I like it 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.720
 we are going to put the backpack of the school 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:28.270
 psychologist if not probably not because 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:28.270
 imagine you do not hear this 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.860
 If I get 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.670
 I suppose there's always that way 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.929
 I've never seen it anywhere else in this 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.039
 video game that is about collecting bags and 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.229
 I tutto with very good and you have to 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.829
 get a character to see in the 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.679
 dolls were numbered and you took 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.439
 a bag with a kind of cane and 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.479
 then that bag had a number and the 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.950
 that it was Diego who was a poodle and 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.860
 then they told him that if he did not want it 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.860
 that you take the joker that once 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.720
 in an afternoon 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.390
 the first thing is firm a cup of 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.390
 crazy bird in which it comes out 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:33.950
 usa our children the flag of usa 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.190
 with the flag of usa back before 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.390
 I was thinking the other one because also 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.390
 I liked it was the same but I knew 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.520
 the gray background and the colored crazy bird 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.190
 whole but I thought it's not because I 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.990
 I liked very much the good world this is from the 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.129
 two because I also picked up because they are 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:57.140
 you are both of the same 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:00.830
 even if it comes out in a mirror that puts 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.670
 penance rodeo that there was one of 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.530
 the bulls to see another mechanic that I know 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.480
 if we beat the bull they gave you a sheet and 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.410
 we get the sheet and a while when 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.420
 today we are going to leave a day of adventure 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.870
 appeared another one previously and the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.870
 other 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.660
 why 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:26.880
 here I have a shirt burn what 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:30.940
 a lot that shows the cookies 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.220
 so I liked it especially because I 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.060
 taste 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.930
 and good 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.870
 is here because here he puts in the 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:46.430
 Portaventura tag also he 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.430
 for the adventure 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:55.010
 and I bought this case from my father 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.050
 for your phone phones that like 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.350
 he did not know what phone of his own he 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.160
 I asked angel and it was compatible for his 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.210
 iphone 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.210
 Portaventura is not severe 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.289
 ah 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:22.800
 good now and I fucked me good from 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:26.660
 cup is to the state I cup I got myself 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.660
 It's in our cookies 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:33.450
 that comes out here in our cookies and 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:36.810
 here his name and then shaded from 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:41.590
 yellow leaves his silhouette 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:44.650
 then I stuffed the mold 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.140
 because I do not know is the prettiest of all 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:51.580
 those of portaventura after the 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:53.260
 our cookie and he called me a lot the 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.480
 attention because it's not the red of it anymore 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.260
 a thicker red made in the camera 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.820
 about almost orange 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.120
 but I 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.190
 'sesame neighborhood' and so on later in the 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.920
 same game of hunting the bags in the 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.810
 that diego got the chilli to me 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:14.540
 I do not need to take the wild 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.540
 and I got a pineapple from the fruit ninja 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.990
 the pacman from the side but 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.840
 in the planet 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.840
 I caught one of Oscar 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.900
 here he puts on the label also by 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:37.720
 portaventura and that called me a lot 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.010
 attention because it was the most original that 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.050
 had seen because of Oscar there's no 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.260
 many things is not even the 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.090
 character like that since I decided the 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.500
 stuffed animal but not the character walking around 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.200
 there 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:53.170
 so they told me 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:56.170
 and good to my mother I took this cup of 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:58.110
 Betty Boop, I fucked her in the park 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:01.670
 water 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.670
 puts me here for adventure 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:05.279
 with palm trees 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.750
 that does not have nothing else and good 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.400
 well up here the video I hope you 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.050
 I liked it because Diego was gone 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.720
 because it has been given 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:21.860
 and I hope that you liked it and 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.860
 See you in another goodbye
