00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
minutes you have enough button these are

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.000 
minutes you have enough button these are
toggle<00:02:12.180> these<00:02:12.690> two<00:02:12.900> are<00:02:12.989> toggle

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
toggle these two are toggle

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
and this is temporary now warmup time

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.710 
and this is temporary now warmup time
sorry<00:02:19.590> about<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.799> mess<00:02:19.950> but<00:02:20.010> warmup<00:02:20.670> time<00:02:20.720> for

sorry about the mess but warmup time for

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.949 
sorry about the mess but warmup time for
this<00:02:21.840> machine<00:02:22.340> takes<00:02:23.340> about<00:02:23.670> I'd<00:02:24.599> say<00:02:24.659> about

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
this machine takes about I'd say about

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.289 
this machine takes about I'd say about
three<00:02:25.379> to<00:02:25.620> eight<00:02:25.890> minutes<00:02:26.220> as<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:27.000> can<00:02:27.120> see

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
three to eight minutes as you can see

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.690 
three to eight minutes as you can see
it's<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:28.319> cut<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:28.980> know<00:02:29.159> when<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:29.459> warm

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
it's you cut you know when it's warm

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.250 
it's you cut you know when it's warm
like<00:02:29.760> right<00:02:30.030> now<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.299> really<00:02:30.510> warm<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.140> if

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
like right now it's really warm so if

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.390 
like right now it's really warm so if
you<00:02:32.150> if<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.269> spray<00:02:33.540> some<00:02:33.870> it'll<00:02:34.560> come<00:02:34.739> out<00:02:34.860> I'm

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
you if you spray some it'll come out I'm

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.309 
you if you spray some it'll come out I'm
not<00:02:35.549> sure<00:02:35.730> how<00:02:35.910> far<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.510> distance<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:37.140> is

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
not sure how far of a distance that is

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.350 
not sure how far of a distance that is
about<00:02:37.560> three<00:02:37.799> feet<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:41.730> know<00:02:41.849> it<00:02:42.030> always<00:02:42.150> like

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
about three feet you know it always like

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.190 
about three feet you know it always like
dies<00:02:42.599> out<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:42.989> just<00:02:43.769> one<00:02:43.950> push<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:45.049> even<00:02:46.049> push

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
dies out so just one push and even push

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.500 
dies out so just one push and even push
it<00:02:47.150> now<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.209> get<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.599> effect<00:02:49.610> if<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:51.030> notice

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
it now you get that effect if you notice

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.330 
it now you get that effect if you notice
it<00:02:51.660> has<00:02:51.810> four<00:02:52.170> LEDs<00:02:53.329> around<00:02:54.329> it

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
it has four LEDs around it

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.050 
it has four LEDs around it
see<00:02:56.340> those<00:02:56.489> are<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:56.970> low<00:02:57.090> light<00:02:58.700> those<00:02:59.700> four

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
see those are for low light those four

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.210 
see those are for low light those four
lights<00:03:00.390> go<00:03:00.959> off<00:03:00.989> when<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.620> when<00:03:02.069> it's

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
lights go off when you when it's

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.979 
lights go off when you when it's
activated<00:03:02.609> I<00:03:02.940> think<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.450> might<00:03:03.569> be<00:03:03.599> a<00:03:03.690> safety

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
activated I think it might be a safety

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.900 
activated I think it might be a safety
feature<00:03:04.319> just<00:03:04.920> there<00:03:05.099> to<00:03:05.190> look<00:03:05.400> cool<00:03:05.579> but<00:03:05.819> it

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
feature just there to look cool but it

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.220 
feature just there to look cool but it
doesn't<00:03:06.150> really<00:03:06.239> light<00:03:06.510> up<00:03:06.660> anything<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:07.140> the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
doesn't really light up anything in the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.589 
doesn't really light up anything in the
dark<00:03:07.500> in<00:03:07.739> fact<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.579> have<00:03:08.730> this<00:03:08.879> under<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.180> DJ

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
dark in fact I have this under a DJ

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.650 
dark in fact I have this under a DJ
table<00:03:10.049> so<00:03:10.230> it's<00:03:10.410> not<00:03:10.500> gonna<00:03:10.769> show<00:03:11.359> much<00:03:12.359> at<00:03:12.540> all

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
table so it's not gonna show much at all

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.259 
table so it's not gonna show much at all
anyway<00:03:13.470> yeah<00:03:14.160> that's<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.549> fog<00:03:14.760> machine<00:03:14.940> from

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
anyway yeah that's the fog machine from

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.259 
anyway yeah that's the fog machine from
Spencer's<00:03:16.340> what<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.370> really<00:03:17.670> like<00:03:17.879> about<00:03:17.910> this

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
Spencer's what I really like about this

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.250 
Spencer's what I really like about this
fog<00:03:18.480> machine<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:20.220> just<00:03:20.370> rinse<00:03:20.549> off<00:03:21.260> turn

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
fog machine is you just rinse off turn

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.699 
fog machine is you just rinse off turn
that<00:03:22.349> off

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
that off

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.520 
that off
it's<00:03:23.489> got<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.669> reasonable<00:03:24.599> length<00:03:24.750> cable<00:03:25.260> but

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
it's got a reasonable length cable but

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.920 
it's got a reasonable length cable but
whatever<00:03:25.829> what<00:03:26.639> I<00:03:26.669> like<00:03:26.940> about<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.359> is<00:03:27.540> right

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
whatever what I like about it is right

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.020 
whatever what I like about it is right
here<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:28.709> not<00:03:29.040> even<00:03:29.340> warm<00:03:29.459> it's<00:03:29.760> actually

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
here it's not even warm it's actually

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.890 
here it's not even warm it's actually
cold<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:30.739> everything<00:03:32.150> about<00:03:33.150> here<00:03:33.750> and

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
cold and everything about here and

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.720 
cold and everything about here and
higher<00:03:34.049> is<00:03:34.290> hot<00:03:34.590> what<00:03:34.829> does<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.040> mean<00:03:35.310> you

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
higher is hot what does that mean you

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.039 
higher is hot what does that mean you
can<00:03:35.880> put<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.120> on<00:03:36.239> carpet<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.720> they<00:03:36.870> won't

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
can put this on carpet and they won't

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.009 
can put this on carpet and they won't
even<00:03:37.139> get<00:03:37.349> warm<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.459> like<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.180> is<00:03:39.540> the

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
even get warm so I like that is the

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.330 
even get warm so I like that is the
safety<00:03:40.260> thing<00:03:40.590> so<00:03:40.709> you<00:03:40.769> don't<00:03:40.919> accidentally

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
safety thing so you don't accidentally

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.920 
safety thing so you don't accidentally
touch<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.700> tip<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.120> burn<00:03:42.299> your<00:03:42.480> finger<00:03:42.780> off

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
touch the tip and burn your finger off

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.449 
touch the tip and burn your finger off
or<00:03:43.200> something<00:03:43.560> because<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:43.950> know<00:03:44.069> how<00:03:44.280> hot

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
or something because I know how hot

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.659 
or something because I know how hot
these<00:03:44.609> things<00:03:44.819> can<00:03:45.030> get<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:47.310> only<00:03:47.459> thing<00:03:47.609> I

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
these things can get the only thing I

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:48.949 
these things can get the only thing I
really<00:03:47.790> need<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.060> do<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.389> I'll<00:03:48.540> clean<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.780> up

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
really need to do is I'll clean it up

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.050 
really need to do is I'll clean it up
probably<00:03:49.590> get<00:03:49.829> some<00:03:49.950> vinegar<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.310> water<00:03:50.519> but

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
probably get some vinegar and water but

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.449 
probably get some vinegar and water but
yeah<00:03:51.419> just<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:52.079> fog<00:03:52.260> machine<00:03:52.290> all<00:03:52.799> it<00:03:53.250> has<00:03:53.430> a

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
yeah just a fog machine all it has a

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.809 
yeah just a fog machine all it has a
really<00:03:53.819> good<00:03:54.980> warmup<00:03:55.980> time<00:03:56.010> about<00:03:56.579> three

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
really good warmup time about three

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.000 
really good warmup time about three
minutes<00:03:57.239> I<00:03:57.389> know<00:03:57.750> American<00:03:58.230> DJ<00:03:58.379> has<00:03:58.680> won<00:03:58.859> that

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
minutes I know American DJ has won that

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.949 
minutes I know American DJ has won that
like<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.609> haze<00:03:59.970> machine<00:04:00.359> his<00:04:00.540> machines<00:04:00.870> are

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
like a haze machine his machines are

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.869 
like a haze machine his machines are
different<00:04:01.319> weather<00:04:01.859> I<00:04:01.919> think<00:04:02.370> it's<00:04:02.459> based

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
different weather I think it's based

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.789 
different weather I think it's based
whatever<00:04:03.180> his<00:04:03.389> machine<00:04:03.780> doesn't<00:04:04.379> even<00:04:04.620> need<00:04:04.769> a

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
whatever his machine doesn't even need a

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.670 
whatever his machine doesn't even need a
warmup<00:04:05.160> time<00:04:05.190> but<00:04:05.870> yeah<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.900> mean<00:04:07.200> it's<00:04:07.650> a

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
warmup time but yeah I mean it's a

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.509 
warmup time but yeah I mean it's a
really<00:04:07.829> good<00:04:07.980> machine<00:04:08.329> quality<00:04:10.220> but<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.310> fog

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
really good machine quality but the fog

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.009 
really good machine quality but the fog
fluid<00:04:11.699> that<00:04:11.940> they<00:04:12.060> saw<00:04:12.209> at<00:04:12.329> Spencer's<00:04:12.780> I

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
fluid that they saw at Spencer's I

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.750 
fluid that they saw at Spencer's I
wouldn't<00:04:13.980> say<00:04:14.099> is<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.340> best

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
wouldn't say is the best

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.819 
wouldn't say is the best
they<00:04:15.090> come<00:04:15.269> in<00:04:15.419> gallon<00:04:15.720> in<00:04:15.840> pint<00:04:16.139> but<00:04:16.769> I

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
they come in gallon in pint but I

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.319 
they come in gallon in pint but I
recommend<00:04:17.370> if<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:17.579> are<00:04:17.609> gonna<00:04:17.820> get<00:04:17.970> some<00:04:18.150> fog

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
recommend if you are gonna get some fog

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.509 
recommend if you are gonna get some fog
fluid<00:04:18.810> for<00:04:19.139> this<00:04:19.289> machine<00:04:19.680> that<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.220> get<00:04:20.370> some

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
fluid for this machine that you get some

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.190 
fluid for this machine that you get some
higher<00:04:20.669> quality<00:04:21.180> one<00:04:21.359> so<00:04:21.599> I<00:04:21.750> think<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.079> one

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
higher quality one so I think the one

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.480 
higher quality one so I think the one
