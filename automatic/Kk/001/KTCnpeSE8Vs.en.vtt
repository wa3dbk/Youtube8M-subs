00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
of our energy on that whole bleep that

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.220 
of our energy on that whole bleep that
other<00:02:18.370> side<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.209> when<00:02:19.420> we<00:02:19.570> switch<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:19.989> the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
other side so that when we switch to the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.110 
other side so that when we switch to the
other<00:02:20.260> side<00:02:20.459> basically<00:02:21.459> we<00:02:21.670> get<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.940> same

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
other side basically we get the same

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:33.820 
other side basically we get the same
amount<00:02:22.360> of<00:02:22.570> friction

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.410 

alright<00:02:34.520> this<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.730> gonna<00:02:34.850> be<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.120> third
