00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:16.560 

it's<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.870> family<00:04:08.380> there<00:04:08.620> one

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.420 

there<00:04:17.170> are<00:04:17.290> some<00:04:19.170> it's<00:04:20.170> like<00:04:20.380> a<00:04:20.560> it's<00:04:21.010> like

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.620 
there are some it's like a it's like
marble<00:04:22.230> zeros<00:04:23.230> clones<00:04:23.830> how<00:04:24.760> it<00:04:24.940> attacks<00:04:25.300> the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
marble zeros clones how it attacks the

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.720 
marble zeros clones how it attacks the
same<00:04:25.960> attack<00:04:26.290> unit<00:04:26.680> half<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.340> second<00:04:27.700> later

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
right talks like that so if you cross

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.970 
right talks like that so if you cross
the<00:04:32.740> Bob<00:04:32.920> it's<00:04:33.730> like<00:04:33.940> low<00:04:34.570> attack<00:04:34.960> jump<00:04:35.650> over

the Bob it's like low attack jump over

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.070 
the Bob it's like low attack jump over
low<00:04:36.160> attack<00:04:36.520> it'll<00:04:37.090> have<00:04:37.300> a<00:04:37.330> low<00:04:37.600> attack<00:04:37.900> on

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
low attack it'll have a low attack on

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:48.490 
low attack it'll have a low attack on
both<00:04:38.260> sides
