00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:10.120
 here we are today to remove the clutch 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:14.000
 she started to lead me well for that 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.609
 they do not remove them you can not remove them 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.890
 can the corner already this thing move here 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:22.130
 then take them off me because 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.390
 that I already removed them and actually as 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:36.410
 removed the clutch twisted 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:48.620
 cars screwdriver like this you learn these 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:50.629
 I unscrew the pitch we remove the protective one from him 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.960
 preferably oil put here at me 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.739
 no that i didn't let me know what not 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:03.129
 put the scoundrel bills here need butter 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:10.130
 put under the cap and longing and cotter pin 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:14.420
 Here is such which holds this nut on 19 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.520
 then if you shoot it all in the collection 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.250
 but then you need to remove the wheel motoblock 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.900
 Well, or really suffer to debug it on 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.630
 very edge because here is small 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.620
 distance the thickness of the pulley is large it is not 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.650
 will come out 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.900
 that is, labor tormented the wheel from the driver 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:39.640
 I will shoot it and I will shoot in parts 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:43.880
 for this, we take the key 13 and 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.400
 Actually unscrew these nuts case 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:53.640
 it's not easy 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:58.740
 so dreary that you need to remember these 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.530
 it is necessary to unscrew the nuts evenly you 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.090
 is it a cast iron stove or some kind of forehead for me 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.759
 on if the muti unscrew unevenly 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.480
 she can burst and give her fingers there 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.670
 spring is compressed much spring around 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.130
 worth compressed 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.110
 then you actually need to unscrew them 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.120
 evenly unscrew these two too 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.510
 evenly 4 launched slightly 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.090
 let go let go 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.800
 so so shoot but central until 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:36.510
 the nut is twisted in principle it will not fly out 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.500
 painless can be removed to twisted this 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.100
 central nut 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.209
 but if it is not twisted this nano then 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.870
 evenly and twist to look at 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.810
 fingers with a stack of a prize can hit 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.080
 fingers and not at all weakly injured on 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.980
 production and then take the key on 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:26.580
 nineteen 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:29.150
 This Gadget which stand on not approve 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.150
 twisted 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:52.510
 it is better to do certainly not like me 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:55.819
 I give in and fingers 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.079
 Lokoy at 19 through the bureau points Glinka 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:05.540
 Thought photo feet have a cook. didn't hit 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:12.950
 then actually remove the cover 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:15.530
 worth the fallen peak name lead 4 with one 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.410
 side closed on one side 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.590
 open to grease the Chinese have become his 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.120
 here you can change the prince of an open song 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.479
 put you two sides fix 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.810
 nothing terrible in it will not even 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:33.849
 on the contrary less likes to get there 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:38.650
 clutch disc 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:44.780
 look right at the slots 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:47.289
 splines whole lining and erased not 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:52.340
 cracked not black 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:53.979
 means not all burnt rivets on 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.250
 place entirely 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:02.060
 drive a good thickness with almost 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.639
 the shop has been working for four years 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:10.250
 and pay attention to this hub 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:12.289
 not hanging loose hanging not hanging here 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.630
 see the defect on the rivets Chinese 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.370
 made 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.639
 mechanical probably or fields on the machine 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.789
 and 2 rivets 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:26.000
 cut wrong riveted rest 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.389
 okay I get noise on this 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.229
 drive 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:34.070
 it's me it's a rivet hub basically 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.690
 nothing keeps the prophet hanging for beauty 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.090
 the Chinese caught up 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:43.610
 in a good way, of course, these rivets 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.610
 cut well and rivet but the floor is Chinese 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:56.639
 we have what we will not complain 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:56.639
 principle holds well well and actually 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:05.530
 the basket itself and the pulley is removed it me 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:11.560
 I already took it off because she told me 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:15.220
 easily removed who is not removed not 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.560
 removed what to do here after 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.240
 you have it all tied up other necessary 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.940
 you just need to put the clutch squeeze 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:25.870
 pull on her bearing move 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.700
 here from the 2 thread from the minato puller 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.380
 but if already this method is not to remove who 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.660
 then 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:35.229
 filming to help well, in principle, I am 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:38.919
 rented and for the second time in his life 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.700
 motoblock always my clutch survived 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.210
 and she bounced off 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:47.139
 do not need anything like a stripper 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:51.789
 way and look immediately vents 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:54.580
 the heart of the oil, I have wiped this cyst 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:58.510
 for the film were filmed was all fuel oil all 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:01.840
 greased slot clean good wife 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:05.410
 bearing is a separate story wife 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.510
 Bearing I have is still 1 and 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:10.150
 resist and what falls pour on y 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:14.139
 me honestly four years one and 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:18.120
 same here so he dangles on it not 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:18.120
 worn out by such quality chinese 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.360
 wonderful 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:32.270
 Here is such a trouble but so less than 4 years 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:35.300
 works smoothly lubricated four 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:38.480
 years ago how greased so far never 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:42.020
 Do not maz in the grease is whether we have the environment 

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.770
 good whether it's me well done 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.770
 actually like this
