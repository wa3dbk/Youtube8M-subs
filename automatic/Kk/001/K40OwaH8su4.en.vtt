00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.540
 hello very good to all these of mind 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.120
 for fun I'm alex and today we're going to 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.890
 present the first chapter of a 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.720
 season that I will be doing on the 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.110
 step of the days on how to decorate 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.580
 your house go either how to decorate 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.099
 your living room how to decorate our 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:22.240
 cook how to decorate your garden etc 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:25.089
 etc and today I am going to present to you how 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.079
 decorate our garden with fireplaces with 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.439
 types of chimney 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.439
 go for it 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:38.090
 loading the world we see here then you 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.950
 I bring 44 styles of chimneys 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.060
 I'm going to teach it like that over and then 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.530
 let's do the tutorial 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.530
 this would be the first 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.200
 this second one is already much more 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.480
 big 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.940
 the third that's good is a little 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.650
 simple but but good this would be more 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.650
 for inside for your living room 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.710
 and the fourth 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.890
 Once this is done, we are going to 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.930
 let's teach him how to do it 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.290
 for the first one we're going to need 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.290
 stone bricks 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.560
 because the visual stone obviously the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.560
 fire over here 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.710
 a little stone that the stone is already 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.600
 put and let's do the base and then 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.900
 and the details as well as the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.990
 buttons and how I like the plank 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.990
 wood 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.590
 we started we put one each band 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.590
 another behind 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.509
 this is the very simple base 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.470
 we break the stone we put the stone 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.340
 abyssal 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.340
 we raise 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.350
 let's leave them these squares 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.060
 clean to put the wood or if 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.770
 you want you can lift them but good 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.500
 I left it like this I put the wood as a 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.270
 detail from there I leave knife I let 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.070
 the meat whatever it is worth do not know to me 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.190
 I always like to put details 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.670
 that people forget 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.110
 and I forget to take the lid that now 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.780
 I can not find it here is the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.500
 trapdoor 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.120
 if you want to put fire already 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.349
 you put the trapdoor here 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.130
 and this would be what the fireplace of the 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.970
 fireplace if you want to put the buttons 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.970
 you catch them 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.970
 okay to do this 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.470
 all right 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.160
 I'll put 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.160
 the plates 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.720
 and so it's pretty much more detailed pretty 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.490
 it is not so bland 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.750
 if you take this away, it's a bit bland 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.750
 let's go for the second 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.190
 we have 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.890
 good around here 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.800
 before building them what always 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.430
 I do is put the base and then put and 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.380
 we started 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.180
 to build well 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.180
 it would be if we take stone 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.310
 wood too 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.629
 the fire that I do not know why I have removed the 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.959
 abyssal skin I do not know why the 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.959
 agitated 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.450
 good we raise everything is worth 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.400
 and do this 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.459
 and here we put the wood 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.459
 can be put here 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.209
 and for the other band like 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.520
 so here we break these two 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.360
 squares 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.100
 we put one stone here and the other here 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.120
 because if we stop if we put the fire 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:19.970
 equipment will burn the wood we put 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.940
 this here and on top of that stone we put 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.370
 another stone maybe 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.639
 he puts fire 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.639
 decoration blocks you take panel of 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.639
 crystal 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.120
 well 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:41.650
 It could be this way or if you want to 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:41.650
 as it is in the other you raise it 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.020
 you pick them up and it would be 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.760
 how I like it, not so bland, this is worth 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.060
 is the second we see that it is very 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.410
 simple 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:01.290
 for this which is what we have said that 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.450
 it's simpler for in six blocks 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.980
 iron iron blocks 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.430
 I use a lot so I do not see it 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:11.250
 as as very much more modern not 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.380
 you have to take wool or that whole thing 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.360
 stone all wood I do not like 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.920
 so much then I always try to go to 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.280
 the modern is very simple 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.280
 we have 2 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.750
 we got up 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.900
 we put it 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.230
 And here too 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.800
 if you want you can raise it a little 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.800
 plus 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.350
 and cover it 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.160
 we do like this because the way 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.320
 behind is a little bit a little left a little 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.630
 wrong but think that here you have yours 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.150
 your wall of your house is worth this 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.030
 would go down here and that because 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.849
 you would see that either do not worry 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.960
 much 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:17.070
 as I do not have pairs for seve 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.390
 then here you fire him 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.610
 as I said you can download it if 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.979
 you want 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.330
 and we go to the fourth one that is the one that most 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:29.939
 like the truth is that it is quite 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.349
 cured we catch go of abyssal bark 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:33.900
 and we will need nothing more 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:36.220
 good smooth stone you can do everything 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.840
 of d 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.300
 stone bricks of the raisin that to me 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.340
 like to go combining 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.270
 go for it 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.270
 you put one here 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.490
 here 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.840
 Break expose the stone 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.840
 here too 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.380
 behind the smooth stone you wear 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.130
 post d 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.130
 iron 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:16.870
 this starts to start to take shape 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.870
 and here you put this 

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:20.649
 and now stone 

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:41.110
 we turn it on there is candela yes sir 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:44.540
 If you want the stone not to be seen so much 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:48.100
 abyssal you can put more stone 

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.100
 in this case it would be iron block 

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:56.330
 and there are already 44 chimneys made 

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.280
 well this is all gentlemen and 

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.950
