00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.830

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.270
 find today for a new 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.650
 mourning I hope you all go 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.270
 very well because today we are 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.160
 Sunday and who says Sunday 10 of 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.270
 boost a little special week 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.010
 last one had opened sludge 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.480
 start up and today I propose you 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.160
 to welcome you with something 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.050
 that you probably never have 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.880
 views on youtube anyway I have 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.470
 never seen it's a booster 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.930
 extremis to fear 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.970
 but in Japanese, look at me 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.120
 point the booster is terrible he is 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.680
 too much too much too much I love we're going 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.210
 look a little bit we see all the 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.530
 energies of the time 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.000
 at the time he is necessarily more 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.370
 dragon energy an energy makes 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.900
 it was still the good old days we 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.030
 red is the color 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.430
 blue the colors of rubies and sapphire 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.920
 the final evolutions of starter braz and 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.570
 gally growls and janko and finally 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.880
 some little pokemon that symbolizes at 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.990
 n 1 but diana is a liquid guy because 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.370
 I remind you that at the beginning of 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.870
 ruby and sapphire version there is the 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.850
 seco teacher who is being chased by 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.320
 a small media has in any case the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.090
 booster is really very very very beautiful 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.890
 in Japanese there are no boosters 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.360
 as many booster camp illustrations 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.920
 French they only have one 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.479
 illustration while we have four 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.969
 in each series in any case from 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.530
 the former block is still against the 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:20.210
 work much better blow their 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.100
 illustrations look at me how much 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.840
 these rich anyway the booster is 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.380
 terrible and note that it is in edition 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.509
 1 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.490
 all Japanese series have a 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.140
 edition 1 and edition 2 we in 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.549
 French it was only in the wizard block 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.619
 that from the ex block who stopped him 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.579
 editing and we would not necessarily 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.039
 all the same edition 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.869
 so give it to booster we find at 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.159
 small by the cool and a little speedy 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.990
 to show how truly a 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.179
 boost its rich in Japanese is 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.679
 really very very very beautiful and that's the 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.389
 Japanese booster is a little less rated 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.979
 that the French booster I had him 

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:51.020
 for 25 euros but I still had 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.459
 never seen I looked at the prices a little bit to 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.350
 the international and that's really what we 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.030
 can find the booster between 20 and 30 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.310
 euros which is still a small 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.450
 Prices for breakfast this morning before 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.189
 from you open the booster I wanted 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.959
 say the word that granny the seller and the

 wishes an excellent reception in 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.209
 hoping that this booster will make you happy 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.039
 I have a display of 30 aulas do not need 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.150
 you see that from this appointment 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.410
 remind me of the legends of which I am 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.150
 separates if the opportunity you want to do 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.040
 case do not hesitate I know it's 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.540
 a series that you enjoy soon yes 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.220
 that's exactly right in the past 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.180
 I had a discreet call of legend and 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.379
 We know each other 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.000
 with the seller because we already know 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.099
 made sales I sold a display 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.510
 jungle the edition of at the time we know 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.079
 already bought and sold items 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.549
 mutually 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.170
 well, it's someone I know 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.129
 very well and we'll see maybe I 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.750
 will buy him his inis pleases when 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.459
 I will have more sub it's not yet 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.200
 topical 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.370
 good I stop documenting you a lot 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.810
 spoken we may go to the most 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.000
 interesting is what you expect 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.920
 the opening of these Japanese boosters 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.530
 edition a ruby and sapphire 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.329
 it's an ex series then it's gone 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.069
 will go to the opening of this booster 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.290
 on the other hand I had forgotten that in Japanese 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.129
 booster it's super well sealed it's 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.930
 not like the French 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.400
 frankly the japanese have all of 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.909
 better I love the series what the sauce 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.620
 Japanese 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.120
 I said at the beginning of my channel that 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.340
 I would also open full of 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.629
 Japanese but I did not do it because 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.069
 already I can not complete the 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.060
 French series so if I put myself 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.280
 also japanese 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.560
 you can imagine that I would get away with it 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.939
 not then I do not know at all the 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.750
 card placement all I see 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:14.959
 is that I have the impression that there is 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.760
 still a lot of cards 2 4 6 8 10 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.079
 March 11 roughly like French in 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.859
 did I say nothing I had just 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.969
 the impression that it was really 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.560
 hand on these spoilers 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.480
 well here I did not know where was 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.090
 the cards placement look at me the 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.010
 card go too much but the heat cute 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.750
 holographic there is not only 1 to 3 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.430
 of the three small tanks millions with a 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.049
 landscape and colors 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.419
 the card go too much too beautiful 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.129
 wow, it's unblocked these wells 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.319
 balloons it's all four japanese 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.269
 are of better quality than series 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.689
 to French or English very very beautiful 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.090
 map 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.709
 then we will continue with a dinner on 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.849
 really departs the million tank for 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.239
 keep the beauty of the card is not 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.939
 spoiling 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.319
 then we have to chamalot that that 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.629
 comes a lot of rubies and sapphires I 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.769
 know the cards then a weight so 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:59.419
 reindeer a late room 1 swallows or 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.829
 rather a horde of enemies washer on 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.629
 see full of swallow all 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.269
 around the map is worth a visit 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.560
 we follow wow she is too beautiful 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.659
 wow 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.280
 a media but which media has frankly 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.590
 he is in a position she is 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.340
 terrible I love the illustrations of 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.599
 block ex1 stirred up Monday 9am she 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.680
 hold me I remembered it I'm 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:20.570
 remembered this card but I did not 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.759
 not quality in rubies sapphires not bad 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.560
 not bad, we go on with 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.690
 hang on that we do not care a bit and 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.770
 we will end with an energy then 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.180
 apparently in the Japanese series 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.370
 there were no rivers 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.139
 I do not know the specifics at all 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.340
 not to tell you nonsense I know that 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.540
 in the boosters jacques normally he 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.460
 there is always a holographic 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.050
 in any case for the first series I 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.880
 do not know if it continued after in 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.620
 boost to toilet like that they have the 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.630
 called the ex block but in any case 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.340
 frankly very very badly because then very 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.780
 very happy to have opened this booster 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.340
 jap 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.690
 this morning I hope he will have you 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.820
 you had a good time 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.080
 look at me the sapphire ruby ​​acronym 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.889
 then the macro I'm not sure about you 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.680
 to want to be 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.030
 in any case we had the 6th card 55 that 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.310
 means it's only 55 hours in 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.810
 the series like it's weird that there is 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.010
 maybe two happy sapphire then 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.750
 I am for I am produced everything I 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.160
 do not know I do not know Japanese 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.020
 compared to French I am 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.580
 much less stalling but in any case I 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.090
 think we had a very good 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.590
 breakfast 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.210

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.850
 classic boosters 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.130
