00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.030
 hello in this video lesson i want 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.210
 show you how to use the program 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.000
 Photoshop can create such an interesting 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.560
 beautiful effect for your photos under 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.460
 name earlybird 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:25.410
 and so where to start the first we create 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.740
 gradient map gradient we should 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.260
 standard over purple to orange 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.090
 click ok and the orange should be in 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.309
 lights and purple in the shadows 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.629
 of you is not right then click here 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.570
 inversion we leave this squaw after 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.110
 create this and after that you need it 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.360
 your translate in multiplication 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.360
 opacity lower about 20 25 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.780
 after that we create our own brightness 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:04.219
 contrast and brightness we increase 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.219
 up to 15 contrast up to 20 20 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.789
 we leave this layer after this 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:17.630
 create your color but fill with color and 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:21.170
 we need a color called fdf 1 to 5 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.100
 under the code so this is such a light 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.979
 beige click ok and 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.729
 we must have this color too 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.369
 multiplication is a whole 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:38.560
 and its opacity will be the same 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:43.009
 so further we need to create your level 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:48.020
 channel level irji bimbo should here 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:53.689
 here moving the slider left approximately 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:56.119
 to a value of 0 0 20 something like this further 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:02.349
 go to the red channel and this one 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.349
 slider already translate dita value 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.560
 15 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.650
 we leave this layer and we need now 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.830
 create a copy of layers a copy of all layers 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.410
 one goal on pinch shift keys dispute 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.790
 contour alt e 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.910
 layer is created we need it now 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:28.049
 discolored remove image 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.440
 correction discolor further we have this 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:36.560
 layer should should make your own 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.560
 be laying on a soft light and 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:44.360
 opacity we put about 50 so 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.720
 so after that we create create need 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.680
 increase the contrast on our snapshot 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:01.720
 for this we simply create the whole fill 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:06.840
 its black color and now you need to create 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:11.170
 gradient map gradient map 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:15.340
 now take the gradient 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.280
 radial and off black white and black 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.970
 black and just do here 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.299
 from the center to the edges like this 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.180
 It turned out on a vignette such now we 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:31.889
 can using opacity 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.959
 choose the one we need 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:40.530
 opacity how much will 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:45.239
 shaded our edges put it 82 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.700
 next we create an exposure layer before and 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:55.419
 shift on need to move about to 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:57.120
 values ​​of 080 come back and now to us 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:00.480
 need to create 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.690
 again new layer copy from all layers 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:08.489
 shift contour alt e and now you should 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.489
 go filter 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:17.350
 Sharpening and contour sharpness 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.940
 here we will set up as you need depending 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.680
 depending on your 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:27.000
 from your snapshot as far as you snapshot 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:30.509
 big you adjust the effect and radius 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.660
 we click ok now we can all our own 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:36.599
 merge into one group and let's 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.610
 let's see what we got in the end 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:43.410
 Here's a picture of us turned 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:47.020
 our effect here is this we had 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:53.020
 there was such a misty haze beautiful 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.389
 such colors and very good processing 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.430
 photos 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:00.180
 I wish you good luck with Photoshop and 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.630
 often use such interesting 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:07.349
 effects to process your photos 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.349
 good luck everyone bye
