00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
weapons and things in the game what you

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.000 
weapons and things in the game what you
can<00:02:33.440> do<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.920> set<00:02:34.730> up<00:02:34.760> sets<00:02:35.660> within<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.530> game<00:02:36.680> by

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
can do is set up sets within the game by

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.250 
can do is set up sets within the game by
choosing<00:02:37.340> different<00:02:37.700> items<00:02:38.240> so<00:02:38.750> if<00:02:38.900> I<00:02:39.020> load

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
choosing different items so if I load

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.750 
choosing different items so if I load
one<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.650> I've<00:02:39.740> already<00:02:39.890> set<00:02:40.190> up<00:02:40.220> for<00:02:40.700> example

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
one that I've already set up for example

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.490 
one that I've already set up for example
this<00:02:41.150> one<00:02:41.390> I<00:02:42.100> can<00:02:43.100> then<00:02:43.310> go<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.540> decide<00:02:45.140> why<00:02:45.470> I

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
this one I can then go and decide why I

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.880 
this one I can then go and decide why I
would<00:02:46.040> like<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.900> find<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:48.050> staff<00:02:48.290> that<00:02:48.470> matches

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
would like to find a staff that matches

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.030 
would like to find a staff that matches
so<00:02:49.220> I'd<00:02:49.340> go<00:02:49.550> to<00:02:49.610> do<00:02:50.030> hand<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:50.690> stuff<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:51.470> then

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
so I'd go to do hand and stuff and then

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.030 
so I'd go to do hand and stuff and then
it<00:02:52.430> basically<00:02:53.140> gives<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.260> all<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.590> stuffs<00:02:54.860> in

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
it basically gives you all the stuffs in

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.010 
it basically gives you all the stuffs in
the<00:02:55.160> game<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:56.120> can<00:02:56.270> filter<00:02:56.510> through<00:02:56.750> them

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
the game and you can filter through them

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.810 
the game and you can filter through them
and<00:02:57.260> just<00:02:57.530> try<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.370> find<00:02:58.670> one<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:58.910> matches<00:02:59.560> I

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
and just try and find one that matches I

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.760 
and just try and find one that matches I
think<00:03:01.820> is<00:03:01.910> really<00:03:02.060> cool<00:03:02.330> it's<00:03:02.840> especially

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
think is really cool it's especially

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.890 
think is really cool it's especially
good<00:03:04.130> if<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.580> have<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.820> certain<00:03:05.090> item<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:05.750> you

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
good if you have a certain item that you

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.990 
good if you have a certain item that you
really<00:03:06.709> like<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.250> want<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.550> use<00:03:07.760> for

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
really like and you want to use for

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.170 
really like and you want to use for
example<00:03:08.060> for<00:03:08.930> me<00:03:09.020> it<00:03:09.110> was<00:03:09.200> these<00:03:09.380> shoulders

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
example for me it was these shoulders

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.490 
example for me it was these shoulders
and<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.420> want<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.690> find<00:03:11.870> things<00:03:12.080> that<00:03:12.230> match

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
and you want to find things that match

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.790 
and you want to find things that match
perfectly<00:03:13.720> without<00:03:14.720> sort<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.350> looking<00:03:15.620> online

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
perfectly without sort of looking online

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.620 
perfectly without sort of looking online
and<00:03:16.130> things<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:16.700> just<00:03:16.880> doing<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.510> yourself

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
and things and just doing it yourself

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.580 
and things and just doing it yourself
really<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:19.100> you<00:03:19.520> can<00:03:19.670> also<00:03:19.820> filter<00:03:20.239> by<00:03:20.720> color

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
really so you can also filter by color

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.930 
really so you can also filter by color
and<00:03:22.040> things<00:03:22.310> which<00:03:22.730> is<00:03:23.120> really<00:03:23.420> useful<00:03:23.570> and

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
and things which is really useful and

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.880 
and things which is really useful and
also<00:03:25.940> if<00:03:26.060> somebody<00:03:26.510> else<00:03:26.720> has<00:03:27.440> got<00:03:27.680> this

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
also if somebody else has got this

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.100 
also if somebody else has got this
add-on<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.400> can<00:03:28.519> link<00:03:28.970> your<00:03:29.060> sets<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.660> them<00:03:29.900> so

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
add-on you can link your sets to them so

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.610 
add-on you can link your sets to them so
you<00:03:30.170> can<00:03:30.440> share<00:03:30.620> them<00:03:31.540> yeah<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:33.440> is<00:03:33.590> a
