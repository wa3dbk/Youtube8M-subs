00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.170
 very good here we are in the dungeon 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:06.910
 of pacheco again with a boxing that is 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.800
 open a box in front of people who 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.660
 You see how to do it I mean in the 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.519
 20th century that that would be a sample of 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.280
 entertainment so it is we are with 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.890
 the black sword game a board game 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.750
 of editing already form exactly the 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.610
 Armenian edition that is a game that 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.590
 very kindly has yielded us 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.330
 given precisely the brothers 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.600
 sworn from the black sword that 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.580
 usually some association 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.990
 which is what created the game in addition 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.990
 are those who have created the role play 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:44.280
 for all my life I wanted to leave you 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.809
 Of course, one of the challenges 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.190
 most important of the game is to sleep already and 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.840
 well here we have the edition a measure 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.850
 that maybe later there will be more 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.680
 expansions baixas and after 30 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.050
 minutes in principle from 14 years 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.489
 and for two or more players not for the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.320
 limit so we assume that limits are 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.950
 300 players 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.950
 good 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:11.729
 the instructions of the box in addition to 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:17.070
 that the guys behind so you can see 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.690
 read and see the game already if you like 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:25.610
 letters 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:25.610
 board game if we have is important 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.650
 it is possible with always matches 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.000
 have deadlocks in relation to the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.980
 way to award the letters in case of 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.330
 tie good so here comes this is 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.750
 a notice about the optional rules 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.270
 on how to tie and carry 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.310
 out the games in other ways not 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.770
 they really are not the same, it's not necessary 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.580
 if behind the letters to the same type and 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.900
 so we have 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.000
 the types of letters are few if they are 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.470
 few because this is an auction game 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.120
 is a strategic game rather than 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.760
 combinatorial then it's a game this 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.050
 that you have to remember but the letters 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.460
 that has to give a little bit those that have 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.480
 come out the ones that can come out then 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.700
 obviously they have to be 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.700
 relatively few types because if not 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:18.910
 yes sure it will be and well then 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.490
 we have these letters as you see as I say 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.740
 with very beautiful some produce by 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.440
 here we see that they produce gold other dan 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.910
 points are taken from a gold I do not remember 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.640
 very well the victory points indeed 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.050
 right at the end of the game wins and then 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.520
 some as you see here they have a symbol 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.540
 of attack because this despite being a 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.720
 game of auction is a game of the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.959
 expenses in which you can attack curious and 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.719
 the letters then have here a 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.489
 a special legend that does not apply in 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.200
 the game but before the game 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.430
 You can select some letters and 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.129
 put them on the table they create 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.769
 special conditions for that game 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.200
 we will make a game shortly to see 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.049
 how exactly has died so 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.370
 Well, you know what good thanks to 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.290
 the brothers oaths of the black 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.060
 we will put your website here below 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.739
 so you can find out about all their 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.629
 news and other things about this black 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.239
 role play and the card game because 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.750
 this is the board or of cards will not come 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.750
 soon
