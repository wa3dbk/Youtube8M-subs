off the springs first go to sit back and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.420 
off the springs first go to sit back and
you'll<00:01:02.219> screw<00:01:02.550> driver<00:01:02.850> off<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.600> part<00:01:04.430> now

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you'll screw driver off this part now

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.770 
you'll screw driver off this part now
you<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.790> remember<00:01:06.060> which<00:01:06.360> way<00:01:06.600> it's

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.899 
you have to remember which way it's
pointing<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.830> know<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.310> isn't<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
pointing so you know that this isn't a

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.820 
pointing so you know that this isn't a
piece<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.960> plastics<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> bottom<00:01:11.220> right<00:01:12.830> so

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
piece of plastics on the bottom right so

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.580 
piece of plastics on the bottom right so
you'll<00:01:13.950> take<00:01:14.130> those<00:01:14.369> off<00:01:16.100> very<00:01:17.100> basic<00:01:18.590> swing

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
this cuz it's not going to go through

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.000 
this cuz it's not going to go through
and<00:01:31.220> this<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.640> a<00:01:31.670> retaining<00:01:32.180> cap<00:01:32.390> for<00:01:33.010> the

and this is a retaining cap for the
different<00:01:34.400> shoots<00:01:35.320> so<00:01:36.320> you'll<00:01:36.470> take<00:01:36.650> that<00:01:36.890> off

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
different shoots so you'll take that off

wouldn't<00:02:08.149> sit<00:02:08.330> flush<00:02:08.539> so<00:02:08.750> I<00:02:08.780> had<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.080> remove<00:02:09.350> it

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
wouldn't sit flush so I had to remove it

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.949 
wouldn't sit flush so I had to remove it
it<00:02:10.009> won't<00:02:10.250> stop<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.729> operation<00:02:10.970> just<00:02:11.720> as<00:02:11.810> long

it won't stop the operation just as long

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.290 
it won't stop the operation just as long
as<00:02:12.080> there's<00:02:12.230> two<00:02:12.350> on<00:02:12.470> each<00:02:12.620> side<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:14.060> was

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
as there's two on each side so that was

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.840 
as there's two on each side so that was
okay<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.739> get<00:02:15.890> all<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.310> dollar<00:02:16.489> much<00:02:16.730> you

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
this can be quite tricky it's gonna seem

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.759 
this can be quite tricky it's gonna seem

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
does that a lot

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.820 
does that a lot
just<00:02:26.390> try<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.540> keep<00:02:26.690> going<00:02:27.410> like<00:02:27.530> this<00:02:27.590> until

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
just try to keep going like this until

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:41.710 
just try to keep going like this until
you<00:02:31.510> can<00:02:32.510> use<00:02:33.440> quite<00:02:33.620> irritating<00:02:39.549> if<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:41.600> have

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
you can use quite irritating if you have

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.870 
you can use quite irritating if you have
to<00:02:41.810> do<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.019> for<00:02:42.140> like<00:02:42.410> maybe<00:02:42.620> 40<00:02:43.190> times<00:02:43.430> before

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
to do it for like maybe 40 times before

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.280 
to do it for like maybe 40 times before
after<00:02:44.150> though<00:02:44.540> I'm<00:02:45.019> not<00:02:45.140> sure<00:02:45.380> whatever<00:02:47.290> it's

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
after though I'm not sure whatever it's

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:57.240 
after though I'm not sure whatever it's
not<00:02:48.380> really<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.620> foot<00:02:48.920> -<00:02:52.720> just<00:02:53.720> be<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:53.989> but

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:05.009 

you'll<00:02:58.250> feel<00:02:58.549> kind<00:02:58.820> of

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.289 

so<00:03:06.019> again<00:03:06.500> just<00:03:06.799> everything's<00:03:07.160> reversed<00:03:07.400> so

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
so again just everything's reversed so

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.300 
so again just everything's reversed so
this<00:03:08.480> goes<00:03:08.660> back<00:03:08.900> on<00:03:09.140> here<00:03:10.299> stick<00:03:11.299> it<00:03:11.420> on<00:03:12.310> this

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
this goes back on here stick it on this

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.650 
this goes back on here stick it on this
one<00:03:13.549> doesn't<00:03:13.730> have<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:13.940> be<00:03:14.060> flush<00:03:14.329> but<00:03:14.570> you

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
one doesn't have to be flush but you

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.970 
one doesn't have to be flush but you
want<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.900> all<00:03:15.049> your<00:03:15.200> screws<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.590> be<00:03:15.680> flushed

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
want to all your screws to be flushed

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.970 
want to all your screws to be flushed
course<00:03:16.400> just<00:03:17.150> looks<00:03:17.360> pretty<00:03:17.829> something<00:03:18.829> back

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
course just looks pretty something back

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.430 
course just looks pretty something back
on<00:03:19.810> if<00:03:20.810> there<00:03:21.019> are<00:03:21.079> these<00:03:21.200> springs<00:03:21.739> back<00:03:21.950> on

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
on if there are these springs back on

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.030 
on if there are these springs back on
and<00:03:24.440> stick<00:03:24.739> your<00:03:24.890> other<00:03:25.160> piece<00:03:25.489> back<00:03:25.760> on<00:03:26.000> here

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
and stick your other piece back on here

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:38.520 
and stick your other piece back on here
like<00:03:28.040> this

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:04:11.309 

yeah<00:03:39.530> answer

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.890 

so<00:04:12.189> that<00:04:12.370> goes<00:04:12.549> back<00:04:12.730> on<00:04:12.939> there<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.659> you<00:04:13.810> have

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
so that goes back on there and you have

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.680 
so that goes back on there and you have
to<00:04:14.049> slide<00:04:15.010> it<00:04:15.040> in<00:04:15.250> here<00:04:15.430> there's<00:04:16.150> a<00:04:16.269> piece<00:04:16.479> of

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
to slide it in here there's a piece of

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.569 
to slide it in here there's a piece of
plastic<00:04:17.109> where<00:04:17.259> the<00:04:17.380> coins<00:04:17.799> actually<00:04:18.100> shoot

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
plastic where the coins actually shoot

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.640 
plastic where the coins actually shoot
in<00:04:18.820> here<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.630> sometimes<00:04:20.109> if<00:04:20.229> you<00:04:20.289> don't<00:04:20.410> put

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
in here and sometimes if you don't put

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.840 
in here and sometimes if you don't put
it<00:04:20.739> in<00:04:20.859> right<00:04:21.039> you<00:04:21.160> can<00:04:21.310> actually<00:04:21.430> get<00:04:21.669> that

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
it in right you can actually get that

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.129 
it in right you can actually get that
off<00:04:21.970> kilter<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:22.389> the<00:04:22.539> coins<00:04:22.780> will<00:04:22.930> go<00:04:23.050> in

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
off kilter and the coins will go in

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.840 
off kilter and the coins will go in
there<00:04:23.199> and<00:04:23.350> you<00:04:23.410> got<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.530> problem<00:04:23.830> you<00:04:24.639> got<00:04:24.759> to
