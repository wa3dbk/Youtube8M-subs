00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:11.490
 and whirls a warm welcome 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.019
 wilkins wonderful my goodness how it looks 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.460
 I have my final daily 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.770
 Reward once completely through 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.539
 the last 30 days begins again 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.270
 That's not what interests me 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.220
 but what I really want to show where 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.019
 is that where is this where is my gold here 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.400
 leave and then I'll show you this 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.560
 directly one can on the map namely 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.809
 now I have waited extra where is it 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.920
 because now I have the event in me 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.890
 logged in for two minutes what else 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.670
 there it is down here 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.160
 I just thought that has another 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.660
 had color in common, well nee the event 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.550
 we already know your okay little 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.899
 goes then we do only have 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.250
 I probably the other event probably 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.840
 That somehow misses a minute 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.840
 pretty annoying story 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:02.160
 ok we can do what I want 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.750
 do not hear a story but we can do it 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.369
 The question is a bit more 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.650
 see if we come in there 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.729
 but that should be possible 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.320
 i want that again with mine 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.939
 classic tactics make him a role model 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.280
 even with before it actually wants a whole 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:23.040
 little dragon I like to am 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:24.600
 quietly did a bit I played 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.990
 do this again and again this 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.909
 Leap is incredible about the power 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.960
 it's actually that in its old age 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.750
 Spielmann can imagine because of it 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.770
 actually it is called realtime and 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.689
 theoretically you should not be there then 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.710
 can imagine without dying 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.329
 many units 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.610
 it may well be that we are not there 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:47.759
 get through no chance no chance 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.189
 not with this army but we wish 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.170
 do it all out a little bit and do it 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.610
 the following we also need to take 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.329
 I'm blabbering this now 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.259
 listen to 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.560
 That's not true, it does not itch me 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.810
 so be careful now we take it anyway 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.380
 destroyed and I would think so here 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.380
 one but 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.810
 11 quads that it makes a difference if I am 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.360
 I definitely need that now 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.330
 also makes the different there 3 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.220
 first step there was a bowman 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:25.160
 we do it the whole time 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.530
 only shows the zack and says like a 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.790
 small 5 on the cube so that must be 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.019
 our houses are all in one 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.400
 direction that I did not quite make it 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.230
 but do it on the other side 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.140
 little damage to our kite from 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.209
 behind but this angie angie is already 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.930
 that makes the pressure really right 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.830
 so that's an engine tower 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.989
 I have to need my year now 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.470
 Just pull on safety that was 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.390
 the back of me in any case this 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.690
 beautiful strongbow destroys so belongs 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.670
 the 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.730
 we'll get that again here 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.799
 the frost from the top exactly and now comes 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.310
 already after the power gave the job 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.680
 sheet does not matter was not bad was like 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.410
 get approach comes anyway 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:10.549
 thus we well as you know 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.600
 by that already destroy anyway 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.350
 Our 30km bonus is getting wonderful 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.430
 Let's do this again here 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.549
 thought if I really wanted you 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.109
 this other mission will show you below 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.530
 was ahead of other missions but this is 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.810
 it does not seem to come then that 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.190
 Next time I want to be okay 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.410
 I can follow faith in the north 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.209
 not go because we all fight 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.600
 already done then we just do it 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:42.590
 the website mobile veit so a whole 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:43.670
 normal public toilet that is 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.380
 actually the only thing 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.870
 I'm nervous now and I would 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.310
 I like to stay with my tanks 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.280
 because here afterwards and I think so 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.480
 actually quite good that we so ours 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.040
 archers a bit out of the 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.420
 bredouille keep from what should 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.130
 actually falling fast because of that 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.769
 I think I can set so early 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.850
 here are a few things together a 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.590
 moment you denglisch is also back 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.450
 really rough at the start dies here 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.210
 Everything is gone but that is not so tragic 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.870
 because revenge thinks i think mwp is from 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.270
 this round 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:17.090
 oh my god where are you coming at once 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:18.470
 this damage the dragon ago what a 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.120
 seven killstreak okay that's it 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.680
 not bad at all but got it anyway 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.720
 this damage in the kites i thought 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.180
 I've been very relaxed it all 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.470
 Relaxed relaxed play you 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.030
 Yogaeasy.de has long been like her 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.930
 cancer on now that the farmer easier 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.670
 because we can get ahead here 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.600
 Just wait as I am with mine 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.180
 broke a bit too hectic rhine 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.030
 run since I am now completely honest 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:44.720
 and now everything is off air 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.800
 now we can get a 1 from 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.410
 the and I want very much like my 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.600
 Archers behind those of mine heal 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.550
 or rather protect with the ability 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.190
 once everything freaked the prime it is 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.570
 very important that no harm 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.780
 to be more so no extra 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.840
 hurt more for the others 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.340
 defense building distributed wonderful 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.680
 another nice victory 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.940
 that's the way you play it 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.600
 actually still when I mean I am 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.880
 be honest with you 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.770
 I play currently in viking take 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.790
 really only as it was at the beginning 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.510
 that means I go once 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.460
 purely on day x 121 or sometimes too 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.080
 all beatles stones earlier i am so in 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.640
 my times of riot games 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.820
 actually two times a day 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.890
 entered and wrote me on each 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.090
 with comments like me 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.410
 the game still looks and he does 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.330
 any suggestions for improvement 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.350
 So you would like her or if he was 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.370
 maybe some fast dax 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.990
 be that because i still play my game 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.070
 pretty new I have recently 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.500
 seen who I think the 5 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.350
 million downloads is managed 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.720
 namely not a bad number 5 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.420
 million players took tag what 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.560
 the gold is back there 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.250
 why pay is the gold behind me 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.860
 I just have to think here 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.970
 then destroy the gold 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.320
 then I can sit down there now I can 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.820
 your reinsetzen I do not believe that 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.240
 then you can let yourself in here 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.110
 put 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.250
 Is that possible 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.400
 Can I get you in there? I can not 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.660
 We now also use and protect 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.410
 one more second I believe 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.790
 not that they do not stand a chance though 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:16.120
 the gold did not take a big one 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:17.860
 victorious with 25 km running despite greasy've 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.300
 erasmus unlocked in the title in 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.850
 italy definitely digital 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.490
 collection that is a rare nature 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.450
 Titanium easier just a bit 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.600
 I improve a little bit what have 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.890
 We also in the state once I got him 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.320
 tens of thousands but he will become now 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:35.490
 not here for him look how far 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:38.260
 is to bring high 300 km gold 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.970
 300k money we can with our 300 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.590
 callgirl the infected hire yes 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.630
 I do not itch but not one with the 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.280
 scissorhands you're boring even 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.990
 Unfortunately , I reluctantly read such 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.169
 stories through that do not bother you 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:53.560
 rubble and ash not yet available 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:55.720
 okay i thought what will come again 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.500
 or is already activated but it 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.730
 then probably a new one seems 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.100
 to be a mission 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.660
 after like her model in the north now 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.580
 already hit us in the south 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.229
 a campaign was barely off 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:09.880
 we can tinker a bit further 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:11.860
 but upgrade our gold storage storage 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.740
 is it really with him what are 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.940
 the maximum number for titans currently 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.010
 for me rather not maximum number 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.050
 make an upgrade ok I have to 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.380
 can I have mine now I would have to 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.680
 look 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:26.639
 i believe the highest level of titan 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.530
 what I have the level 23 with 1 active 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.150
 Then he 'll come and see if we go 

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.680
 which could evolve 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.900
 we can not continue to wrap 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.789
 could be a pity then we must first 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.770
 our stronghold upgrade so that we can 

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:39.090
 and then we can do it 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.499
 that too , of course, but of course I have to 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.580
 collect a bit together because enough 

00:07:40.499 --> 00:07:42.629
 I do not have that and with them 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.039
 remaining james I'm still in there 

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:46.139
 Startbereich that does not mean that either 

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:49.590
 I need a bit of cash, in fact 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:50.819
 a bit of gold then would a 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.139
 drive a little bit and we'll take a look 

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:52.979
 Next follow a little bit on last 

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:54.569
 Definitely a thumbs up 

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:58.159
 Thanks for watching it makes it good 

00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:58.159
 Until next time
