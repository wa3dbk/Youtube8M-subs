00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
I just from the looks of the wood and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.899 
I just from the looks of the wood and
the<00:01:19.920> smells<00:01:20.280> kind<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.670> musty<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.490> pulled

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the smells kind of musty so I pulled

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.830 
the smells kind of musty so I pulled
that<00:01:24.409> frame<00:01:25.409> or<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> shelf<00:01:26.040> art<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.759> meant<00:01:27.720> that

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that frame or the shelf art I meant that

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.730 
that frame or the shelf art I meant that
it<00:01:27.930> was<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.259> attached

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
it was really attached

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.539 
it was really attached
anyway<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.369> they<00:01:30.150> had<00:01:30.299> these<00:01:30.450> seams

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
anyway and they had these seams

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.190 
anyway and they had these seams
duct-taped<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.420> took<00:01:33.540> all<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> duct<00:01:34.020> tape

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
duct-taped so I took all the duct tape

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.910 
duct-taped so I took all the duct tape
off<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.619> along<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> way<00:01:35.720> a<00:01:36.770> couple<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
off all along the way a couple of the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.359 
off all along the way a couple of the
holes<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> corners<00:01:39.530> I<00:01:40.530> believe<00:01:41.130> there<00:01:41.340> was

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
holes in the corners I believe there was

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.010 
holes in the corners I believe there was
a<00:01:41.520> mouse<00:01:41.790> at<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.180> point<00:01:42.390> they<00:01:42.570> did<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:42.810> some

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
perfect but it's tight as it wasn't

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.610 
perfect but it's tight as it wasn't
tight<00:05:12.010> at<00:05:12.130> all<00:05:12.250> when<00:05:12.490> I<00:05:12.520> got<00:05:12.790> it<00:05:13.290> so<00:05:14.290> I'm<00:05:14.470> gonna

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
tight at all when I got it so I'm gonna

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.900 
tight at all when I got it so I'm gonna
go<00:05:14.800> ahead<00:05:14.920> and<00:05:15.420> do<00:05:16.420> the<00:05:16.570> sides

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.210 

it's<00:05:19.480> a<00:05:19.510> little<00:05:19.750> tough<00:05:20.020> of<00:05:20.200> an<00:05:20.320> angle<00:05:20.650> to<00:05:20.860> get<00:05:21.190> a

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
it's a little tough of an angle to get a

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.180 
it's a little tough of an angle to get a
screwdriver<00:05:21.490> or<00:05:21.910> a<00:05:22.120> drill<00:05:22.240> down<00:05:22.660> in<00:05:22.840> there<00:05:23.190> so

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
screwdriver or a drill down in there so

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.820 
screwdriver or a drill down in there so
I<00:05:24.220> start<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.730> screws<00:05:25.000> first<00:05:25.500> get<00:05:26.500> them<00:05:26.590> just

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
I start the screws first get them just

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.070 
I start the screws first get them just
poking<00:05:27.190> out<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.310> bottom<00:05:27.760> and<00:05:27.940> then<00:05:28.750> I<00:05:28.870> just

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
poking out the bottom and then I just

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.330 
poking out the bottom and then I just
use<00:05:29.320> a<00:05:30.120> makeshift<00:05:31.500> ratchet<00:05:32.500> screwdriver<00:05:32.620> with

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
use a makeshift ratchet screwdriver with

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.850 
use a makeshift ratchet screwdriver with
a<00:05:33.370> little<00:05:33.670> screw<00:05:33.850> tip<00:05:34.000> on<00:05:34.210> there<00:05:34.390> or<00:05:34.690> a<00:05:35.020> little

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
a little screw tip on there or a little

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.030 
a little screw tip on there or a little
stubby<00:05:36.340> and<00:05:37.020> then<00:05:38.020> I'll<00:05:38.140> put<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.710> cover<00:05:38.950> on

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
stubby and then I'll put the cover on

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.620 
stubby and then I'll put the cover on
the<00:05:39.310> tops<00:05:40.920> should<00:05:41.920> begin<00:05:42.160> to<00:05:42.280> go<00:05:42.460> so<00:05:43.300> we'll<00:05:43.480> get

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
the tops should begin to go so we'll get

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.680 
the tops should begin to go so we'll get
back<00:05:43.690> in<00:05:44.200> a<00:05:44.230> little<00:05:44.470> while
