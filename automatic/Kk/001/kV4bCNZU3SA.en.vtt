00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
they don't like the game so much to try

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.349 
they don't like the game so much to try
to<00:02:39.359> do<00:02:39.569> it<00:02:39.689> the<00:02:39.870> legit<00:02:40.079> way<00:02:40.680> um<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:42.209> they<00:02:42.329> just

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
up the regular way so it's annoying but

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.080 
up the regular way so it's annoying but
at<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.010> same<00:03:02.189> time<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:02.700> like<00:03:02.760> we're

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
at the same time it's like we're

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.539 
at the same time it's like we're
whatever<00:03:03.500> what<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.620> your<00:03:04.799> approach<00:03:05.099> to<00:03:05.219> do

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
whatever what is your approach to do

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:06.920 
whatever what is your approach to do
anyway<00:03:05.879> just<00:03:05.939> allow<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.389> like<00:03:06.540> sniff<00:03:06.840> your

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
anyway just allow you to like sniff your

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.339 
anyway just allow you to like sniff your
balls<00:03:07.200> by<00:03:07.530> standing<00:03:07.919> straight<00:03:08.159> up<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:09.840> think<00:03:10.230> it

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
balls by standing straight up I think it

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.959 
balls by standing straight up I think it
allows<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.889> I<00:03:10.950> don't<00:03:11.099> have<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.370> but<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:11.849> think

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:11.969 
allows you I don't have it but I think

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.909 
allows you I don't have it but I think
it<00:03:12.359> allows<00:03:12.569> you<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:13.019> UM<00:03:13.260> hear<00:03:13.709> their<00:03:13.889> footsteps

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.170 
I guess if you're gonna do host
migration<00:05:12.990> I<00:05:13.440> guess<00:05:13.620> tweak<00:05:14.340> it<00:05:14.580> and<00:05:14.729> you<00:05:15.060> know

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
migration I guess tweak it and you know

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.180 
migration I guess tweak it and you know
make<00:05:15.479> it<00:05:15.630> work<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.990> proper<00:05:16.349> way<00:05:16.590> because<00:05:16.979> I

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
make it work the proper way because I

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.129 
make it work the proper way because I
can't<00:05:17.909> count<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.330> number<00:05:18.360> of<00:05:18.659> times<00:05:18.780> I've
