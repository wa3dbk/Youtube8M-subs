activity everybody really enjoyed doing
it<00:00:07.859> today<00:00:08.900> very<00:00:09.900> simple<00:00:10.320> materials<00:00:11.010> just

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
it today very simple materials just

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.220 
it today very simple materials just
didn't<00:00:11.429> have<00:00:11.580> construction<00:00:12.269> paper<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.960> the

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
didn't have construction paper in the

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.010 
didn't have construction paper in the
six<00:00:13.410> colors<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.160> rainbow<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:15.020> scissors

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
six colors of the rainbow and scissors

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.189 
six colors of the rainbow and scissors
glue<00:00:16.470> sticks<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.420> I<00:00:18.420> think<00:00:18.779> that's<00:00:18.930> about<00:00:19.050> it

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
glue sticks and I think that's about it

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.380 
glue sticks and I think that's about it
and<00:00:19.650> what<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.800> did<00:00:20.100> was<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.699> had<00:00:20.730> these<00:00:21.090> already

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
and what I did was I had these already

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.200 
and what I did was I had these already
pre<00:00:21.840> sliced<00:00:21.990> or<00:00:22.710> pre-cut<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.460> did<00:00:23.939> these<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.150> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
pre sliced or pre-cut I did these in the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.880 
pre sliced or pre-cut I did these in the
one<00:00:24.390> inch<00:00:24.630> lengths<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.410> here<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.590> thought<00:00:25.769> this

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
one inch lengths on here I thought this

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.620 
one inch lengths on here I thought this
was<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> great<00:00:26.340> manageable<00:00:27.000> size<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
was a great manageable size for the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.029 
was a great manageable size for the
children<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> have<00:00:28.260> them<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.560> with<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:28.949> I'm

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
children to have them this with so I'm

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.919 
children to have them this with so I'm
change<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.550> really<00:00:29.849> huge<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.720> think

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
change like really huge and I think

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:31.970 
change like really huge and I think
that's<00:00:31.050> very<00:00:31.080> hard<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.560> children<00:00:31.890> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
that's very hard for the children to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.280 
that's very hard for the children to
hold<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.399> glue<00:00:32.520> at<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.730> same<00:00:32.969> time<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:34.110> can

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
hold and glue at the same time you can

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.870 
hold and glue at the same time you can
do<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.950> feel<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.280> best<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:35.670> your

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
do what you you feel is best for your

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.639 
do what you you feel is best for your
learning<00:00:36.239> environment<00:00:36.329> mine<00:00:36.750> was<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:37.140> inch<00:00:37.380> I

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
learning environment mine was one inch I

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.040 
learning environment mine was one inch I
had<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.370> set<00:00:38.610> out<00:00:38.760> I'll<00:00:39.030> submit<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> chart<00:00:39.840> for

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
had to set out I'll submit a chart for

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.650 
had to set out I'll submit a chart for
the<00:00:40.170> children<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:41.160> what<00:00:41.370> order<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.270> colors

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the children with what order the colors

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.750 
the children with what order the colors
of<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.170> chain<00:00:43.410> were<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.739> go<00:00:43.890> these<00:00:44.280> were<00:00:44.460> mixed

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
of the chain were to go these were mixed

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.310 
of the chain were to go these were mixed
up<00:00:44.910> they<00:00:45.030> were<00:00:45.090> not<00:00:45.300> put<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.600> order<00:00:45.960> because<00:00:46.170> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
up they were not put in order because I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.510 
up they were not put in order because I
want<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> children<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.039> sort<00:00:47.280> through<00:00:47.399> and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
want the children to sort through and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.150 
want the children to sort through and
find<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> colors<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.899> then<00:00:49.530> they<00:00:49.800> made<00:00:49.980> their

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
find the colors and then they made their

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.860 
find the colors and then they made their
chains<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.030> them<00:00:51.210> how<00:00:51.449> many<00:00:51.510> of

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
chains it was up to them how many of

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.950 
chains it was up to them how many of
these<00:00:52.410> they<00:00:52.649> wanted<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.129> make<00:00:53.539> but<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.600> did<00:00:54.780> ask

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
these they wanted to make but I did ask

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.450 
these they wanted to make but I did ask
that<00:00:55.079> they<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.320> at<00:00:55.590> least<00:00:55.620> one<00:00:56.010> complete

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that they do at least one complete

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.880 
that they do at least one complete
sequence<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.719> colors<00:00:58.050> most<00:00:58.320> children<00:00:58.739> did

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
sequence of the colors most children did

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.500 
sequence of the colors most children did
three<00:00:59.129> or<00:00:59.250> four<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.030> have<00:01:00.210> some<00:01:00.390> really

great great for fine motor skills I hand

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.690 
great great for fine motor skills I hand
coordination<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.630> color<00:01:13.350> identification<00:01:13.799> as

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
coordination and color identification as

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.969 
coordination and color identification as
well<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:15.390> there<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.619> would<00:01:16.740> start

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979

well on there and so they would start
out<00:01:17.070> with<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> first<00:01:17.490> piece<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.750> know

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
out with the first piece of I know

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.620 
out with the first piece of I know
you've<00:01:19.860> all<00:01:20.130> done<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.460> before<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.390> first

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
you've all done this before the first

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.380 
you've all done this before the first
piece<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.960> construction<00:01:22.350> paper<00:01:22.759> fold<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.970> or

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
piece of construction paper fold it or

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.149 
piece of construction paper fold it or
not<00:01:24.630> fully<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.170> kind<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.380> roll<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.590> until

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
not fully but I kind of roll it until

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.520 
not fully but I kind of roll it until
the<00:01:26.610> ends<00:01:26.759> connect<00:01:27.299> put<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> little<00:01:28.170> glue<00:01:28.350> right

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the ends connect put a little glue right

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.429 
the ends connect put a little glue right
here<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> glue<00:01:29.579> stick<00:01:30.140> so<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.290> put

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
here with the glue stick so you can put

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.850 
here with the glue stick so you can put
some<00:01:31.560> glue<00:01:31.710> stick<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:33.259> I'm<00:01:34.259> gonna<00:01:34.409> fold<00:01:34.680> it

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
some glue stick here I'm gonna fold it

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.429 
some glue stick here I'm gonna fold it
over<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:35.909> hold<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.420> until<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.229> dries

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
over and then hold it until it dries

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.740 
over and then hold it until it dries
just<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> couple<00:01:38.130> seconds<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:39.420> once<00:01:39.570> they

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
just a couple seconds and then once they

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.480 
just a couple seconds and then once they
have<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.960> then<00:01:40.439> they<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.740> start<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.100> lacing

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
have that then they can start the lacing

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.520 
have that then they can start the lacing
of<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> other<00:01:41.880> colors<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.840> construction

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
of the other colors of construction

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.960 
of the other colors of construction
paper<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.250> would<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.520> go<00:01:44.640> through<00:01:44.820> just

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
paper so it would just go through just

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.990 
paper so it would just go through just
like<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:47.220> would<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> same<00:01:47.729> thing

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
like that you would do the same thing

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.710 
like that you would do the same thing
there<00:01:48.299> put<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> little<00:01:48.570> glue<00:01:48.899> stick<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.320> here<00:01:50.720> on

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
there put a little glue stick on here on

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.530 
there put a little glue stick on here on
the<00:01:51.960> end<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:54.110> then<00:01:55.110> they<00:01:56.040> were<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.490> push<00:01:57.390> it

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
the end and then they were just push it

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.480 
the end and then they were just push it
together<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.229> they<00:01:59.040> would<00:01:59.130> look<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
together and they would look on the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.069 
together and they would look on the
chart<00:01:59.850> see<00:02:00.149> what<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> next<00:02:00.450> color<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.899> it's

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
chart see what the next color is it's

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.929 
chart see what the next color is it's
going<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.259> be<00:02:01.350> yellow<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:01.950> they<00:02:02.490> would<00:02:02.610> find<00:02:02.820> a

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
going to be yellow so they would find a

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.580 
going to be yellow so they would find a
yellow<00:02:03.320> place<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.530> through<00:02:06.320> put<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> little<00:02:07.469> bit

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
yellow place it through put a little bit

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.420 
yellow place it through put a little bit
of<00:02:07.680> glue<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.220> end<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:10.160> then<00:02:11.160> hold

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
of glue on the end of it and then hold

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.530 
of glue on the end of it and then hold
the<00:02:11.580> ends<00:02:11.760> together<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.390> they<00:02:12.480> would

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the ends together and they would

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.730 
the ends together and they would
continue<00:02:12.959> with<00:02:13.020> that

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
continue with that

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.290 
continue with that
