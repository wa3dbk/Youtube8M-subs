 you're there on your band 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.170

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.110

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.040
 Traffic light is on red when you are on it 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.070
 want to cross the cycle path 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.290
 they are all on your bike too 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.590
 believe so but I check it 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.690
 not too hot than with long I know 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.190

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.920
 also yes especially if it is in the evening 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.030

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.330
 check out her one thing closet that 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.510

 yes that your steering is straight yes actually 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.640
 almost never 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.110
 I often don't have a really safe bike 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.790
 nothing 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.550
 they do have an effector for none 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.440
 light but never cycle in the dark 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.910
 and almost never no 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.250
 and if i mean i just take it with my 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.340
 lights with you then you have loose lights 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.050
 yes but that is also safe why you 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.910
 it is so unsafe to ride a bike 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.650
 path that is not right 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.510
 when you brake do not do well then 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.760
 you can just shoot and maintain 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.860
 to come in the evening people can 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.799
 do n't see you can get hit quickly 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.690
 become or do you get major accidents or 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.060
 you cannot see for yourself where you want to travel 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.180
 you also give your opinion on traffic 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.250
 then go to save at hyves and leave one 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.010
