00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.200 

it's<00:01:38.479> really<00:01:38.810> easy<00:01:39.080> to<00:01:39.229> do<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:39.860> you<00:01:40.850> know<00:01:40.940> just

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
it's really easy to do and you know just

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.500 
it's really easy to do and you know just
basically<00:01:41.920> as<00:01:42.920> far<00:01:43.280> as<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:43.490> tuning<00:01:43.880> goes<00:01:44.060> just

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
basically as far as the tuning goes just

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.500 
basically as far as the tuning goes just
see<00:01:44.720> how<00:01:45.080> it<00:01:45.710> fits<00:01:46.130> within<00:01:46.369> your<00:01:46.700> your<00:01:47.119> track

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.480 
see how it fits within your your track
you<00:01:47.840> know<00:01:47.960> if<00:01:48.110> you've<00:01:48.380> tuned<00:01:48.890> off<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.250> kick

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
you know if you've tuned off the kick

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.450 
you know if you've tuned off the kick
drum<00:01:49.790> or<00:01:50.119> or<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.110> main<00:01:51.350> snap<00:01:51.740> if<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.070> tuned<00:01:52.310> it

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
drum or or the main snap if you tuned it

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.999 
drum or or the main snap if you tuned it
up<00:01:52.550> or<00:01:52.760> down<00:01:52.909> just<00:01:53.720> make<00:01:53.869> sure<00:01:54.050> you<00:01:54.200> follow<00:01:54.500> how

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
up or down just make sure you follow how

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.650 
up or down just make sure you follow how
that<00:01:55.220> role<00:01:55.430> goes<00:01:55.700> in<00:01:55.910> so<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.180> sounds<00:01:56.479> very

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
that role goes in so it sounds very

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.840 
that role goes in so it sounds very
smooth<00:01:57.080> and<00:01:57.350> natural<00:01:57.770> sounding<00:01:58.190> that's<00:01:58.610> why<00:01:58.790> I

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
smooth and natural sounding that's why I

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.270 
smooth and natural sounding that's why I
did<00:01:59.060> it<00:01:59.090> by<00:01:59.270> even<00:01:59.630> numbers<00:02:00.050> you<00:02:00.290> know<00:02:00.409> eight

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
did it by even numbers you know eight

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.420 
did it by even numbers you know eight
six<00:02:01.940> four<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:02.630> two<00:02:02.869> you<00:02:03.710> know<00:02:03.830> but<00:02:04.009> if<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:04.250> do

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
six four and two you know but if you do

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.820 
six four and two you know but if you do
what<00:02:04.700> odd<00:02:04.880> just<00:02:05.300> make<00:02:05.450> sure<00:02:05.690> you<00:02:05.990> follow<00:02:06.290> the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
what odd just make sure you follow the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.680 
what odd just make sure you follow the
same<00:02:07.040> pattern<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:07.970> sounds<00:02:08.270> very<00:02:08.390> natural

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
same pattern so it sounds very natural

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:17.530 
same pattern so it sounds very natural
