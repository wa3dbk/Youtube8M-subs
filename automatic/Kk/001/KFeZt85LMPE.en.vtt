00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hi, what 's up? 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.280
 Korean cuisine and today I will bring 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.870
 gay kit recipe that I say is a soup 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.700
 from kent 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.920
 you should ask there and you do not 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.199
 taught to make sense since it is to teach 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.690
 do that is because it is usually the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.420
 people buy who takes out the grocery stores, right? 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.980
 To be honest, I did it once. 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.320
 just for you did not have all 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.670
 ingredients is and I wanted this 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.119
 teaching you 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.980
 the correct way, everything's cute, I'm going 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.190
 to teach because in December my mother 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.899
 I came here to spend her vacation or 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.629
 teach you various recipes that the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.360
 My mother has taught so is this. 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.110
 waiting for the ok and especially today I made 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.149
 two 15 day recipes because we are 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.250
 well depends a lot from region to region. 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.160
 region and I took a little while to 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.410
 end up choosing a recipe just nÃ© 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.329
 I saw in a Korean program that they 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.420
 presented the way of doing what 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.160
 is correct in the correct proportion of 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.949
 each ingredient so I took this 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.710
 The recipe needs you and the other 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.260
 I'm bringing the one I make at home, right? 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.900
 because when you do at home you do not 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.750
 have all those ingredients then 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.270
 I was using it that I had not even 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.670
 kind enough to me right then revenue 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.590
 I put it is another that is chapter ii 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.210
 and be tricolor than other ingredients 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.280
 I hope you like these two 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.009
 because there you choose what you want 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.840
 You want to do ok, so stay tuned. 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.840
 in the recipe and another with you from here 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.090
 little to experience in the first 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.810
 recipe or you need to prepare a broth with 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.390
 10 angel vines one half turnip of the turnip 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.340
 chili pepper and a piece of 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.020
 kashima than the kelp that op 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.310
 Let's put two liters of water and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.899
 boil for 30 minutes 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.899
 meanwhile I'll cut a fifth of 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.640
 a box of tofu in smaller cubes and a 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.640
 stalk of chives in pieces 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.310
 Now I'm going to need some 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.840
 pig fat to affect the quench 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.060
 because who is searching and putting the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.099
 pork fat I tried to enjoy the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.620
 pork fat that I bought 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.390
 and stayed 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.390
 meat together but ok 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.459
 now I will explain what to stir until the 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.370
 People keep a more orange color on it. 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.640
 changes color from red to orange 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.040
 I'll put half a spoonful of sugar 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.610
 to be able to lighten the taste sour 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.610
 the kit 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:48.280
 Now let's pour 400 ml of the broth 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.280
 we prepared 100 grams of pork 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:55.849
 now let's boil for about ten 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:59.680
 minutes I'll put the tofu and 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.680
 quarter tablespoon of salt 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:10.220
 the end I will join a fifth of spoon 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:12.170
 of expensive kut soup the chives and a half 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.819
 spoon of apple coli vinegar that can 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.880
 be replaced by any other 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:21.739
 white vinegar or boiling for another 15 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.530
 and you can turn the fire off. 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.870
 Our first kit is ready, right? 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.489
 Now let's go to the second one, I guarantee. 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.930
 which is a little simpler than this 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:35.239
 From here to the second recipe you can 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.629
 use any deep pan because neither 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.910
 everyone has the right Quinha kombo I 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.400
 I will fight with sesame oil or I can 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.310
 be another vegetable oil 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.230
 We'll fry the kit already with the meat of 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.230
 pork and everything together without much freshness 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.910
 in fact I had used almost everything 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.770
 the kit then I put some gay cactus 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.620
 portugal who had only done with 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.370
 turnips in the future I'll teach you how to 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.190
 Make this dish too, I'll put it on. 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:12.660
 half a cubed onion instead of sugar 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.870
 to give a sweet taste and now let's 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.019
 continue to stir all this mixture 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.150
 put water instead of the broth 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:27.480
 let's close the lid and let it boil 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:30.210
 20 minutes after the 20 minutes I 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.890
 decreases the fire already put the tofu 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.520
 If you do not have it, you do not need either. 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.870
 put now I'll boil for another 10 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.750
 minutes 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.940
 the longer the boiling time the jungle will 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.740
 get more ball I like her well 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.140
 mole right soltinha 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.420
 if you think you were waiting 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.730
 seasoning with more cult expensive and in my 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.140
 if I put but half a teaspoon 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.250
 since I think it gives a little taste 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.800
 Special 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.480
 before I dissolve cut already with the 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.490
 own broth to avoid getting 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.390
 that everyday acorn on the bottom of 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.860
 panela and somebody get out of there prize 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.810
 reminding you once again that this is the way 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.430
 I usually cook because in 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.890
 original recipe not between everyday 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.830
 but it looks good anyway 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.360
 nobody ever complained 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.530
 after ten minutes, place the 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.810
 chive 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:27.780
 turn off the fire is ready for us 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:32.600
 according to which he had to prove nothing with 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.600
 you and probable first catch 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.919
 It's really good, I found it a little bit 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:46.190
 wait a little bit sour because of the 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:53.750
 I saw nothing there but touch little moral tune . 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:55.880
 my up until well more goals feeling a 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.740
 I like meat a little more because I 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:04.280
 I put a little more than this 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:05.870

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.460

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.650
 But this second I showed to 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.960
 You 're much less complicated than 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.880
 The first is because you do not need 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.220
 all those ingredients just do not 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.830
 that original flavor is what you have 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.530
 original is the first one that has a 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.020
 taste more azedinho're hot he 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.729
