00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.119 
say that drawing is really good
especially<00:00:37.079> since<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.620> drew<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.890> with<00:00:37.980> your

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
especially since you drew it with your

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.770 
especially since you drew it with your
left<00:00:38.309> hand<00:00:38.520> wow<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.030> can't<00:00:39.329> believe<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.629> drew

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
left hand wow I can't believe you drew

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.690 
left hand wow I can't believe you drew
that<00:00:39.809> with<00:00:40.079> your<00:00:40.200> left<00:00:40.379> hand<00:00:40.620> see<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> amazing

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
that with your left hand see the amazing

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.069 
that with your left hand see the amazing
thing<00:00:41.850> would<00:00:42.000> be<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.180> if<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.510> drew<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.870> not

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
thing would be is if I drew that not

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.549 
thing would be is if I drew that not
with<00:00:43.230> my<00:00:43.350> left<00:00:43.559> hand<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.370> with<00:00:44.579> my<00:00:44.850> right<00:00:45.300> hand

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
with my left hand but with my right hand

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.319 
with my left hand but with my right hand
because<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.039> my<00:00:47.250> non-dominant<00:00:47.640> hand<00:00:48.090> and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
because this is my non-dominant hand and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.810 
because this is my non-dominant hand and
that<00:00:49.260> would<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.530> really<00:00:49.950> hard<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.340> me<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.610> draw

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
that would be really hard for me to draw

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.850 
that would be really hard for me to draw
all<00:00:51.090> right<00:00:51.239> hand<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:51.989> got<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> idea<00:00:52.590> of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
all right hand it so I got the idea of

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.770 
all right hand it so I got the idea of
doing<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.430> challenge<00:00:53.670> video<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.600> draw

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
doing a challenge video to draw

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.720 
doing a challenge video to draw
something<00:00:55.199> with<00:00:55.230> your<00:00:55.469> non-dominant<00:00:56.129> hand<00:00:56.160> so

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
something with your non-dominant hand so

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.760 
something with your non-dominant hand so
instead<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.030> trying<00:00:57.180> something<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.780> my<00:00:57.960> left

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
instead of trying something with my left

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.010 
instead of trying something with my left
hand<00:00:59.010> I'm<00:00:59.280> gonna<00:00:59.579> drop<00:00:59.820> with<00:01:00.030> my<00:01:00.210> right<00:01:00.989> hand

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
hand I'm gonna drop with my right hand

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.349 
hand I'm gonna drop with my right hand
and<00:01:01.469> see<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.190> turns<00:01:02.460> out<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.030> let's<00:01:03.180> go<00:01:03.300> to

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
and see how it turns out so let's go to

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.810 
and see how it turns out so let's go to
the<00:01:03.510> drawing<00:01:03.719> board<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.080> find<00:01:04.409> out<00:01:04.820> little

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820

attempt<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.570> hold<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> pencil<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.619> my

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
attempt to hold the pencil in my

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.219 
attempt to hold the pencil in my
non-dominant<00:01:11.820> hand<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.930> feels<00:01:12.960> very

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
non-dominant hand and it feels very

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.929 
non-dominant hand and it feels very
weird<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.189> can<00:01:14.310> definitely<00:01:14.520> tell<00:01:14.880> I

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
don't draw with my right hand because my

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.890 
don't draw with my right hand because my
lighting<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.820> totally<00:01:18.210> messed<00:01:18.420> up<00:01:18.600> for<00:01:18.780> this

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
lighting is totally messed up for this

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.990 
lighting is totally messed up for this
it's<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.710> geared<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.549> there's<00:01:20.759> no

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it's it's geared so that there's no

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.840 
it's it's geared so that there's no
shadow<00:01:21.360> across<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.140> part<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:23.430> with<00:01:23.640> this

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.860 

all<00:02:30.770> right<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.250> there<00:02:31.459> is<00:02:31.670> my<00:02:32.150> horse<00:02:32.450> head<00:02:32.690> with

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
all right so there is my horse head with

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.300 
all right so there is my horse head with
a<00:02:32.900> left<00:02:33.230> hand<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.709> have<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:34.010> admit<00:02:34.160> it

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
a left hand and I have to admit it

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.350 
a left hand and I have to admit it
actually<00:02:34.580> turned<00:02:34.819> out<00:02:34.879> better<00:02:35.090> than<00:02:35.300> I

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
actually turned out better than I

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.390 
actually turned out better than I
thought<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.720> would<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.349> so<00:02:36.890> I'm<00:02:36.950> gonna<00:02:37.069> try<00:02:37.340> it

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
thought it would and so I'm gonna try it

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.540 
thought it would and so I'm gonna try it
again<00:02:37.660> I<00:02:38.660> think<00:02:39.260> because<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:40.760> have<00:02:41.209> I<00:02:42.310> only<00:02:43.310> have

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
again I think because I have I only have

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.949 
again I think because I have I only have
to<00:02:43.700> move<00:02:43.849> this<00:02:44.000> part<00:02:44.239> because<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.629> kept<00:02:44.810> it

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
to move this part because I kept it

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.809 
to move this part because I kept it
relatively<00:02:45.379> small<00:02:45.769> I<00:02:46.010> have<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> little<00:02:46.640> bit

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
relatively small I have a little bit

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.330 
relatively small I have a little bit
more<00:02:47.000> control<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.390> think<00:02:47.750> where<00:02:48.470> my<00:02:48.680> deficiency

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
more control I think where my deficiency

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.400 
more control I think where my deficiency
would<00:02:49.459> be<00:02:49.640> would<00:02:50.030> be<00:02:50.060> trying<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.690> make<00:02:50.900> long

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
would be would be trying to make long

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.870 
would be would be trying to make long
lines<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:51.980> having<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.250> move<00:02:52.400> my<00:02:52.580> whole<00:02:52.790> entire

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
lines and having to move my whole entire

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.300 
lines and having to move my whole entire
