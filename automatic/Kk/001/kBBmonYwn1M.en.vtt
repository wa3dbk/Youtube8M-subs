us took the assignment seriously I

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.990 
us took the assignment seriously I
propose<00:03:35.739> that<00:03:35.980> Nintendo<00:03:36.310> focuses<00:03:36.760> on<00:03:36.880> making

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
propose that Nintendo focuses on making

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.270 
propose that Nintendo focuses on making
the<00:03:37.329> new<00:03:37.480> 3ds<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:38.200> more<00:03:38.470> complete<00:03:38.769> gaming

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
the new 3ds a more complete gaming

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.490 
the new 3ds a more complete gaming
experience<00:03:39.880> I<00:03:40.120> think<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.930> second<00:03:41.260> analog

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
experience I think the second analog

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.340 
experience I think the second analog
stick<00:03:41.890> is<00:03:42.070> a<00:03:42.100> good<00:03:42.430> move<00:03:42.670> in<00:03:42.880> this<00:03:43.000> direction

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
stick is a good move in this direction

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.690 
stick is a good move in this direction
the<00:03:44.350> truth<00:03:44.590> of<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.769> matter<00:03:44.920> is<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:45.220> nobody

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
the truth of the matter is that nobody

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.099 
the truth of the matter is that nobody
wants<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:45.970> play<00:03:46.150> games<00:03:46.480> on<00:03:46.690> a<00:03:46.720> tiny<00:03:46.959> screen

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109
