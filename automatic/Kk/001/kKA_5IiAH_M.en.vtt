make a little bit further in so my face

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.550 
make a little bit further in so my face
it<00:05:07.790> will<00:05:07.940> look<00:05:08.120> more<00:05:08.390> thinner<00:05:08.840> in<00:05:09.020> this<00:05:09.169> area

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
it will look more thinner in this area

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.600 
it will look more thinner in this area
which<00:05:10.100> is<00:05:10.310> nice<00:05:10.550> also<00:05:11.419> we<00:05:11.540> can<00:05:11.570> control

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
which is nice also we can control

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.370 
which is nice also we can control
control<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:13.729> jawline<00:05:14.240> to<00:05:14.600> make<00:05:14.810> our<00:05:15.050> face

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
control the jawline to make our face

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.850 
control the jawline to make our face
more<00:05:15.830> thin<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:17.169> pointed<00:05:18.169> in<00:05:18.290> this<00:05:18.410> area

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
more thin and pointed in this area

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.250 
more thin and pointed in this area
that's<00:05:19.160> really<00:05:19.490> good<00:05:19.700> too<00:05:19.940> for<00:05:20.780> a<00:05:20.810> really

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
that's really good too for a really

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
Square and round and face so we'll make

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.690

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
shape and right in here we can also

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.460

contoured<00:05:28.520> the<00:05:28.910> shapes<00:05:29.270> and<00:05:29.570> the<00:05:29.660> temple<00:05:30.320> area

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
contoured the shapes and the temple area

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.710 
contoured the shapes and the temple area
also<00:05:30.890> for<00:05:31.220> the<00:05:31.310> same<00:05:31.520> matter<00:05:31.760> to<00:05:32.360> make<00:05:32.540> your

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
also for the same matter to make your

face look thinner nicer and also we can

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.320 
face look thinner nicer and also we can
use<00:05:35.690> it<00:05:36.080> for<00:05:36.440> controlling<00:05:37.340> son<00:05:37.610> areas<00:05:38.120> like

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
use it for controlling son areas like

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.480 
use it for controlling son areas like
they<00:05:38.630> know<00:05:38.810> sorry<00:05:39.260> to<00:05:39.680> make<00:05:39.830> your<00:05:40.070> nose<00:05:40.190> look

know that long but normally those are

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.700 
know that long but normally those are
more<00:05:52.670> specific<00:05:53.300> controls<00:05:53.900> that<00:05:54.410> we're<00:05:54.590> not

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
more specific controls that we're not

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.560 
more specific controls that we're not
going<00:05:54.890> to<00:05:54.980> do<00:05:55.160> much<00:05:55.400> we're<00:05:55.760> gonna<00:05:55.940> do<00:05:56.240> more

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
going to do much we're gonna do more

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.170 
going to do much we're gonna do more
like<00:05:57.200> giving<00:05:57.710> shadows<00:05:58.370> back<00:05:58.640> to<00:05:58.820> your<00:05:58.940> face

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
like giving shadows back to your face

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.400 
like giving shadows back to your face
and<00:05:59.420> maybe<00:05:59.750> making<00:06:00.590> a<00:06:00.920> little<00:06:01.340> bit<00:06:01.520> nicer

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
and maybe making a little bit nicer

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.890 
and maybe making a little bit nicer
nicer<00:06:03.410> shape<00:06:03.860> to<00:06:04.100> your<00:06:04.130> face<00:06:04.510> so<00:06:05.510> the<00:06:05.630> trick<00:06:05.870> is

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
nicer shape to your face so the trick is

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.980 
nicer shape to your face so the trick is
to<00:06:06.050> apply<00:06:06.380> really<00:06:06.920> softly<00:06:07.280> from<00:06:07.700> the<00:06:07.990> headline

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
to apply really softly from the headline

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.130 
to apply really softly from the headline
into<00:06:09.530> your<00:06:09.680> face<00:06:09.890> so<00:06:10.340> the<00:06:10.610> amount<00:06:11.570> of<00:06:11.810> brother

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
into your face so the amount of brother

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.720 
into your face so the amount of brother
a<00:06:12.260> bigger<00:06:12.560> amount<00:06:12.860> of<00:06:13.010> product<00:06:13.340> will<00:06:13.460> be<00:06:13.490> in

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
a bigger amount of product will be in

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.560 
a bigger amount of product will be in
the<00:06:13.850> headline<00:06:14.240> and<00:06:14.480> then<00:06:14.750> it<00:06:14.900> will<00:06:15.080> fade<00:06:15.950> away

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
the headline and then it will fade away

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.030 
the headline and then it will fade away
on<00:06:17.570> the<00:06:17.750> way<00:06:17.900> until<00:06:18.140> your<00:06:18.500> face<00:06:18.680> will<00:06:19.010> look

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
on the way until your face will look

00:06:19.040 --> 00:07:04.930 
on the way until your face will look
much<00:06:19.580> natural<00:06:20.030> much<00:06:20.750> natural

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:04.940 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.450 

now<00:07:05.940> this<00:07:06.570> is<00:07:06.630> will<00:07:06.990> and<00:07:07.199> that's<00:07:07.770> it<00:07:08.009> this<00:07:08.310> is

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 
now this is will and that's it this is

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.270 
now this is will and that's it this is
the<00:07:08.669> control<00:07:09.210> the<00:07:10.080> trick<00:07:10.410> to<00:07:10.620> control<00:07:11.160> your

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280

the control the trick to control your
chicks<00:07:11.580> as<00:07:11.880> to<00:07:12.300> find<00:07:12.660> out<00:07:12.840> where<00:07:13.110> is<00:07:13.229> the<00:07:13.349> end

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 
chicks as to find out where is the end

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.439 
chicks as to find out where is the end
of<00:07:13.800> your<00:07:13.949> cheekbones<00:07:14.430> and<00:07:14.699> there's<00:07:15.030> where<00:07:15.300> you

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:15.449 
of your cheekbones and there's where you

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:17.600 
of your cheekbones and there's where you
want<00:07:15.630> to<00:07:15.720> contour<00:07:16.199> and<00:07:16.440> you<00:07:16.770> can<00:07:16.949> go<00:07:17.070> from<00:07:17.370> the

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.610 
want to contour and you can go from the

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.480 
want to contour and you can go from the
upper<00:07:18.060> and<00:07:18.300> part<00:07:18.930> of<00:07:18.990> your<00:07:19.169> ear<00:07:19.349> into<00:07:19.740> the

upper and part of your ear into the
corner<00:07:20.820> of<00:07:20.970> your<00:07:21.120> mouth<00:07:21.150> that<00:07:21.570> will<00:07:21.810> be<00:07:22.020> the

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:22.229 
corner of your mouth that will be the

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:24.230 
corner of your mouth that will be the
angle<00:07:22.470> that<00:07:22.620> you<00:07:22.770> have<00:07:23.070> so<00:07:23.669> this<00:07:23.820> is<00:07:23.849> head<00:07:24.120> this

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
angle that you have so this is head this

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.390 
angle that you have so this is head this
is<00:07:24.330> a<00:07:24.389> final<00:07:24.630> look<00:07:24.780> as<00:07:25.080> you<00:07:25.199> can<00:07:25.349> see<00:07:25.560> we<00:07:26.130> bring

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 
back the volume to our face with a

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.110 
back the volume to our face with a
contouring<00:07:28.319> highlighting<00:07:28.409> I<00:07:29.220> know<00:07:29.490> that<00:07:29.699> in

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120
