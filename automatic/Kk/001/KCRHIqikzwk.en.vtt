00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.799
 the staff is not to make a video here 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:12.059
 basically explaining how to make a 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.340
 great of one of a thousand genes book 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.650
 blues arriving a problem recently 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.150
 It took me a while to find the solution. 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.010
 I thought it would be useful if I left a 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.439
 personal video had the same problem 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.750
 that I can solve faster is ok 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.539
 everyone knows more than what 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.120
 you do bios update on the board 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.700
 Asus mother of notebooks 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.930
 everything I'm seeing today is just 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:45.980
 is using this program here is the flash 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.980
 chain located here 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:59.890
 here was the wrong selection so here 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.350
 is the flash has all the versions of it? 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.479
 only as soon as none of the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.750
 versions let you do so great only 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.520
 Stop upgrading so you just 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.880
 can update bills that happened 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:17.020
 with me until I said that I fulfilled the 206 for 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.110
 219 found she could not return to 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.600
 long version then just looking 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.119
 Although not easy, it is difficult to 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.580
 find out where it explains us is to do the 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:35.470
 next wilson 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:40.569
 obviously comes here in the program installs 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.429
 in flash and scale and also low 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.340
 version of the song you need 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.670
 all in the data never from another site that 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:02:07.390
 It may prove wrong anything 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:02:18.910
 A bad thing would be to make the following flash 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:42.550
 then the computer c executable program 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:47.129
 it is this message that the problem is 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:52.720
 older than the current version of Flash 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:54.730
 does not let you put new versions of 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.959
 beauty to solve problems is the 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.959
 next is 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.890
 going to start going in the most basic way 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:10.769
 to locate the command itself that 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:13.470
 it's all the accessory programs is trump 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.470
 command is allowed to execute 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.239
 as administrator 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.090
 ok here april command right 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.209
 There you will do the following click on the 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:28.980
 flash drags it to the prompt 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:31.230
 command is going to generate the path 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.970
 whole program of citizen understanding goes 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.290
 to run only before you go 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.980
 put the parameter 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:45.780
 after the quotation mark you're going to type is a 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:48.030
 space bar since it normally 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.889
 but now it's worth a parameter of 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.420
 that he will skip dates so he goes 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:59.400
 to any god you put 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.620
 any version it actually back to 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.780
 previous version was my case you 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.129
 Can you stay twice in your life? 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:11.099
 You need to leave as you can see here. 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.739
 Look, it really does appear in the 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.169
 oldest town but the button and 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.840
 update is active then just click 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.269
 here or upgrade a thousand without problems is 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.150
 make the transaction for me 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.130
 done this is expected to end all 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.750
 process here as well as program itself 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.220
 said have to be with the battery with 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.630
 25% battery and everything else is what 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.349
 does the normal update without any 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.419
 problem 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:38.130
 This is a very basic thing, but I 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.320
 It took me a while to find out if it would be useful. 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.050
 to other users who may have 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.150
 problem with these bills like i had 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.110
 and i5 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.110
 anyway this
