00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
happening in need 10 days since we

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.320 
happening in need 10 days since we
launched<00:00:14.950> the<00:00:15.070> game<00:00:15.250> and<00:00:15.519> a<00:00:15.820> little<00:00:16.059> bit<00:00:16.180> on

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
launched the game and a little bit on

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.650 
launched the game and a little bit on
our<00:00:16.570> plans<00:00:16.990> for<00:00:17.200> the<00:00:17.530> future<00:00:18.150> yes<00:00:19.150> I<00:00:19.390> guess<00:00:19.539> to

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
our plans for the future yes I guess to

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.170 
our plans for the future yes I guess to
start<00:00:19.900> us<00:00:20.020> off<00:00:20.280> when<00:00:21.280> we<00:00:21.460> did<00:00:21.640> release<00:00:21.789> we<00:00:22.060> had

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
start us off when we did release we had

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.620 
start us off when we did release we had
a<00:00:22.210> bit<00:00:22.360> of<00:00:22.390> a<00:00:22.510> rocky<00:00:22.660> stop<00:00:24.060> we're<00:00:25.060> now<00:00:25.210> 10<00:00:25.449> days

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
a bit of a rocky stop we're now 10 days

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.330 
a bit of a rocky stop we're now 10 days
into<00:00:25.840> it<00:00:25.990> and<00:00:26.230> we've<00:00:26.350> done<00:00:26.590> as<00:00:26.920> of<00:00:27.220> recording

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
into it and we've done as of recording

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.650 
into it and we've done as of recording
to<00:00:28.230> 2020<00:00:29.230> updates<00:00:29.699> which<00:00:30.699> is<00:00:30.850> quite<00:00:31.390> a<00:00:31.420> lot<00:00:31.630> I

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
to 2020 updates which is quite a lot I

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.450 
to 2020 updates which is quite a lot I
mean<00:00:31.869> I<00:00:32.079> think<00:00:32.259> us<00:00:32.710> programmers<00:00:33.280> have<00:00:33.370> been

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
mean I think us programmers have been

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.790 
mean I think us programmers have been
working<00:00:33.699> around<00:00:33.969> the<00:00:34.030> clock<00:00:34.440> pretty<00:00:35.440> much<00:00:35.589> to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
working around the clock pretty much to

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.319 
working around the clock pretty much to
get<00:00:35.920> some<00:00:36.159> of<00:00:36.249> these<00:00:36.309> major<00:00:36.640> issues<00:00:36.909> in<00:00:37.210> a<00:00:37.300> way

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
get some of these major issues in a way

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.299 
get some of these major issues in a way
specifically<00:00:38.170> these<00:00:38.409> these<00:00:38.649> major<00:00:38.979> crashes

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
specifically these these major crashes

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.759 
specifically these these major crashes
that<00:00:39.609> are<00:00:39.699> quite<00:00:39.879> a<00:00:39.909> few<00:00:39.969> I<00:00:40.179> think<00:00:40.239> about<00:00:40.769> fans

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
that are quite a few I think about fans

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.639 
that are quite a few I think about fans
have<00:00:41.949> been<00:00:41.979> having<00:00:42.280> so<00:00:42.909> and<00:00:43.210> we've<00:00:43.420> got<00:00:44.260> mostly

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
have been having so and we've got mostly

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:45.869 
have been having so and we've got mostly
male<00:00:44.799> the<00:00:44.920> way<00:00:45.039> there's<00:00:45.249> a<00:00:45.309> few<00:00:45.489> people<00:00:45.670> that

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
male the way there's a few people that

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.059 
male the way there's a few people that
still<00:00:45.940> can't<00:00:46.449> quite<00:00:46.600> get<00:00:47.260> into<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:47.559> game<00:00:47.739> but

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:48.069 
still can't quite get into the game but

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:49.770 
still can't quite get into the game but
we're<00:00:48.909> still<00:00:49.089> working<00:00:49.179> on<00:00:49.449> that<00:00:49.600> and<00:00:49.690> we're

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
we're still working on that and we're

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.579 
we're still working on that and we're
pretty<00:00:50.049> confident<00:00:50.530> those<00:00:51.399> ones<00:00:51.699> sorted<00:00:52.589> now

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
pretty confident those ones sorted now

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.219 
pretty confident those ones sorted now
after<00:00:54.339> that<00:00:54.519> we're<00:00:55.449> planners<00:00:55.780> are<00:00:55.870> jumping<00:00:56.139> to

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
after that we're planners are jumping to

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.750 
after that we're planners are jumping to
some<00:00:56.379> new<00:00:56.499> features<00:00:56.920> or<00:00:57.039> get<00:00:57.219> some<00:00:57.489> other

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
some new features or get some other

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.079 
some new features or get some other
features<00:00:58.149> finished<00:00:58.479> yeah<00:00:59.229> so<00:00:59.589> the<00:01:00.010> first<00:01:00.699> big

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
features finished yeah so the first big

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.029 
features finished yeah so the first big
thing<00:01:01.119> the<00:01:01.510> focusing<00:01:01.869> on<00:01:02.019> is<00:01:02.260> the<00:01:02.530> multiplayer

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
thing the focusing on is the multiplayer

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.189 
thing the focusing on is the multiplayer
of<00:01:03.219> skirmish<00:01:03.639> lobby<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.930> as<00:01:05.050> you'll<00:01:05.170> probably

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
of skirmish lobby so as you'll probably

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.620 
of skirmish lobby so as you'll probably
aware<00:01:05.770> if<00:01:05.950> you've<00:01:06.100> read<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.700> text<00:01:07.450> on<00:01:07.510> the

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
aware if you've read the text on the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.350 
aware if you've read the text on the
main<00:01:07.750> menu<00:01:08.020> we<00:01:08.830> had<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.040> roll<00:01:09.940> back<00:01:10.120> to<00:01:10.330> a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
main menu we had to roll back to a

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.940 
main menu we had to roll back to a
version<00:01:10.570> that<00:01:10.750> wasn't<00:01:11.170> broken<00:01:11.470> at<00:01:11.740> those

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
version that wasn't broken at those

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.790 
version that wasn't broken at those
lobbies<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:12.370> they<00:01:12.550> look<00:01:12.760> pretty<00:01:13.270> bad<00:01:13.800> they

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
lobbies and they look pretty bad they

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.410 
lobbies and they look pretty bad they
only<00:01:14.950> support<00:01:15.250> up<00:01:15.760> to<00:01:15.910> two<00:01:16.030> players<00:01:16.270> in

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
only support up to two players in

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.660 
only support up to two players in
multiplayer<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:17.230> not<00:01:17.770> very<00:01:17.830> many<00:01:18.040> maps<00:01:18.310> and

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
multiplayer and not very many maps and

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.570 
multiplayer and not very many maps and
it's<00:01:18.880> just<00:01:19.090> generally<00:01:19.420> not<00:01:19.570> nice<00:01:20.370> so<00:01:21.370> what<00:01:21.460> you

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
it's just generally not nice so what you

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.310 
it's just generally not nice so what you
should<00:01:21.970> be<00:01:22.090> seeing<00:01:22.300> on<00:01:22.510> your<00:01:22.540> screen<00:01:22.930> now<00:01:22.960> is

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
should be seeing on your screen now is

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.600 
should be seeing on your screen now is
what<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.650> lobbies<00:01:23.950> are<00:01:24.100> gonna<00:01:24.220> be<00:01:24.340> looking

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
what the lobbies are gonna be looking

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.110 
what the lobbies are gonna be looking
like<00:01:25.590> we're<00:01:26.590> in<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.860> program<00:01:27.160> process<00:01:27.970> of

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
like we're in a program process of

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.780 
like we're in a program process of
testing<00:01:28.330> those<00:01:28.630> at<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.080> moment<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:30.520> make<00:01:30.640> sure

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
testing those at the moment to make sure

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.450 
testing those at the moment to make sure
you<00:01:31.150> know<00:01:31.240> they<00:01:31.390> actually<00:01:31.720> work<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.460> what's

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
you know they actually work and what's

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
your vision goes up that should

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.190 
your vision goes up that should
hopefully<00:01:36.610> be<00:01:36.850> what<00:01:37.690> you<00:01:37.750> think<00:01:37.810> in<00:01:38.020> a<00:01:38.050> week

week or two yeah we're thinking pretty
soon<00:01:40.300> I<00:01:40.450> mean<00:01:40.600> where<00:01:40.780> most<00:01:41.680> of<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:41.920> way<00:01:42.040> there

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.350 
soon I mean where most of the way there
were<00:01:42.370> there<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:42.610> are<00:01:42.760> program<00:01:43.120> and<00:01:43.270> we're

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
were there you are program and we're

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.450 
were there you are program and we're
really<00:01:43.540> just<00:01:43.630> gonna<00:01:43.840> plug<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:44.530> in<00:01:44.620> and<00:01:44.770> get<00:01:45.430> a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
really just gonna plug it in and get a

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.080 
really just gonna plug it in and get a
working<00:01:45.790> you<00:01:45.850> do<00:01:45.940> some<00:01:46.090> testing<00:01:46.390> cool<00:01:48.090> yeah

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
working you do some testing cool yeah

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.790 
working you do some testing cool yeah
not<00:01:49.300> too<00:01:49.450> long<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.870> I<00:01:50.020> guess<00:01:50.230> the<00:01:50.380> other<00:01:50.409> part

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
not too long and I guess the other part

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.350 
not too long and I guess the other part
of<00:01:50.860> that<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.610> four-player

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
of that is the the four-player

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.230 
of that is the the four-player
multiplayer<00:01:52.600> is<00:01:53.409> this<00:01:54.220> kind<00:01:54.430> of<00:01:54.490> rolls<00:01:54.760> into

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
multiplayer is this kind of rolls into

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.120 
multiplayer is this kind of rolls into
some<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.229> other<00:01:56.350> work<00:01:56.530> have<00:01:56.680> been<00:01:56.710> doing

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
some of the other work have been doing

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.260 
some of the other work have been doing
as<00:01:57.370> well<00:01:57.520> as<00:01:57.640> bug<00:01:57.820> fix<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.210> that's

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
as well as bug fix and that's

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.670 
as well as bug fix and that's
performance<00:01:58.810> improvements<00:01:59.320> because<00:01:59.409> we<00:01:59.590> know

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
performance improvements because we know

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.840 
performance improvements because we know
the<00:01:59.800> game<00:01:59.920> hasn't<00:02:00.250> been<00:02:00.340> working<00:02:00.520> quite<00:02:00.820> well

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
the game hasn't been working quite well

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.300 
the game hasn't been working quite well
too<00:02:01.420> well<00:02:01.570> for<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:02.110> number<00:02:02.890> of<00:02:02.920> PC

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
too well for a number of PC

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.359 
too well for a number of PC
configurations

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
configurations

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.310 
configurations
and<00:02:04.460> getting<00:02:05.359> performance<00:02:05.810> working<00:02:06.170> better

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
and getting performance working better

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.959 
and getting performance working better
is<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:06.920> know<00:02:06.979> it's<00:02:07.100> handed<00:02:07.399> him<00:02:07.549> and<00:02:07.759> allowing

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
is you know it's handed him and allowing

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.699 
is you know it's handed him and allowing
more<00:02:08.269> people<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.660> play<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.929> game<00:02:09.080> in<00:02:09.590> the

things<00:02:12.980> we<00:02:13.069> are<00:02:13.190> going<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.580> be<00:02:13.640> working<00:02:13.940> on<00:02:14.060> in

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
things we are going to be working on in

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.300 
things we are going to be working on in
the<00:02:14.690> very<00:02:14.959> near<00:02:15.110> future<00:02:15.140> are<00:02:15.650> tooltips

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
the very near future are tooltips

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.380 
the very near future are tooltips
which<00:02:16.970> as<00:02:17.239> a<00:02:17.300> lot<00:02:17.660> of<00:02:17.780> you've<00:02:17.900> seen<00:02:18.170> contain

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
which as a lot of you've seen contain

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.270 
which as a lot of you've seen contain
not<00:02:20.390> very<00:02:20.660> friendly<00:02:21.019> information<00:02:21.470> if<00:02:22.069> you<00:02:22.250> are

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
not very friendly information if you are

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.309 
not very friendly information if you are
familiar<00:02:23.120> with<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.299> game<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.780> obviously

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
familiar with the game and obviously

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.900 
familiar with the game and obviously
thought<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:24.890> should<00:02:25.099> be<00:02:25.220> people<00:02:25.489> who<00:02:25.700> aren't

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
thought it should be people who aren't

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.490 
thought it should be people who aren't
familiar<00:02:26.060> with<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.510> game<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.349> that's

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
familiar with the game so that's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.449 
familiar with the game so that's
something<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.860> should<00:02:28.010> be<00:02:28.040> happening<00:02:28.220> very

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
something that should be happening very

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.830 
something that should be happening very
soon<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.299> top<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.599> were<00:02:29.780> also

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
soon and on top of that were also

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.080 
soon and on top of that were also
working<00:02:30.260> on<00:02:30.560> some<00:02:31.010> balance<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.790> rivets

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
working on some balance of rivets

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.729 
working on some balance of rivets
specifically<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.930> certain<00:02:33.319> level<00:02:33.530> in<00:02:33.650> the

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
specifically to certain level in the

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.320 
specifically to certain level in the
campaign<00:02:34.099> of<00:02:34.129> people<00:02:34.549> having<00:02:34.819> difficulty

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.949 
campaign of people having difficulty
with<00:02:35.950> name<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:36.980> couple<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.459> seven<00:02:37.819> and<00:02:37.970> nine<00:02:38.180> are

with name a couple of seven and nine are

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.360 
with name a couple of seven and nine are
the<00:02:39.110> ones<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.470> getting<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.709> most<00:02:39.829> feedback<00:02:40.069> on

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
the ones of getting the most feedback on

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.030 
the ones of getting the most feedback on
to<00:02:40.579> make<00:02:40.849> some<00:02:41.000> changes<00:02:41.299> too<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:42.040> that's

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
to make some changes too so that's

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.890 
to make some changes too so that's
generally<00:02:44.000> what<00:02:44.390> we're<00:02:44.510> going<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:44.660> be<00:02:44.750> working

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
generally what we're going to be working

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.580 
generally what we're going to be working
on<00:02:45.170> in<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.680> Nexus<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.160> two<00:02:46.400> three<00:02:46.880> ish<00:02:47.060> weeks

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
on in the Nexus of two three ish weeks

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.509 
on in the Nexus of two three ish weeks
it'll<00:02:48.590> probably<00:02:48.799> roll<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.069> little<00:02:49.129> bit<00:02:49.370> longer

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
it'll probably roll a little bit longer

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.039 
it'll probably roll a little bit longer
especially<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.239> balance<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:50.959> the

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
especially the the balance and the

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.300 
especially the the balance and the
performance<00:02:51.530> improvements<00:02:51.920> those<00:02:52.099> are<00:02:52.190> going

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
performance improvements those are going

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.140 
performance improvements those are going
to<00:02:52.370> be<00:02:52.489> ongoing<00:02:53.030> things<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:55.610> after<00:02:55.940> that

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
to be ongoing things and after that

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.250 
to be ongoing things and after that
we've<00:02:56.629> got<00:02:56.660> some<00:02:57.170> bigger<00:02:57.799> things<00:02:58.099> in<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.310> pipe

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
we've got some bigger things in the pipe

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.830 
we've got some bigger things in the pipe
the<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:00.980> first<00:03:01.190> thing<00:03:01.370> is<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:02.180> map<00:03:02.540> editor

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
the so the first thing is the map editor

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.479 
the so the first thing is the map editor
this<00:03:03.500> is<00:03:03.620> something<00:03:03.860> we've<00:03:03.950> had<00:03:04.069> working<00:03:04.310> for

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
this is something we've had working for

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.490 
this is something we've had working for
quite<00:03:04.879> some<00:03:05.120> time<00:03:05.150> in<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.840> form<00:03:06.079> of<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.290> rather

quite some time in the form of a rather

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.479 
quite some time in the form of a rather
rudimentary<00:03:07.099> debug<00:03:07.819> console<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:09.370> what<00:03:10.370> we

rudimentary debug console so what we

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.309 
rudimentary debug console so what we
really<00:03:10.760> want<00:03:10.880> to<00:03:10.940> do<00:03:11.060> before<00:03:11.450> we<00:03:11.480> give<00:03:12.049> it<00:03:12.170> out
