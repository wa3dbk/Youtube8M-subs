how much pressure enough so that you're

how much pressure enough so that you're
transferring<00:01:07.420> your<00:01:07.540> body<00:01:07.840> weight<00:01:08.050> from<00:01:08.229> your

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
you roll the ball forward so your body

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.010 
you roll the ball forward so your body
weight<00:01:12.820> should<00:01:13.000> have<00:01:13.180> transferred<00:01:13.690> to<00:01:13.900> your

dominant foot by the time it's planted
now<00:01:16.330> it's<00:01:16.570> important<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.050> note<00:01:17.290> that<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:17.680> need

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
now it's important to note that you need

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.370 
now it's important to note that you need
to<00:01:18.010> keep<00:01:18.160> your<00:01:18.340> event<00:01:18.820> as<00:01:19.090> you<00:01:19.420> plan<00:01:19.630> your<00:01:19.780> foot

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
to keep your event as you plan your foot

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.530 
to keep your event as you plan your foot
this<00:01:20.680> not<00:01:20.890> only<00:01:20.920> cushions<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.550> impact<00:01:22.000> that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
this not only cushions the impact that

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.570 
this not only cushions the impact that
the<00:01:22.630> angle<00:01:23.020> created<00:01:23.440> by<00:01:23.560> your<00:01:23.740> leg<00:01:23.950> kind<00:01:24.460> of

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
the angle created by your leg kind of

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.670 
the angle created by your leg kind of
acts<00:01:24.759> like<00:01:24.940> a<00:01:24.970> ramp<00:01:25.330> for<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.660> ball<00:01:25.869> for

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
acts like a ramp for the ball for

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.140 
acts like a ramp for the ball for
example<00:01:27.160> if<00:01:27.340> you<00:01:27.460> were<00:01:27.550> to<00:01:27.580> keep<00:01:27.850> your<00:01:28.030> leg

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
example if you were to keep your leg

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.240 
example if you were to keep your leg
straight<00:01:28.180> as<00:01:28.810> you<00:01:28.900> planted<00:01:29.259> your<00:01:29.350> foot<00:01:29.619> then

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
straight as you planted your foot then

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.279 
straight as you planted your foot then
it<00:01:30.490> creates<00:01:30.790> a<00:01:30.940> 90<00:01:31.210> degree<00:01:31.509> angle<00:01:31.539> and<00:01:32.050> because

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
it creates a 90 degree angle and because

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.350 
it creates a 90 degree angle and because
of<00:01:32.470> this<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:33.190> ball<00:01:33.399> is<00:01:33.580> more<00:01:33.759> likely<00:01:34.119> to<00:01:34.240> go

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
of this the ball is more likely to go

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.389 
of this the ball is more likely to go
backwards<00:01:34.899> instead<00:01:35.110> of<00:01:35.320> upwards<00:01:35.830> but<00:01:36.190> if<00:01:36.310> you

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
backwards instead of upwards but if you

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.010 
backwards instead of upwards but if you
have<00:01:36.580> your<00:01:36.700> knee<00:01:36.850> then<00:01:37.149> then<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.630> angle

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
have your knee then then the angle

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.749 
have your knee then then the angle
created<00:01:38.380> by<00:01:38.500> your<00:01:38.649> leg<00:01:38.860> naturally<00:01:39.430> lifts<00:01:39.670> the

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
created by your leg naturally lifts the

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.760 
created by your leg naturally lifts the
ball<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:40.180> this<00:01:40.660> is<00:01:40.780> an<00:01:40.899> important<00:01:41.320> factor<00:01:41.649> to

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
ball and this is an important factor to

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.290 
ball and this is an important factor to
keep<00:01:41.920> in<00:01:42.100> mind<00:01:42.280> for<00:01:42.460> later<00:01:42.670> when<00:01:42.970> you're

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
keep in mind for later when you're

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:55.420 
keep in mind for later when you're
trying<00:01:43.479> to<00:01:43.630> apply<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.930> rainbow

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.680 

so<00:01:56.430> now<00:01:56.550> that<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.760> have<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.909> technique<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
so now that you have a technique for the

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.570 
so now that you have a technique for the
flick<00:01:57.900> up<00:01:58.080> just<00:01:58.560> practice<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.070> over<00:01:59.220> and<00:01:59.400> over

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
flick up just practice it over and over

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.460 
flick up just practice it over and over
again<00:01:59.760> just<00:02:00.180> lick<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.840> juggle<00:02:01.200> flick

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
again just lick it up and juggle flick

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.380 
again just lick it up and juggle flick
it<00:02:01.590> up<00:02:01.650> in<00:02:01.860> Jungle<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.729> you'll<00:02:03.030> go<00:02:03.180> through<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
it up in Jungle and you'll go through a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.150 
it up in Jungle and you'll go through a
lot<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.630> trial<00:02:03.870> and<00:02:03.960> error<00:02:04.200> but<00:02:04.650> it's<00:02:04.800> all<00:02:04.950> part

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
lot of trial and error but it's all part

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.740 
lot of trial and error but it's all part
of<00:02:05.220> getting<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.520> feel<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.970> truth<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.630> can

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
of getting a feel for the truth you can

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.359 
of getting a feel for the truth you can
also<00:02:06.900> control<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.470> height<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.920> ball<00:02:08.100> by

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
also control the height of the ball by

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.010 
also control the height of the ball by
doing<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.759> flick<00:02:09.030> at<00:02:09.149> different<00:02:09.509> speeds

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
doing the flick at different speeds

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.780 
doing the flick at different speeds
the<00:02:10.440> smaller<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.370> less<00:02:11.400> height

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
the smaller you do it the less height

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.730 
the smaller you do it the less height
the<00:02:11.910> ball<00:02:11.940> will<00:02:12.240> have<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:13.110> faster<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.620> do<00:02:13.709> it

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
the ball will have the faster you do it

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.110 
the ball will have the faster you do it
the<00:02:13.890> more<00:02:14.100> higher<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.610> ball<00:02:14.730> will<00:02:14.940> have

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
the more higher the ball will have

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.480 
the more higher the ball will have
because<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.660> has<00:02:15.780> more<00:02:15.990> momentum<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:17.370> when

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
because it has more momentum so when

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.740 
because it has more momentum so when
you're<00:02:17.610> confident<00:02:17.970> with<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.209> flick<00:02:18.420> up<00:02:18.570> and

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
you're confident with the flick up and

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.970 
you're confident with the flick up and
you're<00:02:18.840> getting<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.200> few<00:02:19.350> times<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.800> row

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
you're getting it a few times in a row

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.830 
you're getting it a few times in a row
it's<00:02:20.400> time<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.880> turn<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.240> into<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.600> rainbow

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
it's time to turn it into a rainbow

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.080 
it's time to turn it into a rainbow
flick<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.980> can<00:02:23.130> do<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.459> by<00:02:23.730> flicking

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
flick and you can do this by flicking

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.390 
flick and you can do this by flicking
the<00:02:24.180> ball<00:02:24.360> up<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.780> healing<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.200> once<00:02:25.410> just<00:02:26.250> get

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
the ball up and healing it once just get

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.160 
the ball up and healing it once just get

used to the motion flick it up heal at

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:40.270 
used to the motion flick it up heal at

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
moving forward so you're going to need

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.440

to time your run with the ball and this

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:30.140 
to time your run with the ball and this
is<00:03:14.599> just<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.810> matter<00:03:15.019> of<00:03:15.079> trial<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:15.590> error
