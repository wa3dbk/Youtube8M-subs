00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.549
 the wine designer already has many 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.709
 fixed fixed blade knives between 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.480
 they wheat not boquera in turn 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.090
 they contract many designs with 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.430
 designers to mass produce them without 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.740
 But not too much wheat has a 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.050
 advantage and that is from the productions 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.720
 more faithful to the original that exist in 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.460
 mouth that is virtually identical to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.920
 difference in the thickness of the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.650
 original the boxer plos wheat is not a 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.379
 utilitarian and tactical design for this the 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.690
 design was based on a worn tip that is 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.480
 which by definition is utilitarian and 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.550
 gave a sharper point with counter sharpness 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.710
 which makes it a tactical knife 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.510
 utility for daily use one of the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.430
 most important characteristics of this 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.649
 knife out of its perfect size 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.070
 for daily use is that it is made in 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.809
 sandvika 1227 that as you know is one of 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.120
 the best steels for cutlery 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.250
 mass production with very good 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.769
 retention of the edge and at the same time a 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.420
 fantastic resistance to deterioration a 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.100
 of the features that most call the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.740
 attention on this knife for daily use 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.840
 is the handle because although it is a product 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.420
 artistic to be 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.969
 image of the original has an excellent 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.859
 Ergonomics is very remarkable the way in which 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.679
 that my letter of two is worked 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:24.539
 tones what not only provides an expected 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.369
 excellent grip but it gives a 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.679
 unique aesthetic a tool of 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.959
 mass production the sheet as was 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.659
 wait it extends all along 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:35.609
 of the mango forming a complete profile and 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.500
 It ends with a hole for the 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.350
 fastener secured with a cylinder 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.590
 metallic the sheet as I said before is a 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.630
 Modified furniture with some angulation 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.489
 that seems to be something like a 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.020
 both inverted 3 mary side 

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:51.719
 contrary to what most 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.299
 I would expect it is concave which nowadays 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:57.179
 it is extraordinarily rare that 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.590
 moves away from its possible tactical intention and 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.229
 puts it in the area of â€‹â€‹the tools 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.689
 dedicated cut although many people 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.819
 could think that the frosting weakens 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.799
 the sheet in just 8 points 3 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.440
 centimeters long there's really no 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.780
 a lot of steel that weaken the case is 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.000
 fall in two halves what keeps the 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.859
 lightness and a small size to be able 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.720
 take it in the kangaroo pocket or 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.710
 diary case although it has 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.900
 perforations 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.030
 incompatible with the tec what comes from 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.640
 factory without this the trine forest 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.680
 although it is a camping sport knife 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.810
 aiken etcetera and has been given a 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.490
 tactical orientation the design I consider 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.070
 which is simply a way to go back 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.320
 more attractive a cutting tool 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.230
 of magnificent performance and the most 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.390
 important is that your aesthetic supports your 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.550
 utility to make it a tool 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.760
 which is carried at all times as it should be 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.760
 be
