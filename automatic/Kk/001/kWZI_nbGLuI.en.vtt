00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 the medicinal properties of propolis 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.420
 produced by the bee has awakened 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.910
 increasingly the interest of 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.920
 consumers in Brazil and is thinking 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.349
 In this, the project developed by 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.120
 foundation of the University of Tocantins and 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.850
 by the Rural Development Institute 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.580
 has been encouraging honey producers to 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.640
 invest in the product and add value to 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.279
 agriculture to the current production of my 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.830
 tocantins is about 200 tonnes 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.769
 per year according to the technician in 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.770
 ruraltins beekeeping is a product that 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.380
 has little market value on the market and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.200
 propolis is another aggregate source of 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.090
 beekeeping activity which can make the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.340
 lucrative business 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.559
 joel own the kilo of his own today 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:53.070
 is varying from 220 reais while honey 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.239
 is around 12 and 15 reais is very 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.640
 more advantage 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.850
 the beekeeper opens his eyes now and 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.280
 begin producing propolis here in the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.830
 agrotecnological center of tocantins 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.810
 researchers study this substance 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.360
 is produced from the resin of 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.270
 trees and the secretion of their own 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.490
 bees with the result of these surveys 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.650
 beekeepers can know the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.310
 chemical composition of propolis that is 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.990
 produced in each region of the state 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.930
 considered a critical period both in 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.689
 my production of propolis in the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.840
 during the rainy season, bees are not 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.720
 get out of the boxes to feed themselves 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.909
 to lower costs and maintain value 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.939
 nutrition of hives 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.840
 the ruraltins technicians guide the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.060
 beekeepers to install a feeder 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.979
 collective for bees critical period 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.020
 that the sheep but software in this 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.540
 rainy season price now 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.119
 beekeepers should be careful that in this 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.969
 they feed the bees 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.140
 both the production of honey by propolis 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.939
 and pollen this feeder of our study 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.219
 we did here together with the 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.160
 unitins agro that we are here in this 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.009
 period we provide an energy supply 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.620
 and we have here a 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.370
 provision of a feed 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.769
 made from soybean meal for the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.200
 beekeepers interested in investing in 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.200
 the market the technician reviews some 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.530
 guidelines that can also be obtained 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.680
 in the ruraltins offices last 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.959
 he asked, it's only 3 meters 5 more 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.150
 you can use a distance from a box 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.209
 to the other and to make us ride 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.659
 a pawn always has a distance 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:45.629
 recommended at least 500 meters away 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.670
 of residences to take care of 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.099
 with children and small animals 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.440
 we have lectures and in the future we will have 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.950
 investments to take these courses 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.989
 for people who want to 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.269
 their residences or associations 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.220
 here in our region we already have the 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.280
 honey producers who have invested 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.510
 including the slab in the bed of the 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.989
 hugs to her 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.319
 the lasa she came to stay there in the effort 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.480
 that she took the course for the 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.639
 there food food course 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.069
 food technology and she has already 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.650
 in an interview for us that now the 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.470
 Her goal is to produce royal jelly 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.349
 which is the most expensive part of beekeeping 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.319
 so that's what the people want is to produce 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.160
 the law in a specific way is thus to add 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.160
 value to your work
