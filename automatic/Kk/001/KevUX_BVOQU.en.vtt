fabric<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.570> just<00:00:09.900> use<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.139> very<00:00:10.500> little

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
fabric and I just use a very little

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.980 
fabric and I just use a very little
amount<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:11.400> actually<00:00:11.730> cut<00:00:12.150> mine<00:00:12.360> from<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.780> that

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
amount I actually cut mine from a that

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.829 
amount I actually cut mine from a that
quarter<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:14.280> used<00:00:14.639> flannel<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.480> probably

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
quarter and I used flannel you probably

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.390 
quarter and I used flannel you probably
want<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.049> use<00:00:16.170> something<00:00:16.379> more<00:00:16.770> absorbent

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
want to use something more absorbent

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.040 
want to use something more absorbent
because<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.910> reason<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.420> big<00:00:18.570> Danah<00:00:18.810> is

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
because the reason for the big Danah is

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.109 
because the reason for the big Danah is
to<00:00:19.230> catch<00:00:19.439> all<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.710> drool<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.250> spit<00:00:20.520> up<00:00:20.670> so

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
to catch all that drool and spit up so

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.150 
to catch all that drool and spit up so
you<00:00:21.180> can<00:00:21.449> use<00:00:21.660> whatever<00:00:22.080> fabric<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.650> want<00:00:22.800> but

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
you can use whatever fabric you want but

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.220 
you can use whatever fabric you want but
I<00:00:23.189> would<00:00:23.460> suggest<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:24.210> more<00:00:24.449> absorbent<00:00:25.050> fabric

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
I would suggest a more absorbent fabric

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.410 
I would suggest a more absorbent fabric
then<00:00:25.830> you're<00:00:26.010> going<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.369> need<00:00:26.519> some<00:00:26.849> paper<00:00:27.090> to

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
then you're going to need some paper to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.419 
then you're going to need some paper to
make<00:00:27.539> your<00:00:27.720> pattern<00:00:27.960> something<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.890> attach

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
make your pattern something to attach

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.790 
make your pattern something to attach

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.160 
the bib Tana's in the back and on this
one<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.160> used<00:00:32.189> velcro<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.510> another<00:00:33.840> one<00:00:34.020> I

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
one I used velcro and on another one I

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.200 
one I used velcro and on another one I
use<00:00:34.350> snaps<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.219> can<00:00:35.430> use<00:00:35.579> whatever<00:00:35.760> works

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
use snaps so you can use whatever works

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.770 
use snaps so you can use whatever works

that another thing that I did which is

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.130 
that another thing that I did which is
also<00:01:10.020> optional<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:11.369> came<00:01:11.490> down<00:01:12.030> from<00:01:12.420> my<00:01:12.810> 7

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.960

inches<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.619> came<00:01:13.830> down<00:01:14.040> half<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.430> an<00:01:14.580> inch<00:01:14.700> in

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
inches I came down half of an inch in

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.120 
inches I came down half of an inch in
the<00:01:15.000> middle<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.509> then<00:01:15.930> back<00:01:16.110> up<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> 7<00:01:16.830> inches

the middle and then back up to 7 inches
on<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.549> sides<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.600> way<00:01:18.869> it'll<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.350> fit

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
on the sides so that way it'll just fit

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.960 
on the sides so that way it'll just fit
better<00:01:19.650> around<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> neck<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.430> won't<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.729> as

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
better around the neck and won't be as

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.240 
better around the neck and won't be as
bulky<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:21.990> don't<00:01:22.200> necessarily<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
bulky but you don't necessarily have to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.890 
bulky but you don't necessarily have to
do<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.400> now<00:01:24.119> once<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.659> your<00:01:24.750> pattern

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
do that now once you have your pattern

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.380 
do that now once you have your pattern
already<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.100> then<00:01:26.250> go<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.700> cut<00:01:26.939> out<00:01:27.119> two

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
already you can then go and cut out two

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.420 
already you can then go and cut out two
pieces<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:28.140> fabric<00:01:28.320> after<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.250> both

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430
