00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.430
 hello friends a taste again be 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.139
 with all of you the craft that 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.840
 let's make today is a nice 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.170
 vase that is made with flowers made of 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.910
 tickets is thought more than anything in a 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.980
 gift for now that comes 10 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.530
 May to go down I do not know if it has 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.230
 past that sometimes we do not know what 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.090
 give to our mommy and it would be 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.340
 better give him the money so that she 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.629
 choose what to buy and well what better 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.660
 way to do it 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.940
 that in a vase with notes is a 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.280
 very original way of doing it and I think 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.630
 that our moms will love 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.570
 well then to make our pretty 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.579
 but we're going to need a base like 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.579
 this one I chose 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.879
 this little bottle 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.070
 apart we obviously need tickets 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.600
 the bills will depend on the 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.089
 amount that you want to give to 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.309
 mom I chose these as sample because 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.100
 I liked the color 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.979
 and well let's do then our 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.310
 bullfighter we need also I chose 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.490
 put pebbles of these that we can 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.280
 find on the bank of a river or sometimes 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.439
 They also sell them in bags in the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.420
 craft stores of these 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:29.090
 small to fill our bottle 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.890
 we are also going to need clean pipes 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.730
 so that it is the stem of our flower 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.240
 right now we do it 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.210
 and we are going to need 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.640
 another cleans pipes rather others cleans 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.420
 more pipes to make as these ornaments 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.100
 these 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.110
 as little guys we're going to do 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.180
 they're going to go here and well we're going to 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.820
 start then the first thing we're going to 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.390
 to do is let's put the stones 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.390
 inside 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.450
 what we are going to do now is the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.860
 little flower in the shape of an accordion and let's go 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.810
 grab our ticket and we're going to 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.810
 start folding it 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.440
 in this way to form what is the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.440
 wind 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.880
 It is good here and now half 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.480
 let's put the pipes clean 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.480
 A) Yes 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.520
 and we are going to turn around that he cleans pipes 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.860
 the fold we left here did not 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.680
 down to leave us for us 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.400
 allows to close the ticket and that 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.400
 form the little flower 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.010
 A) Yes 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.790
 we try to fit well in half 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.850
 so that we are well formed 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.010
 flower we check like this and it looks good 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.960
 this part that we left a little bit more 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.440
 long pipe clean simply the 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.440
 we cut 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.490
 now to be able to close our flower of 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.560
 this part we are going to put a little bit of 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.560
 tape or tape 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.500
 good and look like this is completely 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.240
 formed our flower with the ticket already 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.310
 nothing else with another pipe cleaner what 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.620
 let's do now is to form what 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.250
 it's the little leaf 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.250
 A) Yes 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.130
 we turn here with the tip clean 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.790
 pipes 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.010
 so that it is well informed and we are going 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.350
 to measure up to what we have 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.600
 and we are going to rotate the here again 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.020
 about twice and we're going to cut this 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.020
 part 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.770
 now we're just going to curve what is 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.069
 the little leaf like this to give it 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.569
 a little bit more 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:08.329
 so look, it was better and good what 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.719
 let's do now it's also like them 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:14.299
 he said with another clean pipes extra we go 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:16.190
 to choose three colors to do what 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.720
 this will be this adornito that also 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.530
 will take you in here and give you more 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.600
 view 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.400
 and good 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.400
 let's roll it up like this 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.820
 and leave this piece towards 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.680
 down to put it in the bottle 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.680
 nothing more then we open it 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.570
 and look, we've already been 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.230
 Now let's go putting one of 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.230
 our flowers 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:55.680
 we do face the pebbles and 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.680
 let's go putting our flowers 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.000
 now as I was telling you these others that 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.990
 previously did we also are going to 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.990
 put in this part 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.620
 good look and it's almost ready 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.740
 our vase now what is missing is 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.070
 with a piece of ribbon we are going to cut 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.720
 the two pieces one of them we're going 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.460
 to put here around to tape 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.470
 this part where are the pipes cleaned 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.470
 and look more our vase 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.920
 we are going to need glue 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.620
 and this nothing else we are going to put it like this 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:08.500
 and in this we are going to do the pretty 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.500
 so that nothing else looks 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.750
 We check the size that is not too 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.880
 large that is appropriate to our 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.270
 credit and we put a little bit of glue 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.270
 as well 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.880
 why 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.250
 we cut in the form of a little bird so that 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.250
 see more beautiful 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.240
 and now we are going to paste it in this part 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:06.139
 and well in the center we can already put 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:09.030
 some extra detail I'm going to put 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.800
 this little heart 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.230
 good friends and look how nice it has 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.000
 already finished our vase and 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.220
 as I told you, it 's a very 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.140
 original to be able to give money to 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.510
 mom so she can buy what she 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.100
 want or what he likes best we 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.220
 we see in the following tutorial up 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.220
 then
