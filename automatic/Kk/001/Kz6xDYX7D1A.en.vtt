00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.280
 so on bound pigtails you visa on 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:16.230
 single crochet spreads in 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:20.730
 building and look according to the scheme we need 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.449
 knit 3 air loops we them and 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.699
 tying out we introduce a hook under the thread and 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:35.040
 knit 3 air loop further 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:37.469
 through three loops of the previous row 1 2 3 in 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:45.590
 vyvyazyvaya fourth column from the sc 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:50.100
 I do nakid counting loops 1 2 3 4 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:53.489
 we drive a hook under both strings of a loop 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.500
 so under both strings we pick up the pads 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:05.630
 working thread we take out the wind you and 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:11.130
 tying 2 and 2 strings on the diagram below 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:18.119
 3 air loops added add 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:21.710
 1 2 3 them further from the resulting 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:27.000
 holes cut three double crochet 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:30.380
 we put the hook straight on 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.590
 the hole picks up the working thread 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:44.960
 pulling out and tying 2 2 re-enter 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:48.829
 in work so we enter into the hole 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:55.860
 pull out the working thread and knit 2 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:02:00.000
 2 further according to the scheme we have a column with 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:09.450
 back in three air in three 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.020
 loop 4 counting down 1 2 3 4 in the will hook 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.959
 under 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:20.610
 both strings 5 take the work glove 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:23.580
 we pull out the working thread further according to the scheme 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.459
 we have again 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:32.040
 3 air loops up and 3 posts with 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:33.450
 backsplash 3 air loops up and 3 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:41.060
 double crochet 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:41.060
 from the resulting hole 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:50.150
 and knitting is repeated until the end of the row
