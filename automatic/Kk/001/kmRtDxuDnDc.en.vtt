in<00:01:50.300> football<00:01:50.720> I<00:01:50.930> think<00:01:51.830> is<00:01:52.330> you<00:01:53.330> can't<00:01:53.540> get

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
in football I think is you can't get

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.750 
in football I think is you can't get
away<00:01:53.780> from<00:01:53.900> football<00:01:54.140> it's<00:01:54.590> one<00:01:55.580> of<00:01:55.670> these

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
away from football it's one of these

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.969 
away from football it's one of these
things<00:01:55.820> is<00:01:56.120> always<00:01:56.600> on<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.810> TV<00:01:57.110> and<00:01:57.140> it's<00:01:57.740> when

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
things is always on the TV and it's when

things is always on the TV and it's when
you<00:01:58.040> hear<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.280> crowd<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:58.700> stuff<00:01:58.880> like<00:01:59.000> that

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
you hear the crowd and stuff like that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.580 
you hear the crowd and stuff like that
it's<00:01:59.330> like<00:01:59.479> you<00:01:59.690> want<00:01:59.810> to<00:01:59.900> be<00:02:00.049> part<00:02:00.350> of<00:02:00.440> it

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
it's like you want to be part of it

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.560 
it's like you want to be part of it
somehow<00:02:00.830> either<00:02:01.280> watching<00:02:01.940> it<00:02:02.060> being<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.330> fun

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
somehow either watching it being a fun

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.539 
somehow either watching it being a fun
or<00:02:02.810> playing<00:02:03.409> it<00:02:03.620> or<00:02:03.770> coaching<00:02:04.250> or<00:02:04.370> whatever

or playing it or coaching or whatever
and<00:02:04.760> I<00:02:05.299> think<00:02:05.570> it's<00:02:05.720> one<00:02:05.840> of<00:02:05.870> these<00:02:06.020> things

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
and I think it's one of these things

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.980 
and I think it's one of these things
where<00:02:06.409> I<00:02:06.740> kind<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.310> around<00:02:07.909> 14-15<00:02:08.569> a<00:02:08.630> kind<00:02:08.869> of

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
where I kind of around 14-15 a kind of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.779 
where I kind of around 14-15 a kind of
gave<00:02:09.110> up<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.590> thought<00:02:09.800> I'll<00:02:10.280> have<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.520> go<00:02:10.640> do

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
gave up and I thought I'll have to go do

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.250 
gave up and I thought I'll have to go do
some<00:02:10.970> else<00:02:11.120> but<00:02:11.540> there's<00:02:11.660> always<00:02:11.810> a<00:02:11.930> part<00:02:12.200> of

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
some else but there's always a part of

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.540 
some else but there's always a part of
me<00:02:12.380> that<00:02:12.410> wanted<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.890> be<00:02:13.069> involved<00:02:13.310> in<00:02:13.490> the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
me that wanted to be involved in the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.750 
me that wanted to be involved in the
game

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
game

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.850 
game
somehow<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.840> always<00:02:15.019> thought<00:02:15.170> there's<00:02:15.769> no

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
somehow and I always thought there's no

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.110 
somehow and I always thought there's no
way<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.129> can<00:02:16.220> be<00:02:16.430> involved<00:02:16.610> in<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.879> game<00:02:17.000> and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
way I can be involved in the game and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.210 
way I can be involved in the game and
that<00:02:17.209> was<00:02:17.269> my<00:02:17.450> mentality<00:02:17.810> but<00:02:18.769> I<00:02:18.829> think<00:02:19.069> we'll

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
that was my mentality but I think we'll

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.069 
that was my mentality but I think we'll
after<00:02:19.730> talking<00:02:19.939> to<00:02:20.180> Andy<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.599> basically

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
after talking to Andy is basically

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.270 
after talking to Andy is basically
that's<00:02:21.260> when<00:02:21.409> everything<00:02:21.590> really<00:02:21.829> changed

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
that's when everything really changed

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.970 
that's when everything really changed
and<00:02:22.819> then<00:02:23.019> after<00:02:24.019> that<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.170> was<00:02:24.319> driven<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.709> it

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
and then after that I was driven to it

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.649 
and then after that I was driven to it
