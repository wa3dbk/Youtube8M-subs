00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
I've noticed that it's not that abusive

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.600 
I've noticed that it's not that abusive
this<00:05:37.639> time<00:05:37.940> around<00:05:38.120> so<00:05:38.979> if<00:05:39.979> you<00:05:40.159> had<00:05:40.370> issues

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
this time around so if you had issues

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.999 
this time around so if you had issues
with<00:05:40.820> people<00:05:41.330> look<00:05:41.509> at<00:05:41.599> that<00:05:41.810> flacco<00:05:42.560> was<00:05:42.740> out

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 
with people look at that flacco was out

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.270 
with people look at that flacco was out
there<00:05:43.419> pulling<00:05:44.419> a<00:05:44.599> mark<00:05:44.870> sanchez<00:05:45.469> but<00:05:45.979> it<00:05:46.099> gets

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
there pulling a mark sanchez but it gets

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.459 
there pulling a mark sanchez but it gets
up<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:46.699> he<00:05:46.789> throws<00:05:46.820> the<00:05:47.240> ball<00:05:47.389> like<00:05:47.659> a<00:05:47.719> beast

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:50.469 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:53.709 

so<00:05:51.469> the<00:05:51.860> pistol<00:05:52.250> offense<00:05:52.370> I<00:05:52.849> feel<00:05:53.210> is<00:05:53.389> going<00:05:53.599> to

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:53.719 
so the pistol offense I feel is going to

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:55.480 
so the pistol offense I feel is going to
be<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:53.930> threat<00:05:54.199> this<00:05:54.409> year<00:05:54.740> using<00:05:55.219> a<00:05:55.280> pistol
