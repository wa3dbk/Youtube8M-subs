00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.240 
build on its shoulders wallpaper machine
okay<00:04:35.030> yeah<00:04:35.450> you<00:04:36.350> wanna<00:04:36.470> go<00:04:36.650> do<00:04:36.919> on<00:04:36.979> the<00:04:37.070> scene

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
okay yeah you wanna go do on the scene

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.830 
okay yeah you wanna go do on the scene
actually<00:04:37.640> do<00:04:37.820> want<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.090> see<00:04:38.210> it<00:04:38.300> in<00:04:38.390> action<00:04:38.510> all

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
actually do want to see it in action all

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:47.559 
actually do want to see it in action all
right

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:52.580 

that<00:04:48.569> he's<00:04:49.229> a<00:04:49.259> winner<00:04:51.139> yeah

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
that he's a winner yeah

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.309 
that he's a winner yeah
that<00:04:53.220> is<00:04:53.400> brilliant<00:04:54.210> why<00:04:54.750> has<00:04:54.870> no<00:04:55.050> one<00:04:55.080> done

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319 
that is brilliant why has no one done

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.469 
that is brilliant why has no one done
that<00:04:55.470> before<00:04:55.740> very<00:04:56.069> flat<00:04:56.490> it's<00:04:57.120> absolutely

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
that before very flat it's absolutely

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.960 
that before very flat it's absolutely
fantastic<00:04:57.599> I<00:04:58.110> can't<00:04:58.319> think<00:04:58.590> why<00:04:59.159> somebody<00:04:59.729> has

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
fantastic I can't think why somebody has

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.300 
fantastic I can't think why somebody has
not<00:05:00.150> invented<00:05:00.659> that<00:05:00.780> before<00:05:01.110> well<00:05:01.919> thank<00:05:02.490> you

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310
