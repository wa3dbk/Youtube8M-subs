00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.160
 Hello everyone then we will 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.160
 proceed to pair the smart and watch 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:18.789
 with our hollow wax of your mobile 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:21.009
 Android with version 4.2 or higher 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.890
 in the smart and watch we accede at least 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.220
 adjustments and within adjustments we click on 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.230
 the bluetooth option 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.510
 we access the bluetooth menu 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.700
 and the first thing we have to do is 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.670
 make our smart watch be 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.210
 visible for other devices we press 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.739
 here and we put it in visible to 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.500
 other devices 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.150
 in turn we open the smart application and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.010
 watch on our android phone 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.160
 click on contextual and look for the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.290
 device 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.770
 as you see on our screen 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:01.500
 Android smartphone shows our watch 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.500
 the smart watch 2131 click on 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.500
 and on both screens there is a 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.620
 request link checked 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.770
 the code matches 90 73 20 and 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.750
 click on link 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.360
 at this moment we have linked to the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.610
 two teams 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.790
 Now what we should do is link 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.860
 the 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.720

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.890
 click on the name of our 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.050
 device and the system will ask us 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.470
 link the device is martÃ­ watch 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.890
 with our type number 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.720
 to accept 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.540
 a smartphone message is sent on 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.060
 clock and on the clock we press to accept 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.470
 at this time our smart and watch and 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.720
 our mobile phone are already 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.860
 linked 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.860
 with which we can leave 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.510
 as you can see the time has already been synchronized 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.700
 with the time of the clock and the date already 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.700
 has synchronized with the date of the clock 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.920
 once we have made this link 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.740
 initial 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.989
 let's start setting up other 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.530
 aspects of notifications of 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.110
 our martins bots 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.900
 click on the context menu and choose 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.970
 the adjustments option unfolds this 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.610
 menu in which we can configure a 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.580
 lots of club parameters we're going 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.910
 to fix in some of them the first 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.520
 the configuration of sms is fast 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.190
 from our smart and watch we can 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.610
 reject a call well hanging 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.230
 directly or by sending an SMS 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.450
 this case the messages that come 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.350
 predefined are these we can modify 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.350
 any message by clicking on it and 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.350
 typing 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.940
 to the main menu 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.840
 and we follow the configuration 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.130
 use of the system 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.780
 to link the two teams 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.950
 and one of the most important because it is 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.840
 one of the main functions of 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.560
 our clock is the settings menu of 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.560

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.840
 click on it opens us this 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.610
 screen where we see a red zone 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.840
 which indicates this application does not 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.819
 will work until you activate is the 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.950
 corresponding function 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.390
 it is necessary that we activate a function 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.720
 of accessibility within our 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.840
 Android smartphone 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.269
 and we click on the red zone 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.989
 in accessibility in services we press 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.060
 on the smart spc and watch we enable 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.120

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.970

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.879
 and we already see all the applications 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.530
 and processes of the Android operating system 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:58.160
