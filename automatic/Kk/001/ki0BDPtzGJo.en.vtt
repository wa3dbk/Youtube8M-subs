00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:11.529
 we were very happy and for this achievement 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:15.969
 in the state of paraná yemen the results the first place was with 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:16.930
 one hour 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.230
 the utc pr 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.039
 and we in the otc system pr that are 11 campuses the white duck camp stayed in 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.220
 second place compared to the other campuses in the general classification of the state 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.480
 of the paraná uenp campus white duck of the pcpr was in sixth place 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.710
 and there that including the buzzing city the state and institutions discuss 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.390
 private individuals also as speaker maria the college good jesus 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.690
 home and Curitiba 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.110
 It is very important at that point we spoke with private schools 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.970
 if not public at all 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.880
 really the thing is bad is being done by twitter that he seeks 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.950
 seems to have done much better he knows it is a work and effort of the 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.840
 teachers 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.150
 we also know that part of this is due to the more 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.929
 entrance of our students 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.890
 we enter with a group of students and they go through a selection process 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.430
 the more we are very satisfied and it is a demonstration that when 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.190
 to the public service, he achieves this is that it is not 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.190
 cutting edge in the execution of work 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.560
 are three amendments in the text with our problems 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.340
 until yesterday but we are with 98% of fill our vacancies here of the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.260
 students who applied for candidacy to sisu 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.820
 treat yourself then we consider that a fairly high rate because 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.280
 if I am not mistaken in the press it was what enem's index usually brings and the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.730
 tacoma occupancy rate of 35% fear of the sisu system today we are then in the 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.360
 white duck campus with an occupancy rate of 98% still considering that 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.150
 many of these students are coming from outside again if 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.990
 trend we have students coming from são paulo holy spirit 'minasgerais 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.400
