00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.430
 friends all huge hello in this video 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.760
 I want to tell what materials to us 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.490
 needed to draw first 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.980
 in order to draw in our techniques 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.199
 we will need to gouache him i paint here 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.080
 such a set of 12 flowers is very 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.770
 fits well with our tasks new 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.810
 firms 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.250
 and our domestic manufacturer is very 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.310
 good here than paints are needed 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.710
 brushes at least in the set should 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.040
 be three brushes 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.829
 large medium and small tassel 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.780
 large and medium brushes in this case 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.489
 this bristles are so hard hair very and 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.739
 the brush is flat in shape that is 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.010
 if you turn it so sideways she 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.129
 thin here and so it is wide so that 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.850
 there is a flat bristle more and less 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.270
 and a little tassel is already here 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.790
 synthetic round synthetic number one 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.950
 soft hair small size tassels 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.619
 rounded shape and and 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.090
 besides the bristles we can use 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.759
 also synthetic brushes are flat 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.320
 that is, either a large bristle or 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.530
 middle seta can be replaced 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.460
 flat synthetic tassel here 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.340
 flat 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.100
 a large flat medium brush that is 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.490
 any bristles can be replaced 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.750
 but the main thing is to 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.420
 bristle was present at least 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.400
 what a brush one was seta 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.290
 because for some tasks we need 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.600
 her in this here is the stiffness of this tassel 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.549
 further the palette she who mix 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.950
 paint can be like this with grooves 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.530
 you can use this board for 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.090
 sculpting can just plate 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.610
 using it doesn't matter 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.600
 the main thing that was convenient to mix 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.060
 paint on this surface is paper on 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.659
 which draw in this case, this 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.030
 watercolor paper 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.539
 we need thick paper to 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.760
 she doesnâ€™t q you when we paint on her 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.890
 watercolor paper in two different sides 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.730
 we can use and here it is 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.220
 rough side and smooth side 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.640
 paper is not fundamentally important to 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.090
 the paper itself was tight 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.510
 further than wipe the brush use 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.290
 either paper towels and such here 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.680
 mitten for a long time enough or a rag 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.549
 any well absorbing and now i am you 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.140
 tell you how to prepare paint for 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.750
 to draw her 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.099
 if you have a brand new paint fresh 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.190
 open and see whether it is moving on 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.920
 meaning you tilt the jar if it 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.470
 no way to turn and with 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.079
 nothing happens to her it means that 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.799
 you can make it more mobile 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:08.079
 how do we change its texture 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:13.180
 add to each paint can 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:14.910
 about a third of the cap water we need 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.799
 paint consistency 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:26.489
 like urban sour cream on rustic 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:29.709
 thick which spoon stands and does not fall a 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:32.470
 such an urban fifteen percent 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.319
 thin sour cream and at the same time without 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.239
 bigotry yes you don't breed for 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.280
 to paint directly spread over too 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.900
 surface that is such an average 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.139
 consistency was to krasochki 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:48.940
 moving and either I have this 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:50.650
 a wooden stick with a sharp tip this 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.430
 not a special stick this stick for 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.579
 kebabs or such a stick or 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.650
 just the flip side all on the other 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.799
 show jars 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.739
 reverse side of the brush thin we 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.609
 mix each paint jar 2 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.609
 homogeneous consistency 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.540
 and so each can of paint is one light 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.530
 prevented rubbing 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.299
 and a napkin a paper towel and a cloth 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:27.670
 and the next color 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:30.800
 We go and so all the colors mix and 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.050
 look consistency yes we needed 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.130
 about great coloring here I turn over 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:40.460
 now it's a jar here I have it 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:44.540
 paint flows out and here we looked yellow 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:47.270
 originally paint to cop she moves 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.570
 something happens to her already so freely 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.550
 and can't just flip the can and 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:56.900
 nothing will change until that is paint 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:59.150
 we need such a moving here all 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.240
 mix paint and can proceed 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.890
 for drawing do not forget to prepare 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.110
 we will need a glass of water too 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.090
 I wish you success in your work and 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.520
 watch video tutorials 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.520
 draw and be happy
