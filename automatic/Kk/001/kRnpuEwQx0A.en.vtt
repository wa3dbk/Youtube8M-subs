00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.760
 Hello 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:23.660
 arrived Victor we will today 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.660
 investigate this new one 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:31.680
 new nozzle principle it is designed 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.590
 for fishing carp 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:43.010
 I think it will be interesting to spend it 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:46.410
 Carpet does not mean 60 grams 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:59.940
 we take to start is not known yet 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:01:07.980
 can i not shave dry for 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:10.580
 all those countries will add there 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.580
 windy weather 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.240
 today it was raining unknown yet 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.240
 there will be some cataclysms therefore 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.240
 for 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.300
 improvement to make the nozzle better 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.840
 sat on a hook add 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:34.240
 coarse fibers up to about the jaw 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:39.840
 grant 10 grams 15 percent 15 percent 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:48.210
 nozzle will be more i more fibrous 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:55.060
 but not that is fiber flexibility give us 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:58.150
 add here the same ones 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:13.630
 droplets that i used in the past 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:17.830
 Statement by left bubble 100 grams and 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:23.040
 40 grams left last day 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.040
 seasonal is that is idle used 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:34.190
 here's water let's say 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.890
 also add semen gv 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.280
 in principle, on the dough, it interferes with the proportions 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.280
 one to one 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.569
 on 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.569
 fibers i add 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.190
 water 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:08.190
 through gram test rally 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:10.610
 drops of 10 grams of fiber unlike 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.610
 livers 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.250
 these are coarser fibers thicker 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.250
 let's say 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.830
 that is, a and a similar action 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.390
 let's say your number 5 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.390
 seat liner in the end 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.569
 there will be ready two seen round 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.720
 here so usually still should nakhuya 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.740
 turn over 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.270
 all the water soaked 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:52.930
 dough should 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.930
 settle for 5 seater 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.900
 that's the consistency of what happened 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.380
 here 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:10.310
 here you can see here they are fibers 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:15.380
 and what is there he they are he fibers he 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:18.100
 everything is hanging 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.100
 dough waiting
