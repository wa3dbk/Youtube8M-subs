I guess the mascot of this anime but we
don't<00:02:20.100> know<00:02:20.280> much<00:02:20.489> about<00:02:20.700> him<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.630> last

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
don't know much about him so the last

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.570 
don't know much about him so the last
part<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.230> episode<00:02:22.500> focused<00:02:23.100> on<00:02:23.250> figuring

we<00:02:25.680> really<00:02:25.980> don't<00:02:26.100> know<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.640> mean<00:02:27.000> I'm<00:02:27.209> guessing

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
we really don't know I mean I'm guessing

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.720

he's<00:02:27.690> based<00:02:27.959> off<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.380> platypus<00:02:28.890> but<00:02:29.130> we<00:02:29.550> don't

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
he's based off the platypus but we don't

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.610 
he's based off the platypus but we don't
know<00:02:29.850> exactly<00:02:29.970> what<00:02:30.480> he<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.290> which<00:02:31.470> will
