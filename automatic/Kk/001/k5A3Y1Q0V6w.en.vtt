crazy well today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.080> do<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.650> using<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> proper<00:00:26.789> heat

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
how to do it using the proper heat

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.970 
how to do it using the proper heat
settings<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> omelet<00:00:28.619> will<00:00:28.710> slide

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
settings so that the omelet will slide

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.189 
settings so that the omelet will slide
right<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> pan<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.119> into<00:00:30.599> your<00:00:30.929> plate

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
right of the pan and into your plate

okay<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.520> first<00:00:32.669> principle<00:00:32.969> I'm<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.510> to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
okay so the first principle I'm going to

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.470 
okay so the first principle I'm going to
go<00:00:33.750> through<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.140> called<00:00:34.440> me<00:00:35.130> Zen<00:00:35.399> plus<00:00:35.670> which

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
go through is called me Zen plus which

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.540 
go through is called me Zen plus which
is<00:00:36.510> basically<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.140> fancy<00:00:37.469> French<00:00:37.980> word<00:00:38.309> that

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
is basically a fancy French word that

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.450 
is basically a fancy French word that
means<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:39.300> everything<00:00:39.809> ready<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.260> go<00:00:40.340> so<00:00:41.340> as

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
means have everything ready to go so as

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.810 
means have everything ready to go so as
you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.149> I've<00:00:42.300> got<00:00:42.379> cheddar<00:00:43.379> cheese

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
utensils at hand ready to go now the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.470 
utensils at hand ready to go now the
point<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.460> everything<00:01:03.329> is

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
point of this is so that everything is

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.690 
point of this is so that everything is
ready<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.899> go<00:01:04.019> once<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.710> want<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.430> put<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
ready to go once you want to put the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.539 
ready to go once you want to put the
eggs<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> heat<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.979> last<00:01:07.979> thing<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.369> want

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
eggs to the heat the last thing you want

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.130 
eggs to the heat the last thing you want
to<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.970> put<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> eggs<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> heat<00:01:09.930> and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
to do is put the eggs to the heat and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.870 
to do is put the eggs to the heat and
still<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.710> waiting<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.280> your<00:01:11.369> onions<00:01:11.729> to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
still be waiting for your onions to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.390 
still be waiting for your onions to
saute<00:01:12.390> or<00:01:12.659> find<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> need<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.830> go<00:01:13.979> cut<00:01:14.220> up

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
saute or find the need to go cut up

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.859 
saute or find the need to go cut up
something<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.390> meantime

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
something in the meantime

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.490 
something in the meantime
so<00:01:16.860> at<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.070> point<00:01:17.369> what<00:01:17.670> I'm<00:01:17.790> going<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.210> is

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
so at this point what I'm going to do is

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.520 
so at this point what I'm going to do is
heat<00:01:19.500> up<00:01:19.530> my<00:01:20.100> stainless<00:01:20.970> steel<00:01:21.330> pan<00:01:21.840> now<00:01:22.409> this

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
heat up my stainless steel pan now this

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.050 
heat up my stainless steel pan now this
is<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> very<00:01:22.920> important<00:01:23.310> step<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.729> I'm<00:01:23.820> going<00:01:24.000> to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
is a very important step so I'm going to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.190 
is a very important step so I'm going to
preheat<00:01:24.299> I'm<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.840> turn<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.040> about

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
preheat I'm going to turn it on to about

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.960 
preheat I'm going to turn it on to about
medium-low<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.460> high<00:01:29.640> side<00:01:29.939> of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
medium-low on the high side of

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.700 
medium-low on the high side of
medium-low<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.049> would<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.259> medium<00:01:31.530> low

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
medium-low so that would be medium low

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.280 
medium-low so that would be medium low
we're<00:01:32.189> going<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.509> do<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> high<00:01:33.960> side<00:01:34.229> of

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
we're going to do it on the high side of

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.460 
we're going to do it on the high side of
medium<00:01:34.590> low<00:01:34.890> we're<00:01:35.009> gonna<00:01:35.100> let<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.670> heat<00:01:35.939> up

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
medium low we're gonna let it heat up

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.410 
medium low we're gonna let it heat up
now<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.619> isn't<00:01:37.860> very<00:01:38.340> important<00:01:38.909> principle

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
now this isn't very important principle

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.740 
now this isn't very important principle
because<00:01:39.659> if<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.960> put<00:01:40.259> cold<00:01:41.159> eggs<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> cold

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
because if you put cold eggs to a cold

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.130 
because if you put cold eggs to a cold
pan<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.439> get<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> sticky<00:01:44.040> mess<00:01:44.369> okay<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.630> that's

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
pan you get a sticky mess okay so that's

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.710 
pan you get a sticky mess okay so that's
not<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.500> good<00:01:46.799> thing<00:01:46.909> what<00:01:47.909> we<00:01:48.060> want<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.540> is

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
not a good thing what we want to do is

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.260 
not a good thing what we want to do is
wait<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> pan<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.710> heat<00:01:49.740> up<00:01:49.950> then<00:01:50.700> add<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
butter and then add the egg so that's

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.850 
butter and then add the egg so that's
the<00:01:53.970> process<00:01:54.390> we're<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.780> go<00:01:55.560> through

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the process we're going to go through

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
now I'm going to give you some tips on

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.139 
now I'm going to give you some tips on
knowing<00:01:58.140> when<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.979> right<00:01:59.219> time<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.610> add<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
knowing when the right time to add the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.700 
knowing when the right time to add the
butter<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:00.899> when<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> right<00:02:01.439> time

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
butter is and then when the right time

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.459 
butter is and then when the right time
to<00:02:02.189> add<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.759> exits<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:03.689> for<00:02:03.930> right<00:02:04.049> now<00:02:04.110> we're

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
to add the exits but for right now we're

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.840 
to add the exits but for right now we're
going<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.619> wait<00:02:04.829> for<00:02:04.890> about<00:02:05.280> three<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.579> four

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
going to wait for about three to four

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.830 
going to wait for about three to four
minutes<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.899> pan<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.350> heat<00:02:07.380> up<00:02:08.569> now<00:02:09.569> my

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
minutes for this pan to heat up now my

minutes for this pan to heat up now my
pan<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.140> still<00:02:10.410> preheating<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:11.489> getting

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
pan is still preheating it's getting

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.030 
pan is still preheating it's getting
pretty<00:02:11.940> hot<00:02:12.060> now

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
pretty hot now

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.309 
pretty hot now
a<00:02:13.069> test<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:13.730> can<00:02:13.939> do<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.599> put<00:02:14.930> some<00:02:15.079> water

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
a test that I can do is put some water

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.459 
a test that I can do is put some water
on<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.769> to<00:02:15.799> Z<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.459> see<00:02:16.610> how<00:02:16.819> hot<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:17.299> going<00:02:17.659> so

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:18.469 
on it to Z to see how hot it's going so

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:19.420 
on it to Z to see how hot it's going so
I'm<00:02:18.530> just<00:02:18.620> going<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.799> get<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:18.980> little<00:02:19.159> splash

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
I'm just going to get a little splash

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.709 
I'm just going to get a little splash
with<00:02:19.760> my<00:02:20.000> fingers<00:02:21.069> put<00:02:22.069> in<00:02:22.189> there<00:02:22.540> see<00:02:23.540> how<00:02:23.659> the

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:23.719 
with my fingers put in there see how the

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.599 
with my fingers put in there see how the
water<00:02:24.079> starts<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.620> evaporate<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.400> kind<00:02:25.579> of

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:25.609 
water starts to evaporate and kind of

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.429 
water starts to evaporate and kind of
jump<00:02:25.879> off<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.090> little<00:02:26.480> bit<00:02:26.629> we're<00:02:27.230> almost<00:02:27.469> there

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439 
jump off a little bit we're almost there

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.440 
jump off a little bit we're almost there
all<00:02:30.439> right<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:30.890> we're<00:02:31.099> just<00:02:31.579> about<00:02:31.909> ready<00:02:32.299> to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
all right so we're just about ready to

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.119 
all right so we're just about ready to
go<00:02:32.689> here<00:02:32.930> let's<00:02:33.049> try<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.379> water<00:02:33.620> test<00:02:33.980> one

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
go here let's try the water test one

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.559 
go here let's try the water test one
more<00:02:34.310> time<00:02:36.819> see<00:02:37.819> how<00:02:37.909> it<00:02:38.060> jumps<00:02:38.329> off

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
more time see how it jumps off

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.330 
more time see how it jumps off
immediately<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.379> means<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.739> pan<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:40.129> good

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
immediately that means the pan is good

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.809 
immediately that means the pan is good
and<00:02:40.459> hot

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
and hot

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.720 
and hot
so<00:02:41.150> turnout<00:02:41.569> down<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.810> smidgen<00:02:42.500> okay<00:02:43.370> we're

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
so turnout down a smidgen okay we're

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.280 
so turnout down a smidgen okay we're
going<00:02:43.819> to<00:02:43.909> go<00:02:44.030> ahead<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.299> add<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.629> butter<00:02:44.810> now

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
going to go ahead and add the butter now

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.990 
going to go ahead and add the butter now
now<00:02:46.069> we<00:02:46.220> want<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.489> add<00:02:47.139> approximately<00:02:48.139> a

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
now we want to add approximately a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.429 
now we want to add approximately a
tablespoon<00:02:50.000> maybe<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.629> tablespoon<00:02:51.169> and<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.409> half

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:51.439 
tablespoon maybe a tablespoon and a half

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.990 
tablespoon maybe a tablespoon and a half
of<00:02:51.829> butter<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:54.189> like<00:02:55.189> butter<00:02:55.489> so<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:55.790> don't

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
of butter and I like butter so I don't

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.770 
of butter and I like butter so I don't

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
mind putting a little bit more plus it

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.780 
mind putting a little bit more plus it
helps<00:02:59.959> with<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.470> nonstick<00:03:01.069> magic<00:03:01.609> that's

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
helps with the nonstick magic that's

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.440 
helps with the nonstick magic that's
going<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.120> happen<00:03:02.450> here<00:03:02.859> now<00:03:04.269> butter<00:03:05.269> is

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
going to happen here now butter is

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.659 
going to happen here now butter is
sizzling<00:03:05.930> right<00:03:06.049> away<00:03:06.349> it's<00:03:06.560> melting<00:03:07.040> I'm

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:07.669 
sizzling right away it's melting I'm

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.059 
sizzling right away it's melting I'm
just<00:03:07.819> going<00:03:07.939> to<00:03:07.970> go<00:03:08.150> ahead<00:03:08.389> and<00:03:08.540> start<00:03:09.069> moving

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
just going to go ahead and start moving

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.699 
just going to go ahead and start moving
that<00:03:10.400> around<00:03:10.720> now<00:03:11.720> we<00:03:11.780> don't<00:03:12.049> want<00:03:12.319> the<00:03:12.470> butter

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709
