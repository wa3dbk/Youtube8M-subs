motion going in and going out it's

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.350 
motion going in and going out it's
important<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> choose<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> band<00:00:56.460> where<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.210> can

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
mind that form is critical and that you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.120 
mind that form is critical and that you
should<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.549> able<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.850> do<00:01:12.090> 10<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.960> 12<00:01:13.350> with
