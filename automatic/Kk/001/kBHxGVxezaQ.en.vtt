I've got about a teaspoon of East but we

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.950 
I've got about a teaspoon of East but we
need<00:00:39.370> to<00:00:39.489> use<00:00:39.670> some<00:00:40.239> lukewarm<00:00:40.629> water<00:00:40.960> for<00:00:41.199> it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
need to use some lukewarm water for it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.900 
need to use some lukewarm water for it
we're<00:00:43.960> gonna<00:00:44.080> mix<00:00:44.320> it<00:00:44.470> together<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:45.010> then<00:00:45.699> add

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
we're gonna mix it together and then add

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.290 
we're gonna mix it together and then add
it<00:00:46.090> to<00:00:46.239> our<00:00:46.350> refined<00:00:47.350> flour<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:48.089> just<00:00:49.089> make<00:00:49.269> a

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
it to our refined flour and just make a

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.490 
it to our refined flour and just make a
soft<00:00:50.110> dough<00:00:50.440> out<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:50.650> it<00:00:51.899> at<00:00:52.899> this<00:00:53.110> stage<00:00:53.350> I'm

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
soft dough out of it at this stage I'm

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.040 
soft dough out of it at this stage I'm
going<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.680> add<00:00:53.800> a<00:00:54.070> pinch<00:00:54.610> of<00:00:54.730> salt<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:55.719> reason

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
going to add a pinch of salt the reason

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.290 
going to add a pinch of salt the reason
why<00:00:56.170> I<00:00:56.200> didn't<00:00:56.469> add<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.649> salt<00:00:57.070> earlier<00:00:57.670> was

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
why I didn't add the salt earlier was

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.600 
why I didn't add the salt earlier was
the<00:00:58.780> East<00:00:58.989> and<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.530> sugar<00:00:59.860> when<00:01:00.280> they<00:01:00.370> start

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
the East and the sugar when they start

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.639 
the East and the sugar when they start
working<00:01:00.820> together<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.660> salt<00:01:01.930> actually<00:01:02.110> cuts

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
working together the salt actually cuts

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.170 
working together the salt actually cuts
the<00:01:02.860> working<00:01:03.160> of<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.430> East<00:01:03.520> so<00:01:03.910> we<00:01:03.940> need<00:01:04.089> to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
the working of the East so we need to

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.150 
the working of the East so we need to
always<00:01:04.479> add<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:05.170> salt<00:01:05.470> at<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:05.920> last<00:01:06.100> stage

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.969 

okay<00:01:12.190> at<00:01:12.369> this<00:01:12.640> stage<00:01:12.990> we're<00:01:13.990> gonna<00:01:14.110> add<00:01:14.320> some

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
okay at this stage we're gonna add some

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.870 
okay at this stage we're gonna add some
olive<00:01:15.190> oil<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.860> just<00:01:18.100> knead<00:01:18.340> it<00:01:18.490> all<00:01:18.610> together

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.830 

whenever<00:01:21.880> you<00:01:22.030> are<00:01:22.119> making<00:01:22.149> a<00:01:22.479> dough<00:01:22.660> with

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
whenever you are making a dough with

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.779 
whenever you are making a dough with
East<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.530> need<00:01:23.679> to<00:01:23.800> do<00:01:23.920> this<00:01:24.069> process<00:01:24.369> really

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
East you need to do this process really

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.430 
East you need to do this process really
well<00:01:25.030> because<00:01:25.360> what<00:01:25.840> you're<00:01:25.990> doing<00:01:26.259> is<00:01:26.410> just

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
well because what you're doing is just

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.070 
well because what you're doing is just
activating<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.429> gluten<00:01:27.910> in<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.630> flour<00:01:28.660> in

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
activating the gluten in the flour in

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.080 
activating the gluten in the flour in
the<00:01:29.440> dough<00:01:29.470> so<00:01:30.039> that<00:01:30.190> it's<00:01:30.429> when<00:01:30.700> it<00:01:30.789> starts

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
the dough so that it's when it starts

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.210 
the dough so that it's when it starts
rising<00:01:31.330> up<00:01:31.660> it<00:01:31.810> rises<00:01:32.200> up<00:01:32.289> really<00:01:33.069> well

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.270 

okay<00:01:37.220> now<00:01:37.880> this<00:01:38.210> needs<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:38.930> sit<00:01:39.320> for<00:01:39.830> about<00:01:39.920> 12

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
okay now this needs to sit for about 12

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.550 
okay now this needs to sit for about 12
to<00:01:40.340> 15<00:01:40.700> minutes<00:01:40.850> so<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.630> East<00:01:41.840> does<00:01:42.290> all

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
to 15 minutes so that the East does all

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.670 
to 15 minutes so that the East does all
its<00:01:42.860> work<00:01:43.130> it<00:01:43.700> gets<00:01:44.030> risen<00:01:44.450> up<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:44.810> then<00:01:45.350> we're

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
its work it gets risen up and then we're

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.560 
its work it gets risen up and then we're
gonna<00:01:45.770> roll<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.010> out<00:01:46.190> and<00:01:46.490> make<00:01:47.000> it<00:01:47.030> into<00:01:47.360> a

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
gonna roll it out and make it into a

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.470 
gonna roll it out and make it into a
pizza<00:01:49.390> so<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.480> dough<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:50.860> soft<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:52.340> bit<00:01:53.060> risen

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
pizza so the dough is soft a bit risen

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.380 
pizza so the dough is soft a bit risen
we<00:01:53.960> need<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.170> handle<00:01:54.560> it<00:01:54.710> very<00:01:54.890> gently<00:01:55.370> and<00:01:55.850> now
