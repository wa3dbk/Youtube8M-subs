00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
shuffling trying to get my deck as I'm

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.250 
shuffling trying to get my deck as I'm
clumped<00:00:58.010> as<00:00:58.100> possible<00:00:58.989> what<00:00:59.989> you're<00:01:00.079> going<00:01:00.200> to

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
clumped as possible what you're going to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.689 
clumped as possible what you're going to
find<00:01:00.320> interesting<00:01:00.770> about<00:01:01.040> this<00:01:01.430> game<00:01:01.670> is<00:01:01.850> that

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
find interesting about this game is that

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.020 
find interesting about this game is that
despite<00:01:04.699> both<00:01:05.449> really<00:01:06.259> bad<00:01:06.469> starts<00:01:07.039> from<00:01:07.790> both

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
despite both really bad starts from both

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.109 
despite both really bad starts from both
of<00:01:08.060> us<00:01:08.530> I<00:01:09.940> got<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.390> last<00:01:11.630> bad<00:01:12.020> start<00:01:12.380> I<00:01:12.530> guess

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
of us I got the last bad start I guess

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.660 
of us I got the last bad start I guess
so<00:01:14.119> it<00:01:14.270> leads<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.750> a<00:01:14.780> pretty<00:01:15.470> unepic<00:01:16.100> and

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
so it leads to a pretty unepic and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.950 
so it leads to a pretty unepic and
anticlimactic<00:01:17.600> finals<00:01:18.530> but<00:01:19.630> there<00:01:20.630> are<00:01:20.659> some

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
anticlimactic finals but there are some

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.140 
anticlimactic finals but there are some
funny<00:01:21.290> scenes<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:22.010> I<00:01:22.250> think<00:01:22.820> you'll<00:01:22.970> still

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
funny scenes and I think you'll still

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.390 
funny scenes and I think you'll still
enjoy<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.659> and<00:01:24.650> so<00:01:25.159> uh<00:01:25.600> he's<00:01:26.600> obviously<00:01:27.400> gonna

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
enjoy it and so uh he's obviously gonna

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.120 
enjoy it and so uh he's obviously gonna
go<00:01:28.640> first<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:29.470> wouldn't<00:01:30.470> understand<00:01:30.830> why<00:01:30.979> he

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
go first I wouldn't understand why he

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.179 
go first I wouldn't understand why he
wouldn't<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:32.200> I<00:01:33.200> look<00:01:33.560> at<00:01:33.680> my<00:01:33.770> hand<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.100> I

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
wouldn't and I look at my hand and I

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.179 
wouldn't and I look at my hand and I
have<00:01:34.369> an<00:01:34.520> nth<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:34.909> fire<00:01:35.900> energy<00:01:36.380> mu2<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.930> DC<00:01:39.189> so

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
have an nth a fire energy mu2 and DC so

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.960 
have an nth a fire energy mu2 and DC so
um<00:01:40.549> I<00:01:40.880> mean<00:01:41.119> I<00:01:41.180> could<00:01:41.689> risk<00:01:42.759> promoting<00:01:43.759> them

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
um I mean I could risk promoting them

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.510 
um I mean I could risk promoting them
you<00:01:44.150> too<00:01:44.360> because<00:01:45.350> i<00:01:45.409> had<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.710> DC<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.220> hat<00:01:46.369> if

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
you too because i had the DC and hat if

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.060 
you too because i had the DC and hat if

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
have a receiver so this is just going to

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.480 
have a receiver so this is just going to
be<00:02:04.250> based<00:02:04.579> off<00:02:04.880> sheer<00:02:05.590> if<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.920> can<00:02:07.070> top<00:02:07.280> deck

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
be based off sheer if I can top deck

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.210 
be based off sheer if I can top deck
anything<00:02:07.850> or<00:02:07.970> not

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:35.059 

so<00:02:14.220> he<00:02:15.560> he<00:02:16.560> finally<00:02:17.010> gets<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.250> basic<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.730> believe

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.880 

so<00:02:36.060> yeah<00:02:36.599> he<00:02:36.780> commits<00:02:37.109> to<00:02:37.230> going<00:02:37.439> first<00:02:37.739> and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
so yeah he commits to going first and

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
huh I see shame and and that's probably

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.849 
huh I see shame and and that's probably
the<00:02:41.459> worst<00:02:41.760> starter<00:02:42.420> anyone<00:02:43.200> playing<00:02:43.409> my<00:02:43.620> deck

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
can see I mean like the main strategy to

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.589 
can see I mean like the main strategy to
go<00:02:46.889> against<00:02:47.280> my<00:02:47.430> deck<00:02:47.670> if<00:02:47.969> I<00:02:48.269> were<00:02:48.389> to<00:02:48.480> play

go against my deck if I were to play

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.390 
go against my deck if I were to play
against<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.989> would<00:02:49.079> be<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.349> shame<00:02:50.159> and<00:02:50.189> a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
against it would be the shame and a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.890 
against it would be the shame and a
bunch<00:02:50.609> of<00:02:50.700> energies<00:02:51.060> on<00:02:51.180> arm<00:02:51.359> you<00:02:51.540> too<00:02:51.750> and

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
smeargle is a really good starter so as

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.679

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:29.910 
far as i can tell i have no no base to
gauge<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.199> how<00:03:19.439> his<00:03:19.799> hand<00:03:20.069> is<00:03:20.250> right<00:03:20.459> now

the NK so far so I top deck a plus power

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.580 
the NK so far so I top deck a plus power
I<00:04:54.720> would<00:04:55.710> have<00:04:55.800> risked<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.280> burn<00:04:56.520> regardless

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
I would have risked the burn regardless

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.510 
I would have risked the burn regardless
but<00:04:58.590> it<00:04:58.800> just<00:04:58.950> helps<00:04:59.100> at<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:01.530> just<00:05:01.770> kill<00:05:02.070> the

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
but it just helps at to just kill the
