spot them and they'll get taken out very

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.699

like<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.129> do<00:02:59.250> with<00:02:59.400> mines<00:02:59.610> is<00:02:59.850> to<00:02:59.970> put<00:03:00.150> them

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
like to do with mines is to put them

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.090 
like to do with mines is to put them
just<00:03:00.480> off<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.780> side<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.260> roads<00:03:01.530> put

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
just off to the side of the roads put

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.309 
just off to the side of the roads put
them<00:03:02.220> in<00:03:02.310> cover<00:03:02.579> next<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.090> rubble<00:03:03.450> if<00:03:03.930> there's

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
them in cover next to rubble if there's

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.190 
them in cover next to rubble if there's
a<00:03:04.470> broken<00:03:04.829> building<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:06.359> put<00:03:06.569> them<00:03:06.690> close<00:03:06.930> as

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
a broken building you put them close as

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.590 
a broken building you put them close as
you<00:03:07.380> can<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.769> other<00:03:08.760> bits<00:03:09.030> in<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.329> environment

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
you can to other bits in the environment

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.449 
you can to other bits in the environment
so<00:03:10.319> they<00:03:10.350> can<00:03:10.560> be<00:03:10.650> disguised<00:03:11.010> it's<00:03:11.310> as<00:03:11.430> simple

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
so they can be disguised it's as simple

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.640 
so they can be disguised it's as simple
as<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.239> then<00:03:12.510> people<00:03:12.660> will<00:03:12.989> eventually

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
as that and then people will eventually

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.650 
as that and then people will eventually
hit<00:03:13.799> them<00:03:13.980> as<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.670> mentioned<00:03:15.030> earlier<00:03:15.329> some

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
hit them as you mentioned earlier some

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.360 
hit them as you mentioned earlier some
maps<00:03:15.930> such<00:03:16.170> as<00:03:16.350> caspian<00:03:16.739> border<00:03:16.769> do<00:03:17.160> feature

maps such as caspian border do feature

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.620 
maps such as caspian border do feature
quite<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.730> lot<00:03:17.880> of<00:03:17.910> aircraft<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.569> you

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
quite a lot of aircraft and you

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.729 
quite a lot of aircraft and you
mentioned<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.109> thing<00:03:19.350> is<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.560> best

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
mentioned that this thing is the best

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.620 
mentioned that this thing is the best
way<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:19.920> take<00:03:20.130> them<00:03:20.340> down<00:03:20.370> but<00:03:20.730> how<00:03:21.269> should<00:03:21.480> an

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
way to take them down but how should an

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.750 
way to take them down but how should an
engineer<00:03:22.019> use<00:03:22.260> this<00:03:22.440> thing<00:03:22.650> okay<00:03:23.549> well<00:03:23.700> the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
engineer use this thing okay well the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.949 
engineer use this thing okay well the
first<00:03:23.970> thing<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.150> need<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.359> do<00:03:24.569> is<00:03:24.780> have<00:03:24.900> a

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
first thing you need to do is have a

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.960 
first thing you need to do is have a
look<00:03:25.109> in<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.349> sky<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.859> watch<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.609> enemy

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
look in the sky and watch the enemy

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.809 
look in the sky and watch the enemy
aircraft<00:03:27.959> for<00:03:28.349> it<00:03:28.470> just<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.130> minute<00:03:29.310> or<00:03:29.489> so<00:03:29.519> not

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
aircraft for it just a minute or so not

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.940 
aircraft for it just a minute or so not
too<00:03:30.030> long<00:03:30.209> what<00:03:31.019> you're<00:03:31.139> looking<00:03:31.380> for<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.769> for

too long what you're looking for is for

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.770 
too long what you're looking for is for
them<00:03:32.069> to<00:03:32.310> either<00:03:32.609> pop<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:32.970> flares<00:03:33.239> or<00:03:33.420> use<00:03:33.630> the

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
them to either pop the flares or use the

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
once you've seen those that's when you

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.390 
once you've seen those that's when you
need<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.349> pull<00:03:43.500> out<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.620> Stinger<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.190> start

need to pull out the Stinger and start
tracking<00:03:44.819> that<00:03:44.940> aircraft<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:45.750> really<00:03:45.989> you

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
tracking that aircraft so really you

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.270 
tracking that aircraft so really you
want<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.319> catch<00:03:46.470> them<00:03:46.739> in<00:03:46.919> the<00:03:47.010> middle<00:03:47.220> of

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
want to catch them in the middle of

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.890 
want to catch them in the middle of
reloading<00:03:47.609> their<00:03:47.849> countermeasures<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.510> way

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
reloading their countermeasures that way

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.210 
reloading their countermeasures that way
you've<00:03:49.019> got<00:03:49.049> a<00:03:49.169> much<00:03:49.410> greater<00:03:49.590> chance<00:03:49.769> of

like<00:03:53.849> to<00:03:53.880> do<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.389> put<00:03:54.569> pressure<00:03:54.810> on

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
like to do is that you put pressure on

kill<00:04:14.600> and<00:04:14.810> getting<00:04:15.050> those<00:04:15.140> aircraft<00:04:15.530> at<00:04:15.650> the

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
kill and getting those aircraft at the

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.500 
kill and getting those aircraft at the
spot<00:04:15.950> so<00:04:16.610> we've<00:04:16.760> talked<00:04:16.940> about<00:04:17.060> destroying

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
spot so we've talked about destroying

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.509 
spot so we've talked about destroying
the<00:04:17.630> opposing<00:04:18.049> teams<00:04:18.290> vehicles<00:04:18.830> how<00:04:19.250> can<00:04:19.430> the

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
the opposing teams vehicles how can the

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.130 
the opposing teams vehicles how can the
engineer<00:04:19.820> support<00:04:20.150> his<00:04:20.239> own<00:04:20.390> teams<00:04:20.630> so<00:04:20.989> this

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
engineer support his own teams so this

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.810 
engineer support his own teams so this
is<00:04:21.170> where<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.769> engineer<00:04:22.130> class<00:04:22.280> really<00:04:22.640> comes

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
is where the engineer class really comes

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.910 
is where the engineer class really comes
into<00:04:23.030> its<00:04:23.150> own<00:04:23.450> I<00:04:23.720> firstly<00:04:24.290> as<00:04:24.440> an<00:04:24.560> engineer

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
like the said 11 and the Huey if you sit

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.060 
like the said 11 and the Huey if you sit
in<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.780> back<00:05:23.990> of<00:05:24.169> those<00:05:24.380> you<00:05:24.710> can<00:05:24.860> pull<00:05:24.980> out

in the back of those you can pull out
your<00:05:25.220> petal<00:05:25.640> angle<00:05:26.180> it<00:05:26.300> so<00:05:26.570> you're<00:05:26.690> facing

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
your petal angle it so you're facing

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.330 
your petal angle it so you're facing
toward<00:05:27.230> the<00:05:27.320> front<00:05:27.410> of<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.650> helicopter<00:05:28.190> and

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
you can fix from the inside so even

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.420 
you can fix from the inside so even
rockets<00:05:30.620> won't<00:05:30.919> be<00:05:30.980> able<00:05:31.070> to<00:05:31.160> take<00:05:31.310> down

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.490 
rockets won't be able to take down
Allison<00:05:31.880> so<00:05:32.419> the<00:05:32.600> repair<00:05:32.870> tool<00:05:33.050> doesn't<00:05:33.260> only

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
Allison so the repair tool doesn't only

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.900 
Allison so the repair tool doesn't only
heal<00:05:33.800> your<00:05:33.890> vehicles<00:05:34.340> you<00:05:34.430> can<00:05:34.460> have<00:05:34.669> a<00:05:34.730> bit<00:05:34.880> of
