00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.599
 Here is the priest music as I promised we take 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:22.590
 ordinary player mp3 player connector 35 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:29.279
 standard insert to put 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:34.670
 here squeaker here you here 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:38.340
 built-in amplifier cleans you up 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:43.579
 turns up the volume decreases here 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:48.890
 the toggle switch turns on the indicator lights up 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.890
 turn on the music so 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:58.010
 we lay down the player principle you can go 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.010
 add 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.490
 jean and what 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.170
 and 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.640
 has come 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.640
 I will show you how I built 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.270
 amplifier buy in the store 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.810
 computer carousel computer 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.560
 The prefix here is a pure drummer it was 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.299
 drummer in it was an amplifier by 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.030
 2 more tweeters cling 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:58.920
 standard speaker but with such a diameter 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.920
 that is, the amplifier is already in the moped 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:11.080
 Now I will show you how I built that 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:14.650
 there is a system the whole main amp circuit 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.780
 under the hood everything is very comfortable and 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.670
 securely here on the speakers here myself 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.620
 power knocking and but principle here 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.580
 nothing complicated is that dofig here 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.480
 wiring it 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:32.019
 day you do not get confused just write me 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.830
 in lichku I will explain to you how to connect something 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.440
 eat here 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.550
 I connected a transformer in this board 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.690
 he removed and made directly shorter 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.700
 adapted at 12 volts here is the circuit now 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.060
 I will explain to you 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:53.030
 here is the socket 220 years old that we do not understand 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.540
 because the transformer after the transformer 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.110
 goes 12 volts meaning it serves for 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:04.820
 lowering the voltage of these to your 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.430
 served on the amplifier circuit itself on there 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.380
 amplifier we are there it's cooler 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.480
 physics will delve wrong 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:17.090
 you take are watching these two wires 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.090
 which go from transformer to 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.470
 amp shorter cut 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:28.790
 throw back you should get 2 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:33.380
 wires to the battery and to whom 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.709
 amplifier it is your imagination on someone 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.709
 what garazd 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 or 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.650
 Athens is mounted very simply on the steering wheel 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.870
 customize speaker enclosure 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.740
 which I have recently set new 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.740
 dependently cold folding 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.650
 she is empty 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:52.360
 bass speaker so to speak we 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:55.830
 plastic glove box take a soldering iron here 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:59.940
 he looks like someone like that 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:03.010
 it's too healthy but powerful truth and 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:07.500
 measure the size of the mass dynamics 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:11.530
 and then evaporate of course not long 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:16.890
 toxic looks work but it is 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:19.330
 Worth once summoned measured later 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.169
 soldered in a circle until you have 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.150
 minutes 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.060
 affairs will not be you all can not 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.659
 keep working lose train 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.169
 your layout 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.169
 a crisis
