00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
wanted to achieve that look I think

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.050 
wanted to achieve that look I think
everyone<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.369> lifts<00:01:17.610> weights<00:01:17.790> once

everyone that really lifts weights once

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.510 
everyone that really lifts weights once
it<00:01:18.270> looks<00:01:18.479> somewhat<00:01:19.110> decent<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.250> think

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
