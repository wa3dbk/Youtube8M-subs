00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
with the griffin survivor case for the

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.749 
with the griffin survivor case for the
iphone<00:00:09.570> 5<00:00:09.840> reviewed<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.040> iphone<00:00:11.519> full

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
iphone 5 reviewed the iphone full

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.419 
iphone 5 reviewed the iphone full
version<00:00:12.090> not<00:00:12.240> long<00:00:12.389> ago<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.620> iphone<00:00:14.009> 5<00:00:14.250> is

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
version not long ago and the iphone 5 is

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.550 
version not long ago and the iphone 5 is
a<00:00:14.460> slightly<00:00:14.790> different<00:00:15.089> design<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.260> but

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
a slightly different design to it but

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.859 
a slightly different design to it but
the<00:00:16.590> principle<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.310> basically<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.000> same<00:00:18.029> so

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
the principle is basically the same so

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.390 
the principle is basically the same so
it's<00:00:18.990> been<00:00:19.109> designed<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.560> offer<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.890> maximum

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
it's been designed to offer the maximum

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.179 
it's been designed to offer the maximum
protection<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:21.150> your<00:00:21.180> iphone<00:00:21.660> 5<00:00:22.020> as<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.070> can

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
protection for your iphone 5 as you can

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.410 
protection for your iphone 5 as you can
see<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:23.430> got<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.670> belt<00:00:23.910> clip<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.390> back

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
see it's got this belt clip on the back

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.230 
see it's got this belt clip on the back
which<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.930> easily<00:00:25.170> removable<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.550> and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
which is easily removable like so and

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.970 
which is easily removable like so and
then<00:00:27.269> you're<00:00:27.630> left<00:00:27.720> with<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.990> actual<00:00:28.199> case<00:00:28.470> so

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
then you're left with the actual case so

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.500 
then you're left with the actual case so
basically<00:00:29.279> what<00:00:29.400> you've<00:00:29.550> got<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.970> there's<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
basically what you've got is there's a

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.389 
basically what you've got is there's a
hard<00:00:30.900> plastic<00:00:31.230> inner<00:00:31.679> shell<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.130> then<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
hard plastic inner shell and then a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.970 
hard plastic inner shell and then a
tough<00:00:32.640> rubber<00:00:33.030> outer<00:00:33.329> coating<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.770> shows

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
tough rubber outer coating so the shows

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.889 
tough rubber outer coating so the shows
in<00:00:35.190> two<00:00:35.280> parts<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.850> clip<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.090> phone<00:00:36.510> into

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
in two parts you clip your phone into

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.990 
in two parts you clip your phone into
the<00:00:36.930> bottom<00:00:37.440> part<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.860> shell<00:00:38.129> then<00:00:38.790> you

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
the bottom part of the shell then you

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.240 
the bottom part of the shell then you
attach<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.390> rubber<00:00:39.809> coating<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.770> then

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
attach the rubber coating to it and then

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.510 
attach the rubber coating to it and then
the<00:00:41.489> top<00:00:42.360> half<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> shell<00:00:43.320> clips<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the top half of the shell clips on and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.639 
the top half of the shell clips on and
keeps<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> rubber<00:00:45.210> coating<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.780> place<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
keeps the rubber coating in place it's a

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.860 
keeps the rubber coating in place it's a
smart<00:00:46.890> design<00:00:47.219> because<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.910> means<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
smart design because it means that the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.330 
smart design because it means that the
rubber<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.320> not<00:00:49.500> going<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.649> come<00:00:49.829> off<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.129> then

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
rubber is not going to come off and then

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.380 
rubber is not going to come off and then
the<00:00:50.399> shelves<00:00:50.700> aren't<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> come<00:00:51.149> apart

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the shelves aren't going to come apart

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.470 
the shelves aren't going to come apart
either<00:00:51.840> as<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.829> see<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.550> relatively

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
either as you can see it's a relatively

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.069 
either as you can see it's a relatively
bulky<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.140> say<00:00:55.699> but<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:56.969> nice<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.719> grippy<00:00:57.960> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
bulky I say but it's nice and grippy to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.080 
bulky I say but it's nice and grippy to
hold<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> fact<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.609> got<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> built-in

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
hold I like the fact it's got a built-in

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.029 
hold I like the fact it's got a built-in
screen<00:01:00.300> protector<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:00.960> there<00:01:01.199> which

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
screen protector on there which

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.529 
screen protector on there which
definitely<00:01:02.430> doesn't<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.120> way<00:01:03.210> of

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
definitely doesn't get in the way of

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.830 
definitely doesn't get in the way of
actually<00:01:03.960> operating<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.189> phone<00:01:05.400> at<00:01:05.580> all<00:01:05.840> and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the buttons on there the quite far away

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.370 
the buttons on there the quite far away
from<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.909> actual<00:01:12.000> edges<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> case<00:01:12.869> we've

moistures<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.420> don't<00:01:48.720> want<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.899> dunk<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.320> in

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
moistures you don't want to dunk it in

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.350 
moistures you don't want to dunk it in
water<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.130> withstand<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.909> fair

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
water but it can withstand in a fair

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.810 
water but it can withstand in a fair
amount<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.630> rain<00:01:51.899> dust<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:53.009> been<00:01:53.100> vibration

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
amount of rain dust it's been vibration

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.030 
amount of rain dust it's been vibration
tested<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.630> overall<00:01:55.470> designed<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.860> take<00:01:56.009> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
tested and overall designed to take a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.480 
tested and overall designed to take a
real<00:01:56.369> impact<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.149> not<00:01:57.420> damage<00:01:57.600> your<00:01:57.810> phone<00:01:58.490> 35

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
real impact and not damage your phone 35

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.760 
real impact and not damage your phone 35
pounds<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.630> bit<00:02:00.750> more<00:02:00.840> expensive<00:02:01.469> than

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
pounds so it's a bit more expensive than

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.830 
pounds so it's a bit more expensive than
most<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.490> your<00:02:02.610> iphone<00:02:02.909> 5<00:02:03.119> cases<00:02:03.450> out<00:02:03.780> there

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
most of your iphone 5 cases out there

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.530 
most of your iphone 5 cases out there
but<00:02:04.560> then<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.829> does<00:02:05.009> offer<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.399> fair<00:02:05.880> level

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
but then it does offer a fair level

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.779 
but then it does offer a fair level
extra<00:02:06.930> protection<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.009> if<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.520> don't<00:02:08.670> mind

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
extra protection so if you don't mind

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.699 
extra protection so if you don't mind
the<00:02:09.000> extra<00:02:09.119> size<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.869> you're<00:02:10.110> looking<00:02:10.259> for

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
the extra size and you're looking for

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.680 
the extra size and you're looking for
additional<00:02:11.520> protection<00:02:12.090> with<00:02:12.209> phone<00:02:12.450> if

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
additional protection with phone if

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.550 
additional protection with phone if
you're<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> bit<00:02:12.989> rough<00:02:13.200> with<00:02:13.230> it

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
you're a bit rough with it

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.870 
you're a bit rough with it
I<00:02:13.650> think<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.069> griffin<00:02:14.340> survivor<00:02:14.370> is

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
I think the griffin survivor is

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.830 
I think the griffin survivor is
definitely<00:02:15.209> worth<00:02:15.300> taking<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.599> look<00:02:15.630> at

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
definitely worth taking a look at

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.290 
definitely worth taking a look at
especially<00:02:15.930> as<00:02:16.560> it's<00:02:17.280> quite<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.819> bit<00:02:17.970> cheaper

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
especially as it's quite a bit cheaper

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.880 
especially as it's quite a bit cheaper
than<00:02:18.420> some<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.780> other<00:02:18.930> tough<00:02:19.260> cases<00:02:19.560> on

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
than some of the other tough cases on

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.130 
than some of the other tough cases on
the<00:02:20.099> market<00:02:20.550> which<00:02:21.270> gives<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.720> distinct

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
the market which gives it a distinct

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.199 
the market which gives it a distinct
advantage<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:23.099> that's<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.520> griffin<00:02:23.819> survivor

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
advantage so that's a griffin survivor

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.120 
advantage so that's a griffin survivor
for<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.750> iphone<00:02:25.020> 5<00:02:25.230> definitely<00:02:26.069> worth

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
for the iphone 5 definitely worth

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.010 
for the iphone 5 definitely worth
