00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.300 
have to play our best I guess not to
make<00:04:06.419> any<00:04:06.449> mistakes<00:04:07.169> I<00:04:07.470> think<00:04:07.889> we<00:04:08.010> can<00:04:08.159> win

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
make any mistakes I think we can win

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.420 
make any mistakes I think we can win
everyone<00:04:08.669> then<00:04:09.169> even<00:04:10.169> though<00:04:10.349> our<00:04:10.739> comp<00:04:11.099> isn't

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
everyone then even though our comp isn't

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.170 
everyone then even though our comp isn't
that<00:04:11.549> good<00:04:11.729> anymore<00:04:12.470> you<00:04:13.470> actually<00:04:14.400> like<00:04:14.849> your

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
that good anymore you actually like your

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.960 
that good anymore you actually like your
comp<00:04:15.419> has<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.320> become<00:04:16.889> less<00:04:17.159> strong<00:04:17.549> with<00:04:17.849> the

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
comp has it become less strong with the

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.270 
comp has it become less strong with the
resilience<00:04:18.479> changes<00:04:18.900> then<00:04:19.079> yeah<00:04:19.949> with

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
resilience changes then yeah with

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.399 
resilience changes then yeah with
resilience<00:04:20.789> changes<00:04:21.269> i<00:04:21.389> actually<00:04:21.989> think<00:04:22.169> it

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
resilience changes i actually think it

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.399 
resilience changes i actually think it
got<00:04:22.650> nerfed<00:04:22.889> and<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.760> case<00:04:24.029> I<00:04:24.750> really<00:04:25.260> bad

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
got nerfed and the case I really bad

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:26.660 
got nerfed and the case I really bad
mouth<00:04:25.680> so

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
mouth so

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.730 
mouth so
like<00:04:26.970> when<00:04:27.240> we<00:04:27.360> started<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.930> comedy<00:04:28.500> case

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
like when we started the comedy case

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.270 
like when we started the comedy case
were<00:04:29.210> like<00:04:30.210> really<00:04:30.780> good<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.410> skirt<00:04:31.920> strike

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
were like really good the skirt strike

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.550 
were like really good the skirt strike
was<00:04:32.580> hitting<00:04:32.970> for<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.210> lot<00:04:33.390> that's<00:04:34.320> why<00:04:34.530> we

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
was hitting for a lot that's why we

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.350 
was hitting for a lot that's why we
started<00:04:35.040> a<00:04:35.190> company<00:04:35.370> in<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.610> first<00:04:35.850> place<00:04:36.030> but

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
started a company in the first place but

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.960 
started a company in the first place but
it<00:04:37.350> got<00:04:37.560> no<00:04:37.770> stretched<00:04:38.160> out<00:04:38.400> pitch<00:04:38.730> after

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
it got no stretched out pitch after

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.380 
it got no stretched out pitch after
pitch<00:04:39.330> so<00:04:39.690> we<00:04:40.440> basically<00:04:40.620> have<00:04:41.040> 12<00:04:41.340> play<00:04:41.610> our

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
pitch so we basically have 12 play our

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.840 
pitch so we basically have 12 play our
opponents<00:04:42.960> like<00:04:43.140> twice<00:04:43.500> or<00:04:43.860> three<00:04:44.220> times<00:04:44.250> to

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
opponents like twice or three times to

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.220 
opponents like twice or three times to
in<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:45.950> so<00:04:46.970> and<00:04:47.970> obviously<00:04:48.330> you<00:04:48.420> got<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.110> play

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
in and so and obviously you got to play

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.630 
in and so and obviously you got to play
your<00:04:49.260> best<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.710> do<00:04:49.830> so<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:50.010> believe<00:04:50.400> that<00:04:50.520> you

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.240 
your best to do so you believe that you
can<00:04:50.670> do<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.210> what<00:04:51.750> comes<00:04:52.110> in<00:04:52.410> your<00:04:52.440> opinion

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
got a little bit stronger like what

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.830 
got a little bit stronger like what
teams<00:05:05.430> you<00:05:05.640> think<00:05:05.850> have<00:05:05.970> got<00:05:06.120> a<00:05:06.150> slightly<00:05:06.540> more
