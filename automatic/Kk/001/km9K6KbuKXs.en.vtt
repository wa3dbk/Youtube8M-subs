I've<00:00:48.300> got<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.629> switch<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:48.960> over<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.590> at<00:00:49.800> once

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
I've got to switch it over all at once

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
reason being look at the far side of the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.750 
reason being look at the far side of the
net<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.020> looks<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> net<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.010> open<00:00:59.520> over

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
net it looks like the net is open over

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.910 
net it looks like the net is open over
there<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.899> goalie<00:01:01.230> see<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.770> little

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
there but the goalie see that little

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.039 
there but the goalie see that little
triangle<00:01:02.309> between<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.120> goalies<00:01:03.510> head<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
triangle between the goalies head and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.630 
triangle between the goalies head and
the<00:01:04.199> top-left<00:01:04.710> corner<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> goal<00:01:05.580> here

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the top-left corner of the goal here

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.310 
the top-left corner of the goal here
I'll<00:01:05.850> make<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.060> even<00:01:06.270> more<00:01:06.420> obvious<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:06.960> you

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
I'll make it even more obvious for you

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.429 
I'll make it even more obvious for you
that's<00:01:07.680> where<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> puck<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.400> gonna<00:01:08.580> go<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
that's where the puck is gonna go and

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.469 
that's where the puck is gonna go and
when<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.710> hit<00:01:11.070> up<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.700> left<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
when you hit up and to the left on the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.300 
when you hit up and to the left on the
left<00:01:12.510> stick<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.140> really<00:01:13.619> want<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.950> pronounced

left stick you really want to pronounced
and<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.670> fact<00:01:14.880> your<00:01:15.180> skater<00:01:15.600> should<00:01:15.930> almost<00:01:16.049> be

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
and in fact your skater should almost be

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.380 
and in fact your skater should almost be
skating<00:01:16.740> up<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> left<00:01:17.759> away<00:01:18.150> from

their<00:01:18.509> shot<00:01:18.689> he<00:01:18.810> won't<00:01:19.049> because<00:01:19.500> there's

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
their shot he won't because there's

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.649 
their shot he won't because there's
momentum<00:01:19.950> carrying<00:01:20.610> them<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.880> way<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.270> you

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
momentum carrying them that way but you

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.510 
momentum carrying them that way but you
really<00:01:22.170> need<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> jam<00:01:22.770> hard<00:01:23.070> look<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.369> the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.280 
not always as as automatic as the first
shot<00:02:14.579> but<00:02:14.909> again<00:02:15.629> it's<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.930> very<00:02:16.310> devastating

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290

shot and an alternative again because

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.660 
shot and an alternative again because
maybe<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.359> defender<00:02:21.780> might<00:02:21.959> cut<00:02:22.260> across

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
maybe the defender might cut across

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.709

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
sure because I was kind of languishing

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.039

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
around at 500 and I started working

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.599 
around at 500 and I started working
there<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.349> this<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> same<00:02:37.950> game<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.549> you

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609

can<00:02:38.819> do<00:02:38.939> it<00:02:39.090> over<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.659> over<00:02:39.959> again<00:02:40.079> against

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
can do it over and over again against

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.229 
can do it over and over again against
the<00:02:40.769> opponent<00:02:41.250> doesn't<00:02:41.400> really<00:02:41.700> matter<00:02:41.939> if

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
the opponent doesn't really matter if

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.690 
the opponent doesn't really matter if
he's<00:02:42.359> gonna<00:02:42.510> give<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.079> this<00:02:43.260> area<00:02:43.590> around<00:02:44.489> the

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
dot or inside the hash mark you can hit

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:48.559 
dot or inside the hash mark you can hit
that<00:02:47.459> shot<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.879> is<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> different<00:02:48.450> game

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
that shot this is a different game

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.300 
that shot this is a different game
against<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.109> player<00:02:49.349> that<00:02:49.530> was<00:02:49.620> about<00:02:49.829> six

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
against the player that was about six

skill<00:02:50.819> levels<00:02:51.209> above<00:02:51.540> me<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.989> he<00:02:52.470> was<00:02:52.650> beating

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
skill levels above me and he was beating

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.610 
me he was up to nothing and these were
probably<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.219> only<00:02:56.310> two<00:02:56.639> shots<00:02:56.969> that<00:02:57.419> I<00:02:57.900> got

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.020 
close to I was able to tie the game and
eventually<00:03:01.079> win<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.409> so<00:03:01.620> again<00:03:02.040> practice<00:03:02.849> this

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030
