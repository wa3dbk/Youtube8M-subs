00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.060 
I think it like I think it tones down a
little<00:01:25.680> bit<00:01:25.860> later<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.869> overall<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.890> game

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
think the chances of running into one is

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.969 
think the chances of running into one is
like<00:06:13.740> one<00:06:14.460> in<00:06:14.729> four<00:06:15.150> thousand<00:06:15.690> and<00:06:15.900> as<00:06:16.800> I

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
like one in four thousand and as I

cyndaquil and as I stated there is a
little<00:07:11.620> bit<00:07:11.830> overpowered<00:07:12.580> so<00:07:13.090> my<00:07:13.420> cynical

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
little bit overpowered so my cynical

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.320 
little bit overpowered so my cynical
head<00:07:14.140> faster<00:07:14.770> speed<00:07:15.040> and<00:07:15.370> I<00:07:15.550> one<00:07:15.820> shot<00:07:16.120> his

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:19.870 
cyndaquil and what that does for me is

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.170 
cyndaquil and what that does for me is
it<00:07:19.960> raises<00:07:20.710> my<00:07:20.740> reputation<00:07:21.220> up<00:07:21.760> a<00:07:21.850> little<00:07:22.060> bit

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:22.180 
it raises my reputation up a little bit

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.120 
it raises my reputation up a little bit
and<00:07:22.330> then<00:07:22.390> this<00:07:22.660> person<00:07:22.870> you<00:07:23.380> know<00:07:23.500> tries<00:07:24.010> to
