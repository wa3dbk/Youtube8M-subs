00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.309 

well<00:00:01.220> alright<00:00:02.220> so<00:00:02.810> pre-flight<00:00:03.810> here<00:00:04.140> right

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
well alright so pre-flight here right

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.800 
well alright so pre-flight here right
now<00:00:04.470> just<00:00:04.740> check<00:00:04.920> out<00:00:05.250> all<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:06.060> motors<00:00:06.509> here

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
now just check out all the motors here

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.509 
now just check out all the motors here
no<00:00:06.990> stiff<00:00:07.319> motor<00:00:07.620> so<00:00:07.890> that's<00:00:08.099> good

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
no stiff motor so that's good

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.020 
no stiff motor so that's good
put<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.540> battery<00:00:09.900> pack<00:00:11.660> side<00:00:13.790> all<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.910> way

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
put the battery pack side all the way

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.410 
put the battery pack side all the way
down<00:00:16.130> so<00:00:17.130> there's<00:00:17.340> no<00:00:17.550> problem<00:00:18.180> with<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
down so there's no problem with the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:28.060 
down so there's no problem with the
weight<00:00:18.630> distribution<00:00:20.930> connect<00:00:21.930> it

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:36.580 

pull<00:00:28.699> the<00:00:28.910> wire<00:00:29.329> back<00:00:29.599> Hanna<00:00:34.600> all<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.989> just

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
pull the wire back Hanna all the just

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.119 
pull the wire back Hanna all the just
open<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:37.010> remote<00:00:37.600> travels<00:00:38.600> down<00:00:38.870> to<00:00:39.199> I'll

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
open the remote travels down to I'll

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.630 
open the remote travels down to I'll
pairing<00:00:42.460> spared

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
pairing spared

00:00:43.640 --> 00:01:03.990 
pairing spared
let's<00:00:43.879> check<00:00:44.089> the<00:00:44.239> trim<00:00:49.600> centered<00:00:51.640> centered

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.899 

all<00:01:05.140> calibration<00:01:06.140> of<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.590> accelerometer<00:01:07.520> in

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
all calibration of the accelerometer in

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:18.670 
all calibration of the accelerometer in
the<00:01:08.060> gyro<00:01:11.080> calibrate<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:14.210> put<00:01:14.450> up<00:01:14.540> I<00:01:14.630> go<00:01:17.680> so

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
the gyro calibrate it and put up I go so

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.160 
the gyro calibrate it and put up I go so
if<00:01:19.009> everything<00:01:19.460> is<00:01:19.880> what<00:01:20.180> good<00:01:20.420> experiencing

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
if everything is what good experiencing

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.760 
if everything is what good experiencing
is<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.350> quad<00:01:21.950> is<00:01:22.130> going<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.369> be<00:01:22.460> flying<00:01:23.770> fairly

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
is the quad is going to be flying fairly

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.770 
is the quad is going to be flying fairly
straight<00:01:25.280> for<00:01:25.640> beginning<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.390> then<00:01:26.540> going<00:01:26.750> to

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
straight for beginning and then going to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.620 
straight for beginning and then going to
start<00:01:27.020> drifting<00:01:27.729> already<00:01:28.729> drifting<00:01:29.240> towards

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
start drifting already drifting towards

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.320 
start drifting already drifting towards
fight<00:01:32.630> back<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:33.260> keep<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:33.650> up<00:01:33.940> and<00:01:34.940> just<00:01:35.090> keep

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
fight back to keep it up and just keep

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.550 
fight back to keep it up and just keep
going<00:01:35.659> forward<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:41.180> let's<00:01:41.210> try<00:01:41.780> another

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
going forward so let's try another

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:55.010 
going forward so let's try another
axilor<00:01:43.460> motor<00:01:43.720> calibration<00:01:48.970> calibrated

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.510 

going<00:01:55.710> forward

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.370 

very<00:02:01.090> hard<00:02:01.330> to<00:02:01.420> keep<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.810> back<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.930> also<00:02:05.080> been

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
very hard to keep it back it's also been

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.790 
very hard to keep it back it's also been
suggested<00:02:05.650> that<00:02:06.160> we<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:07.630> try<00:02:07.870> to<00:02:07.900> adjust<00:02:08.200> the

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
suggested that we can try to adjust the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.340 
suggested that we can try to adjust the
gyro<00:02:09.220> by<00:02:09.429> putting<00:02:09.789> some<00:02:10.030> some<00:02:10.780> paper<00:02:11.050> here<00:02:11.290> so

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
gyro by putting some some paper here so

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:25.760 
gyro by putting some some paper here so
I'm<00:02:11.530> going<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.710> try<00:02:11.920> that<00:02:13.470> recalibrate<00:02:23.490> we<00:02:24.490> go

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
I'm going to try that recalibrate we go

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.440 
I'm going to try that recalibrate we go
so<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:26.890> should<00:02:27.130> slide<00:02:27.430> back<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.790> little<00:02:28.060> bit<00:02:28.209> and

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
so it should slide back a little bit and

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:45.040 
so it should slide back a little bit and
then<00:02:28.660> I'm<00:02:29.110> going<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.440> drift<00:02:29.709> forward<00:02:29.950> again

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.930 

and<00:02:46.050> that's<00:02:46.290> pretty<00:02:46.470> much<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:47.480> do<00:02:48.480> what
