00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
towards the top and I couldn't do that

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.320 
towards the top and I couldn't do that
because<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:13.130> combination<00:02:13.400> for<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.000> color<00:02:14.180> is

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
because the combination for the color is

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.410 
because the combination for the color is
the<00:02:14.600> white<00:02:14.930> line<00:02:15.140> goes<00:02:15.350> in<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.560> middle<00:02:15.769> so<00:02:16.760> I

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
the white line goes in the middle so I

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.660 
the white line goes in the middle so I
couldn't<00:02:18.319> do<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:18.590> but<00:02:18.800> otherwise<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.489> Gran

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
couldn't do it but otherwise the Gran

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.000 
couldn't do it but otherwise the Gran
