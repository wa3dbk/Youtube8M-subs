looks like I haven't done anything yet

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.529 
looks like I haven't done anything yet
because<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.769> haven't<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.580> then<00:00:27.000> what<00:00:27.150> happens

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
because I haven't and then what happens

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
is you always say it's on the table but

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.220

before<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> get<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.390> chance<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.719> do<00:00:33.840> any<00:00:33.989> funny

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230

moves but that's already happened that's

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.030 
moves but that's already happened that's
phase<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:37.140> very<00:00:37.320> cool<00:00:37.590> because<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.920> so

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
phase one it's very cool because it's so

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.130 
phase one it's very cool because it's so
clean<00:00:38.340> now<00:00:38.520> phase<00:00:38.910> two<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.660> even<00:00:40.020> better

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
clean now phase two is even better

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.569 
clean now phase two is even better

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
because I'm going to make it look like

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.100 
because I'm going to make it look like
it's<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> be<00:00:42.059> easier<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.540> follow<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
