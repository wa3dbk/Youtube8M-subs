i think this last time I may have kept
it<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.840> too<00:01:16.080> long<00:01:16.110> or<00:01:16.740> or<00:01:17.670> something<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.299> don't

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
it in too long or or something I don't

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.170 
it in too long or or something I don't
know<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.170> broke<00:01:19.770> off<00:01:19.979> again<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.060> know

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
know but it broke off again you know

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.090 
know but it broke off again you know
this<00:01:21.509> side<00:01:21.780> which<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.080> prone<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.500> breaking<00:01:22.979> off

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
this side which is prone to breaking off

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.249 
this side which is prone to breaking off
apparently<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:24.330> broke<00:01:24.540> my<00:01:24.689> hair<00:01:24.869> off<00:01:24.990> really

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
asked her to keep the length that I had

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.899 
asked her to keep the length that I had
previously<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.530> back<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.369> know

previously in the back so you know
hopefully<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.390> could<00:02:00.630> still<00:02:00.899> allow<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.200> part

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
hopefully I could still allow that part

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.870 
hopefully I could still allow that part
to<00:02:01.829> grow<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.939> know<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> side<00:02:03.450> part<00:02:04.280> but<00:02:05.280> again

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
to grow you know the side part but again

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.280 
to grow you know the side part but again
like<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.180> said<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.420> mean<00:02:06.689> at<00:02:06.840> least<00:02:06.869> now<00:02:07.229> we'll

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
like I said I mean at least now we'll

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.779 
like I said I mean at least now we'll
really<00:02:07.740> be<00:02:07.799> able<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.069> track<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.399> growth

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
really be able to track the growth

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.780 
really be able to track the growth
because<00:02:09.300> now<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.539> try<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.459> track<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.610> growth

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
because now I try to track the growth

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.309 
because now I try to track the growth
with<00:02:11.970> mineral<00:02:12.330> oil<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.900> my<00:02:13.050> hair

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
with mineral oil with my hair

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.520 
with mineral oil with my hair
cut<00:02:13.560> now<00:02:13.769> and<00:02:14.269> you<00:02:15.269> know<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.689> if<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.049> start

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
cut now and you know so if you start

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.440 
cut now and you know so if you start
seeing<00:02:16.769> my<00:02:17.010> hair<00:02:17.219> down<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.609> here<00:02:17.909> in<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.209> month

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
seeing my hair down to here in a month

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.899 
seeing my hair down to here in a month
then<00:02:19.200> we'd<00:02:19.439> really<00:02:19.859> really<00:02:20.189> be<00:02:20.340> able<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.609> gauge

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
then we'd really really be able to gauge

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.660 
then we'd really really be able to gauge
how<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.359> mineral<00:02:21.780> growth<00:02:21.989> mineral<00:02:22.769> rich<00:02:23.189> has

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
how the mineral growth mineral rich has

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.149 
how the mineral growth mineral rich has
been<00:02:23.849> working<00:02:24.209> I<00:02:24.749> only<00:02:25.499> say<00:02:25.769> that<00:02:25.799> because

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
been working I only say that because

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.619 
been working I only say that because
when<00:02:26.519> I<00:02:26.549> started<00:02:27.030> taking<00:02:27.180> mineral-rich

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
when I started taking mineral-rich

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.199 
when I started taking mineral-rich

before I just finished Hairfinity so it

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.390 
before I just finished Hairfinity so it
was<00:02:30.420> almost<00:02:30.569> like<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.739> was<00:02:31.859> a<00:02:31.950> mix<00:02:32.250> between

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
was almost like it was a mix between

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.179 
was almost like it was a mix between

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
mineral rich or is it just the mineral
