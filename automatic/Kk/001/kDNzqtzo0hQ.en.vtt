cheese<00:00:18.869> paradiddle<00:00:20.660> very<00:00:21.660> similar<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.350> I

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
cheese paradiddle very similar to I

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.200 
cheese paradiddle very similar to I
guess<00:00:23.430> what<00:00:23.550> you'd<00:00:23.670> call<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.850> cheese

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
guess what you'd call a cheese

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.300 
guess what you'd call a cheese
paradiddle<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.350> we're<00:00:25.650> taking<00:00:26.160> a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
paradiddle and that we're taking a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.220 
paradiddle and that we're taking a
paradiddle<00:00:26.640> right<00:00:27.029> left<00:00:27.300> right<00:00:27.449> right<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
paradiddle right left right right and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.410 
paradiddle right left right right and
then<00:00:28.980> we're<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.310> cheese<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:30.090> first

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
then we're going to cheese that first

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.049 
then we're going to cheese that first
note<00:00:31.250> but<00:00:32.250> here<00:00:32.430> we're<00:00:32.550> going<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.700> put<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
note but here we're going to put the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.700 
note but here we're going to put the
blue<00:00:33.450> cheese<00:00:33.750> instead<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.410> standard

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
blue cheese instead of the standard

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.750 
blue cheese instead of the standard
cheese<00:00:35.360> so<00:00:36.860> we<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> paradiddle

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.700 

alright<00:00:44.760> normally<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> cheese<00:00:46.200> paradiddle

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
alright normally for a cheese paradiddle

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.110 
alright normally for a cheese paradiddle
I<00:00:46.770> would<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.100> simply<00:00:47.340> choose<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.850> first

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.360 
I would just simply choose that first

first well not the case with this

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.800 
first well not the case with this
rudiment<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:04.030> want<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.300> bring<00:02:04.450> it<00:02:04.570> much

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
further down so that way you can be

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.650 
further down so that way you can be
ready<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.660> play<00:02:07.900> as<00:02:08.110> a<00:02:08.140> grace<00:02:08.530> note<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:13.330> has

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
you have a very tight diddle followed by

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.290 
you have a very tight diddle followed by
a<00:02:18.250> very<00:02:19.030> open<00:02:19.540> diddle<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.670> if<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.820> play<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.180> the

that<00:04:02.069> we're<00:04:02.190> going<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.340> use<00:04:02.580> when<00:04:02.819> it's<00:04:03.000> fast

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
that we're going to use when it's fast

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.520 
that we're going to use when it's fast
so<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.280> little<00:04:05.640> bit<00:04:05.730> higher<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.780> louder<00:04:06.959> grace

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
so a little bit higher and louder grace

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.630 
so a little bit higher and louder grace

you for the techniques that are required
when<00:04:13.410> it's<00:04:13.560> when<00:04:13.739> it's<00:04:13.769> quick

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.270 

they<00:04:28.050> really<00:04:28.260> have<00:04:28.350> a<00:04:28.380> unique<00:04:28.500> look<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:29.100> sound

they really have a unique look and sound
to<00:04:29.520> them<00:04:29.670> so<00:04:30.360> now<00:04:30.510> I'll<00:04:30.690> do<00:04:30.930> an<00:04:31.050> exercise<00:04:31.530> that

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
to them so now I'll do an exercise that

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.430 
to them so now I'll do an exercise that
will<00:04:32.040> demonstrate<00:04:32.780> this<00:04:33.780> paradiddle

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
will demonstrate this paradiddle

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.410 
will demonstrate this paradiddle
rudiment<00:04:35.100> here<00:04:35.310> I'm<00:04:35.700> going<00:04:35.910> to<00:04:35.970> go<00:04:36.060> back<00:04:36.240> and

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
rudiment here I'm going to go back and

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.590 
rudiment here I'm going to go back and
forth<00:04:36.690> between<00:04:37.430> some<00:04:38.430> blue<00:04:38.670> cheese<00:04:38.700> which<00:04:39.420> are

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
paradiddles which are our grouping of

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.550 
paradiddles which are our grouping of
four<00:04:44.370> so<00:04:45.150> you'll<00:04:45.540> hear<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.990> note<00:04:46.170> value

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
four so you'll hear the note value

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.320 
four so you'll hear the note value
speed-up<00:04:47.070> I'm<00:04:47.280> going<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.490> go<00:04:47.580> from<00:04:47.760> triplets

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
speed-up I'm going to go from triplets

speed-up I'm going to go from triplets
that<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:49.020> depth<00:04:49.290> at<00:04:49.440> sixteen<00:04:50.130> notes<00:04:50.360> Dada

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
that the depth at sixteen notes Dada

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.960 
that the depth at sixteen notes Dada
Dada<00:04:51.630> well<00:04:52.440> put<00:04:52.680> in<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:52.920> blue<00:04:53.220> cheese<00:04:53.550> on<00:04:53.850> the

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
Dada well put in that blue cheese on the

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:09.420 
Dada well put in that blue cheese on the
first<00:04:54.240> note

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:39.130 

little<00:05:10.430> flower<00:05:26.290> and<00:05:27.290> a<00:05:27.950> little<00:05:28.160> faster<00:05:38.140> you

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
little flower and a little faster you

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.780 
little flower and a little faster you
can<00:05:39.290> also<00:05:39.440> play<00:05:39.830> it<00:05:39.860> where<00:05:40.130> the<00:05:40.280> note<00:05:40.460> value

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
can also play it where the note value

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.160 
can also play it where the note value
doesn't<00:05:41.030> change<00:05:41.180> and<00:05:41.810> I'm<00:05:41.870> not<00:05:42.020> necessarily

going from triplets to sixteenth notes

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.310 
going from triplets to sixteenth notes
but<00:05:44.450> I'll<00:05:44.540> just<00:05:44.570> keep<00:05:44.900> a<00:05:45.050> consistent

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
underlying ostinato of notes and I'll

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.510 
underlying ostinato of notes and I'll
just<00:05:50.690> do<00:05:50.840> three<00:05:51.260> and<00:05:51.530> then<00:05:51.800> five<00:05:52.070> same

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
just do three and then five same

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.580 
just do three and then five same
exercise<00:05:53.060> but<00:05:53.090> I'm<00:05:53.420> not<00:05:53.540> going<00:05:53.720> to<00:05:53.750> modulate

then<00:06:48.910> I<00:06:48.940> have<00:06:49.150> it<00:06:49.270> into<00:06:49.480> a<00:06:49.540> five-level<00:06:55.110> so<00:06:56.110> the

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:56.320 
then I have it into a five-level so the

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.380 
then I have it into a five-level so the
possibilities<00:06:57.160> are<00:06:57.190> really<00:06:57.310> endless<00:06:57.520> when

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.390 
possibilities are really endless when

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.240 
possibilities are really endless when
you<00:06:58.540> talk<00:06:58.960> about<00:06:59.170> this<00:06:59.290> technique<00:06:59.710> because

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.250 
you talk about this technique because

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.980 
you talk about this technique because
there's<00:07:00.400> a<00:07:00.460> lot<00:07:00.610> of<00:07:00.640> pre-existing<00:07:01.480> rudiments

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990 
there's a lot of pre-existing rudiments

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.800 
there's a lot of pre-existing rudiments
that<00:07:02.170> you<00:07:02.320> can<00:07:02.530> substitute<00:07:03.100> your<00:07:04.000> cheese<00:07:04.360> with

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
that you can substitute your cheese with

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.860 
that you can substitute your cheese with
the<00:07:05.650> blue<00:07:05.860> cheese<00:07:05.970> so<00:07:06.970> there's<00:07:07.150> a<00:07:07.240> lot<00:07:07.690> of

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
the blue cheese so there's a lot of

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.920 
the blue cheese so there's a lot of
potential<00:07:09.180> ideas<00:07:10.180> that<00:07:10.390> you<00:07:10.480> could<00:07:10.630> come<00:07:10.780> up

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
potential ideas that you could come up

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.110 
potential ideas that you could come up
with<00:07:11.080> them<00:07:11.350> really<00:07:11.950> looking<00:07:12.820> forward<00:07:13.030> to

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 
with them really looking forward to

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.350 
with them really looking forward to
seeing<00:07:13.360> what<00:07:13.600> other<00:07:14.110> people<00:07:14.200> come<00:07:14.590> up<00:07:14.620> with

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
seeing what other people come up with

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.580 
seeing what other people come up with
we're<00:07:16.360> going<00:07:16.450> to<00:07:16.510> do<00:07:16.660> some<00:07:16.840> more<00:07:16.960> videos<00:07:17.350> in

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:17.590 
we're going to do some more videos in

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.650 
we're going to do some more videos in
this<00:07:17.740> sequence<00:07:18.130> -<00:07:18.460> another<00:07:19.180> one<00:07:19.360> called<00:07:19.570> the

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:19.660 
this sequence - another one called the

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.390 
this sequence - another one called the
inverted<00:07:20.230> inverted<00:07:20.410> cheese<00:07:20.980> is<00:07:21.130> going<00:07:21.220> to<00:07:21.340> be

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 
inverted inverted cheese is going to be

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.310 
inverted inverted cheese is going to be
coming<00:07:21.610> up<00:07:21.700> soon<00:07:21.730> that's<00:07:22.450> a<00:07:22.630> pretty

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:23.320 
coming up soon that's a pretty

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.870 
coming up soon that's a pretty
challenging<00:07:23.560> one<00:07:23.980> so<00:07:24.220> stay<00:07:24.520> tuned<00:07:24.700> for<00:07:24.730> that

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 
challenging one so stay tuned for that

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.000
