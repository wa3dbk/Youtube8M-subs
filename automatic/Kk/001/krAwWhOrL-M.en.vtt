I'm not exactly sure where today's run
is<00:00:06.740> going<00:00:06.890> to<00:00:06.950> take<00:00:07.129> us<00:00:07.339> but<00:00:07.580> I<00:00:07.609> can<00:00:07.850> tell<00:00:08.060> you

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
that it starts with a ferry ride across

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.120 
that it starts with a ferry ride across
the<00:00:10.940> river<00:00:11.469> somewhere<00:00:12.469> over<00:00:12.679> the<00:00:12.769> other<00:00:12.889> side

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
the river somewhere over the other side

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.860 
the river somewhere over the other side
is<00:00:13.370> where<00:00:13.549> we'll<00:00:13.700> be<00:00:13.730> running<00:00:14.120> with<00:00:14.269> a<00:00:14.360> private

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
is where we'll be running with a private

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:29.450 
is where we'll be running with a private
bill

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.760 

the<00:00:30.180> basic<00:00:30.570> concept<00:00:30.750> with<00:00:32.030> Harry<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.210> he<00:00:33.360> is

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
the basic concept with Harry is he is

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.310 
the basic concept with Harry is he is
someone<00:00:34.770> goes<00:00:34.920> out<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.190> day<00:00:35.340> before<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> run

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
someone goes out the day before the run

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.560 
someone goes out the day before the run
marks<00:00:37.320> out<00:00:37.470> of<00:00:37.500> course<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> day<00:00:38.570> no

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
marks out of course but on the day no

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.320 
marks out of course but on the day no
one<00:00:39.720> really<00:00:40.080> knows<00:00:40.230> exactly<00:00:40.500> which<00:00:40.890> way<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.190> is

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
one really knows exactly which way it is

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.100 
one really knows exactly which way it is
so<00:00:42.330> there's<00:00:42.830> every<00:00:43.830> time<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.160> get<00:00:44.310> to<00:00:44.489> a

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
so there's every time you get to a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.180 
so there's every time you get to a
intersection<00:00:46.110> people<00:00:46.650> go<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:46.980> every

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
intersection people go up in every

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.520 
intersection people go up in every
direction<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.610> look<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.840> markings<00:00:49.290> that

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
direction to look for the markings that

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.740 
direction to look for the markings that
show<00:00:50.040> it<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> correct<00:00:50.730> way<00:00:51.020> so<00:00:52.670> sometimes

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
show it is a correct way so sometimes

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.320 
show it is a correct way so sometimes
the<00:00:54.750> faster<00:00:55.140> runners<00:00:55.410> who<00:00:55.530> check<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.890> out<00:00:56.040> go

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
the faster runners who check that out go

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.000 
the faster runners who check that out go
the<00:00:57.330> right<00:00:57.510> way<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.140> sometimes<00:00:58.379> they<00:00:58.650> go<00:00:58.770> run

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the right way and sometimes they go run

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.690 
the right way and sometimes they go run
away<00:00:59.360> today<00:01:00.360> we<00:01:00.770> come<00:01:01.770> across<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.190> beacon<00:01:02.520> on

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
away today we come across the beacon on
