and it's making the whole shooting match

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.690 
and it's making the whole shooting match
even<00:03:27.240> tighter<00:03:27.630> on<00:03:27.990> that<00:03:28.440> round<00:03:28.710> item<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.520> more

is only about here I can't get that part
out<00:05:37.570> so<00:05:38.050> it's<00:05:38.260> going<00:05:39.250> to<00:05:39.310> be<00:05:39.430> really<00:05:39.730> difficult

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
out so it's going to be really difficult

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.550 
out so it's going to be really difficult
to<00:05:40.390> put<00:05:40.750> a<00:05:40.810> hack<00:05:41.110> saw<00:05:41.440> down<00:05:42.100> there<00:05:42.130> and<00:05:42.670> saw<00:05:43.360> it

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
to put a hack saw down there and saw it

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.010 
to put a hack saw down there and saw it
so<00:05:44.560> this<00:05:45.070> one<00:05:45.310> might<00:05:45.490> require<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.810> heat

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
so this one might require the heat

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.400 
so this one might require the heat
wrench<00:05:47.850> this<00:05:48.850> one<00:05:49.120> might<00:05:49.360> require<00:05:49.810> the<00:05:50.230> old

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
wrench this one might require the old

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.600 
wrench this one might require the old
blowtorch<00:05:51.100> which<00:05:51.400> we<00:05:51.610> will<00:05:51.880> get<00:05:52.090> into<00:05:53.610> right

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
blowtorch which we will get into right

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.090 
blowtorch which we will get into right
now<00:05:55.050> we're<00:05:56.050> going<00:05:56.140> to<00:05:56.200> take<00:05:56.410> this<00:05:56.590> down<00:05:56.860> it's

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
now we're going to take this down it's

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.530 
now we're going to take this down it's
been<00:05:57.250> soaking<00:05:57.520> for<00:05:57.700> a<00:05:57.910> while<00:05:58.120> we're<00:05:58.330> going<00:05:58.450> to

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
been soaking for a while we're going to

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.780 
been soaking for a while we're going to
set<00:05:58.720> ourselves<00:05:58.870> up<00:05:59.380> we're<00:06:00.280> gonna<00:06:00.370> have<00:06:00.610> three

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
set ourselves up we're gonna have three

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.880 
set ourselves up we're gonna have three
two<00:06:01.180> people<00:06:01.540> hold<00:06:01.720> it<00:06:01.870> in<00:06:01.960> one<00:06:02.140> person<00:06:02.560> turn<00:06:02.740> it

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
two people hold it in one person turn it

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:03.960 
two people hold it in one person turn it
we're<00:06:03.040> gonna<00:06:03.130> see<00:06:03.310> if<00:06:03.370> we<00:06:03.460> could<00:06:03.580> turn<00:06:03.760> this

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
we're gonna see if we could turn this

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:04.590 
we're gonna see if we could turn this
out<00:06:04.150> of<00:06:04.300> here

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
out of here

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.290 
out of here
that's<00:06:05.320> the<00:06:05.560> first<00:06:05.770> step<00:06:06.100> I<00:06:06.340> have<00:06:06.730> soaked<00:06:07.060> it

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
that's the first step I have soaked it

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.230 
that's the first step I have soaked it
oh<00:06:08.040> there<00:06:09.040> was<00:06:09.160> a<00:06:09.190> tube<00:06:09.640> water<00:06:09.880> bottle

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
oh there was a tube water bottle

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.810 
oh there was a tube water bottle
braylon's<00:06:10.660> here<00:06:10.840> I<00:06:11.220> undid<00:06:12.220> this<00:06:12.430> one<00:06:12.640> and

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
braylon's here I undid this one and

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.030 
braylon's here I undid this one and
poured<00:06:13.060> it<00:06:13.180> down<00:06:13.390> and<00:06:13.840> let<00:06:14.290> it<00:06:14.380> soak<00:06:14.560> that<00:06:14.800> way

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
poured it down and let it soak that way

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.940 
poured it down and let it soak that way
I've<00:06:15.550> separated<00:06:16.420> out<00:06:16.930> the<00:06:17.110> frame<00:06:17.410> a<00:06:17.440> little

some spots to be able to put some

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.950 
some spots to be able to put some
penetrant<00:06:28.750> down<00:06:28.930> the<00:06:29.140> slot<00:06:29.640> um<00:06:30.640> oh<00:06:31.240> one<00:06:31.780> of<00:06:31.810> the
