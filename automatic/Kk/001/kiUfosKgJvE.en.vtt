 Kisses 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.540
 and good girls, I'll start by placing a 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.540
 First of all my mobile eyelid 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.970
 and he is my friend 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:47.180
 and now I will take this palette of 120 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.780
 colors and take this light pink color 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.600
 mate and I will use it as a color 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:58.960
 I'm going to blur it very well 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.960
 to go creating the transition of colors 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.780
 now I will take this golden shade 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.420
 and I will place it on my eyelid 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.750
 mobile and good girls excuse me that in 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:28.990
 this video I got too much of the 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:33.100
 I did not notice the picture and well 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.650
 for the next one it will not be that good now 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.960
 take this purple color and I will continue 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.140
 working with the transition of colors 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:44.770
 I'm going to blur it, I do not want it to 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.600
 see something very marked but go creating the 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.600
 color transition nothing more 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.540
 in English 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.540
 that day before 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:03.769
 now I will take this purple color a lot 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:07.680
 stronger and with a brush in pencil or 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:10.249
 if in as the pencil I will be marking my 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.249
 basin 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.230
 and well I'm going to start blurring 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.400
 and well, if necessary, he helped me with the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:32.420
 previous purple shade that I used and I 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.300
 helped blur that purple or 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.760
 that purple and good too if it's 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.280
 necessary again I mark it again 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.540
 and I'm blurring it a little bit with the 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.010
 Same brush so you can not see lines 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.909
 marked out there 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:56.239
 now take this golden super clarito and 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:56.239
 I'm going to seal my shadow in golden cream 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.970
 now I will take the purple clarito and I will 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.910
 to place on my lower lashes 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.010
 blurring it very well to go creating 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.110
 again the transition in my eyelashes 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.980
 lower 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.980
 they fall 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:27.690
 and now I take the darker purple and 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:31.710
 again I mark my tabs again 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.710
 lower to create a more effect 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.780
 smoked on the bottom and how they 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.569
 I say apologize for leaving me so much 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.419
 picture now I'm going to take a shadow 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.570
 clarita and I will light the little bone of 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.420
 my eyebrows 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.060
 to that 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.889
 and if necessary I go back to blur 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.330
 again 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:59.870
 and now I will take a shadow as color 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:02.539
 very short champagne and I will light up my 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.560
 Tear so my eye looks more 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:07.770
 open 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.050
 now I'm going to outline and I'm going to put 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.560
 several layers of mask and I come back with 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.560

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.659

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.590
 a purple 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.880
