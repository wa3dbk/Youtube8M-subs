once<00:00:05.029> upon<00:00:05.479> a<00:00:05.540> time<00:00:05.660> there<00:00:06.559> was<00:00:06.649> a<00:00:06.710> very

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
once upon a time there was a very

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.550 
once upon a time there was a very
special<00:00:07.550> building<00:00:07.970> filled<00:00:08.570> with<00:00:08.840> people<00:00:09.139> who

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:09.560 
special building filled with people who

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.680 
special building filled with people who
did<00:00:09.710> very<00:00:10.040> special<00:00:10.640> things<00:00:10.910> called

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
did very special things called

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.380 
did very special things called
proteomics<00:00:12.560> which<00:00:13.460> did<00:00:13.700> a<00:00:13.730> lot<00:00:13.910> of<00:00:13.940> good<00:00:14.180> for

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:14.390 
proteomics which did a lot of good for

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.570 
proteomics which did a lot of good for
the<00:00:14.450> world<00:00:14.480> but<00:00:15.410> it<00:00:15.890> seemed<00:00:16.160> there<00:00:16.309> were<00:00:16.400> only

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
the world but it seemed there were only

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.329 
the world but it seemed there were only
two<00:00:16.970> ways<00:00:17.210> of<00:00:17.390> getting<00:00:17.539> things<00:00:17.810> done<00:00:17.960> one<00:00:18.829> from

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:19.339 
two ways of getting things done one from

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.040 
two ways of getting things done one from
the<00:00:19.429> bottom<00:00:19.759> artery<00:00:20.089> and<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.539> other<00:00:20.689> from<00:00:20.960> the

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
the bottom artery and the other from the

the bottom artery and the other from the
top<00:00:21.289> down<00:00:21.589> and<00:00:22.339> so<00:00:22.609> the<00:00:22.999> building<00:00:23.210> was<00:00:23.449> divided

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
top down and so the building was divided

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.859 
top down and so the building was divided
into<00:00:24.050> two<00:00:24.409> very<00:00:24.829> distinct<00:00:25.640> groups<00:00:25.909> the<00:00:26.509> bottom

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
into two very distinct groups the bottom

because of the high resolution
separations<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:53.239> ability<00:00:53.690> to

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
the top down he checked his to-do list

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.150 
the top down he checked his to-do list
top<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.480> bottom<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:18.020> he<00:01:18.500> loved<00:01:18.710> riding<00:01:18.950> the

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
top to bottom and he loved riding the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.400 
top to bottom and he loved riding the
elevator<00:01:19.490> down<00:01:20.090> to<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.540> cafeteria<00:01:21.170> for<00:01:21.350> lunch

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
elevator down to the cafeteria for lunch

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.510 
elevator down to the cafeteria for lunch
with<00:01:22.280> Dave<00:01:22.780> everything<00:01:23.780> was<00:01:24.080> top<00:01:24.410> down<00:01:24.710> but

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
with Dave everything was top down but

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.220 
with Dave everything was top down but
this<00:01:25.730> was<00:01:25.880> perfect<00:01:26.300> since<00:01:26.480> he<00:01:26.660> was<00:01:26.780> interested

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
this was perfect since he was interested

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.930 
this was perfect since he was interested
in<00:01:27.260> answering<00:01:27.860> more<00:01:27.980> clinical<00:01:28.520> questions

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
in answering more clinical questions

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.580 
in answering more clinical questions
that<00:01:29.090> required<00:01:29.480> larger<00:01:29.930> numbers<00:01:30.230> of<00:01:30.260> samples

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
that required larger numbers of samples

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.620 
that required larger numbers of samples
so<00:01:31.310> he<00:01:31.430> preferred<00:01:31.760> using<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.240> method<00:01:32.540> of

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
so he preferred using a method of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.330 
so he preferred using a method of
biomarker<00:01:33.350> discovery<00:01:33.500> with<00:01:34.070> a<00:01:34.100> high

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
biomarker discovery with a high

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.940 
biomarker discovery with a high
throughput<00:01:34.670> high<00:01:35.000> sensitivity<00:01:35.630> approach<00:01:36.170> but

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
throughput high sensitivity approach but

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.280 
throughput high sensitivity approach but
alas<00:01:37.250> they<00:01:38.090> still<00:01:38.510> didn't<00:01:38.870> have<00:01:38.960> a<00:01:39.020> good

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
alas they still didn't have a good

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
alas they still didn't have a good
method<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:39.890> ID<00:01:40.540> potential<00:01:41.540> biomarkers<00:01:42.310> still

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
method to ID potential biomarkers still

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.790 
method to ID potential biomarkers still
both<00:01:43.850> methods<00:01:44.330> had<00:01:44.630> their<00:01:44.840> advantages<00:01:45.380> and

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
both methods had their advantages and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.180 
both methods had their advantages and

both friend Dave into the elevator and

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.020 
both friend Dave into the elevator and
push<00:01:51.470> their<00:01:51.680> buttons<00:01:51.890> at<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.340> exact<00:01:52.700> same

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
push their buttons at the exact same

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.440 
push their buttons at the exact same
time<00:01:53.450> at<00:01:54.230> that<00:01:54.500> precise<00:01:55.070> moment<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:56.000> elevator

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
time at that precise moment the elevator

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.620 
time at that precise moment the elevator
shook<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:57.020> terrible<00:01:57.890> shape<00:01:58.190> Fred<00:01:59.120> and<00:01:59.390> Dave

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
shook a terrible shape Fred and Dave

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.980 
shook a terrible shape Fred and Dave
looked<00:01:59.990> at<00:02:00.170> each<00:02:00.320> other<00:02:00.500> with<00:02:00.740> fear<00:02:01.070> and

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
looked at each other with fear and

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.230 
looked at each other with fear and
and<00:02:02.770> that's<00:02:03.040> when<00:02:03.250> something<00:02:03.729> totally

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
and that's when something totally
