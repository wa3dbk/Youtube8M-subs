 I majored who was 3 years 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.670
 age and not to work at face to face 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.100
 first bmx track I was taking when 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.900
 I was bored and it was I think love 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.930
 first sight they gave me my first 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.460
 bicycle this Christmas that had the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.860
 auxiliary rear wheel I learned 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.930
 super fast and after my first time 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.780
 is that I started already in what is the bmx in 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.320
 a track was the track to the western in 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.770
 his first Christmas we bought him a 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.130
 bicycle had two wheels at 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.500
 sides and it seems that it did not make many 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.870
 thank you have these two wheels and he 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.190
 I just wanted to be without any help 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.620
 and I remember that he spent practicing and 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.269
 practicing alone 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:31.470
 the relatives of the usa and they saw him 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:35.400
 that had attitudes from that age 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.190
 and from there it started there would never have been 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.470
 thought he was going to be a sportsman of 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.410
 an Olympiad to the bicycle only named a 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.840
 Olympic sport in 2004 and from there 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.760
 everything was clearer to me and I the only thing 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.700
 what I did was support him give him the support 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.030
 as he had not give him not only he puts it as 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.700
 once and not as a friend as a family 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.070
 as known in all the ways that 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.680
 I could so that he feels calm 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.900
 with him and that he can achieve all the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.760
 segments that he has wanted support 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.060
 towards emilio this season has had 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.390
 let's say two fronts the one is 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.260
 accompany him to events he considers 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.750
 I needed my presence very much for the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.570
 theme that came from this tremendous 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.420
 injury that I had last year in the 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.700
 Pan-American and Mexico at the first time 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.730
 that Ecuador was invited to go 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.200
 to venezuela Emilio was five years old and 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.370
 We were leaving 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.220
 to a competition in October and I would 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.810
 I say this to my husband Eduardo, well, let's go 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:47.470
 to demolish and in the process we know Caracas and 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.700
 We spent nice and see him and it cost me 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.590
 very much back to what was the 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.080
 shoulder rehabilitation return to 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.269
 recover everything to my movement my part 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.860
 mental will not fall or have 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.810
 suffer that pain the pain that I felt was 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.430
 amazing I had six hours shoulder 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.470
 outside then there was never 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.540
 experienced so much pain not 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.330
 after that I went back to pick up I felt that 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.010
 I came back from my level again and when 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.950
 I was already very close to getting the 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.150
 better or the Pan American where I 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.489
 I think it was at my best 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.269
 physical before another the best part 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.160
 mentally trained a lot and so 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.020
 what is my sport the sport contact me 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.430
 they touch from behind I hit myself against the 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.290
 jump I do not remember anything about this 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.430
 fall because they want me very conscious 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:33.120
 well I fell in Guadalajara he was 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.620
 I was participating was 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.830
 were the games that really 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.550
 emilio was shaping up to get a 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.550
 gold medal 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.460
 he had prepared he was emotionally 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:53.810
 professionally very well and they are 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:58.020
 these accidents what 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:01.600
 according to the games he taught 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.250
 they fell back and fell and I had very 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.200
 good times this year as I had very 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.600
 bad moments also my results 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.600
 of the athlete sometimes you said in these 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.920
 campaigns is covering the Olympic dream 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.960
 but always look forward always 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.270
 returned to settle down and if though 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.920
 little is missing let's go ahead or be 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.140
 there is nothing to lose for us not 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.080
 there is nothing to lose and in the world and 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.820

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.170
 Olympiad and be fulfilled today united 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.770
 many people who also dream 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.240
 with me day by day and being a representative 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.210
 more than point of the delegation of ecuador 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.070
 in these Olympics when I found out the 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.650
 London classification 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.110
 I was following the process from 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.420
 before or in two stages the first one 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.400
 the classification stage we are 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.940
 a group 8 instance not then I went 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.830
 to the sanctuary I studied in the sanctuary and 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.710
 when I went to receive the first news 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.820
 of Emilio who had managed to classify 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.320
 classified he gave the classification to 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.390
 Ecuador with nine other countries to go to 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.160
 hit the seven places when I 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.249
 I found out about the classification of medium to 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.150
 London 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:07.240
 for me it was 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.310
 well I knew that I'm going to pass it 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.910
 I trust a lot in the potential that 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.400
 have to not worry is more of this 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:18.640
 Once I knew the world was going to 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:22.570
 define all are proud of me I 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.760
 in which he lives this humility in which and 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.520
 for of course giving thanks to God 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.680
 and the virgin who really protected him 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.560
 He has already protected all the people who 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:36.310
 has supported not so much that it remains a 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:39.220
 fighter and I think he does things 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.470
 can correctly be reaching the 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:45.040
 final I'm very proud of him I know what 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:47.310
 it deserves and I am blessed that it is in my
