work has obviously taken me to different
places<00:01:59.140> every<00:01:59.650> time<00:02:00.490> you<00:02:00.670> move<00:02:00.909> it's<00:02:01.299> quite

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
places every time you move it's quite

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.710 
places every time you move it's quite
it's<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.290> big<00:02:02.500> step<00:02:02.799> and<00:02:03.220> that<00:02:03.880> was<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.360> mean<00:02:04.659> the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
it's a big step and that was I mean the

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.020 
it's a big step and that was I mean the
biggest<00:02:04.990> step<00:02:05.380> was<00:02:05.619> when<00:02:05.799> I<00:02:05.830> first<00:02:06.250> decided<00:02:06.640> I

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
biggest step was when I first decided I

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.870 
biggest step was when I first decided I
come<00:02:07.630> from<00:02:07.750> Mid<00:02:07.960> Wales<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:09.069> I<00:02:09.459> decided

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
come from Mid Wales and I decided

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.059 
come from Mid Wales and I decided
actually<00:02:10.149> I<00:02:10.599> didn't<00:02:10.959> want<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.290> be<00:02:11.410> at<00:02:11.500> home<00:02:11.739> I

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
actually I didn't want to be at home I

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.100 
actually I didn't want to be at home I
wanted<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.730> go<00:02:12.910> somewhere<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.690> wanted<00:02:13.989> to

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
wanted to go somewhere and I wanted to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.470 
wanted to go somewhere and I wanted to
go<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.290> an<00:02:14.500> adventure<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.819> feel<00:02:16.030> right<00:02:16.270> I'll

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
go on an adventure so I feel right I'll

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.240 
go on an adventure so I feel right I'll
move<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.750> Scotland<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.680> we'll<00:02:17.890> see<00:02:18.069> what

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
move to Scotland and we'll see what

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.070 
move to Scotland and we'll see what
happens<00:02:18.580> there<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.060> then<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.840> meet<00:02:20.050> people

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
happens there and then you meet people

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.350 
happens there and then you meet people
and<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:20.800> suddenly<00:02:21.280> discover<00:02:21.580> that<00:02:21.910> actually

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
and you suddenly discover that actually

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.330 
and you suddenly discover that actually
it's<00:02:22.480> really<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:23.590> know<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.830> adventures

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
it's really you know the adventures

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.089 
it's really you know the adventures
worked<00:02:24.550> out<00:02:24.760> if<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.209> doesn't<00:02:25.569> work<00:02:25.720> out<00:02:26.099> what's

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
worked out if it doesn't work out what's

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.890 
worked out if it doesn't work out what's
to<00:02:27.280> say<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.519> can't<00:02:27.849> go<00:02:28.030> somewhere<00:02:28.360> else

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
to say you can't go somewhere else

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.190 
to say you can't go somewhere else
I<00:02:29.160> don't<00:02:30.160> think<00:02:30.390> planning<00:02:31.390> long-term<00:02:31.930> is

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
I don't think planning long-term is

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.979 
I don't think planning long-term is
necessarily<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:33.160> best<00:02:34.000> thing<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.480> do<00:02:34.630> it's

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
necessarily the best thing to do it's

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.020 
necessarily the best thing to do it's
good<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.380> have<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.530> goal<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.160> mustn't<00:02:36.819> think

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
good to have a goal you mustn't think

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.479 
good to have a goal you mustn't think
that<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.630> goal<00:02:37.930> is<00:02:38.230> concreted<00:02:38.890> into<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.220> ground

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
that a goal is concreted into the ground

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.630 
that a goal is concreted into the ground
well<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:39.850> don't<00:02:40.239> think<00:02:40.500> my<00:02:41.500> goals<00:02:41.830> are<00:02:42.220> pretty

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
well I don't think my goals are pretty

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.350 
well I don't think my goals are pretty
flexible<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.530> last<00:02:44.530> year<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.310> decided<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:46.180> wanted

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
flexible so last year I decided I wanted

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.180 
flexible so last year I decided I wanted
to<00:02:46.630> take<00:02:46.780> time<00:02:47.019> out<00:02:47.049> of<00:02:47.319> work<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:47.890> went<00:02:48.100> to

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
to take time out of work so I went to

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.520

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
when I came back from that I discovered

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.110
