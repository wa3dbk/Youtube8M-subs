so we're going to keep it up keep it
open<00:02:04.210> slowly<00:02:05.210> cooking<00:02:05.630> should<00:02:06.290> be<00:02:06.350> almost<00:02:06.470> be

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
open slowly cooking should be almost be

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.490 
open slowly cooking should be almost be
there<00:02:07.420> see<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.509> bubbles<00:02:08.630> still<00:02:08.959> coming<00:02:09.229> up<00:02:09.319> so

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
there see the bubbles still coming up so

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.120 
there see the bubbles still coming up so
it's<00:02:09.619> not<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.740> small<00:02:09.920> boil<00:02:10.280> going<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.860> that's

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
it's not a small boil going and that's

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.510 
it's not a small boil going and that's
it<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:18.080> then<00:02:18.890> we're<00:02:19.040> going<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.190> pull<00:02:19.400> them

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
it and and then we're going to pull them

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.230 
it and and then we're going to pull them
out<00:02:19.640> with<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.510> spider<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:22.000> pull<00:02:23.000> them<00:02:23.120> out

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
out with a spider and pull them out

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.210 
out with a spider and pull them out
we'll<00:02:23.750> dip<00:02:24.020> them<00:02:24.140> right<00:02:24.320> into<00:02:24.470> ice<00:02:25.160> water

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
we'll dip them right into ice water

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.770 
we'll dip them right into ice water
which<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:25.880> called<00:02:26.030> shocking<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.600> we're<00:02:26.690> going

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
which is called shocking it we're going

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.479 
which is called shocking it we're going
to<00:02:26.840> shock<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.650> vegetable<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.190> stop<00:02:28.400> the

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
to shock the vegetable to stop the

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.400 
to shock the vegetable to stop the
cooking<00:02:28.610> process<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:31.690> once<00:02:32.690> we<00:02:32.840> once<00:02:33.170> we<00:02:33.290> get

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
cooking process and once we once we get

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.830 
cooking process and once we once we get
to<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.650> point<00:02:34.060> we<00:02:35.060> will<00:02:35.180> pull<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.420> spinach

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
to that point we will pull the spinach

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.050 
to that point we will pull the spinach
out<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.250> out<00:02:38.769> of<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.489> cold<00:02:40.700> ice<00:02:40.940> water

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
out of the out of the the cold ice water

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.210 
out of the out of the the cold ice water
so<00:02:41.840> we<00:02:41.930> don't<00:02:42.080> take<00:02:42.260> too<00:02:42.380> much<00:02:42.500> flavor<00:02:42.800> extract

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
so we don't take too much flavor extract

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.380 
so we don't take too much flavor extract
any<00:02:43.370> flavor<00:02:43.610> from<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.850> spinach<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:47.060> then

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
any flavor from the spinach and and then

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.940 
any flavor from the spinach and and then
we<00:02:47.510> were<00:02:47.630> going<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.810> squeeze<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.290> out<00:02:48.440> now

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
we were going to squeeze it out now

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.070 
we were going to squeeze it out now
obviously<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.489> is<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:49.670> big<00:02:49.910> this<00:02:50.570> is<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.810> lot<00:02:50.959> of

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
obviously this is a big this is a lot of

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.960 
obviously this is a big this is a lot of
spinach<00:02:51.320> but<00:02:51.440> it's<00:02:51.739> one<00:02:51.950> pound<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.519> spinach

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
and after we blanch and shock the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.979 
and after we blanch and shock the
spinach<00:02:57.040> one<00:02:58.040> pound<00:02:58.340> of<00:02:58.519> spinach<00:02:58.970> is<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.870> going

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
spinach one pound of spinach is it going

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.770 
spinach one pound of spinach is it going
to<00:03:00.050> be<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:01.310> small<00:03:01.580> little<00:03:02.209> amount<00:03:02.600> right

to be this small little amount right

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.870 
to be this small little amount right
over<00:03:03.019> here<00:03:03.410> after<00:03:03.560> we<00:03:04.100> squeeze<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.579> out<00:03:04.700> from

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
over here after we squeeze it out from

over here after we squeeze it out from
the<00:03:04.970> ice<00:03:05.120> water<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:07.480> after<00:03:08.480> we<00:03:08.570> have<00:03:08.690> the
