movement there's a tighten up the screws

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.570 
movement there's a tighten up the screws
you<00:01:52.990> know<00:01:53.200> this<00:01:53.409> will<00:01:53.619> not<00:01:53.800> go<00:01:54.010> anywhere<00:01:54.250> it's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
you know this will not go anywhere it's

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.859 
you know this will not go anywhere it's
very<00:01:54.880> strong<00:01:56.040> omit<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.250> nut<00:01:57.970> that's<00:01:58.119> voting

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
very strong omit the nut that's voting

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.859 
very strong omit the nut that's voting
against<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.759> because<00:02:00.759> it<00:02:00.910> covers<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.690> race

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
against the because it covers the race

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.400 
against the because it covers the race
it<00:02:02.170> doesn't<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.800> lot<00:02:02.830> of<00:02:03.070> spin<00:02:03.400> so<00:02:03.640> keeping<00:02:04.119> it

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
it doesn't a lot of spin so keeping it

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.469 
it doesn't a lot of spin so keeping it
like<00:02:05.410> this<00:02:05.590> is<00:02:05.740> fine<00:02:05.979> we<00:02:06.610> need<00:02:06.729> it<00:02:06.850> on<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.119> dark
