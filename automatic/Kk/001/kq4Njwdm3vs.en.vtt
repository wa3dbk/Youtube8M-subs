good clarity and good projection on your
craw<00:00:19.619> sticks<00:00:19.920> out<00:00:20.070> we<00:00:20.640> all<00:00:20.789> know<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.330> good

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
craw sticks out we all know that a good

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.200 
craw sticks out we all know that a good
rule<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.740> thumb<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.369> have<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> tip<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.090> your

from<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.000> inside<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.510> rim<00:00:27.800> to<00:00:28.800> get<00:00:28.949> it

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
from the inside of the rim to get it

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.339 
from the inside of the rim to get it
pretty<00:00:29.429> decent<00:00:29.849> acrostic<00:00:30.390> sound<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.170> know<00:00:31.199> if

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
pretty decent acrostic sound you know if

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.880 
pretty decent acrostic sound you know if
you<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.679> too<00:00:31.830> far<00:00:32.540> it<00:00:33.540> chokes<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.770> have

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
you have it too far it chokes you have

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.270 
you have it too far it chokes you have
it<00:00:35.010> all<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> way<00:00:35.309> up<00:00:35.399> against<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.630> hoop

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
it all the way up against the the hoop

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.069 
it all the way up against the the hoop
again<00:00:38.280> choke<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.000> inch<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.750> half<00:00:39.780> is

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
again choke so inch and a half is

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.790 
again choke so inch and a half is
generally<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> good<00:00:41.989> you<00:00:42.989> know<00:00:43.110> depending<00:00:43.649> on

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
generally a good you know depending on

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.619 
generally a good you know depending on
if<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.129> 13<00:00:44.520> inch<00:00:44.670> or<00:00:44.850> 14<00:00:45.270> inch<00:00:45.390> snare

if you have a 13 inch or 14 inch snare

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.500 
if you have a 13 inch or 14 inch snare
drum<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.379> know<00:00:46.500> inch<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> half<00:00:47.239> inch<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.480> a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
drum you know inch and a half inch and a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.910 
drum you know inch and a half inch and a
quarter<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.899> generally<00:00:49.350> good<00:00:49.530> rule<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.770> thumb

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
quarter is generally good rule of thumb

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.450 
quarter is generally good rule of thumb
to<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> good<00:00:51.149> cross<00:00:51.750> stick<00:00:51.989> sound<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.680> so

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
to get a good cross stick sound and so

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.760 
to get a good cross stick sound and so
basically<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> rim<00:00:54.270> riser<00:00:54.480> helps<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.559> with

basically the rim riser helps you with

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.130 
basically the rim riser helps you with
grip<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.969> stick<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.690> know<00:00:57.809> because<00:00:57.989> when

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
grip on the stick you know because when

rim<00:01:52.829> riser<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.310> your<00:01:53.460> DW<00:01:53.820> snares<00:01:54.200> because<00:01:55.200> they

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
rim riser on your DW snares because they

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.719 
rim riser on your DW snares because they
have<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> finer<00:01:55.770> thread<00:01:56.159> count<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.549> their

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
have a finer thread count on their

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.450 
have a finer thread count on their
attention<00:01:57.119> runs<00:01:57.329> for<00:01:57.600> easier<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.200> me<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.710> so

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
attention runs for easier to me and so

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.590
