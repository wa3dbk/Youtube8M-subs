00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 issues such as university quotas 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:09.510
 discrimination among other subjects 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.880
 controversy and divides society into 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.990
 lenny we're seeing is a doctor at 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.400
 and since 97 it has been addressing the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.250
 racial themes 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.490
 on one side little heard we come 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.710
 doing research since 2007 leading to 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.500
 the black puppets for the classroom 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.890
 studying with the white puppets and 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.230
 people see that this is not a very 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.120
 children's speaking ability. 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.430
 the identification of whether or not they have 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.270
 that doll in front of his story of 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.879
 life 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.430
 then both for the adult teacher 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.760
 children as in the relationship between 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.620
 the issue of race or whether 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.079
 identify with a particular breed does not 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.420
 it's a quiet thing some time 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.260
 on the internet a video caught the attention of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.989
 world 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.719
 black American children are 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.539
 placed fronts on two dolls one 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.210
 black to white and to the surprise of 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.780
 world the negative characteristics were 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.189
 identified in the black dolls 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.549
 revealing that those same children 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.280
 black women did not like her aesthetics 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.689
 here in rio grande do sul accompanied 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.780
 by Lenny 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.299
 we reproduce the same dynamic of the video 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.840
 but with gaucho children 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:32.070
 we tried to organize a conversation 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.930
 with the five-year-olds of this 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.530
 port city municipal school 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.320
 a peripheral school where he 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.630
 90% of children are black 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.570
 then invited the black children 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.960
 to come and talk about these two 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.049
 dolls a black doll and a cap with 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.259
 a black doll and a white doll 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.439
 we asked the children a few questions 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:01.079
 were precisely four questions for 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.110
 that children from hessen looking at 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.899
 the dolls how did they see each other? 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.739
 four chosen questions had as 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.860
 objective to highlight positivity 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:16.380
 affection 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.420
 the questions were which is the doll that 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.860
 You think she's more beautiful. 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.620
 so this was an issue you see 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.300
 Which doll do you think it is? 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.640
 evil 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.110
 What is the doll I wanted to go to? 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.480
 your best friend 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.230
 What is the doll that looks like a 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.250
 kick 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:41.760
 and the result was amazing and cap 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:47.940
 What do you think is more a nice doll than 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:51.380
 Do you think that the new Mecca you wanted to have 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.380
 a motor better friend 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.570
 what is the rate that looks like the old 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.380
 of the 15 children we talked to had 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.680
 29 negative references of the black doll 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.850
 and only 16 negative references from the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.100
 white doll 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.950
 eleven children said they wanted to have 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.799
 white doll as best friend 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.400
 three of them even being black when 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.019
 asked which dolls they looked like 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.360
 said to be the white doll 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.080
 twelve of them even finding in some cases 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.980
 the black fiend was evil and admitted 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.920
 look at it and it was a show 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.930
 quite small but we can hurt 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.650
 some things of what children 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.400
 brought when these were made 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.400
 questions in the vast majority of children 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:54.170
 all of them black boys and girls them 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.120
 they brought the most beautiful was the doll 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:02.430
 white is the doll that you think is more 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.489
 beautiful and when it was questioned 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.650
 about the evil year in the great majority 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:13.880
 they also said that the black doll 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.880
 she mowa what is the woman thinks is new 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.880
 the best friend stayed like this they had 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.550
 one or another doll as best friend 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.890
 did not have a doll that was and would 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.170
 stand out as their best friend 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.830
 It's the only one I wanted as your 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.830
 improvement 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.509
 we can not simply say so 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.880
 these children are racist 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.470
 How many of us have black dolls? 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.630
 inside home 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.000
 What role is this doll occupying? 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.740
 this joke with the children 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.270
 black children are having the 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.370
 opportunity to feel 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.000
 represented also in these 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.099
 toys on these dolls for example 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.979
 How am I supposed to find myself? 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:12.930
 place I see myself represented is the doll 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:15.539
 who thinks it looks like a day and I 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.479
 I understand that this is fundamental in life. 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:22.289
 of the children they can look at each other 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:24.090
 they can tell you if they like it 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.840
 What is the neca that you think is more 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.840
 beautiful 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.289
 What doll do you think the 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.289
 evil 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.070
 Which doll would you like to have? 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.070
 your best friend 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:56.100
 What doll do you think might be? 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:06:00.139
 It seems like I say why you think she 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.139
 It looks like that bullshit.
