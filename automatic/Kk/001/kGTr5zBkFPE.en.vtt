00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
troops is extremely useful because look

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:10.309 
troops is extremely useful because look
at<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.450> Wizards<00:01:09.810> are<00:01:09.869> completely

00:01:10.309 --> 00:01:10.319 
at that the Wizards are completely

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:12.080 
at that the Wizards are completely
protected<00:01:10.770> by<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.979> golem<00:01:11.429> and<00:01:11.579> pack<00:01:11.789> up<00:01:11.969> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
protected by the golem and pack up and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.149 
protected by the golem and pack up and
they're<00:01:12.810> gonna<00:01:12.869> walk<00:01:13.319> through<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.829> sides<00:01:14.039> of

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
they're gonna walk through the sides of

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.779 
they're gonna walk through the sides of
the<00:01:14.280> base<00:01:14.899> very<00:01:15.899> very<00:01:16.289> unfortunate<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
the base very very unfortunate and the

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.840 
the base very very unfortunate and the
triple<00:01:18.950> 53<00:01:19.950> expose<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.459> the<00:01:20.520> center<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> triple

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
triple 53 expose in the center a triple

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.959 
triple 53 expose in the center a triple
x<00:01:21.270> both<00:01:21.450> right<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:22.619> very<00:01:22.889> useful<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.549> not<00:01:23.729> so

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
x both right it's very useful but not so

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.730 
x both right it's very useful but not so
much<00:01:24.149> when<00:01:24.389> it<00:01:24.479> has<00:01:24.569> to<00:01:24.600> be<00:01:24.840> against<00:01:25.380> pekka's

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
much when it has to be against pekka's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.520 
much when it has to be against pekka's
or<00:01:25.889> golems<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.149> is<00:01:27.329> not<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.990> best<00:01:28.200> setup

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
or golems so that is not the best setup

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.410 
or golems so that is not the best setup
however<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.579> gonna<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.939> able<00:01:29.999> to<00:01:30.119> take<00:01:30.209> out

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
however we are gonna be able to take out

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.209 
however we are gonna be able to take out
all<00:01:30.659> these<00:01:30.810> Wizards<00:01:31.200> without<00:01:31.529> too<00:01:31.770> much<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.189> a

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
all these Wizards without too much of a

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:33.889 
all these Wizards without too much of a
struggle<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.270> only<00:01:33.450> thing<00:01:33.569> I'm<00:01:33.659> worried

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
struggle the only thing I'm worried

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.599 
struggle the only thing I'm worried
about<00:01:34.049> was<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.439> queen<00:01:35.069> but<00:01:35.340> they're<00:01:35.459> already

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
about was that queen but they're already

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.459 
about was that queen but they're already
have<00:01:35.819> fifty<00:01:36.090> three<00:01:36.240> percent<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.200> don't

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
have fifty three percent and I don't

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:38.840 
have fifty three percent and I don't
understand<00:01:37.799> why<00:01:37.859> the<00:01:37.979> guy<00:01:38.159> dropped<00:01:38.490> his<00:01:38.639> queen

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
understand why the guy dropped his queen

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.340 
understand why the guy dropped his queen
but<00:01:38.999> he<00:01:39.090> does<00:01:39.389> later<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.840> you'll<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.079> at<00:01:40.319> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
but he does later on you'll see at the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.410 
but he does later on you'll see at the
end<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:41.039> absolutely<00:01:41.249> crazy<00:01:41.759> decides<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.329> go

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
end it's absolutely crazy decides to go

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.760 
end it's absolutely crazy decides to go
for<00:01:42.450> more<00:01:42.779> percentage<00:01:43.170> maybe<00:01:43.350> he's<00:01:43.499> going<00:01:43.649> for

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
working in 250 that's obvious but it

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.610 
working in 250 that's obvious but it
wasn't<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.030> best<00:03:27.389> attack<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.079> could<00:03:28.290> have<00:03:28.380> done

obviously I really should have gotten
two<00:03:30.239> stars<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.810> one<00:03:30.959> life<00:03:31.139> I<00:03:31.349> think<00:03:31.889> it'd<00:03:31.950> have

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
two stars and one life I think it'd have

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.860 
two stars and one life I think it'd have
been<00:03:32.069> like<00:03:32.160> 30-something<00:03:32.940> trophies<00:03:33.420> it

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
been like 30-something trophies it

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.449 
been like 30-something trophies it
would've<00:03:34.049> been<00:03:34.079> awesome<00:03:34.500> because<00:03:34.950> he<00:03:35.130> goes<00:03:35.280> up

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
would've been awesome because he goes up

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.129 
would've been awesome because he goes up
every<00:03:35.849> time<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:36.120> don't<00:03:36.420> know<00:03:36.480> it's<00:03:36.599> like<00:03:36.690> 16

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
every time I don't know it's like 16

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.240 
every time I don't know it's like 16
trophies<00:03:37.470> for<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.650> first<00:03:37.829> star<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.130> that's

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
trophies for the first star and that's

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.729 
trophies for the first star and that's
like<00:03:38.370> 19<00:03:38.819> 19<00:03:39.329> I<00:03:39.359> think<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:40.019> think<00:03:40.650> it's

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
like 19 19 I think it is I think it's

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.440 
like 19 19 I think it is I think it's
how<00:03:40.829> it<00:03:40.920> goes<00:03:41.069> i'm<00:03:41.310> not<00:03:41.519> positive<00:03:41.730> on<00:03:42.000> that<00:03:42.060> but

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
how it goes i'm not positive on that but

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.110 
how it goes i'm not positive on that but
it<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:43.169> a<00:03:43.410> little<00:03:44.010> weird<00:03:44.370> how<00:03:44.609> it<00:03:44.639> goes<00:03:44.940> the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
it is a little weird how it goes the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.280 
it is a little weird how it goes the
first<00:03:45.329> stars<00:03:45.540> always<00:03:45.780> worth<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.109> least

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
first stars always worth the least

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.020 
first stars always worth the least
amount<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.769> then<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.280> second<00:03:47.639> third<00:03:47.819> star

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
amount and then the second third star

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.080 
amount and then the second third star
worth<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.389> most<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:49.650> here<00:03:49.829> we<00:03:49.889> go<00:03:49.919> 57%<00:03:50.519> we're

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
worth the most so here we go 57% we're

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.819 
worth the most so here we go 57% we're
gonna<00:03:51.209> get<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.389> few<00:03:51.720> more<00:03:51.989> buildings<00:03:52.440> at<00:03:52.590> little

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.250 
but I thought I could pick this off and
I<00:04:11.700> did<00:04:12.090> but<00:04:12.299> I<00:04:12.359> quit<00:04:12.599> in<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.840> dark<00:04:13.019> barracks
