00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
messing with my graphics to see if I can

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.859 
messing with my graphics to see if I can
get<00:01:56.689> some<00:01:57.530> more<00:01:57.560> performance<00:01:58.219> out<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.369> it<00:01:58.869> yeah

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
get some more performance out of it yeah

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.690 
get some more performance out of it yeah
I<00:02:00.170> turned<00:02:00.619> off<00:02:00.799> like<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:00.979> lot<00:02:01.159> of<00:02:01.250> shadows<00:02:01.670> and

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
I turned off like a lot of shadows and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.690 
I turned off like a lot of shadows and
lights<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:02.899> stuff<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.469> shininess<00:02:03.829> so<00:02:04.490> it

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
lights and stuff and shininess so it

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.490 
lights and stuff and shininess so it
looked<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:04.969> little<00:02:05.090> bit<00:02:05.270> funny<00:02:05.509> funny<00:02:05.899> of<00:02:06.140> the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
looked a little bit funny funny of the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.229 
looked a little bit funny funny of the
way<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:06.679> was<00:02:06.770> before<00:02:06.920> anyway<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.090> we<00:02:08.149> have

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
way it was before anyway so we have

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.930 
way it was before anyway so we have
white<00:02:08.420> rod<00:02:08.599> doing<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:09.280> pretty<00:02:10.280> normal<00:02:10.399> wall<00:02:10.759> in

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
white rod doing a pretty normal wall in

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.530 
white rod doing a pretty normal wall in
here<00:02:11.329> well<00:02:12.250> normal<00:02:13.250> for<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.790> scrap<00:02:14.030> station<00:02:14.450> at

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
here well normal for a scrap station at

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.420 
here well normal for a scrap station at
least<00:02:14.720> this<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.290> funny<00:02:15.560> map<00:02:15.799> it's<00:02:16.040> strange

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
least this is a funny map it's strange

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.630 
least this is a funny map it's strange
map<00:02:16.730> in<00:02:17.329> a<00:02:17.420> sense<00:02:17.629> because<00:02:17.959> it's<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:18.860> got<00:02:19.610> a

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
map in a sense because it's it's got a

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.910 
map in a sense because it's it's got a
wide<00:02:19.970> ramp<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:20.840> that's<00:02:21.019> kind<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.260> abnormal

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
wide ramp and so that's kind of abnormal

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.520 
wide ramp and so that's kind of abnormal
but<00:02:22.489> it's<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.760> very<00:02:23.030> long<00:02:23.510> distance<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:24.440> have

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
but it's a very long distance you have

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.610 
but it's a very long distance you have
to<00:02:24.650> go<00:02:24.739> all<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:25.129> way<00:02:25.160> around<00:02:25.340> this<00:02:26.329> long<00:02:26.660> you

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
to go all the way around this long you

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.170 
to go all the way around this long you
shape<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.280> actually<00:02:28.579> get<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.910> enemy<00:02:29.150> base

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
shape to actually get to the enemy base

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.009 
shape to actually get to the enemy base
so<00:02:30.019> it's<00:02:30.609> just<00:02:31.609> a<00:02:31.790> weird<00:02:32.030> sort<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.629> set<00:02:32.900> of

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
so it's just a weird sort of set of

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.900 
so it's just a weird sort of set of
circumstances<00:02:33.530> for<00:02:34.129> a<00:02:34.160> map<00:02:34.370> where<00:02:34.609> it's<00:02:34.730> like

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
circumstances for a map where it's like

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.110 
circumstances for a map where it's like
a<00:02:34.940> rush<00:02:35.209> map<00:02:35.480> but<00:02:35.660> it's<00:02:35.780> also<00:02:35.900> not<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.230> rush<00:02:36.530> map

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
a rush map but it's also not a rush map

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.390 
a rush map but it's also not a rush map
you<00:02:38.120> know<00:02:38.209> it's<00:02:38.510> it's<00:02:39.010> relative<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:40.129> mean<00:02:40.280> it's

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
you know it's it's relative it mean it's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.120 
you know it's it's relative it mean it's
really<00:02:40.700> really<00:02:40.879> short<00:02:41.060> distance<00:02:41.480> between

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
really really short distance between

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.270 
really really short distance between
bases<00:02:43.130> as<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:44.060> crow<00:02:44.299> flies<00:02:44.329> or<00:02:44.900> as<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.380> void

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
bases as the crow flies or as the void

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.870 
bases as the crow flies or as the void
ray<00:02:46.459> flies<00:02:46.730> as<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.359> case<00:02:47.540> might<00:02:47.750> be<00:02:48.760> but<00:02:49.760> it's

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
ray flies as the case might be but it's

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.670 
ray flies as the case might be but it's
actually<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.209> long<00:02:50.450> rush<00:02:50.930> distance<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.590> then

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
actually a long rush distance and then

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.620 
actually a long rush distance and then
but<00:02:51.889> then<00:02:52.069> because<00:02:53.000> even<00:02:53.239> though<00:02:53.329> it's<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.480> long

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
but then because even though it's a long

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.750 
but then because even though it's a long
rush<00:02:53.840> distance<00:02:54.260> there's<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.530> wide<00:02:55.099> ramp<00:02:55.489> as

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
rush distance there's a wide ramp as

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.960 
rush distance there's a wide ramp as
well<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.389> protect<00:02:56.750> so<00:02:57.019> yeah<00:02:57.889> just<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.489> very

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
well to protect so yeah just a very

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.440 
well to protect so yeah just a very
dynamic<00:02:59.120> sort<00:02:59.720> of<00:02:59.780> situation<00:03:00.290> there<00:03:00.410> anyway

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
dynamic sort of situation there anyway

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.809 
dynamic sort of situation there anyway
interesting<00:03:02.450> we<00:03:02.569> have<00:03:02.720> dhamaka<00:03:03.049> going<00:03:03.410> for<00:03:03.680> a

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
interesting we have dhamaka going for a

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.190 
interesting we have dhamaka going for a
Bailey<00:03:04.819> nest<00:03:05.180> right<00:03:05.389> off<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.660> bat<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:05.870> didn't

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
Bailey nest right off the bat I didn't

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.159 
Bailey nest right off the bat I didn't
even<00:03:06.260> see<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:06.500> actually<00:03:07.720> behind<00:03:08.720> lines<00:03:08.959> he's

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.169 
even see that actually behind lines he's

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.289 
even see that actually behind lines he's
just<00:03:09.319> gone<00:03:09.470> for<00:03:09.680> one<00:03:10.010> base<00:03:10.250> play<00:03:10.579> here<00:03:10.910> he's

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
just gone for one base play here he's

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.940 
just gone for one base play here he's
putting<00:03:11.599> out<00:03:11.690> a<00:03:11.720> lot<00:03:11.780> of<00:03:12.049> zerglings<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.680> lot<00:03:12.859> of

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
putting out a lot of zerglings a lot of

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.759 
putting out a lot of zerglings a lot of
zerglings<00:03:13.190> running<00:03:13.579> towards<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:15.500> enemy

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
zerglings running towards the the enemy

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.379 
zerglings running towards the the enemy
base<00:03:15.919> he's<00:03:16.130> got<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.310> baleen<00:03:16.700> s<00:03:16.819> warp<00:03:17.030> again<00:03:17.150> so

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
base he's got a baleen s warp again so

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:18.849 
base he's got a baleen s warp again so
he's<00:03:17.540> probably<00:03:17.810> going<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.109> just<00:03:18.440> go<00:03:18.620> for<00:03:18.650> a

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
he's probably going to just go for a

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.750 
he's probably going to just go for a
bust<00:03:19.160> here<00:03:19.870> sort<00:03:20.870> of<00:03:20.959> an<00:03:21.049> all-in<00:03:21.579> bust<00:03:22.579> is

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
bust here sort of an all-in bust is

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.339 
bust here sort of an all-in bust is
going<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.000> make<00:03:23.120> banelings<00:03:23.630> outside<00:03:24.139> of<00:03:24.290> the

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
going to make banelings outside of the

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.740 
going to make banelings outside of the
base<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.940> whitehall<00:03:25.940> really<00:03:26.299> needs<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.630> know

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
base and whitehall really needs to know

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.110 
base and whitehall really needs to know
this<00:03:26.900> is<00:03:27.019> happening<00:03:27.169> he's<00:03:27.889> a<00:03:28.099> man<00:03:28.579> he's<00:03:28.790> chrono

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
this is happening he's a man he's chrono

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.909 
this is happening he's a man he's chrono
boost<00:03:29.359> in<00:03:29.510> his<00:03:29.630> warp<00:03:29.900> gates<00:03:30.109> but<00:03:30.260> in<00:03:30.380> all<00:03:30.620> we

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
boost in his warp gates but in all we

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.460 
boost in his warp gates but in all we
needs<00:03:31.130> a<00:03:31.250> century<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:32.540> need<00:03:32.720> this<00:03:32.900> century

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
needs a century you need this century

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.140 
needs a century you need this century
he's<00:03:33.950> getting<00:03:34.190> another<00:03:34.250> pile<00:03:34.609> on<00:03:34.790> down<00:03:34.970> here

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
he's getting another pile on down here

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.420 
he's getting another pile on down here
so<00:03:35.359> when<00:03:36.319> this<00:03:36.410> piling<00:03:36.799> gets<00:03:36.950> theoretically

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
so when this piling gets theoretically

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.570 
so when this piling gets theoretically
blown<00:03:37.760> up<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:38.150> will<00:03:38.329> still<00:03:38.599> be<00:03:38.629> a

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
blown up it will still be a

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.540 
blown up it will still be a
he'll<00:03:40.120> still<00:03:40.330> be<00:03:40.450> an<00:03:40.510> okay<00:03:41.290> shape<00:03:41.500> but<00:03:41.710> this<00:03:42.370> is

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
he'll still be an okay shape but this is

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.740 
he'll still be an okay shape but this is
the<00:03:42.670> weak<00:03:42.790> point<00:03:43.060> right<00:03:43.210> here<00:03:43.240> these<00:03:43.540> zealots

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
the weak point right here these zealots

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.990 
the weak point right here these zealots
in<00:03:44.020> that<00:03:44.200> gap<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:45.100> he's<00:03:45.280> just<00:03:45.310> going<00:03:45.550> to<00:03:45.610> run<00:03:45.850> in

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
in that gap so he's just going to run in

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.960 
in that gap so he's just going to run in
with<00:03:46.180> uh<00:03:46.390> with<00:03:46.830> banelings<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.250> oh<00:03:48.370> I<00:03:48.550> think

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
with uh with banelings and oh I think

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.460 
with uh with banelings and oh I think
you<00:03:49.030> might<00:03:49.150> see<00:03:49.420> it<00:03:49.510> now<00:03:49.660> this<00:03:49.900> probe<00:03:50.200> sees

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
you might see it now this probe sees

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.170 
you might see it now this probe sees
those<00:03:50.650> zerglings<00:03:51.100> running<00:03:51.400> he's<00:03:51.790> got<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.090> be<00:03:52.150> a

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
those zerglings running he's got to be a

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.160 
those zerglings running he's got to be a
little<00:03:52.330> bit<00:03:52.480> worried<00:03:52.720> but<00:03:52.840> there's<00:03:53.020> not

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
little bit worried but there's not

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.500 
little bit worried but there's not
really<00:03:53.710> enough<00:03:54.130> time<00:03:54.430> from<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.820> react<00:03:55.030> he's

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
really enough time from to react he's

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.960 
really enough time from to react he's
got<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:55.750> Stargate<00:03:56.320> warping<00:03:56.650> in<00:03:56.800> so<00:03:57.250> if<00:03:57.490> he<00:03:57.640> is<00:03:57.760> oh

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
got a Stargate warping in so if he is oh

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.780 
got a Stargate warping in so if he is oh
there<00:03:58.240> goes<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.540> bailing<00:03:58.930> Oh<00:03:59.320> owns<00:04:00.100> the<00:04:00.460> crap

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
there goes the bailing Oh owns the crap

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.690 
there goes the bailing Oh owns the crap
out<00:04:01.060> of<00:04:01.120> those<00:04:01.510> solids<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.620> oh<00:04:02.740> no<00:04:03.070> probes

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
out of those solids and oh no probes

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.310 
out of those solids and oh no probes
having<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.030> be<00:04:04.210> pulled<00:04:04.510> but<00:04:04.750> not<00:04:05.020> enough

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
having to be pulled but not enough

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.690 
having to be pulled but not enough
probes<00:04:05.620> are<00:04:05.800> there<00:04:05.920> he's<00:04:06.070> trying<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.370> block

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
probes are there he's trying to block

probes are there he's trying to block
know<00:04:07.060> it<00:04:07.450> tries<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.840> put<00:04:07.990> down<00:04:08.110> a<00:04:08.170> gateway

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
know it tries to put down a gateway

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.890

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
we go just just to make the video length

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.420 
we go just just to make the video length
a<00:04:37.870> little<00:04:38.050> bit<00:04:38.140> longer<00:04:38.320> for<00:04:38.500> anti<00:04:38.890> sports<00:04:39.190> as

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
a little bit longer for anti sports as

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.250 
a little bit longer for anti sports as
well<00:04:39.460> man<00:04:39.910> probes<00:04:40.300> coming<00:04:40.600> off<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.810> line<00:04:40.960> and

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
well man probes coming off the line and

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.930 
well man probes coming off the line and
then<00:04:41.410> oh<00:04:41.560> just<00:04:41.950> so<00:04:42.160> close<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.520> can<00:04:42.610> see<00:04:42.790> had

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
then oh just so close you can see had

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.280 
then oh just so close you can see had
the<00:04:43.060> Gateway<00:04:43.360> planted<00:04:43.810> it<00:04:43.930> didn't<00:04:44.169> work

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
the Gateway planted it didn't work

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.950 
the Gateway planted it didn't work
though<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:46.030> if<00:04:46.180> he'd<00:04:46.330> been<00:04:46.450> able<00:04:46.660> to<00:04:46.780> kind

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
though and so if he'd been able to kind

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.780 
though and so if he'd been able to kind
of<00:04:47.020> hold<00:04:47.560> things<00:04:47.800> off<00:04:47.980> with<00:04:48.100> these<00:04:48.220> probes<00:04:48.580> and

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
of hold things off with these probes and

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.430 
of hold things off with these probes and
oh<00:04:49.000> oh<00:04:49.870> oh<00:04:50.770> it's<00:04:51.760> just<00:04:51.970> beautiful<00:04:52.120> if<00:04:52.750> he

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
oh oh oh it's just beautiful if he

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.760 
oh oh oh it's just beautiful if he
hadn't<00:04:53.680> lost<00:04:53.830> every<00:04:54.550> single<00:04:54.820> probe<00:04:55.650> he<00:04:56.650> was

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
hadn't lost every single probe he was

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.110 
hadn't lost every single probe he was
going<00:04:56.919> to<00:04:56.950> try<00:04:57.160> and<00:04:57.190> hold<00:04:57.460> out<00:04:57.640> until<00:04:57.820> he<00:04:58.000> could

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
going to try and hold out until he could

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.880 
going to try and hold out until he could
get<00:04:58.270> a<00:04:58.330> void<00:04:59.020> ray<00:04:59.200> out<00:04:59.350> and<00:04:59.560> then<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.740> void

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
get a void ray out and then the void

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.680 
get a void ray out and then the void
read<00:05:00.070> be<00:05:00.220> able<00:05:00.400> to<00:05:00.520> you<00:05:00.970> know<00:05:01.090> deal<00:05:01.510> with

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
read be able to you know deal with

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.770 
read be able to you know deal with
everything<00:05:02.220> all<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.460> zerglings<00:05:03.790> and<00:05:04.450> he<00:05:04.660> was

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
everything all the zerglings and he was

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.360 
everything all the zerglings and he was
just<00:05:04.960> yeah<00:05:05.110> pretty<00:05:05.350> much<00:05:05.410> all<00:05:05.620> in<00:05:05.890> zerglings

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
just yeah pretty much all in zerglings

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.130 
just yeah pretty much all in zerglings
here<00:05:06.610> where<00:05:07.270> does<00:05:07.390> Queen<00:05:07.600> go<00:05:07.780> was<00:05:07.900> even

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
here where does Queen go was even

his Queen was going anyway so dhamaka

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.950 
his Queen was going anyway so dhamaka
takes<00:05:12.790> the<00:05:12.910> first<00:05:13.090> game<00:05:13.300> of<00:05:13.450> the<00:05:13.510> set<00:05:13.690> and<00:05:13.870> like

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
takes the first game of the set and like

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.870 
takes the first game of the set and like
it<00:05:14.080> is<00:05:14.169> the<00:05:14.260> best<00:05:14.500> of<00:05:14.710> seven<00:05:15.070> like<00:05:15.460> I<00:05:15.490> said<00:05:15.610> its

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
it is the best of seven like I said its

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.020 
it is the best of seven like I said its
best<00:05:16.060> of<00:05:16.180> seven<00:05:16.240> so<00:05:17.700> I'm<00:05:18.700> going<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:18.910> go<00:05:19.000> ahead

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
best of seven so I'm going to go ahead

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.520 
best of seven so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:05:19.390> move<00:05:20.320> on<00:05:20.500> to<00:05:20.620> game<00:05:21.220> two
