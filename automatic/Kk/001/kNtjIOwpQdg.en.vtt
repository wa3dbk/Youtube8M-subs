00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.330
 to the south but to the authentic one also because 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:13.610
 he has it in his blood and he has always done 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:19.610
 flaunt it and this is the fastest has 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:22.250
 said sergio ramos sergio de pequeñito 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.360
 already as they say sending from central 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:32.360
 quality with the bowl hair of these 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:36.440
 he liked his head goal 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.660
 sergio the team is a final of 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.270
 Andalusia with the selection of Seville 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.160
 see what great goal of sergio ramos no 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.470
 they had the qualities and has some 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.070
 fantastic qualities has been able to 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.690
 playing from right-back has been able 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.580
 adapted to be placed centrally and 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.270
 now possibly against piqué 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:59.930
 the best couples in the world 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.879
 of soccer and character this is with 12 years 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.350
 and you could see the sergio personality 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:09.170
 It also has a lot to do, I do not say 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.150
 Cenace is in one place in another also 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.000
 it seems that they are more precocious true and 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.000
 this has not been a good of your long 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.770
 but they have been broadly can 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.390
 have had episodes that have not 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.040
 had a good behavior but 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.550
 generally with good behavior 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.950
 it ends xàbia and it ends there what will be 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.590
 yes to sergio sergio I think they have a 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.080
 behavior is extraordinary truth 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.600
 they had a few bad times but they were 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.390
 solved and now are some examples 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.930
 excellent was the captain the manager 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.400
 of raising that trophy and who was going to 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.360
 speak before the camera and there too 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.360
 he showed his self-confidence 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.890
 not for me 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.770
 luck now they are not accompanying us 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.860
 we are losing but ours 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.630
 missions to win you can go in good 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.020
 I fight without sporting nothing happens if 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.020
 they do not win 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:20.739
 twelve years of years ago in the first the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.310
 second the sixth sector 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.310
 the facts 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.570
 good your aspiration in seville a 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:37.330
 team in seville 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.330
 if not come from this but from that
