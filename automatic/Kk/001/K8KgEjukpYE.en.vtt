and this I will leave it to boy so now

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:53.970 
and this I will leave it to boy so now
the<00:02:33.690> paneer<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.440> complete<00:02:34.860> right

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:03.030 

so<00:02:54.520> I'll<00:02:54.670> just<00:02:54.880> hide<00:02:55.120> it

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.449 

the<00:03:04.040> consistency<00:03:04.730> should<00:03:04.760> be<00:03:04.910> right<00:03:05.180> so<00:03:05.420> that

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
the consistency should be right so that

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:17.190 
the consistency should be right so that
you<00:03:07.459> can<00:03:07.610> make<00:03:07.790> round<00:03:08.030> balls<00:03:08.120> with<00:03:08.630> this

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.930 

needed<00:03:18.200> four<00:03:18.410> to<00:03:18.500> five<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.770> ten<00:03:18.920> minutes<00:03:21.940> so

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
needed four to five to ten minutes so

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.330 
needed four to five to ten minutes so
you<00:03:23.030> have<00:03:23.209> made<00:03:23.360> it<00:03:23.540> this<00:03:23.890> now<00:03:24.890> I<00:03:24.920> will<00:03:25.069> make

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
you have made it this now I will make

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:40.160 
you have made it this now I will make
small<00:03:25.489> round<00:03:25.700> balls

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:57.220 

you<00:03:40.590> sleep

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:16.909 

let's<00:03:57.920> cook<00:03:58.220> so<00:03:58.520> it<00:03:58.880> will<00:03:59.030> double<00:03:59.300> in<00:03:59.390> size

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.330 

so<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:17.609> have<00:04:17.789> made<00:04:18.000> round<00:04:18.269> balls<00:04:18.979> now<00:04:19.979> even

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
so you have made round balls now even

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.719 
so you have made round balls now even
the<00:04:20.430> water<00:04:20.609> has<00:04:20.819> started<00:04:20.909> boiling<00:04:22.310> so<00:04:23.310> one<00:04:23.520> by

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
the water has started boiling so one by

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:51.320 
the water has started boiling so one by
one<00:04:23.939> I<00:04:25.009> will<00:04:26.009> add<00:04:26.159> to<00:04:26.340> this

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.540 

and<00:04:52.330> cover<00:04:53.080> this<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:53.850> cook<00:04:54.850> till<00:04:55.090> one<00:04:55.300> missile

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
and cover this and cook till one missile

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.270 
and cover this and cook till one missile
so<00:04:57.550> this<00:04:57.700> is<00:04:57.790> done<00:04:58.030> now<00:04:58.740> now<00:04:59.740> I<00:04:59.770> will<00:05:00.070> leave<00:05:00.220> you

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:19.890 

all<00:05:10.930> the<00:05:11.080> steam<00:05:11.320> is<00:05:11.440> released<00:05:18.420> so<00:05:19.420> as<00:05:19.570> we<00:05:19.750> can

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
all the steam is released so as we can
