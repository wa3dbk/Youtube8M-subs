00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.500 
anyways i just think that this is really
complementary<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:18.010> really<00:03:18.220> interesting<00:03:18.820> at

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
complementary and really interesting at

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.910 
complementary and really interesting at
least<00:03:19.540> with<00:03:19.810> my<00:03:19.959> skin<00:03:20.230> tone<00:03:20.260> i<00:03:20.440> think<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:20.829> it

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920
