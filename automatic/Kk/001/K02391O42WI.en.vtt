here<00:00:07.350> we're<00:00:07.470> going<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.649> take<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.889> look<00:00:08.160> at<00:00:08.340> how

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
here we're going to take a look at how

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.549 
here we're going to take a look at how
we<00:00:08.790> can<00:00:09.059> get<00:00:09.299> roof<00:00:09.780> trusses<00:00:10.049> into<00:00:10.410> our

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
we can get roof trusses into our

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.320 
we can get roof trusses into our
drawings<00:00:10.950> fantastically<00:00:11.730> quickly<00:00:12.090> using

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
drawings fantastically quickly using

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.740 
drawings fantastically quickly using

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
of course being a sea object they also

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.769 
of course being a sea object they also
section<00:00:18.890> onto<00:00:19.890> our<00:00:20.070> our<00:00:20.669> drawings<00:00:21.150> make<00:00:21.390> 2d

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
section onto our our drawings make 2d

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.160 
section onto our our drawings make 2d
details<00:00:22.230> as<00:00:22.590> well<00:00:23.330> so<00:00:24.330> here<00:00:24.599> we<00:00:24.689> are<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:25.140> have

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
details as well so here we are we have

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.910 
details as well so here we are we have
the<00:00:25.380> AEC<00:00:26.189> trust<00:00:27.150> dialog<00:00:27.539> open<00:00:28.080> now<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:28.740> see

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the AEC trust dialog open now we can see

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.550 
the AEC trust dialog open now we can see
behind<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.759> the<00:00:30.330> result<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.779> using<00:00:30.960> that

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
behind it the the result of using that

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.380 
behind it the the result of using that
all<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> we'll<00:00:32.099> see<00:00:32.339> how<00:00:32.519> that<00:00:32.580> figures<00:00:33.269> in

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
all and we'll see how that figures in

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.960 
all and we'll see how that figures in
later<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:34.350> let's<00:00:35.190> just<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.519> quick<00:00:35.670> tour

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
later but let's just have a quick tour

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.490 
later but let's just have a quick tour
around<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.300> dialog<00:00:36.660> box<00:00:36.900> so<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.350> that

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
around the dialog box so we have that

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.079 
around the dialog box so we have that
just<00:00:37.530> tighter<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.670> then<00:00:38.760> you'll<00:00:38.879> see<00:00:39.030> you

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:39.089 
just tighter and then you'll see you

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:41.960 
just tighter and then you'll see you
have<00:00:39.180> 12<00:00:40.049> different<00:00:40.229> styles<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.100> trust<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.519> all

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
have 12 different styles of trust so all

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.520 
have 12 different styles of trust so all
the<00:00:42.180> different<00:00:42.449> profiles<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.320> could

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the different profiles that you could

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.410 
the different profiles that you could
wish<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.010> within<00:00:44.339> your<00:00:44.519> drawing<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:45.089> we

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
wish to have within your drawing as we

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.450 
wish to have within your drawing as we
toggle<00:00:45.930> through<00:00:46.170> them<00:00:46.440> you'll<00:00:46.949> notice<00:00:47.339> that

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
toggle through them you'll notice that

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.890 
toggle through them you'll notice that
they<00:00:47.610> all<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.119> little<00:00:48.360> markers<00:00:48.780> on

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
they all have the little markers on

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.969 
they all have the little markers on
their<00:00:49.140> show<00:00:49.830> you<00:00:49.890> how<00:00:50.519> to<00:00:50.659> set<00:00:51.659> or<00:00:52.409> where<00:00:52.799> to

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:52.979 
their show you how to set or where to

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:55.729 
their show you how to set or where to
set<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.839> different<00:00:54.839> thicknesses<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
set the different thicknesses for the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.259 
set the different thicknesses for the
members<00:00:56.040> within<00:00:56.309> our<00:00:56.430> drawing<00:00:56.729> so<00:00:56.909> going<00:00:57.150> down

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
members within our drawing so going down

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.899 
members within our drawing so going down
you<00:00:58.080> see<00:00:58.320> there's<00:00:58.830> a<00:00:58.920> complete<00:00:59.339> range<00:00:59.519> of<00:00:59.729> the

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
you see there's a complete range of the

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.289 
you see there's a complete range of the
the<00:01:00.119> trusses<00:01:00.330> there<00:01:00.659> we<00:01:01.619> have<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:02.430> span<00:01:02.879> which

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
the trusses there we have the span which

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.329 
the trusses there we have the span which
we<00:01:03.479> can<00:01:03.629> do<00:01:03.809> by<00:01:03.839> picking<00:01:04.470> from<00:01:04.619> our<00:01:04.769> drawing<00:01:05.129> or

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
we can do by picking from our drawing or

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.459 
we can do by picking from our drawing or
typing<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.080> here<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.810> pitch<00:01:09.810> which

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
typing in here we have the pitch which

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.580 
typing in here we have the pitch which
increments<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.460> two<00:01:11.609> and<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.789> half<00:01:11.969> degrees<00:01:12.590> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
increments in two and a half degrees and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.310 
increments in two and a half degrees and
we<00:01:13.679> have<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.520> thickness<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.420> that's<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.840> front

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
we have a thickness so that's the front

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.359 
we have a thickness so that's the front
to<00:01:16.500> back<00:01:17.689> distance<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.289> the<00:01:19.829> truss<00:01:20.009> itself

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
to back distance on the the truss itself

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.580 
to back distance on the the truss itself
and<00:01:20.969> then<00:01:21.119> various<00:01:21.420> other<00:01:21.539> properties<00:01:22.200> could

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
and then various other properties could

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.800 
and then various other properties could
would<00:01:22.710> buy<00:01:22.950> more<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.149> we're<00:01:24.299> wanting<00:01:24.630> to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
would buy more so if we're wanting to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.230 
would buy more so if we're wanting to
define<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> truss<00:01:25.619> absolutely<00:01:26.369> that's<00:01:26.549> exactly

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
define a truss absolutely that's exactly

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.300 
define a truss absolutely that's exactly
what<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.719> big<00:01:30.439> we<00:01:31.439> also<00:01:31.590> notice<00:01:32.009> within

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
what we can big we also notice within

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.830 
what we can big we also notice within
the<00:01:32.460> dialog<00:01:32.820> there<00:01:33.149> that<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the dialog there that we have the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.260 
the dialog there that we have the
ability<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.170> create<00:01:34.469> an<00:01:34.740> entire<00:01:35.100> run<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.969> roof

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
ability to create an entire run of roof

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.419 
ability to create an entire run of roof
trusses<00:01:36.509> our<00:01:36.749> row<00:01:37.200> there<00:01:37.469> and<00:01:37.740> at<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
trusses our row there and at the

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.029 
trusses our row there and at the
center's<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.600> also<00:01:40.020> an<00:01:40.140> end<00:01:40.289> offset<00:01:40.649> so

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
center's and also an end offset so

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.700 
center's and also an end offset so
looking<00:01:41.789> at<00:01:41.909> our<00:01:42.030> roof<00:01:42.630> here<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:43.289> have<00:01:43.499> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
looking at our roof here we have a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.190 
looking at our roof here we have a
standard<00:01:43.950> 600<00:01:44.609> spacing<00:01:44.999> set<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.840> then<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
standard 600 spacing set but then the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.450 
standard 600 spacing set but then the
the<00:01:46.229> last<00:01:46.679> truss<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.219> introduced<00:01:47.960> before<00:01:48.960> that

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
the last truss is introduced before that

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.830 
the last truss is introduced before that
to<00:01:50.460> accommodate<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.999> wall<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.630> three

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
to accommodate the wall and the three

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.709 
to accommodate the wall and the three
five<00:01:52.079> two<00:01:52.399> here<00:01:53.399> I've<00:01:53.639> actually<00:01:53.850> set<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.359> from

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
five two here I've actually set it from

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.959 
five two here I've actually set it from
the<00:01:54.869> external<00:01:55.259> face<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.859> that's<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.189> city<00:01:56.460> in

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
the external face so that's in city in

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.789 
the external face so that's in city in
setting<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.600> first<00:01:57.840> truss<00:01:58.109> and<00:01:58.319> the<00:01:58.350> last

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
setting the first truss and the last

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.700 
setting the first truss and the last
rows<00:01:59.009> inside<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.240> building<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.380> degree

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710

we'll<00:02:04.250> also<00:02:04.400> take<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:04.850> look<00:02:04.970> at<00:02:05.210> how<00:02:05.390> we<00:02:05.450> can

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
we'll also take a look at how we can

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.230 
we'll also take a look at how we can
derive<00:02:06.620> our<00:02:06.890> two-dimensional<00:02:07.280> drawing

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240

moving into a top view here we can see

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.860 
moving into a top view here we can see
that<00:02:59.660> we<00:02:59.959> have<00:03:00.200> three<00:03:01.100> little<00:03:01.370> markers

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
that we have three little markers

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
construction points which I'm going to

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.390 
construction points which I'm going to
use<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.780> snap<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.470> but<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:07.010> just<00:03:07.130> Dillon

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
use to snap to but it just Dillon

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.710 
use to snap to but it just Dillon
straight<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.880> points<00:03:08.180> we're<00:03:08.360> picking

here<00:03:09.380> on<00:03:09.620> our<00:03:09.830> drawing<00:03:10.130> so<00:03:10.730> we<00:03:10.850> have<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:12.070> the

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
here on our drawing so we have the the

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.040 
here on our drawing so we have the the
span<00:03:13.370> but<00:03:14.120> then<00:03:14.269> projected<00:03:14.750> onto<00:03:14.900> the

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
span but then projected onto the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.400 
span but then projected onto the
external<00:03:15.680> wall<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.870> likewise<00:03:17.870> on<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.260> other

external wall and likewise on the other
two<00:03:18.560> corners<00:03:19.120> so<00:03:20.120> let's<00:03:20.330> go<00:03:20.480> for<00:03:20.690> our<00:03:20.950> trust

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
two corners so let's go for our trust

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.790 
two corners so let's go for our trust
all<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:25.730> AET<00:03:26.090> trusts<00:03:26.480> we<00:03:26.630> have<00:03:26.810> our<00:03:26.989> I<00:03:27.290> trust

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
all the AET trusts we have our I trust

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.790 
all the AET trusts we have our I trust
type<00:03:28.040> we<00:03:28.970> have<00:03:29.209> our<00:03:29.360> span<00:03:29.750> if<00:03:30.080> we<00:03:30.200> want<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.440> to

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
type we have our span if we want to to

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.320 
type we have our span if we want to to
choose<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.040> different<00:03:31.250> span<00:03:31.610> we<00:03:31.790> can<00:03:31.940> pick<00:03:32.209> it

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
choose a different span we can pick it

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.949 
choose a different span we can pick it
from<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.630> drawing<00:03:32.989> as<00:03:33.470> a<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:34.190> have<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.269> couple<00:03:35.840> of

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
from the drawing as a I have a couple of

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.930 
from the drawing as a I have a couple of
construction<00:03:36.769> points<00:03:37.100> that<00:03:37.220> I<00:03:37.250> can<00:03:37.519> use<00:03:37.760> for

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
construction points that I can use for

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.840 
construction points that I can use for
that<00:03:38.030> so<00:03:38.480> I'm<00:03:38.570> just<00:03:38.720> going<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:39.459> pick<00:03:40.459> this<00:03:40.610> ban

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
that so I'm just going to pick this ban

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.400 
that so I'm just going to pick this ban
from<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.180> drawing<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:41.959> can<00:03:42.110> see<00:03:42.260> that

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
from the drawing and you can see that

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.670 
from the drawing and you can see that
gets<00:03:42.620> entered<00:03:42.920> into<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:44.390> box<00:03:44.600> there<00:03:44.900> we

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
gets entered into the the box there we

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.350 
gets entered into the the box there we
have<00:03:45.830> that<00:03:45.980> pitch<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.670> these<00:03:47.120> are

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
have that pitch and these are

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.670 
have that pitch and these are
implemented<00:03:47.720> at<00:03:48.080> two<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:48.799> a<00:03:48.830> half<00:03:48.980> degrees<00:03:50.680> we

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
implemented at two and a half degrees we

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.900 
implemented at two and a half degrees we
have<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:51.980> overhangs<00:03:52.340> so<00:03:52.640> all<00:03:52.850> over<00:03:53.000> say<00:03:53.269> our

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
have the overhangs so all over say our

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.770 
have the overhangs so all over say our
span<00:03:55.910> by<00:03:56.420> by<00:03:57.080> the<00:03:57.140> amount<00:03:58.040> we<00:03:58.250> specify<00:03:59.120> and

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
span by by the amount we specify and

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.960 
span by by the amount we specify and
we've<00:03:59.870> got<00:04:00.019> a<00:04:00.049> 600<00:04:00.590> spacing<00:04:01.040> and<00:04:01.400> I'm<00:04:01.700> going<00:04:01.880> to

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
we've got a 600 spacing and I'm going to

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.900 
we've got a 600 spacing and I'm going to
create<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.390> Rope<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:04.010> construction<00:04:04.549> points

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
create the Rope the construction points

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.150 
create the Rope the construction points
there<00:04:05.060> just<00:04:05.269> to<00:04:05.360> lock<00:04:05.510> onto<00:04:05.750> those<00:04:06.080> and<00:04:06.470> then

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
there just to lock onto those and then

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.150 
there just to lock onto those and then

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
roof trusses and we can see instantly

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.560 
roof trusses and we can see instantly
that<00:04:11.900> it's<00:04:12.200> offset<00:04:12.920> the<00:04:13.190> trustees<00:04:13.579> inside<00:04:14.359> of

orbit<00:04:20.760> will<00:04:21.120> see<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.389> we<00:04:21.510> now<00:04:21.720> have<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:23.070> roof

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
orbit will see that we now have the roof

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.070 
orbit will see that we now have the roof

and<00:04:46.080> we're<00:04:46.530> looking<00:04:46.800> in<00:04:46.979> that<00:04:47.430> direction

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
and we're looking in that direction

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.310 
and we're looking in that direction
and<00:04:48.539> we'll<00:04:48.690> put<00:04:48.900> a<00:04:49.039> section<00:04:50.180> here<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.990> there

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
and we'll put a section here and there

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.320 
and we'll put a section here and there
is<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:53.780> 2d<00:04:54.780> section<00:04:55.229> complete<00:04:55.889> with<00:04:56.100> detail

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
is a 2d section complete with detail

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.360 
is a 2d section complete with detail
one<00:04:58.990> further<00:04:59.230> thing<00:04:59.380> that<00:04:59.710> we<00:04:59.800> can<00:04:59.980> do<00:05:00.130> with

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
one further thing that we can do with

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.030 
one further thing that we can do with
the<00:05:00.610> roof<00:05:01.030> trusses<00:05:01.380> it<00:05:02.380> actually<00:05:02.680> changed

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
the roof trusses it actually changed

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.710 
the roof trusses it actually changed
them<00:05:03.160> for<00:05:03.310> different<00:05:03.430> profiles<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.540> roof

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
them for different profiles the roof

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.480 
them for different profiles the roof
trusses<00:05:04.930> are<00:05:05.170> subject<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:05.680> a<00:05:05.830> profile

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
trusses are subject to a profile

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.870 
trusses are subject to a profile
definition<00:05:07.120> so<00:05:07.330> if<00:05:07.630> we<00:05:08.020> have<00:05:08.770> created<00:05:09.340> another

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
definition so if we have created another

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.440 
definition so if we have created another
roof<00:05:10.150> truss<00:05:10.680> within<00:05:11.680> our<00:05:11.860> drawing<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.400> so<00:05:13.330> we

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
roof truss within our drawing and so we

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.020 
roof truss within our drawing and so we
want<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.950> exchange<00:05:14.950> the<00:05:15.340> one<00:05:15.520> for<00:05:15.730> the<00:05:15.820> other

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
want to exchange the one for the other

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.150 
want to exchange the one for the other
if<00:05:16.300> I<00:05:16.420> just<00:05:16.600> select<00:05:16.810> my<00:05:17.290> roof<00:05:17.470> trusses<00:05:17.770> in<00:05:17.950> here

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
if I just select my roof trusses in here

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.880 
if I just select my roof trusses in here
I'll<00:05:18.910> just<00:05:19.060> use<00:05:19.270> object<00:05:19.660> properties<00:05:20.110> and<00:05:20.440> then

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
I'll just use object properties and then

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.270 
I'll just use object properties and then
filter<00:05:21.220> down<00:05:21.550> on<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:22.890> objects<00:05:23.890> which<00:05:24.010> are<00:05:24.160> our

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
filter down on the objects which are our

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.190 
filter down on the objects which are our
roof<00:05:24.550> trusses<00:05:24.820> here<00:05:25.150> we'll<00:05:25.690> see<00:05:25.840> that<00:05:25.960> we<00:05:26.080> have

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
roof trusses here we'll see that we have

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.820 
roof trusses here we'll see that we have
the<00:05:26.320> profile<00:05:26.800> now<00:05:27.790> if<00:05:28.030> I<00:05:28.440> change<00:05:29.440> it<00:05:29.590> to<00:05:29.650> an

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
the profile now if I change it to an

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.090 
the profile now if I change it to an
attic<00:05:30.070> trust<00:05:30.900> and<00:05:31.900> that's<00:05:32.050> how<00:05:32.230> easy<00:05:32.260> it<00:05:32.560> is<00:05:32.740> to

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
attic trust and that's how easy it is to

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.620 
attic trust and that's how easy it is to
change<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.400> roof<00:05:33.550> truss<00:05:33.760> profiles<00:05:34.210> within

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
change the roof truss profiles within

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.460 
change the roof truss profiles within
Keti<00:05:36.360> so<00:05:37.360> you<00:05:37.450> see<00:05:37.600> that<00:05:37.750> by<00:05:37.930> using<00:05:37.960> connect

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
Keti so you see that by using connect

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.830 
Keti so you see that by using connect
these<00:05:38.590> 16<00:05:38.980> say<00:05:39.220> easy<00:05:39.580> tools<00:05:39.880> you<00:05:40.390> can<00:05:40.540> not<00:05:40.660> only

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
these 16 say easy tools you can not only

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.890 
these 16 say easy tools you can not only
create<00:05:41.080> your<00:05:41.380> models<00:05:42.340> your<00:05:42.790> roof<00:05:43.630> trust

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
create your models your roof trust

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.060 
create your models your roof trust
layouts<00:05:44.290> you<00:05:44.800> can<00:05:44.950> also<00:05:45.070> section<00:05:45.670> them<00:05:45.820> to
