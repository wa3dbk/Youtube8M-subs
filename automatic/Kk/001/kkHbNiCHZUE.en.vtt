girls bathroom let's go to studio that
was<00:02:16.820> how<00:02:16.970> we<00:02:17.030> met<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.569> and<00:02:18.020> it's<00:02:18.500> all<00:02:18.650> history

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
was how we met and and it's all history

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.710 
was how we met and and it's all history
from<00:02:19.430> there

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.030 

so<00:02:22.720> we<00:02:23.080> got<00:02:23.260> engaged<00:02:23.560> in<00:02:24.310> January<00:02:25.030> 2009<00:02:26.040> so

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
so we got engaged in January 2009 so

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.310 
so we got engaged in January 2009 so
it's<00:02:27.190> very<00:02:27.340> exciting<00:02:27.490> time<00:02:28.120> for<00:02:28.150> us<00:02:28.450> we

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
it's very exciting time for us we

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.990 
it's very exciting time for us we
actually<00:02:29.500> don't<00:02:29.830> have<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.250> wedding<00:02:30.640> date<00:02:30.940> yet

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
actually don't have a wedding date yet

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.740 
actually don't have a wedding date yet
so<00:02:31.930> it's<00:02:32.200> kind<00:02:32.470> of<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.770> unique<00:02:33.070> long<00:02:33.790> engagement

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
so it's kind of a unique long engagement

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.250 
so it's kind of a unique long engagement
the<00:02:35.680> reason<00:02:36.070> for<00:02:36.100> this<00:02:36.280> is<00:02:36.670> because<00:02:37.210> I<00:02:37.870> really

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
the reason for this is because I really

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.220 
the reason for this is because I really
want<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.590> take<00:02:38.740> my<00:02:38.980> time<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.310> really<00:02:39.700> enjoy<00:02:40.230> the
