00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.310 
sticky at first but then that went away
as<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.009> dried<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:48.270> 25<00:01:48.659> minutes<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.079> pretty

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
as it dried so 25 minutes is pretty

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.069 
as it dried so 25 minutes is pretty
average<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.979> was<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.369> wasn't<00:01:50.700> too<00:01:50.850> long<00:01:51.090> wasn't

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
average it was it wasn't too long wasn't

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.260 
average it was it wasn't too long wasn't
super<00:01:52.380> fast<00:01:52.619> either<00:01:52.890> though<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.090> don't

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
super fast either though and you don't

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.340 
super fast either though and you don't
really<00:01:54.509> need<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> worry<00:01:54.869> about<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.259> getting

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
really need to worry about it getting

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.190 
really need to worry about it getting
messy<00:01:55.920> as<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.549> dries<00:01:56.790> um<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.840> said<00:01:57.869> it's

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
messy as it dries um like I said it's

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.749 
messy as it dries um like I said it's
white<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:59.040> don't<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.399> worry<00:01:59.549> about<00:01:59.670> a

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
white you don't have to worry about a

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.490 
white you don't have to worry about a
dark-eyed<00:02:00.180> staining<00:02:00.689> your<00:02:00.780> clothes<00:02:01.079> or<00:02:01.409> your

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
dark-eyed staining your clothes or your

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.090 
dark-eyed staining your clothes or your
bedsheets

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
bedsheets

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.569 
bedsheets
so<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.060> that's<00:02:03.299> nice<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.950> color<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.399> one

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
so that that's nice the color this one

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.119 
so that that's nice the color this one
produced<00:02:05.909> was<00:02:06.149> really<00:02:06.659> light<00:02:06.899> I'd<00:02:07.680> say<00:02:07.979> this

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
produced was really light I'd say this

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.309 
produced was really light I'd say this
is<00:02:08.190> more<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.759> tan<00:02:09.000> extender<00:02:09.629> than<00:02:09.810> an<00:02:09.929> actual

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
is more of a tan extender than an actual

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.370 
is more of a tan extender than an actual
self-tanner<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.910> would<00:02:12.540> probably<00:02:12.780> work

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
self-tanner it would probably work

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.320 
self-tanner it would probably work
well<00:02:13.590> as<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.830> tannic<00:02:14.580> center<00:02:14.880> but<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.150> one

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
well as a tannic center but this one

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.230 
well as a tannic center but this one
just<00:02:15.510> gave<00:02:15.690> me<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> nice<00:02:16.200> glow<00:02:16.710> so<00:02:17.550> my<00:02:17.790> tan<00:02:18.030> was

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
just gave me a nice glow so my tan was

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.390 
just gave me a nice glow so my tan was
so<00:02:18.540> light<00:02:18.870> maybe<00:02:19.200> one<00:02:19.560> shade<00:02:19.830> darker<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.340> was

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
so light maybe one shade darker it was

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.330 
so light maybe one shade darker it was
more<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.850> glow<00:02:21.180> than<00:02:21.480> an<00:02:21.600> actual<00:02:21.960> tan<00:02:22.380> and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
more of a glow than an actual tan and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.770 
more of a glow than an actual tan and
you<00:02:23.460> guys<00:02:23.610> know<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.820> like<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.090> be<00:02:24.210> pretty<00:02:24.510> dark

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
you guys know I like to be pretty dark

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.450 
you guys know I like to be pretty dark
so<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:24.960> wasn't<00:02:25.140> really<00:02:25.440> happy<00:02:25.740> with<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.040> color

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
so I wasn't really happy with this color

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.760 
so I wasn't really happy with this color
it<00:02:27.090> was<00:02:27.330> smooth<00:02:27.750> unnatural<00:02:28.320> looking<00:02:28.590> but

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
it was smooth unnatural looking but

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.470 
it was smooth unnatural looking but
that's<00:02:28.920> probably<00:02:29.220> because<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.670> was<00:02:29.820> so<00:02:30.060> light

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
that's probably because it was so light

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.220 
that's probably because it was so light
I<00:02:30.780> actually<00:02:31.410> read<00:02:31.830> some<00:02:32.460> other<00:02:32.580> views<00:02:32.820> online

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
I actually read some other views online

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.600 
I actually read some other views online

this<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.350> don't<00:02:44.220> think<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.910> men<00:02:45.240> will<00:02:45.570> like

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
this I don't think that men will like

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.840 
this I don't think that men will like
this<00:02:46.020> product<00:02:46.500> because<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.430> light<00:02:47.670> and

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
this product because it is so light and

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.430 
this product because it is so light and
it's<00:02:47.910> also<00:02:48.120> on<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.420> pricier<00:02:48.870> side<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.350> it

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
it's also on the pricier side and it

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.190 
it's also on the pricier side and it
smells<00:02:49.770> pretty<00:02:49.950> gross<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.610> lasts<00:02:51.570> about<00:02:51.660> two

smells pretty gross it lasts about two

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.780 
smells pretty gross it lasts about two
days<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:52.770> after<00:02:53.010> about<00:02:53.160> two<00:02:53.430> days<00:02:53.460> you'll<00:02:53.760> have

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
days so after about two days you'll have

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.670 
days so after about two days you'll have
