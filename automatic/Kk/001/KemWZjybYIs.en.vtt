00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.030
 He says 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.020
 happy about the story but not what 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.490
 it happened well at all driving because 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.279
 obviously what we like is to run 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.430
 give the all for the whole and man book 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.660
 of the rally broke from that cabral 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.520
 had the fault in the first stretch to 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.060
 from then on it was clear that 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.240
 you had to lower engine revolutions 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.550
 power all because it is clear that the 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.490
 it 's long to say economically 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.350
 we do not count the sponsors and good 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.850
 that has made us what we never had 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.480
 I want to take out the calculator 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.460
 of the rally but 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.460
 lowering the pace that is the section by section 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.190
 and now we will have to see if we are capable 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.350
 to be in the telde 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.380
 an effort once more luckily 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.850
 practically we have not found that 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.000
 have nothing now we will have to dismantle and 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.370
 review everything and now good now 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.660
 and it is clear that at a public level lowered 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.660
 at the end a little but he 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.960
 with the unfortunate abandonment of 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.960
 vicente bolaÃ±os 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.940
 see them now and in the goal of 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.530
 we encrypted waiting for them to arrive 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.880
 pick it up because the truth was to do 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.630
 a great career and he deserved to have 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.630
 been on the podium 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.540
 and we have him 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.200
 the machines 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.020
 and a pretty pretty result 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.660
 important and good to see if we can 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.920
 keep adding to the box that now does not 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.020
 they are needed after santa's fiasco 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.730
 brigid and I will continue adding to see if 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.090
 we have the same fate that today was a 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.680
 Rally quite different than normal with 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.780
 new stretches where we had never 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.630
 past and on to add that those 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.819
 stretches were complicated then now 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.950
 that it has not been a phase but it's clear 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.180
 that still only three tests have passed 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.989
 of the championship and what to follow 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.989
 fighting pages 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.680
 webber 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.840
 has to be the view that knew normal 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.540
 I would have been talking and I feel that 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.250
 the year is already more complicated but good 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.110
 the races are like this, sometimes it's your turn 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.819
 one to the road I left again that or if 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.330
 we know enough about us 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.700
 what the third step of the podium no 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.040
 it tastes like glory because in our first 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.180
 podium greeted our sports career 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.310
 take out very happy 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.800
 of having achieved it at the end 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.360
 the knowledge of the car is fundamental 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.610
 because we are crowd did is 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.900
 work on the car this year we thought 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.700
 that we already had a little better 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.950
 after lay life but really 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.910
 more work is still hears 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.440
 there is a lot to cut and I say no 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.210
 happens that as you well say very 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.850
 excited above all as a post 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.920
 does angel that works pretty well 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.950
 here in the Canary Islands nothing any problem of 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.130
 no type and super happy to be 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.130
 all right 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.590
 We were not expecting so much and little by little 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.110
 I'm doing to the car and Orlando that I 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.810
 it helps a lot and we had the 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.780
 result 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.780
 too happy when they have me 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.509
 good is my copy and he told me later 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.259
 of when we finished the recruitment in 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:30.470
 very already to be the last to show us 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:35.289
 I really did not want to know times nor 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.289
 nothing quite happy 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.160
 I seemed 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
 all right 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.470
 and 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.400
 and there we have the 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.880
 dedicate the transition that has come to 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.270
 the quality mornings 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.270
 Y 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.310
