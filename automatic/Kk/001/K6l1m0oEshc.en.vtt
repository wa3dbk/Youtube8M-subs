00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
happening they would wrangle or destroy

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.050 
happening they would wrangle or destroy
their<00:02:49.870> sentries<00:02:50.230> they<00:02:51.190> would<00:02:51.400> stop<00:02:51.760> shooting

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
their sentries they would stop shooting

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.430 
their sentries they would stop shooting
each<00:02:52.150> other<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.480> they<00:02:52.570> would<00:02:52.690> focus<00:02:53.019> solely

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
each other and they would focus solely

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.890 
each other and they would focus solely
on<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.800> bus<00:02:53.950> which<00:02:54.910> I<00:02:55.150> guess<00:02:55.330> is<00:02:55.360> it's<00:02:55.720> not

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
on the bus which I guess is it's not

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.810 
on the bus which I guess is it's not
just<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.739> community<00:02:57.160> event<00:02:57.220> it's<00:02:57.459> also<00:02:57.610> the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
just a community event it's also the

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.699 
just a community event it's also the
fact<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.299> can<00:02:58.450> get<00:02:58.600> a<00:02:58.660> hat<00:02:58.870> from<00:02:59.049> it<00:02:59.230> so<00:02:59.470> I

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
fact that you can get a hat from it so I

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.470 
fact that you can get a hat from it so I
get<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.400> it's<00:03:00.519> not<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.760> completely<00:03:00.910> selfless

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
get that it's not a completely selfless

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.000 
get that it's not a completely selfless
action<00:03:02.049> it's<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.440> fact<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.680> they<00:03:02.799> want<00:03:02.950> the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
action it's the fact that they want the

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.289 
action it's the fact that they want the

interesting<00:03:04.510> like<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.170> moment<00:03:05.799> marasmus

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
interesting like the moment marasmus

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.940 
interesting like the moment marasmus

other<00:03:13.360> players<00:03:13.600> it<00:03:13.989> was<00:03:14.260> just<00:03:14.500> marasmus<00:03:15.070> I

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
other players it was just marasmus I

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.949 
other players it was just marasmus I
thought<00:03:15.370> it<00:03:15.430> was<00:03:15.549> really<00:03:15.640> interesting<00:03:16.030> the

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
thought it was really interesting the

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.870 
thought it was really interesting the
fact<00:03:17.200> that<00:03:17.290> obviously<00:03:18.040> team<00:03:18.340> fortress<00:03:18.730> 2

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
fact that obviously team fortress 2

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.090 
fact that obviously team fortress 2
promotes<00:03:19.180> team<00:03:19.930> based<00:03:20.260> gameplay<00:03:20.500> but<00:03:20.920> the

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
promotes team based gameplay but the

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.890 
promotes team based gameplay but the
fact<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:21.430> they<00:03:22.060> can<00:03:22.239> do<00:03:22.329> this<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.600> bring<00:03:22.810> the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
fact that they can do this and bring the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.660 
fact that they can do this and bring the
two<00:03:23.019> teams<00:03:23.230> together<00:03:23.470> without<00:03:23.769> actually

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
two teams together without actually

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.920 
two teams together without actually
forcing<00:03:25.209> them<00:03:25.360> I<00:03:25.480> thought<00:03:25.600> it<00:03:25.690> was<00:03:25.810> really

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
forcing them I thought it was really

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.360 
forcing them I thought it was really
interesting<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.620> when<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:26.860> was<00:03:26.950> happening<00:03:27.070> I

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
interesting and when it was happening I

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.610

really<00:03:29.620> interesting<00:03:30.010> thing<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.459> fact<00:03:30.670> that

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
really interesting thing the fact that

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.670 
really interesting thing the fact that
this<00:03:30.910> one<00:03:31.420> boss<00:03:31.630> sporting<00:03:32.019> provides<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.500> sort

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
of community among the two teams even

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.449 
of community among the two teams even
though<00:03:35.470> we<00:03:35.590> can't<00:03:35.799> kill<00:03:35.950> each<00:03:36.100> other<00:03:36.160> we're

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
though we can't kill each other we're

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.890 
though we can't kill each other we're
not<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:36.880> thought<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.480> was<00:03:37.540> really<00:03:37.660> interesting

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900
