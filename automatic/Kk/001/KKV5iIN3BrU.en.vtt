area I added a bigger TV in here because

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.730 
area I added a bigger TV in here because

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
or just like the table I guess and then

or just like the table I guess and then
the<00:01:45.299> kitchen<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.579> come<00:01:47.700> outside

guys<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.840> what<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> changed<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> most<00:01:49.590> I

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
guys this is what I changed the most I

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.160 
guys this is what I changed the most I
added<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> little<00:01:51.060> bit<00:01:51.240> more<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.570> backyard<00:01:51.780> as

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
added a little bit more of a backyard as

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.630 
added a little bit more of a backyard as
you<00:01:52.290> guys<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.619> see<00:01:52.680> last<00:01:53.130> time<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.399> was<00:01:53.520> pretty

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
you guys can see last time it was pretty

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.300 
you guys can see last time it was pretty
barren<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.380> I<00:01:55.380> actually<00:01:55.649> increased<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
barren and I actually increased the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.590 
barren and I actually increased the
height<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.640> these<00:01:56.729> shrubs<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.270> one<00:01:57.450> more

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
height of these shrubs so one more

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.870 
height of these shrubs so one more
blocks<00:01:57.840> now<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.259> two<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.310> added<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.640> cool

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
blocks now it's two so I added this cool

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.469 
blocks now it's two so I added this cool
pool<00:02:00.119> area<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.770> just<00:02:01.770> giving<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.250> guys<00:02:02.280> some

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
pool area and just giving you guys some

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.100 
pool area and just giving you guys some
inspiration<00:02:03.479> for<00:02:03.600> stuff<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.990> could

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
inspiration for stuff that you could

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.389 
inspiration for stuff that you could
build<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.740> would<00:02:04.920> recommend<00:02:05.219> putting

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
build that I would recommend putting

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.600 
build that I would recommend putting
some<00:02:05.579> snow<00:02:06.030> blocks<00:02:06.420> not<00:02:07.320> like<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> snow<00:02:08.429> box

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
some snow blocks not like the snow box

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.800 
some snow blocks not like the snow box
but<00:02:08.759> like<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.910> little<00:02:09.030> mats<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.539> guess<00:02:09.690> you

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
but like the little mats I guess you

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.940 
but like the little mats I guess you
could<00:02:09.929> say

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
could say

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.580 
could say
on<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.880> layer<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:13.050> your<00:02:13.170> pool<00:02:13.410> like

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
on like the layer of your pool like

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.960 
on like the layer of your pool like
around<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.920> edge<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.160> gives<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> little<00:02:14.790> bit

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
around the edge it gives it a little bit

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.190 
around the edge it gives it a little bit
more<00:02:15.060> depth<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.570> actually<00:02:15.870> makes<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.080> look

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
more depth and actually makes it look

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.920 
more depth and actually makes it look
real<00:02:16.410> slick<00:02:16.710> so<00:02:17.670> guys<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.540> reason<00:02:18.750> why<00:02:18.840> it

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
real slick so guys and the reason why it

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.630 
real slick so guys and the reason why it
looks<00:02:18.960> so<00:02:19.110> deep<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.650> wash<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.220> gave<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.580> away

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
looks so deep I wash I just gave it away

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.310 
looks so deep I wash I just gave it away
but<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.270> reason<00:02:21.510> why<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.660> looks<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:21.840> deep<00:02:22.140> in

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
but the reason why it looks so deep in

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.690 
but the reason why it looks so deep in
the<00:02:22.380> pool<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.680> because<00:02:22.920> if<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.070> place<00:02:23.310> ice<00:02:23.430> in

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
the pool is because if you place ice in

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.340 
the pool is because if you place ice in
the<00:02:23.790> bottom<00:02:23.910> layer<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.300> pool<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.900> actually

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
the bottom layer of the pool it actually

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.720 
the bottom layer of the pool it actually
makes<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.560> look<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.830> lot<00:02:25.980> deeper<00:02:26.220> than<00:02:26.490> it<00:02:26.580> is

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
makes it look a lot deeper than it is

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.330 
makes it look a lot deeper than it is
which<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.450> cool<00:02:27.930> little<00:02:28.020> effect<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.650> just

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
which is a cool little effect so just

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.530 
which is a cool little effect so just
guys<00:02:29.460> giving<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.790> guys<00:02:29.880> more<00:02:30.060> inspiration

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
guys giving you guys more inspiration

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.760 
guys giving you guys more inspiration
maybe<00:02:30.690> something<00:02:31.020> didn't<00:02:31.260> know<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.620> then<00:02:31.710> you

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
maybe something didn't know and then you

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.680 
maybe something didn't know and then you
can<00:02:31.890> actually<00:02:32.130> swim<00:02:32.370> up<00:02:32.580> through<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.540> bottom

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
can actually swim up through the bottom

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.810 
can actually swim up through the bottom
of<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.960> pool<00:02:34.140> into<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.220> hot<00:02:35.370> tub<00:02:35.400> pretty

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
of the pool into the hot tub pretty

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.940 
of the pool into the hot tub pretty
awesome<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:37.170> can<00:02:37.320> sit<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.590> hot<00:02:37.709> tub<00:02:37.890> and

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
awesome you can sit in the hot tub and

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.740 
awesome you can sit in the hot tub and
the<00:02:38.130> hot<00:02:38.490> tubs<00:02:38.640> kind<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:38.910> like<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.180> on<00:02:39.300> higher

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
the hot tubs kind of like it on higher

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.180 
the hot tubs kind of like it on higher
layer<00:02:40.110> than<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.470> pool<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.680> think<00:02:40.800> it's<00:02:41.040> one<00:02:41.130> of

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
layer than the pool I think it's one of

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.890 
layer than the pool I think it's one of
my<00:02:41.250> favorite<00:02:41.490> pools<00:02:41.610> I've<00:02:41.760> built<00:02:41.970> some<00:02:42.690> cool

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
my favorite pools I've built some cool

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.230 
my favorite pools I've built some cool
ideas<00:02:43.200> here<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.640> then<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.820> know<00:02:44.910> obviously

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
ideas here and then you know obviously

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.360 
ideas here and then you know obviously
this<00:02:45.390> was<00:02:45.540> here<00:02:45.690> before<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.260> then<00:02:47.220> if<00:02:47.310> you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
this was here before and then if you

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.320 
this was here before and then if you
come<00:02:47.459> over<00:02:47.610> here<00:02:47.820> this<00:02:47.940> supposed<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.209> be<00:02:48.300> a

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
come over here this supposed to be a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.620 
come over here this supposed to be a
tire<00:02:48.540> swing<00:02:48.780> it's<00:02:49.380> kind<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.620> bad<00:02:49.800> but<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.130> mean

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
tire swing it's kind of bad but I mean

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.300 
tire swing it's kind of bad but I mean
it's<00:02:51.630> okay<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.080> then<00:02:52.680> over<00:02:52.890> here<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.100> like<00:02:53.190> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
it's okay and then over here is like the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.910 
it's okay and then over here is like the
little<00:02:53.430> grill<00:02:53.700> area<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.270> just<00:02:54.480> added<00:02:54.600> some

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
little grill area I just added some

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.490 
little grill area I just added some
little<00:02:55.920> tables<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.550> can<00:02:56.640> say<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.500> the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
little tables you can say that so the
