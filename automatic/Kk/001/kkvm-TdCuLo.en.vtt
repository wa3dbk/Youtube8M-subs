00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.840
 purchase the most advanced defroster 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:30.439
 bovine semen available on the market 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.960
 the wp 100 will certainly contribute to the 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.210
 poverty rate and its herd 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.660
 valuing more and more for its 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.080
 investment in insemination as well as 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.510
 wpc usage instructions and warnings 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.840
 What are we going to show this video? 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.760
 simple but essential for the efficacy and 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.480
 durability of your product 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.860

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.100
 who should not be in the sun 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.520
 fill the beaker with clean water 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.580
 without residues until the brand interned as 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.460
 the water should always be two 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.549
 centimeters to edge league the cable 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.159

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.110
 a good automotive battery that works 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.290
 normally when you are leaving the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.290
 car 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.390
 after connecting the appliance to the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.600

 automatically within 20 seconds to 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.830
 and 30 seconds for the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.670
 when the water reaches 34 degrees 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.970
 Celsius 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.340
 the wpc emits a beep and 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.100
 display in place of the message, please wait 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.239
 a computer will appear indicating that the

 the straws in the glass up to four at a time 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.459
 with the bushing facing down and the seal 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.980
 from the enclosure up the vanes should 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.940
 completely submerged in water and 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.549
 attention 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.100
 if there are thin and medium vanes together 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.680
 choose the average pick time 30 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.079
 seconds to avoid risk 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.549
 affects the time key to start the 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:03.060
 time counting 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.980
 the wpc will beep when the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.739
 blades are ready for 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.720
 insemination know that after the 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.810
 thawing of the first batch 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.840
 the temperature will remain constant at 35 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.570
 degrees and you can restart the count 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.420
 how many times do you want until I finish 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.000
 all desired inseminations without 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.120
 need to restart the process 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.200
 I want more practicality than this I do 31 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.420
 disconnecting and sanitizing the appliance 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.120
 To switch the appliance off, press the 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.280
 on off 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.900
 the temperature indicator will rise from 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.510
 display after using your wp without securing it well 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:54.409
 before storing a 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:57.560
 and a glass physically afterwards. 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:00.310
 dry the air and the equipment and its 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.310
 transport 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.180
 save time avoid putting water in 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.609
 temperature above 35 degrees celsius 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.859
 in the glass or leaving the equipment 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.019
 very warm place before use 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.660
 when you connect the car 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.300
 temperature is above 37 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.630
 degrees celsius a message will appear. 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.610
 temperature and is harmful to the 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.460
 time for the temperature to drop to 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.470
 low of 37 degrees celsius is time consuming 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.740
 can delay your work 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.230
 insemination in this case to accelerate 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.520
 cooling you can put cold water 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.290
 on the appliance body several times 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.350
 But before re-use 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.870
 defroster let stand for 15 minutes. 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.540
 minutes with cold water in the glass so that 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.860
 prior stabilization of the 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:04.680
 temperature automotive batteries 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.030
 if I had the battery powered b100 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.120
 automotive 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.460
 thanks to a bad battery the device 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.100
 may issue a warning 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.130
 presenting the message low battery 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.020
 in this case if the appliance does not 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:23.040
 can leave the heating process 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.730
 continue until the water reaches 1 35 degrees 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.240
 Celsius 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:30.000
 I ignore low battery wpc 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.100
 in an economic unit and descent 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.210
 leakage energy to maintain the temperature 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.680
 Water not a low battery can nab 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.300
 until it disappears 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.110
 the appliance continues to operate 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.610
 usually after heating 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.460
 however we recommend that you 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:51.960
 Provides a new battery more 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:54.540
 possible guarantee that your 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.090
 tablet pc is always on top 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.760
 conditions of use it is necessary that 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.580
 handled with minimal care by a 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.950
 cost and waterproof 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.740
 we recommend that you come in the 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.620
 your deicer the conditions of your 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.020
 guarantee, however we will cut 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.830
 two warnings 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.110
 which may also void that guarantee if 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.690
 your device is transported out of the 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.800
 or if the seals are broken 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.449
 differential 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:30.449
 the wpc has three ponds 2 on top in the 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:34.409
 cap screws and one on the side 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:37.289
 out of the car so always remember 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:41.099
 uses a carrying case and does not 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:42.990
 the care seals 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:46.590
 store the appliance closed 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:49.020
 Dry not protected and transportation without wv

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.020
 repeated shocks or vibrations may 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.069
 be damaging to electronics and sledgehammer 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.889
 carriage 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:07:01.800
 attention if you notice a haze 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:04.590
 inside display of the display and 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.630
 this is not normal and may mean that 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.810
 water has entered the appliance 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.949
 If this happens send your wp 6 to 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.219
 that there is immediately the re-pa 

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:17.190
 ready 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:20.039
 follow all the guidelines that we have

 be wpc and if you have questions you may 

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:28.949
 watch the video as many times as you want 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.560
 refer to the manual or even call

 answer time for bovine semen freezer 

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:44.960
 not have robustness and need to ensure 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.960
 the success of the insemination of his flock
