00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello to you all again step weiss and this 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.649
 my rubric called mechanisms in 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.650
 minecraft 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.940
 2 series today I will show how to do 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:19.289
 simple machine gun look like he 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.519
 It works here actually 3 distributors here 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.910
 such from the opinion shemka from the table on 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:30.650
 redstone held and lever that's how he 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:36.020
 works in turn and what will happen if 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:44.520
 I will put arrows in these distributors 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:47.460
 1 2 3 and so we look as you see the arrows 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.430
 very quickly fly well, you can comment 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.710
 say very quickly and so can they 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:59.160
 easy to assemble but we better not 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:04.140
 shoot i will show how this is built 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:08.060
 scheme we need to put three distributors 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:14.250
 in this way, now retreat 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:18.920
 two blocks we put the lever here now with 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:25.650
 spend him some red dust 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:28.070
 set opposite distributors here and here 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.120
 a rock 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:38.910
 here here and here red dust here and 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:42.480
 here, too, and so here we have 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:47.840
 it turns out you can even a little closer 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:52.170
 from here you let it be you decide it and 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:56.720
 actually so turn off and I for more 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.720
 here here here you need to put everything 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:06.960
 we actually carry red dust 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.090
 there you choose where you will 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.770
 more profitable to put red dust 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:20.610
 Well, that's something like this naturally 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:21.900
 We set for us to see it works 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.820
 line and arrows 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:30.900
 click on the lever and in general everything works 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:34.860
 let's clean so let's let's 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.430
 remove the creative now and see what happens with 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.030
 we will we get all that is 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:48.290
 very quickly you can build this 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:51.330
 for let's say our cards for passing 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.300
 use it in every way 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.120
 that's all with you was treading I 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.930
 ask you to put this video like 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.230
 if you do not mind throw off a few 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.780
 rubles a few rubles skinte me on 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.570
 webmoney so I can optimize 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:15.200
 channel naturally if you do not mind on 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.200
