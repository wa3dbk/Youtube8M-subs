00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.770
 hello, Santa Claus 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.170
 hello, how are you, sir? I hope so. 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.730
 Well, it's already Christmas time, and you 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.880
 have to work hard to meet 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.789
 many children, Santa would like 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.980
 to ask for my gift and my name and I 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.830
 I liked getting a sneaker or a 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.060
 sandal for christmas and new year 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.970
 if you could have given me this 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.490
 Thank you, but if you can not 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.080
 Thank you too. Merry Christmas. 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.870
 Brazil is a country that has a great 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.090
 population and every year 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.010
 this Christmas season children of various 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.020
 poor communities dream of winning 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.040
 gifts that can not afford to 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.079
 purchase 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.600
 That's why the Santa Claus Campaign 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.120
 Post office provides such 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.309
 children to come here to adopt 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.000
 pick a note and give a gift 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.000
 for these children 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.420
 the post office has existed since 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.880
 1997 is and she for the people 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.360
 participate, they visit our 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.620
 agencies and we have these letters 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.590
 available at the agencies of the 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.110
 people read and saw the requests 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.280
 what the children are doing and then yes 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.280
 they adopt the ages 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.969
 the people who are most favored at times 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.619
 not so much but at least to be able 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:37.570
 contribute with something and make a 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.610
 merry christmas child is a campaign 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.340
 fantastic because we have the condition 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.890
 to help a child adopt and maintain 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.090
 the picture of Santa and they have to 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.439
 believe that Santa has 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.569
 believe in the dream 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.390
 the child asks for example employment to 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.579
 the father is for example sometimes neither asks 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.369
 toy for them are worried about 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.319
 She sometimes asks for food. 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.450
 basket for the family so that 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.250
 spend a Christmas as a Christmas dinner 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.280
 for example last year people 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.110
 to handle 70,000 letters is not and 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.590
 we managed to get away with doing this 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.900
 dream of 70 thousand children that on the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.390
 perhaps without this campaign. 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.220
 I could get one and have a present on the day 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.220
 Christmas for a happier Christmas 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.860

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.260
