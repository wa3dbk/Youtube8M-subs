and the less the second-best team won 13
teams<00:04:24.070> games<00:04:24.670> at<00:04:24.910> home<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.300> they<00:04:25.810> made<00:04:25.960> the

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
teams games at home and they made the

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.670 
teams games at home and they made the
difference<00:04:26.320> there<00:04:26.770> and<00:04:27.480> and<00:04:28.480> against<00:04:29.260> a<00:04:29.440> team

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
difference there and and against a team

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.750 
difference there and and against a team
between<00:04:30.070> 10<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.280> 20<00:04:30.640> and<00:04:31.440> I<00:04:32.440> believe<00:04:33.040> that<00:04:33.070> we

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
between 10 and 20 and I believe that we

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.320 
between 10 and 20 and I believe that we
lost<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.120> championship<00:04:34.330> last<00:04:34.810> year<00:04:36.240> in<00:04:37.240> the

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
lost the championship last year in the

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.040 
lost the championship last year in the
top<00:04:37.780> in<00:04:38.170> the<00:04:38.380> first<00:04:38.620> 14<00:04:39.190> games<00:04:39.750> where<00:04:40.750> we<00:04:40.870> lost

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
top in the first 14 games where we lost

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.140 
top in the first 14 games where we lost
five<00:04:41.290> games<00:04:41.590> after<00:04:42.010> dost<00:04:42.250> only<00:04:42.580> one<00:04:42.760> in<00:04:43.000> the

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
five games after dost only one in the

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.680 
five games after dost only one in the
whole<00:04:43.270> season<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:44.400> I'm<00:04:45.400> convinced<00:04:45.910> that<00:04:46.270> the

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
whole season and I'm convinced that the

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.770 
whole season and I'm convinced that the
difference<00:04:47.140> of<00:04:47.320> potential<00:04:47.860> was<00:04:48.070> not<00:04:48.310> as<00:04:49.240> big

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
difference of potential was not as big

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.050 
difference of potential was not as big
as<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.110> number<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.530> points<00:04:50.740> indicates<00:04:51.430> it<00:04:51.640> the

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
as the number of points indicates it the

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.260 
as the number of points indicates it the
numbers<00:04:52.450> of<00:04:52.480> an<00:04:52.810> idol<00:04:53.200> had<00:04:53.980> always<00:04:54.190> a<00:04:54.370> weight

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
numbers of an idol had always a weight

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.440 
numbers of an idol had always a weight
in<00:04:55.600> their<00:04:56.590> game<00:04:56.830> because<00:04:57.700> he's<00:04:57.880> called<00:04:58.180> one

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
in their game because he's called one

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.280 
in their game because he's called one

play of that caliber is always difficult
