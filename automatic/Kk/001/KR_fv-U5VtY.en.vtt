00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.950
 he is one of the king of statistics agency he suspected 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.119
 his story is stinking 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.489
 yes i am very curious season of a coalition 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:15.679
 6 good morning what i need and i was that is a bit was 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.390
 leave them yourself 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.460
 you see that's the advice 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.369
 after all, it is not going at all here, but it is their own strength that would 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.369
 he kept himself 6 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.690
 French strike actions 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.830
 It is therefore this is not the amount plus interest capital the third quarter of this 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.800
 years, but that explains Roger Federer 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.140
 lisse sailing yacht is all that's it on 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.999
 this is a competition credit 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:48.449
 the program in the brain 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.920
 for someone personal 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.160
 And this is nobody 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.760
 this moment it is the first time a year to hold 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.700
 You then have the result when it comes to a dog's current college program 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.710
 for the next thirty years 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.800
 it is difficult 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.350
 which is going to pay 12 170 euros for my columns that is really way too much 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.940
 money 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.000
 that gives hope left in Antwerp 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.820
 finally 420 euros that people already a nice amount 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.280
 twelve 170 euros i assumed that the buyer wants the company would be that on 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.440
 this way to buy commercial would get the money and I would like that too 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.539
 the dog it is the focus time got sick and every ricoh has 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.390
 I would colere that I would deal 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.390
 but i had no business at all i got a younger man of 32 on the line 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.950
 who bought the call for them themselves also Marc the Dog Eraser 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.410
 I believe that I misunderstand 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.590
 I feel on my abbado to tell himself he turned out to be one of the youngest 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.400
 Internet entrepreneurs are owner of Veiling.nl that a few years ago 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.490
 I got recovered also I need you but could do a bit of it 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.119
 self-glorification of the young irritating rich picked up on display 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.499
 I have to swallow 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:57.029
 Makaay for twelve hundred possibly also in the tiebreak in a year 

00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:00.519
 so what do I care to bite through the sour apple but there 

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:04.679
 is to know more about this young richer could buy me quite the cnv so me 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.299
 start again with the explicit want to mention that mark 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.300
 didn't want the front runner out 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.350
 but that became important to me before I was just a writer 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.049
 to his actual visit 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.279
 Marc de Hond is indeed one of the first to be the youngest Internet entrepreneurs 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:18.330
 residents eighteenth 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.900
 and with that he sold this share that she trains in the village socially already 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.620
 succeeded but I started all over again 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.990
 all radio deejay and of course you also get land there but I was too 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.080
 involved in the first time swallow what years 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.399
 the limited daily ruperti exist among other things of the island 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:35.739
 but then fate struck fate 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.999
 but I also have a tumor in his spinal cord successful surgery only one 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.270
 medical blunder after that 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.170
 we had a partial paraplegia and ended up in a wheelchair 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.709
 radio cooperates to do what was often experienced about those miserable years and how 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.740
 on top of that you came across a badly moving book with the title power that 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.229
 has already experienced several fractures 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.319
 and mark started his third career he came in contact with it 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.400
 wheelchair basketball and also more effectively with amateurs, he quickly picked up on that 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:02.029
 two and a half years in the selection of the Dutch national basketball team and so on 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:06.079
 come to the core of this column but I think that is wheelchair basketball 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.879
 in the Netherlands a poor child in the media and the Netherlands has a good one 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.300
 very good team himself 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.129
 last year the netherlands became the wheelchair bakel who became european champion 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.239
 but it doesn't even feel there in the newspaper he says I leave that in the newspaper 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.790
 by which the globe had given the breasts of a woman between stations Randstad 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.099
 at a gas station and that plot too thick you had become thicker that state is 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.430
 in the newspaper marine that the dutch wheelchair basketball team 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.650
 European champion becomes yes that is not interesting enough that is of course possible 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.369
 that the quality was quite a bit because of the rolls of per game 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:41.109
 our national bank also has nothing to do with it in midfield 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.939
 People are afraid of the handicapped and prefer to look 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.679
 not to but I also know a lot of people who are scared 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:50.789
 vormer twice also would rather not go and see this that I am very strong 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:54.339
 argument the wheelchair basketball is likely to place next year 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:57.649
 for the Olympic Games in London N VA as the flagship of the 

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:58.479
 paralympics 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:01.229
 the team that consists of all boys with a special story shows 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.850
 market 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.080
 those who have become disabled have wikileaks 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.449
 train hard under what to do in life 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:10.119
 how nice it would be if all those in the media could get some attention and 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:14.199
 not because the disabled but the spectacular top sport is because of this 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.849
 started it really is a lot more fun to watch than for example a couple 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.370
 fat men became darts 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.910
 next year is about wheelchair basketball you know where the Netherlands can 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.110
 places for london how nice it would be to get some media attention 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.470
 could go even stronger the newspaper that failed to mention some 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.810
 persons were the two points 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.070
 and that also seems beautiful TV the personal stories of those guys 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.419
 Combining it with the games on to the Olympic Games it sounds like one 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.139
 exciting boys' book players like klm's mark on the ground althaus de 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.280
 brilliant game distributor it is heard 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.640
 the coach I have Jan van der Linden himself one of the best players in the world 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.470
 with those animals still not know at all but that is going to change all young 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.470
 animal misfortune have turned into something positive and special 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.100
 that we must send before being found and marc the dog with him same 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.570
 set the goal of putting wheelchair basketball on the map in the Netherlands 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.180
 but we are happy with that 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.199
 that he wants to participate himself, he pays out of his own pocket 12 170 euros girls 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.610
 can give orders to do a column about this but I think this was one 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.639
 peak year for those who newspaper boys breda are hurting willpower utility 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.060
 do you already feel right away with a weak bag of syrup or 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.639
 even to pay on euros 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.340
 and that is not going to announce me once i hope i want to and 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.770
 that certainly does not concern him 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.729
 no it is about a life story the other with regulated to beautiful 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.729
 things to do at this so have a merry christmas all the jobs 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.210
 to go 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:37.129
 have the name set 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.330
 we are enjoying it 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.169
 certainly the 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.129
 it is very easy to stand 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.129
 this year 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:46.509
 the year
