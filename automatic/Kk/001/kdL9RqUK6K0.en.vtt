00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.340

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.160
 welcome watercolor do not miss it 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.609
 here we are with liliana sylvia torÃ¡n 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.910
 it's really a pleasure to be in charge and 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.669
 legally created thank you 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.579
 Well, today we have a beautiful picture of 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.110
 flowers and made in acrylic but we 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.420
 you are going to teach how to do it is exactly 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.370
 we work with thinking first and spatula 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.190
 then good to play from below with 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.980
 spatula solines then I take advantage of 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.409
 tell our friends already 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.190
 in the kiosks paint tables number 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:53.739
 one since July 3 at the kiosks 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.609
 not to be missed because they are asking 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.390
 long ago pictures so I do not know the 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.300
 lose 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.149
 lily we hear you thank you thanks to you 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.360
 Mom how they are doing good morning we will 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:09.399
 start this picture that is made 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.460
 about an easy book we are working 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:16.790
 with the line of decorative acrylics 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.800
 eternal as always is anchored with 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:24.350
 these colors gray blue purple mist 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.850
 Victorian and then everything is worked 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.030
 very loose for example if I want 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:33.670
 illuminate I'm going to take the white the gray 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:37.310
 I fog the purple and I'm going to do this come 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.890
 very loose the brushstroke until leaving the 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.800
 imprint of the brushstroke so that 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.380
 that the fund and the work have the 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.000
 same dialogue plastically is to say no 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.070
 I'm going to have a very faded background and 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.490
 then work everything with spatula but 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.190
 I'm going to simulate everything 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.160
 situation I will place greens more 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.920
 darker green blurs in the area 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.679
 shadow look at this English green of the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.790
 decorative mixed with the gray of 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.840
 paine 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.390
 so that it messes up all this for 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.170
 that you see that after the flowers 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.080
 I drew it with a charcoal is about 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.650
 very loose lines and we started with the 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.970
 fire red on those strokes like to give 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.130
 a base see like that with the brush and I what 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.290
 that I recommend to start 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.840
 work with spatula that they get used to 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.180
 to work with the brush in this way 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.100
 see that it's almost like a spatula is a 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.350
 intermediate step so that afterwards 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.620
 get used to the spatula in what they are 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.270
 the daisies how are they going to be white 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.250
 you know that what is white 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.160
 always have to have any other 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.250
 color less white then let's 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.230
 start these petals come can be 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.770
 colors like that we had in the 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.310
 fund let's give up come 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.290
 the 100 to natural that is used 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.960
 as the most neutral color of the palette 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.600
 like the gray of paint green fog and 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.930
 I will also use this mixed purple 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:15.430
 with the gray I'm going to take different 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.500
 colors and I will generate areas of greater 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.930
 darkness as with the greens with the 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.660
 colors of colder temperatures with the 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.850
 blue also that so far does not look 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.460
 look at this Victorian blue that pretty 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.350
 that is how he stained everything that would be 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:35.130
 petals of these daisies 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.050
 Once we've spotted background 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.260
 raised the colors of the daisy 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.500
 I'm going to remove this tray that is one of the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.500
 decorative acrylics and I'm going to take this 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.690
 which is of the line also of eternal 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.620
 but they are the professional acrylics 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.600
 what is the difference the density and the 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.700
 greater contact concentration of 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.480
 peppers then I'll start with 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.190
 this meat red or take charge well 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.120
 matter this what I need stuff 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.560
 for this to run look at the spatula 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.740
 grabbed and gently then I go 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.740
 pulling 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.360
 I can take this more clarito that is the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.780
 vermilion 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.470
 then I'm separating a little bit 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.470
 some petals 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.800
 and 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.669
 with this carmine I'm going to finish 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.920
 separate they leave it like that until 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.920
 rudely 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.640
 because this will give more ease to the 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.640
 work 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.720
 being starting to separate if you 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.790
 they need a shadow color I have 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.720
 here the carmine and I have the English green 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.300
 dark I mix them come here with the same 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.480
 spatula then I have a color of 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.400
 perfect shadow the mixture of two 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.080
 complementary the saturation of two 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.300
 complementary will give me a neutral 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.250
 what do I put here and how is this 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:09.900
 neutral has green would be the perfect 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:12.570
 to mark the shadow of this red flower 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.780
 as for the daisy now in a 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.180
 next step, I'm going to tell you, come on 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.140
 I want to show this too now let's go 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:25.110
 to go to the daisy but this one is 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.840
 well red look at me normita just 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.030
 said this box is in oil are not 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.150
 professional acrylics look the shine 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.910
 that has this acrylic the density the 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:40.740
 unctuousness as I can spread 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.580
 perfectly with the spatula, notice that 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.480
 I can 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.380
 put here in the zones declared and come 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.650
 with the carmine 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.390
 in the dark areas then I'll 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.030
 that I'm going to go through so you can see that 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:59.760
 You can also mix them 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.280
 to the previous palette remember that I here 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:07.710
 had a decorative paint grid 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:13.610
 then also the quality is perfect 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:16.230
 to go mixing and generating these 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.300
 different planes 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.790
 of the flowers then I'm going to cover 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.970
 this so that when turning it around you do not 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.710
 dirty your desk and here we have 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.900
 a little raised that what I said 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:32.820
 of the daisy in relation to the painting 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.920
 opaque now I tell you to later say 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.360
 this so that of what I was 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.850
 saying how he had told me that 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:43.050
 Menca spatula four at a time then 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:45.570
 to tunisia soft the secret is to do this 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.940
 soft without pressing and then going to 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.850
 analyze with British varnish the 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.830
 eternal water that's what it gives you and that 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.510
 is what gives the shine and masters you 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.700
 it looks like it 's an oil 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:59.820
 flavio if I will ask you if it is a 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:02.040
 I forget clearly that is this one small 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:05.070
 trampita the eye that we did see these and 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.410
 tica margarines mentioned thus for 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:10.590
 simulate ctera pit that really is 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:13.440
 acrylic a very toxic waterborne material 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:16.680
 where everyone can work and with this 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.140
 it has no pain pain, nothing good 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.879
 geely thank you very much thanks to you 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:25.680
 as always and that you follow very well 

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:28.199
 thanks thank you good now we're going to 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:32.629
 a cut and we continue with silvina buquete 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:32.629
 that is going to be a frame in cartapesta
