a surrogate shock arm even though it's

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.650

so<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.590> look<00:02:53.739> at<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.950> spring<00:02:54.190> rate

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
so you have to look at the spring rate

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.550 
so you have to look at the spring rate
and<00:02:54.640> then<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.030> may<00:02:55.390> have<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.900> go<00:02:56.110> in<00:02:56.290> and

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
and then you may have to go in and

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.630 
and then you may have to go in and
revolve<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:57.520> shock<00:02:59.070> to<00:03:00.070> make<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.430> work<00:03:00.610> for

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
revolve that shock to make it work for

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.510 
revolve that shock to make it work for
the<00:03:00.880> SV<00:03:01.180> 1000<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:02.020> may<00:03:02.200> get<00:03:02.380> lucky<00:03:02.500> in<00:03:02.860> that

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
the SV 1000 you may get lucky in that

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.220 
the SV 1000 you may get lucky in that
your<00:03:03.670> body<00:03:03.910> weight<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.330> correct<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.930> spring

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
your body weight is correct the spring

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.060 
your body weight is correct the spring
is<00:03:05.410> correct<00:03:05.950> if<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:07.020> change<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.200> valving<00:03:08.650> via

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
is correct if you change the valving via

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.380 
is correct if you change the valving via
the<00:03:09.250> adjusters<00:03:09.730> for<00:03:09.760> compression<00:03:10.300> and

the adjusters for compression and

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.150 
the adjusters for compression and
rebound<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.900> find<00:03:11.170> something<00:03:11.440> suitable<00:03:11.980> and

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
rebound you find something suitable and

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.610 
rebound you find something suitable and
comfortable<00:03:12.670> then<00:03:13.570> all<00:03:13.959> is<00:03:14.170> well<00:03:14.350> with<00:03:14.560> the
