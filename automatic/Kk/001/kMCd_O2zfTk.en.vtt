fanatic tab get in fanatic and try these
fins<00:00:28.800> before<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.369> buy<00:00:29.580> them

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
fins before you buy them

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.330 
fins before you buy them
so<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> fins<00:00:30.990> off<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.320> my<00:00:31.470> left<00:00:31.949> these<00:00:32.070> are<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
so the fins off to my left these are the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.240 
so the fins off to my left these are the
WCT<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.870> future<00:00:34.230> fins<00:00:34.530> honeycomb

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.130 
WCT but this is future fins honeycomb
material<00:00:35.850> now<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.420> material<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.870> gonna<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
material now that material is gonna be a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.080

little<00:00:37.559> bit<00:00:37.649> more<00:00:37.920> flexible<00:00:38.610> than<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
little bit more flexible than the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.450 
little bit more flexible than the
material<00:00:39.510> off<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.870> my<00:00:39.989> right<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:41.040> honeycomb

set of fins Rasta hex and that's because

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.510 
set of fins Rasta hex and that's because
of<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.110> colorway<00:00:46.649> that's<00:00:47.100> one<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.399> my

of that colorway that's one of my

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.400 
of that colorway that's one of my
favorite<00:00:47.969> colors<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.510> any<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> fins<00:00:49.320> that

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
favorite colors in any of the fins that

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.979 
favorite colors in any of the fins that
future<00:00:49.739> fins<00:00:50.100> makes<00:00:50.460> now<00:00:51.210> off<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.570> my<00:00:51.719> right

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
future fins makes now off to my right

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.139 
future fins makes now off to my right
you<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.649> future<00:00:53.160> fins<00:00:53.430> tech<00:00:53.789> flex

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
you do have future fins tech flex

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.000 
you do have future fins tech flex
material<00:00:54.719> now<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.320> material<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:55.949> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
material now this material is going to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.650 
material now this material is going to
be<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> little<00:00:56.370> bit<00:00:56.550> more<00:00:56.699> stiffer<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
be a little bit more stiffer and a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.540 
be a little bit more stiffer and a
little<00:00:57.960> bit<00:00:58.079> more<00:00:58.230> high-performance<00:00:59.070> now

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
little bit more high-performance now

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.490 
little bit more high-performance now
that's<00:00:59.730> because<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.449> carbon<00:01:00.989> at<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> base

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
that's because of the carbon at the base

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.189 
that's because of the carbon at the base
and<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.340> carbon<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:02.910> at<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> tip<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.690> also

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
and the carbon up at the tip you also

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.870 
and the carbon up at the tip you also
have<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.710> honeycomb<00:01:05.220> right<00:01:05.460> there<00:01:05.640> through

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
have that honeycomb right there through

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.340 
have that honeycomb right there through
the<00:01:05.970> middle<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.390> that's<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.200> make

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the middle and that's going to make

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.960 
the middle and that's going to make
these<00:01:07.500> fins<00:01:07.830> flex<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.460> very<00:01:08.700> specific

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
these fins flex in a very specific

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.450 
these fins flex in a very specific
pattern<00:01:09.479> designed<00:01:10.320> specifically<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.280> these

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
pattern designed specifically for these

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.380 
pattern designed specifically for these
fins<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> WCT<00:01:13.650> features<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> flat<00:01:14.640> foil<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
fins so the WCT features a flat foil and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690 
fins so the WCT features a flat foil and
it<00:01:15.720> also<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> very<00:01:16.259> upright<00:01:16.860> template<00:01:17.490> you

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
it also is a very upright template you

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.609 
it also is a very upright template you
can<00:01:17.729> see<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.299> over<00:01:18.570> here<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.140> back<00:01:19.350> edge

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
can see that over here on the back edge

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.830 
can see that over here on the back edge
of<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.979> fin<00:01:20.250> that's<00:01:21.060> gonna<00:01:21.210> make<00:01:21.420> these<00:01:21.540> fins

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
of this fin that's gonna make these fins

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.620 
of this fin that's gonna make these fins
very<00:01:22.200> fast<00:01:22.560> very<00:01:22.890> pivoting<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.060> great<00:01:24.390> for

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
very fast very pivoting and great for

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.289 
very fast very pivoting and great for
critical<00:01:25.080> surfing<00:01:25.530> we<00:01:26.490> say<00:01:26.700> these<00:01:26.880> fins<00:01:27.119> are

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
critical surfing we say these fins are

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.319 
critical surfing we say these fins are
probably<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.229> 150<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.070> 180<00:01:29.670> pound<00:01:30.060> range

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
probably for the 150 to 180 pound range

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.480 
probably for the 150 to 180 pound range
that's<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.020> medium<00:01:31.259> surfer<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:32.040> you're<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
that's a medium surfer if you're a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.770 
that's a medium surfer if you're a
little<00:01:32.729> bit<00:01:32.939> bigger<00:01:33.119> than<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.659> can

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
little bit bigger than that you can

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.569 
little bit bigger than that you can
probably<00:01:34.049> get<00:01:34.350> away<00:01:34.380> with<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> tech<00:01:35.070> flex<00:01:35.369> if

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
probably get away with the tech flex if

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.760 
probably get away with the tech flex if
the<00:01:36.060> waves<00:01:36.270> are<00:01:36.420> absolutely<00:01:36.900> cranking<00:01:37.439> we

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the waves are absolutely cranking we

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.039 
the waves are absolutely cranking we
recommend<00:01:38.280> tech<00:01:38.490> flex<00:01:38.759> over<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.299> hex<00:01:39.630> because

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
recommend tech flex over the hex because

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.440 
recommend tech flex over the hex because
it<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.500> stiffer<00:01:40.920> material<00:01:41.070> if<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:42.150> want

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
it is that stiffer material if you want

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.120 
it is that stiffer material if you want
to<00:01:42.509> try<00:01:42.720> either<00:01:42.930> these<00:01:43.229> fins<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.890> do<00:01:44.009> that

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
to try either these fins you can do that

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
to try either these fins you can do that
right<00:01:44.430> here<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.909> our<00:01:45.000> fanatic<00:01:45.479> fin<00:01:45.689> testing
