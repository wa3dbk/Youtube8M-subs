00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that nature whenever you're doing this

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.540 
that nature whenever you're doing this
make<00:01:44.340> sure<00:01:44.400> this<00:01:45.620> this<00:01:46.620> is<00:01:46.800> your<00:01:47.070> hood

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
make sure it's folded upwards like this

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.430 
make sure it's folded upwards like this
so<00:01:50.490> whenever<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:51.030> starts<00:01:51.510> to<00:01:51.690> rain<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.320> will

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
so whenever it starts to rain it will

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.950 
so whenever it starts to rain it will
still<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.830> nice<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.250> dry<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.390> guys<00:01:54.540> notice

the<00:02:36.840> fact<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.290> can<00:02:37.440> use<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.830> as<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.100> sail

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
the fact that you can use this as a sail

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.380 
the fact that you can use this as a sail
if<00:02:39.269> you<00:02:39.360> have<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.540> small<00:02:39.870> boat<00:02:40.170> or<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.470> small<00:02:41.070> raft

if you have a small boat or a small raft
since<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.720> like<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> tarp<00:02:43.610> style<00:02:44.610> material

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
since this is like a tarp style material

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.620 
since this is like a tarp style material
you<00:02:45.810> can<00:02:45.959> rig<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.200> up<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.620> use<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.950> as<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.100> sail

and<00:02:49.250> yet<00:02:50.250> another<00:02:50.519> amazing<00:02:50.850> use<00:02:51.209> for<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.540> you

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
and yet another amazing use for this you

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.410 
and yet another amazing use for this you
can<00:02:52.170> use<00:02:52.320> this<00:02:52.470> as<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.709> smoke<00:02:53.190> signal<00:02:53.489> tool<00:02:53.910> and

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
can use this as a smoke signal tool and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.870 
can use this as a smoke signal tool and
what<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.630> mean<00:02:54.780> by<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.110> is<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.739> take<00:02:55.950> two<00:02:55.980> take

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
what I mean by that is you take two take

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.780 
what I mean by that is you take two take
two<00:02:57.150> sticks<00:02:57.480> put<00:02:58.350> them<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.560> an<00:02:58.680> X<00:02:58.890> type<00:02:59.370> pattern

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
two sticks put them in an X type pattern

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.270 
two sticks put them in an X type pattern
and<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.600> connect<00:03:00.900> from<00:03:01.140> one<00:03:01.290> corner<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.830> the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
and you connect from one corner to the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.550 
and you connect from one corner to the
other<00:03:02.370> corner<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.360> next<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.810> next<00:03:03.900> so

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
other corner to the next to the next so

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.740 
other corner to the next to the next so
you<00:03:04.620> have<00:03:04.739> an<00:03:04.890> X<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.670> then<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.970> stretch<00:03:06.480> this

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
you have an X and then you stretch this

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.580 
you have an X and then you stretch this
fabric<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:09.030> makes<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:09.480> one<00:03:10.170> hard

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
fabric and that makes it one hard

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.470 
fabric and that makes it one hard
structure<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:11.850> whenever<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.180> start<00:03:12.360> your

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
structure so whenever you start your

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.050 
structure so whenever you start your
smoke<00:03:12.840> fire<00:03:13.110> as<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.470> know<00:03:14.340> your<00:03:14.519> signal<00:03:14.850> fire

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
smoke fire as you know your signal fire

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.720 
smoke fire as you know your signal fire
you<00:03:15.810> hold<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.200> smoke<00:03:16.500> down<00:03:16.769> three<00:03:17.340> different

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
you hold the smoke down three different

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.140 
you hold the smoke down three different
times

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
times

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.350 
times
that's<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.750> international<00:03:19.440> sign<00:03:19.860> for<00:03:20.150> SOS<00:03:21.150> or

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360
