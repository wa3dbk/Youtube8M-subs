00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.000
MANTI DUMPLINGS

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.219
Now I'll make the Uzbek national dish - Manti (dumplings).

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:19.989
Manti typically consist of a spiced meat mixture, usually lamb or ground beef, in a dough wrapper.

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:30.210
For the dough we need 2 cups of flour,

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:40.260
2 eggs (can be added from 1 to 5 eggs)

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:49.740
and salt.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:01:02.200
Knead the fresh dough.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.400
Add a little water in portions and knead the dough.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:18.200
Knead the dough with hands at the end. The dough turns thick.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:27.960
Cover the dough with a napkin and leave to infuse for 20 minutes.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.210
Cook the filling for our dumplings.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:44.740
Ground meat is recommended to use for manti.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:59.230
Manti is juicy dish. It includes a lot of onions.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:10.270
Grind the meat with the onions.

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:36.889
We cooked a minced beef.

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:42.929
Salt and pepper minced to your taste.

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:48.419
The dough has infused.

00:02:52.199 --> 00:03:03.699
First roll out half the dough with a rolling pin.

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:13.069
The dough should not be too thin.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.939
Enough.

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:39.059
Cut the dough into rectangles.

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:46.059
Cut off the edges - they are not needed.

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:11.059
Put the filling on the dough and seal at the opposite edges of the dough.

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:23.639
Shaped like the letter "H".

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:33.879
You can seal the dough differently, I learned this method.

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:43.669
It turns a patty.

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:49.420
I'll cook manti in a steamer.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:59.020
Water boils. Put the strainer on the pot.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:06.729
Manti dipped in oil. So they do not stick to the strainer.

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:13.729
Manti should not touch each other.

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:29.830
On the top I put a grater - it will be the next "floor" of the steamer.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:36.830
Spread the manti.

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:55.400
I can not cover with a lid, so I use a bowl.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.759
Cook for 20-25 minutes over medium heat.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.259
Turn off the heat.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:21.339
Manti has increased markedly in size.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:30.830
Shift manti carefully not to damage them.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:40.710
All the juice must be remained within the manti.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.610
Manti is well served with a sauce to your liking. I like with sour cream.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:55.610
Bon Appetite!

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.000
