00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello friends and welcome to 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.259
 another presentation so you look 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.599
 twice quite manage or soy sauce, the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.719
 actually better left and right quasi 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.820
 as they actually say in the floating 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.910
 hovering on the side of a tractor 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.580
 there's mirror right mirror and then 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.050
 50 really bad mirror 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.890
 So it must be pretty cool the idea 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.590
 is pretty cool 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.929
 the implementation would only wish to me 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.040
 that's a little better 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:39.030
 So rather the engine in the air can 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.910
 but let's see if the whole thing 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.280
 Example in German is the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.879
 Cinemas with old left and teacher too 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.879
 activate 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:57.750
 So that was better it must be 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.120
 but still not perfectly solved 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.010
 hopefully there will be this year before yes so 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.270
 almost outdoor games work out of it 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.299
 that mirror for agriculture 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.580
 2013 allows this script and that 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.010
 really is not the murder again 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.770
 he is absolutely awesome to find nice 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.409
 you have to take a look if you are there 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.450
 Now it's standard mirror star 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.299
 Michael, you have to do that quite often 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.060
 the right one to look 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.070
 so actually supposedly invested 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.680
 have tuned the wind that is one 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.500
 bisserl village because recalculates her knife 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.540
 The now katrin stone can be found today 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.600
 to judge quite badly in the back 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:43.439
 what or have fabricated and we 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.970
 ask with it problem if you are there 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:51.049
 At least we have nothing better there 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:56.780
 Disabled us so würz the left Bütt 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.780
 spicy back just like that we do 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:07.990
 or does it have to be so right now 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:12.400
 It's just a bit of exercise already 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:18.430
 better nice gimmick okay the opponents 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.019
 Thus the miss mother and so on 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.959
 again switching off accurately with the 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.489
 key combination you would get a good idea 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.959
 two wish in this one 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.150
 Bisserl exactly goes and you maybe 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.940
 can even align 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.750
 and maybe a bit integrated in 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.090
 controlled the normal outside mirror 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.030
 normal outside mirror actually that was 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.760
 so great that a bus driver did not come 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.769
 only the landmark has swapped who 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.940
 very nice stupid me very happy says 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.629
 thanks for watching friends and 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.629
 business machines
