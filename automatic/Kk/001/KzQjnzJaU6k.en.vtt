same it's just been released so there

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.120 
same it's just been released so there
are<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> few<00:00:15.990> little<00:00:16.139> things<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.560> will<00:00:16.980> be

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
are a few little things that will be

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.800 
are a few little things that will be
updated<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.699> future<00:00:17.760> but<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> first

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
updated in the future but the first

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.929 
updated in the future but the first
command<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.260> /t<00:00:19.859> our<00:00:20.010> create<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.670> then<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
command is /t our create and then the

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.090 
command is /t our create and then the
arena<00:00:21.240> name<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.600> want<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.960> then<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.859> need<00:00:23.010> to

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
arena name you want and then you need to

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.179 
arena name you want and then you need to
put<00:00:23.279> 1<00:00:23.550> +<00:00:23.850> 2<00:00:24.330> +<00:00:24.570> after<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.260> which<00:00:25.439> sets<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.980> team

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
put 1 + 2 + after it which sets the team

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.660 
put 1 + 2 + after it which sets the team
sizes<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:27.740> number<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.830> teams<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.460> could

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
sizes and number of teams so you could

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.189 
sizes and number of teams so you could
change<00:00:29.880> them<00:00:30.090> if<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.269> wanted<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.960> make<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
change them if you wanted to to make the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.459 
change them if you wanted to to make the
team's<00:00:31.410> bigger<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.890> things<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:33.469> then

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
team's bigger and things like that then

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.709 
team's bigger and things like that then
the<00:00:34.590> next<00:00:34.860> thing<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.070> want<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.730> /t<00:00:36.570> our

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the next thing you want to do is /t our

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.799 
the next thing you want to do is /t our
altar<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:38.100> then<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.790> arena<00:00:39.090> name<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.629> then

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
altar and then the arena name and then

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.400 
altar and then the arena name and then
one<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.649> alters<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.100> spawn<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:41.879> one<00:00:42.410> so

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
one so that alters the spawn for one so

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.130 
one so that alters the spawn for one so
you<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.739> add<00:00:43.890> 2<00:00:44.430> 3<00:00:44.820> 4<00:00:45.120> as<00:00:45.390> many<00:00:45.570> spawns<00:00:45.840> as<00:00:46.050> you

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
you can add 2 3 4 as many spawns as you

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.810 
you can add 2 3 4 as many spawns as you
want<00:00:46.350> obviously<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:47.039> depends<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.489> how<00:00:47.670> many

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
want obviously it depends on how many

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.720 
want obviously it depends on how many
plays<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.360> set<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:49.649> I'll<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.309> set<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> few

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
plays you set so I'll just set a few

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.700 
plays you set so I'll just set a few
spawns<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.270> an<00:00:51.390> example<00:00:51.719> although<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.469> Maps

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
spawns as an example although this Maps

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
spawns as an example although this Maps
only<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.250> take<00:00:53.370> 2<00:00:53.579> players<00:00:53.879> anyway<00:00:55.730> it's

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
only going to take 2 players anyway it's

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.510 
only going to take 2 players anyway it's
nice<00:00:56.879> all<00:00:57.090> set<00:00:57.329> up<00:00:57.449> now<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> then<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.100> TR

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
nice all set up now so then you do TR

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.810 
nice all set up now so then you do TR
alter<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.829> arena<00:01:02.100> name<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:02.879> wait<00:01:03.120> room

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
alter the arena name and then wait room

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.789 
alter the arena name and then wait room
and<00:01:05.820> then<00:01:06.000> then<00:01:06.210> number<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
and then then number so this is the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.950 
and then then number so this is the
first<00:01:08.010> wait<00:01:08.280> room<00:01:08.490> you're<00:01:08.670> saying<00:01:08.960> basically

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
first wait room you're saying basically

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.810 
first wait room you're saying basically
this<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.200> where<00:01:10.350> players<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:11.040> teleported<00:01:11.369> up

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
this is where players get teleported up

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.800 
this is where players get teleported up
when<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> game<00:01:12.240> starts<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.509> then

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
when the game starts so it's just then

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.600 
when the game starts so it's just then

right back up to the top but before you
do<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.909> make<00:01:47.939> sure<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.299> fill<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.659> any

gaps as you can see I've missed a few

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.679 
gaps as you can see I've missed a few
blocks<00:01:50.549> where<00:01:50.820> I've<00:01:50.880> been<00:01:51.000> smashing<00:01:51.479> through

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
blocks where I've been smashing through

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.319 
blocks where I've been smashing through
so<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:53.009> myself<00:01:53.189> some<00:01:53.549> TNT<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.180> some

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
top obviously I've got to set the other

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.780 
top obviously I've got to set the other
corner<00:02:20.990> but<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.200> shouldn't<00:02:21.500> have<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.860> be<00:02:22.610> just

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
corner but you shouldn't have to be just

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.420 
corner but you shouldn't have to be just
select<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.150> cuboid<00:02:23.510> around<00:02:23.900> your<00:02:24.080> arena<00:02:24.430> then

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
select a cuboid around your arena then

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.090 
select a cuboid around your arena then
you<00:02:25.520> just<00:02:25.700> type<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.120> command<00:02:26.920> /t<00:02:27.920> are

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
you just type in the command /t are

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.699 
you just type in the command /t are
alter<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:29.450> arena<00:02:29.750> name<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.410> then<00:02:30.920> add<00:02:31.220> region

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
alter the arena name and then add region

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.840 
alter the arena name and then add region
and<00:02:33.709> basically<00:02:34.040> this<00:02:34.220> will<00:02:34.280> just<00:02:34.520> can't<00:02:34.700> with

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
and basically this will just can't with

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.300 
and basically this will just can't with
a<00:02:34.910> message<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:35.600> that<00:02:36.260> name<00:02:36.530> there<00:02:36.830> is<00:02:37.100> an

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
a message and that name there is an

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.720 
a message and that name there is an
arena<00:02:37.550> saved<00:02:37.970> in<00:02:38.209> world<00:02:38.420> at<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:39.310> so<00:02:40.310> you'll

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
arena saved in world at it so you'll

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.130 
arena saved in world at it so you'll
have<00:02:40.820> to<00:02:40.940> make<00:02:41.060> sure<00:02:41.270> these<00:02:41.450> plugins<00:02:41.750> are<00:02:42.050> also

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
have to make sure these plugins are also

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.690 
have to make sure these plugins are also
installed<00:02:42.740> there<00:02:42.950> will<00:02:43.070> be<00:02:43.100> links<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.550> all<00:02:43.670> of

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
installed there will be links to all of

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.449 
installed there will be links to all of
them<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.990> then<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:45.170> want<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.410> do<00:02:45.500> region<00:02:46.010> flag

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
them and then you want to do region flag

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.820 
them and then you want to do region flag
ba<00:02:47.270> and<00:02:47.870> then<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.200> arena<00:02:48.470> name<00:02:50.530> then<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.650> want

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
ba and then the arena name then you want

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.060 
ba and then the arena name then you want
to<00:02:51.890> put<00:02:52.040> invincible<00:02:52.820> allow<00:02:56.920> basically<00:02:57.920> this

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
to put invincible allow basically this

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.770 
to put invincible allow basically this
just<00:02:58.370> means<00:02:58.520> players<00:02:58.940> won't<00:02:59.150> take<00:02:59.420> any<00:02:59.630> damage

do<00:03:44.299> is<00:03:44.420> right-click<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:45.079> sign<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.440> join<00:03:45.620> the

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
do is right-click the sign to join the

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.870 
do is right-click the sign to join the
game<00:03:46.000> so<00:03:47.000> then<00:03:47.150> I'm<00:03:47.269> putting<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:47.660> queue<00:03:48.820> so<00:03:49.820> as

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
game so then I'm putting the queue so as

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.170 
game so then I'm putting the queue so as
you<00:03:50.000> can<00:03:50.090> see<00:03:50.209> it<00:03:50.360> says<00:03:50.570> one<00:03:50.780> of<00:03:50.810> infinite<00:03:52.180> then

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
you can see it says one of infinite then

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.729 
you can see it says one of infinite then
I'll<00:03:53.299> put<00:03:53.480> joined<00:03:53.750> game<00:03:53.989> and<00:03:54.320> because<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:54.620> will

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
we're in the game as you can see just

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.280 
we're in the game as you can see just
give<00:04:10.760> it<00:04:10.880> six<00:04:11.180> seconds<00:04:11.660> then<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:11.930> will<00:04:12.049> start

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
give it six seconds then it will start

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.569 
give it six seconds then it will start
and<00:04:12.500> then<00:04:12.620> you<00:04:12.680> start<00:04:12.980> saying<00:04:13.220> that's<00:04:13.370> full

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
and then you start saying that's full

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.300 
and then you start saying that's full
for<00:04:13.760> your<00:04:13.880> floor<00:04:14.090> oh<00:04:14.590> he<00:04:15.590> ran<00:04:15.769> straight<00:04:15.980> into

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
for your floor oh he ran straight into

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.009 
for your floor oh he ran straight into
my<00:04:16.400> path<00:04:16.669> so<00:04:17.060> as<00:04:17.329> you<00:04:17.479> can<00:04:17.540> see<00:04:17.600> I'm<00:04:17.870> running

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
my path so as you can see I'm running

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.250 
my path so as you can see I'm running
around<00:04:18.260> you<00:04:18.620> can<00:04:18.769> see<00:04:18.919> the<00:04:18.950> floor<00:04:19.250> disappears

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
around you can see the floor disappears

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.930 
around you can see the floor disappears
the<00:04:21.260> basic<00:04:21.590> aim<00:04:21.770> is<00:04:21.950> just<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.250> be<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.490> last<00:04:22.669> one

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
the basic aim is just to be the last one

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.089 
the basic aim is just to be the last one
alive<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.479> falls<00:04:23.690> through<00:04:23.810> its<00:04:24.800> obviously

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
alive that falls through its obviously

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.750 
alive that falls through its obviously
I've<00:04:25.280> only<00:04:25.400> got<00:04:25.580> two<00:04:25.729> teams<00:04:26.030> in<00:04:26.240> this<00:04:26.330> one

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
I've only got two teams in this one

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.760 
I've only got two teams in this one
but<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.240> can<00:04:27.450> set<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.720> up<00:04:27.840> with<00:04:27.900> loads<00:04:28.650> of

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
but you can set it up with loads of

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.840 
but you can set it up with loads of
different<00:04:28.890> teams<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.550> loads<00:04:29.700> of<00:04:29.790> different

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
to set it up then all you want to do is

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.970 
to set it up then all you want to do is
keep<00:04:35.910> running<00:04:36.000> around<00:04:36.360> however<00:04:36.930> what<00:04:37.230> have

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980

it's<00:04:40.770> just<00:04:41.010> deleting<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:41.910> blocks<00:04:42.120> wherever

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
it's just deleting the blocks wherever

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.170 
it's just deleting the blocks wherever
you<00:04:42.540> walk<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:43.370> I'll<00:04:44.370> quickly<00:04:44.580> just<00:04:44.820> fall<00:04:45.000> for

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
you walk and I'll quickly just fall for

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.940 
you walk and I'll quickly just fall for
a<00:04:45.300> few<00:04:45.510> layers<00:04:45.690> just<00:04:46.110> so<00:04:46.200> you<00:04:46.260> can<00:04:46.500> see<00:04:46.770> what

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
a few layers just so you can see what

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.670 
a few layers just so you can see what
happens<00:04:47.250> when<00:04:47.370> you<00:04:47.490> do<00:04:47.640> lose<00:04:47.960> but<00:04:48.960> you'll<00:04:49.440> see

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
happens when you do lose but you'll see

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.140 
happens when you do lose but you'll see
that<00:04:49.800> I<00:04:49.860> do<00:04:49.980> lose<00:04:50.310> in<00:04:50.520> this<00:04:50.610> game<00:04:50.850> because<00:04:51.090> I

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
that I do lose in this game because I

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.720 
that I do lose in this game because I
just<00:04:51.330> fall<00:04:51.510> straight<00:04:51.720> through<00:04:52.050> to<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.260> bottom

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
just fall straight through to the bottom

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.830 
just fall straight through to the bottom
but<00:04:53.730> you<00:04:53.940> can<00:04:54.060> see<00:04:54.210> it<00:04:54.330> works<00:04:54.480> pretty<00:04:54.720> well

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
but you can see it works pretty well

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.870 
but you can see it works pretty well
it's<00:04:55.290> not<00:04:55.470> quite<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.010> same<00:04:56.220> as<00:04:56.340> high<00:04:56.460> pixels

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
it's not quite the same as high pixels

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.580 
it's not quite the same as high pixels
but<00:04:57.150> it's<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.570> closest<00:04:57.990> that's<00:04:58.230> out<00:04:58.410> at<00:04:58.530> the

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
but it's the closest that's out at the

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.560 
but it's the closest that's out at the
moment<00:04:58.950> I<00:04:59.100> hope<00:04:59.880> that<00:05:00.030> you've<00:05:00.120> enjoyed<00:05:00.270> this

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
out and try and use it on your servers I

out and try and use it on your servers I
do<00:05:04.530> hope<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.860> get<00:05:05.070> a<00:05:05.130> working<00:05:05.490> version<00:05:05.640> of<00:05:05.880> this

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
do hope to get a working version of this

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.210 
do hope to get a working version of this
on<00:05:06.180> my<00:05:06.210> server<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:07.230> set<00:05:07.410> up<00:05:07.500> a<00:05:07.590> few<00:05:07.800> arenas

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
on my server and to set up a few arenas

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.880 
on my server and to set up a few arenas
it's<00:05:08.940> probably<00:05:09.630> just<00:05:09.900> under<00:05:10.230> two<00:05:10.380> weeks<00:05:10.410> away

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
it's probably just under two weeks away
