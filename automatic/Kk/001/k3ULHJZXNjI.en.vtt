especially good casual title because it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.179 
especially good casual title because it
offers<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:20.540> light<00:01:21.540> challenge<00:01:22.159> without<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:25.189> super

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
offers a light challenge without a super
