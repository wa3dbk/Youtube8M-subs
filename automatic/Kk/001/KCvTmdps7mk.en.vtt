00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 exactly what the organization of the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.400
 systems 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.010
 then the marriage states the district 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.110
 and municipalities 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.080
 organized in collaboration with 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.700
 their education systems, each of which 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.029
 federation it has its respective 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.850
 competence autonomy the union has 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.199
 sovereignty, including establishing its 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.550
 system your regime 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.080
 So we're going to realize systems 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.310
 municipal education systems 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.470
 state education system 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.599
 district education system 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.210
 education and all the dismemberment of 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.160
 but the union will organize the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.079
 federal education system and 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.399
 territories in the existence of the territory 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.660
 remember that we do not currently have 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.250
 more territories, right? 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.680
 today they are units of the federation already 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.170
 which will finance the institutions of 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.180
 federal public education and it is clear that 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.789
 shall exercise in educational matters a 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.800
 redistributive function, this is 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.410
 then the relevant scenario for the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.309
 verification in order to ensure 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.770
 equalization of opportunities 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.289
 educational and of course the great 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.170
 establishing standards 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.030
 minimum of quality in teaching 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.580
 the idea is technical assistance and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.960
 financial whom the other entities to 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.240
 states to the federal district and 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.549
 municipalities and the union it maintains its 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.290
 federal system and it contributes to 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.290
 the state and district systems 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.729
 municipalities are implemented and 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.880
 which in turn has the necessary resources 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.650
 for its operational activity in the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.080
 technical area and in the financial area also 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.170
 that municipalities 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.060
 priority in teaching 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.920
 fundamental and clear in education 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.450
 the competence of 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.290
 attendance of pre - school education 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.380
 fundamental 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.240
 directed to the municipalities 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.640
 in the case the states and the federal district 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.890
 will act primarily in teaching 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.329
 elementary and high school and then enter 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.970
 scene a feature is realizing 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.770
 the fundamental education that education 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.840
 then it will be maintained 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.520
 provided by two entities of the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.469
 two level federation 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.820
 then we will have the municipalities that 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.649
 we will have the states 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.960
 remember that the federal district should read 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.729
 nÃ© state and municipal competencies 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.200
 in the case of education 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.610
 so do not realize that teaching 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.340
 because of its importance 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.590
 and would it be the object 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.580
 duty universal right state 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.410
 of all 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.819
 he determined that the two entities of the 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.069
 federation committed to the 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.010
 therefore this is not your 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.690
 structuring and of course we will 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.239
 realize that in the organization of the 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.220
 and states and municipalities will 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.470
 define collaborative standards 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.780
 distribution to the public call of the 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.549
 census in order to ensure the 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.280
 universalization of compulsory education 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.739
 who is the compulsory education today 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.080
 elementary school 2016 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.519
 from 4 to 17 years old in the then we go 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.340
 realize that it will contemplate part 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.819
 of early childhood education 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.180
 remains with elementary school 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.160
 compulsory and high school will also be 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.019
 from 2016 compulsory education 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.370
 then we will realize that teaching 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.700
 obligatory it is going through a 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.760
 expansion and of course basic education 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.810
 priority will be given to the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.170
 regular education 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.720
 priority does not prevent the 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.420
 existence of other panels of other 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.769
 education scenarios, and then we 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.940
 let's realize that basic education 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.079
 it directs regular education but 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.870
 other forms of teaching 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:27.280
 can be object of application of 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.280
 of vacancies and
