not liquid use glue stick just apply

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.600 
not liquid use glue stick just apply
layer<00:02:28.660> like<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.380> then<00:02:29.890> you're<00:02:30.460> good<00:02:30.580> to

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
go just don't get any on the sides it's

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.050 
go just don't get any on the sides it's
really<00:02:32.590> messy<00:02:32.980> all<00:02:33.610> right<00:02:33.730> enough<00:02:33.880> with<00:02:34.030> that

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.770 
actually not because that's the eight of
hearts<00:03:34.300> so<00:03:35.880> that's<00:03:36.880> that<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.240> then<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.600> do

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
hearts so that's that and then you do

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.050 
hearts so that's that and then you do
another<00:03:38.080> double<00:03:38.320> lift<00:03:38.620> just<00:03:39.610> riffle<00:03:40.030> through

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
another double lift just riffle through

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.240 
another double lift just riffle through
or<00:03:40.930> when<00:03:41.470> you're<00:03:41.590> putting<00:03:41.770> that<00:03:41.920> down<00:03:41.980> you

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
or when you're putting that down you

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.580 
or when you're putting that down you
just<00:03:42.370> move<00:03:42.640> to<00:03:42.880> up<00:03:43.210> a<00:03:43.300> little<00:03:43.510> bit<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.780> make<00:03:44.530> it

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
just move to up a little bit to make it

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.490 
just move to up a little bit to make it
easier<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.550> say<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.820> next<00:03:46.090> card<00:03:46.300> is<00:03:46.500> the

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
easier you say the next card is the

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.380 
easier you say the next card is the
eight<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.800> hearts<00:03:48.070> and<00:03:48.280> then<00:03:48.940> you<00:03:49.060> put<00:03:49.270> that

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
eight of hearts and then you put that

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.440 
eight of hearts and then you put that
down<00:03:50.350> but<00:03:51.070> it's<00:03:51.190> actually<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.700> double<00:03:52.180> if<00:03:52.300> so

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
down but it's actually a double if so

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.740 
down but it's actually a double if so
it's<00:03:52.600> essentially<00:03:53.230> 10<00:03:53.860> clubs<00:03:54.540> alright<00:03:55.540> so

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
it's essentially 10 clubs alright so

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.240 
it's essentially 10 clubs alright so
then<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:56.020> just<00:03:56.230> wave<00:03:56.620> your<00:03:56.770> hand<00:03:56.980> over<00:03:57.100> it

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
then you just wave your hand over it

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.700 
then you just wave your hand over it
snap<00:03:57.730> your<00:03:57.910> fingers<00:03:58.270> and<00:03:58.380> they<00:03:59.380> have
