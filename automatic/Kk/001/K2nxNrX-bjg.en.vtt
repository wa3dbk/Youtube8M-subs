00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.060
 say an airplane there is a plane noise 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:25.010
 just scramble will yes it's 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.010
 volunteer it's great 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.990
 a turbine looks like a turbine so 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.030
 there I am in traction 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.329
 because I am in all electric it is 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.570
 the front yeah but it's a car that 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.260
 is long and wide and a ton a 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.300
 worth 185 it's still going to have been optimized 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.440
 also because otherwise there is 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.629
 still the thermal of the electric 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.300
 there are both technologies what happens 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.220
 all the eight has the lowest center 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.239
 of gravity of the history of the brand 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.960
 we are on the ground we are no longer 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.960
 Okay 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.620
 and with two cars in one the lamb 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.350
 as currently 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.860
 and just now the wolves 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.049
 doctor jekyll and mister hyde i'm going 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.390
 return to the comfort mode that wants 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:22.820
 automatically combine the type 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.780
 okay but it combines that is to say it 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.259
 turn on one or the other 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.670
 yes not both at the same time that's it 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.990
 I am electrical fittings the one who 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.190
 manages you have voluntarily I'm going 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:40.520
 accelerate a little bit harder they 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:44.390
 want to start case okay the noise 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:48.530
 is double at the the noise and work 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.390
 I'm not waiting because 1 3 6 7 1 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.740
 3 cylinders 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.789
 it's a three-cylinder by a noise 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.080
 with its shareholders so a huge 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.380
 work at the exhaust level at these 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.950
 standards 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:03.140
 it looks like a v8 while this work on 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:11.900
 the sets then walk on the bottom of 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:16.150
 do their own button drive that's 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:21.459
 all good we live from the habit 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:24.340
 where is what we do not see 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.110
 the head-up display the wii 2 series 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.090
 you have that it's interesting 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.409
 actually gathers everything we see 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.480
 really well it's the limitation of the 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.769
 everything I spent at will pass the camera but 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.200
 in any case I see it well even we 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:44.560
 all agree in the planes of 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.349
 hunt have there his voice really clearly 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.000
 and the sun does not bother it's true 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.010
 it's impressive quality governed 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.120
 is very far yes on the road 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.250
 yes it looks like he's far on the 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.750
 effective route of the shot it's not 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.109
 really the same system as it is the 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.819
 sets of orange and where is the sector 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.730
 the same okay there is just the new 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.230
 mini lsd ndolo series of assets tourer who 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.359
 uses different technology with 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.030
 the plexiglass that goes out hockey in all 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:13.720
 the other bmw uses this technology 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.359
 is exactly on jeanmonod already a little 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.430
 liar that's the exit you have 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.709
 present because I'm accelerating 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.699
 offended a learned dosage of the pedal if 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.870
 you want to try the mode all 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:25.440
 electric you just press 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.440
 stained glass 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.090
 Why 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.100
 we 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.819
 do I really like dancing and 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.400
 dashboards of the range where it's 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.160
 all its blue borders that reminds in 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.560
 is the custom 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.770
 electrified 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.770
 after 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.090
 good grip 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:59.110
 it 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:59.110
 left chapter knife 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.590
 Hello 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:11.469
 the berlue 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.609
 little noise the handing over to his generals of the 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:15.069
 when we touch pallets 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.160
 we stay in manual mode in fact it will be 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.650
 it's up to you to pass the reports 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.880
 yes because the lnah did not mount the 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.880
 reports the passes 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:40.230
 kalou and trends related to 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.900
 technologies novelties in the ir 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.300
 deficiency of full carton tooling and 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.200
 we'll go back and make a U-turn 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.200
 absolutely for change 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.750
 in a garden 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:04.500
 so here we have a vehicle 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:06.750
 who costs how much you have 142 thousand euros 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.920
 in the steering wheel between the parts 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.920
 so do not break the 8 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.000
 there is really no bowl gregory a 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.100
 driving school follow a driving school with 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.530
 a limit that's hard when you try 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:28.590
 so when usa united 8 in a short way 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.740
 and that you have a driving school in front of the 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.740
 scene 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:43.130
 this is not the 3 but adapts to 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.330
 winners 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:03.840
 you saw it would be too fat I was years old 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.840
 1 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:14.129
 it's quickly there when 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:18.090
 we have to go 20 points with catches 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:19.800
 its four-wheel drive but both 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:25.280
 the helpers who intervene at the same 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.280
 time we have the distribution to temptation 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.870
 Gregory, it's with you that I have the most 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.870
 want to vomit we tried right away 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:42.409
 if not non-market work 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.409
 lunar years 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:59.729
 in fact with links still me I 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:05.069
 thought it was the camera that 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:08.849
 put the detect you can not you 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:12.440
 to deceive with his was well there you are in 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:12.440
