00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.520 
if it goes in a lot say some really sits
in<00:01:55.049> there<00:01:55.170> deep<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.590> then<00:01:56.219> he<00:01:56.310> does<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:57.469> sort<00:01:58.469> of

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
in there deep and then he does a sort of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.580 
in there deep and then he does a sort of
ps3<00:01:58.829> version<00:01:59.460> which<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.920> raised<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:03.060> it's

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
ps3 version which is a raised so it's

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.249 
ps3 version which is a raised so it's
we'll<00:02:04.710> hear<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:05.850> more<00:02:06.000> over<00:02:06.869> like<00:02:07.109> that

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
we'll hear so it's more over like that

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.479 
we'll hear so it's more over like that
and<00:02:07.439> then<00:02:07.530> he<00:02:07.590> does<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> fusion<00:02:08.220> which<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.459> a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
and then he does a fusion which is a

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.470 
and then he does a fusion which is a
sort<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.729> mix<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.660> both<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.170> then<00:02:11.480> hopefully

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
sort of mix of both and then hopefully

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.900 
sort of mix of both and then hopefully
soon<00:02:13.230> well<00:02:13.620> he's<00:02:13.769> told<00:02:13.980> me<00:02:14.099> in<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.280> next<00:02:14.670> few

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
soon well he's told me in the next few

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.350 
soon well he's told me in the next few
weeks<00:02:15.090> he'll<00:02:15.930> be<00:02:16.310> updating<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.730> website<00:02:17.910> with

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
weeks he'll be updating the website with

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.690 
weeks he'll be updating the website with
some<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.840> called<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.110> gear<00:02:19.319> tops<00:02:19.620> which<00:02:20.459> are

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
some that called the gear tops which are

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.220 
some that called the gear tops which are
much<00:02:21.030> more<00:02:21.239> aggressive<00:02:21.690> than<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:21.930> if<00:02:22.110> you've

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
much more aggressive than this if you've

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.910 
much more aggressive than this if you've
ever<00:02:22.349> used<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:23.060> remote<00:02:24.060> control<00:02:24.420> plane

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
ever used a remote control plane

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.740 
ever used a remote control plane
controller<00:02:25.920> they're<00:02:26.129> very<00:02:26.280> very<00:02:26.569> hard<00:02:27.569> and

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
controller they're very very hard and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.729 
controller they're very very hard and
they'll<00:02:27.870> push<00:02:28.080> into<00:02:28.230> your<00:02:28.379> fingers<00:02:28.709> and

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
they'll push into your fingers and

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.890 
they'll push into your fingers and
that's<00:02:28.980> why<00:02:29.250> I'm<00:02:29.310> looking<00:02:29.700> forward<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.150> so

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
these crappy black plastic this will be

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.259 
these crappy black plastic this will be
all<00:02:43.319> more<00:02:43.680> than<00:02:43.920> guessing<00:02:44.099> much<00:02:45.060> better

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
all more than guessing much better

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.729 
all more than guessing much better
control<00:02:45.480> much<00:02:45.900> better<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.290> know<00:02:46.380> your<00:02:46.500> finger

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
went to sleep you can get there right

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
went to sleep you can get there right
away<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:49.260> i<00:02:49.319> think<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.620> just<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.860> great<00:02:50.040> idea

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
away and i think it's just a great idea

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
away and i think it's just a great idea
rather<00:02:51.930> than<00:02:52.140> going<00:02:52.349> for<00:02:52.530> something<00:02:52.650> like<00:02:52.799> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
rather than going for something like the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.819 
rather than going for something like the
razor<00:02:53.720> 360<00:02:54.720> pad<00:02:54.900> which<00:02:55.110> is<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> lot<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.590> money

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
razor 360 pad which is a lot of money

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.920 
razor 360 pad which is a lot of money
and<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.879> know<00:02:57.000> yet<00:02:57.239> does<00:02:57.450> have<00:02:57.540> some<00:02:57.810> good

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
and you know yet does have some good

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.220 
and you know yet does have some good
features<00:02:58.110> at<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:59.160> timing<00:02:59.579> of<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.230> thumbs

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
features at the the timing of the thumbs

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.720 
features at the the timing of the thumbs
this<00:03:01.349> is<00:03:01.500> one<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.680> would<00:03:01.860> really<00:03:02.129> like<00:03:02.310> but<00:03:02.670> I

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
this is one I would really like but I

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.539 
this is one I would really like but I
think<00:03:03.180> for<00:03:03.660> what<00:03:03.780> for<00:03:04.140> what<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.470> before<00:03:04.620> it's

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
think for what for what is before it's

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.369 
think for what for what is before it's
not<00:03:05.760> really<00:03:05.910> worth<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.360> for<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:07.019> this<00:03:07.260> is

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
not really worth it for this is this is

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.890 
not really worth it for this is this is
something<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:08.040> looks<00:03:08.340> great<00:03:08.819> i<00:03:08.880> mean<00:03:09.030> i'm
