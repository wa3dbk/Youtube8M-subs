00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
cannon fodder so you've got this

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.419 
cannon fodder so you've got this
low-tech<00:02:05.369> militia<00:02:06.590> supported<00:02:07.590> by<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> very

low-tech militia supported by a very

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.460 
low-tech militia supported by a very
high<00:02:08.729> tech<00:02:09.030> core<00:02:09.360> organization<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.319> has

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
high tech core organization that has

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.619 
high tech core organization that has

so<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.519> point<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.000> spear<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.510> really<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
so the point of the spear is really the

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.599 
so the point of the spear is really the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.159 
specifically the ability to control your
production<00:03:56.849> cues<00:03:57.180> from<00:03:57.509> anywhere<00:03:57.959> on<00:03:58.019> the

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
production cues from anywhere on the

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.390 
production cues from anywhere on the
battlefield<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:58.889> could<00:03:59.099> be<00:03:59.220> in<00:03:59.310> the

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
battlefield so you could be in the

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.189 
battlefield so you could be in the
middle<00:03:59.519> of<00:03:59.639> a<00:03:59.729> battle<00:03:59.939> and<00:04:00.269> tell<00:04:00.900> your

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
middle of a battle and tell your

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.780 
middle of a battle and tell your
production<00:04:01.620> structures<00:04:02.009> to<00:04:02.129> create<00:04:02.489> new

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
production structures to create new

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.539 
production structures to create new
vehicles<00:04:03.389> or<00:04:03.629> infantry<00:04:04.169> so<00:04:04.859> we<00:04:05.009> knew<00:04:05.280> for

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
vehicles or infantry so we knew for

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.069 
vehicles or infantry so we knew for
command<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:05.909> conquer<00:04:06.150> 3<00:04:06.329> we<00:04:06.479> had<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.900> bring

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
command and conquer 3 we had to bring

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.629 
command and conquer 3 we had to bring
back<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.530> side<00:04:07.769> bar<00:04:08.009> but<00:04:08.189> we<00:04:08.250> had<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.489> update

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
back the side bar but we had to update

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.789 
back the side bar but we had to update
it<00:04:09.000> because<00:04:09.269> RTS<00:04:09.780> games<00:04:10.019> have<00:04:10.229> evolved<00:04:10.739> over

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
it because RTS games have evolved over

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.800 
it because RTS games have evolved over
the<00:04:11.009> last<00:04:11.069> seven<00:04:11.609> years<00:04:11.639> and<00:04:12.060> so<00:04:12.569> have<00:04:12.780> the

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
the last seven years and so have the

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.420 
the last seven years and so have the
user<00:04:13.109> interfaces<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:13.829> in<00:04:13.919> fact<00:04:14.069> some<00:04:14.189> of<00:04:14.250> our

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
user interfaces and in fact some of our

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.009 
user interfaces and in fact some of our
previous<00:04:14.609> games<00:04:15.060> have<00:04:15.269> pioneered<00:04:15.540> some

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
previous games have pioneered some

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.379 
previous games have pioneered some
advances<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.680> how<00:04:16.829> to<00:04:16.889> make<00:04:17.099> interface<00:04:17.639> in<00:04:17.880> an

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
advances and how to make interface in an

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.140 
advances and how to make interface in an
RTS<00:04:18.989> really<00:04:19.380> accessible<00:04:19.889> easy<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.549> use<00:04:20.820> so
