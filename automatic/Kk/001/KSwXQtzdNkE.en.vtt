00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
they're all the way up and then it'll

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.069 
they're all the way up and then it'll
turn<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.009> lights<00:01:50.399> off<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.930> putting<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.049> down

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
turn the lights off and putting it down

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.719 
turn the lights off and putting it down
and<00:01:52.409> be<00:01:52.500> read<00:01:52.740> until<00:01:53.100> they're<00:01:53.220> all<00:01:53.310> down<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
and be read until they're all down and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.560 
and be read until they're all down and
then<00:01:53.820> I'll<00:01:54.030> stake<00:01:54.329> me<00:01:54.979> it<00:01:55.979> also<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.820> be<00:01:56.850> yellow

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
then I'll stake me it also can be yellow

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.200 
then I'll stake me it also can be yellow
but<00:01:58.079> I've<00:01:58.229> not<00:01:58.979> figured<00:01:59.340> out<00:01:59.490> how<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.820> works

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
but I've not figured out how that works

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.340 
but I've not figured out how that works
I<00:02:00.570> think<00:02:01.140> if<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.340> your<00:02:02.430> gear<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.939> stuck

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
I think if one of your gear is stuck

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.679 
I think if one of your gear is stuck
then<00:02:04.350> it'll<00:02:04.890> turn<00:02:05.009> yellow<00:02:05.219> that's<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.420> I

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
then it'll turn yellow that's just I

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.010 
then it'll turn yellow that's just I
guess<00:02:06.960> um<00:02:08.060> it's<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.450> any<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> other

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
guess um it's like any of the other

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.780 
guess um it's like any of the other
state<00:02:10.289> tech<00:02:10.470> panels<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.160> has
