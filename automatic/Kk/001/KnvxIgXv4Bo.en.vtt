00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
Aqua illuminations Vega I decided to be

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.990 
Aqua illuminations Vega I decided to be
a<00:03:16.940> good<00:03:17.299> idea<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.720> take<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.350> van<00:03:18.530> Gogh<00:03:18.650> off

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
a good idea to take the van Gogh off

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.539 
a good idea to take the van Gogh off
while<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.030> was<00:03:20.390> cleaning<00:03:21.350> out<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.799> tank<00:03:22.070> and

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
while I was cleaning out the tank and

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.060 
while I was cleaning out the tank and
fill<00:03:23.299> it<00:03:23.480> back<00:03:23.600> up<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:24.140> whatnot<00:03:24.290> just<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.920> make

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
fill it back up and whatnot just to make

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.210 
fill it back up and whatnot just to make
sure<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:25.250> didn't<00:03:25.820> get<00:03:25.970> any<00:03:26.180> water<00:03:26.359> damage

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
sure I didn't get any water damage

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.110 
sure I didn't get any water damage
because<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.400> would<00:03:28.489> be<00:03:28.519> a<00:03:28.609> very<00:03:28.790> expensive

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
because that would be a very expensive

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.229 
because that would be a very expensive
thing<00:03:29.600> to<00:03:29.750> get<00:03:29.900> water<00:03:30.109> on<00:03:30.200> and<00:03:30.560> see<00:03:31.370> I<00:03:31.400> just<00:03:31.760> got

so we make cleaning the sump a hell of a
lot<00:04:27.320> easier<00:04:28.540> I<00:04:29.540> took<00:04:30.110> advantage<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.520> no

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
lot easier I took advantage of the no

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
power situation tilt the skimmer out

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.890 
power situation tilt the skimmer out
give<00:04:35.150> it<00:04:35.210> a<00:04:35.240> good<00:04:35.389> vinegar<00:04:36.020> bath<00:04:37.630> it's<00:04:38.630> almost

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
give it a good vinegar bath it's almost

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.930 
give it a good vinegar bath it's almost
like<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.110> brand-new<00:04:39.470> skimmer<00:04:39.860> again<00:04:40.160> put<00:04:40.850> it

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
like a brand-new skimmer again put it

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.159 
like a brand-new skimmer again put it
back<00:04:41.120> in<00:04:41.389> for<00:04:42.380> those<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:42.950> you<00:04:43.070> who<00:04:43.870> pay<00:04:44.870> close

of<00:04:59.210> bored<00:04:59.449> at<00:04:59.600> home<00:04:59.630> so<00:05:00.080> I<00:05:00.110> was<00:05:00.260> just<00:05:00.500> thinking

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
of bored at home so I was just thinking

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.610 
of bored at home so I was just thinking
of<00:05:00.919> things<00:05:01.100> to<00:05:01.280> do<00:05:01.430> with<00:05:01.669> the<00:05:01.910> sump<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:02.960> put<00:05:03.590> a

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
of things to do with the sump I put a

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.020 
of things to do with the sump I put a
little<00:05:03.770> piece<00:05:03.979> of<00:05:04.160> egg<00:05:04.340> crepe<00:05:04.639> between

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
little piece of egg crepe between

little piece of egg crepe between
chamber<00:05:05.450> wine<00:05:05.630> chamber<00:05:06.080> to<00:05:06.260> maybe<00:05:07.100> I<00:05:07.250> was

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
chamber wine chamber to maybe I was

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.690 
chamber wine chamber to maybe I was
thinking<00:05:07.910> as<00:05:08.720> water<00:05:09.289> goes<00:05:09.560> flows<00:05:09.979> in<00:05:10.250> between

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
thinking as water goes flows in between

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.330 
thinking as water goes flows in between
here<00:05:11.110> into<00:05:12.110> chamber<00:05:12.500> to<00:05:12.710> it<00:05:13.070> would<00:05:13.190> help

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
here into chamber to it would help

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.640 
here into chamber to it would help
aerate<00:05:13.639> the<00:05:14.180> water<00:05:14.660> as<00:05:14.930> its<00:05:15.139> kind<00:05:15.349> of<00:05:15.410> flowing

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
aerate the water as its kind of flowing

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.890 
aerate the water as its kind of flowing
it<00:05:15.830> over<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.310> chamber<00:05:16.760> I<00:05:16.970> don't<00:05:17.780> know<00:05:17.840> I've

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
it over the chamber I don't know I've

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.140 
it over the chamber I don't know I've
been<00:05:17.960> bored<00:05:18.320> for<00:05:18.470> 13<00:05:19.190> days<00:05:19.220> ourselves<00:05:20.000> I

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
been bored for 13 days ourselves I

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.110 
been bored for 13 days ourselves I
thought<00:05:20.599> it'd<00:05:20.690> be<00:05:20.720> a<00:05:20.870> good<00:05:20.990> idea<00:05:21.820> but<00:05:22.820> anyways

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
thought it'd be a good idea but anyways

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.219 
thought it'd be a good idea but anyways

below<00:05:42.260> what<00:05:42.349> you<00:05:42.560> think<00:05:42.740> about<00:05:42.860> that<00:05:43.190> order<00:05:43.880> of

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
below what you think about that order of

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.690 
below what you think about that order of
filtration<00:05:46.220> but<00:05:48.160> anyways<00:05:49.160> right<00:05:49.400> here<00:05:49.580> you

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
filtration but anyways right here you

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.650 
filtration but anyways right here you
can<00:05:49.849> see<00:05:50.060> that<00:05:50.090> the<00:05:50.830> heater<00:05:51.830> is<00:05:51.979> gone<00:05:52.970> it's

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
can see that the heater is gone it's

can see that the heater is gone it's
actually<00:05:54.050> in<00:05:54.110> the<00:05:54.200> little<00:05:54.410> 2.5<00:05:55.039> gallon<00:05:55.550> tank

keep him what's left of my fish alive
what<00:06:01.010> did<00:06:01.220> survive<00:06:01.580> was<00:06:02.060> a<00:06:02.360> clownfish<00:06:03.080> green

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680

chromis shrimp snail and Herbert
that's<00:06:08.970> basically<00:06:09.630> it<00:06:09.780> so<00:06:10.740> I'm<00:06:10.800> kind<00:06:11.070> of

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
that's basically it so I'm kind of

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.950 
that's basically it so I'm kind of
trying<00:06:11.400> to<00:06:11.580> keep<00:06:11.729> those<00:06:11.910> guys<00:06:12.120> alive<00:06:12.570> in<00:06:12.780> the

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
little 2.5 gallon but back to the sump

in<00:06:16.380> the<00:06:17.280> refugium<00:06:17.729> section<00:06:18.180> over<00:06:18.389> here<00:06:18.949> I've

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:19.949 
in the refugium section over here I've

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:22.879 
in the refugium section over here I've
actually<00:06:20.389> replaced<00:06:21.389> the<00:06:21.660> live<00:06:21.870> sand<00:06:22.320> and<00:06:22.650> I've

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
actually replaced the live sand and I've

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:24.920 
actually replaced the live sand and I've
put<00:06:23.130> crushed<00:06:23.430> coral<00:06:23.850> I<00:06:24.090> thought<00:06:24.570> crushed

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
put crushed coral I thought crushed

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.740 
put crushed coral I thought crushed
coral<00:06:25.260> would<00:06:25.470> be<00:06:25.590> a<00:06:25.620> better<00:06:25.949> option<00:06:26.180> for<00:06:27.180> the

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
coral would be a better option for the

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.570 
coral would be a better option for the
refugium<00:06:28.229> section<00:06:28.740> just<00:06:28.919> so<00:06:29.190> it<00:06:29.310> could<00:06:29.430> help

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
refugium section just so it could help

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.719 
refugium section just so it could help
stabilize<00:06:30.240> the<00:06:30.270> pH<00:06:30.780> as<00:06:31.110> the<00:06:31.949> waters<00:06:32.280> kind<00:06:32.639> of

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
stabilize the pH as the waters kind of

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:35.629 
stabilize the pH as the waters kind of
