00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.639 
direction the ball came just going to
mix<00:01:20.860> it<00:01:21.009> up<00:01:21.130> here<00:01:21.159> firing<00:01:21.729> it<00:01:21.820> from<00:01:21.969> the<00:01:22.090> left

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:29.550 
mix it up here firing it from the left
from<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.680> right<00:01:27.750> now<00:01:28.750> it's<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.020> quick<00:01:29.259> feed

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
from the right now it's the quick feed

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:38.810 
from the right now it's the quick feed
here<00:01:29.829> from<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.189> keeper

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820

and we're just going to mix it up from
side<00:01:41.049> to<00:01:41.080> side<00:01:41.380> so<00:01:41.619> it<00:01:41.740> doesn't<00:01:41.770> know<00:01:42.009> where

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
side to side so it doesn't know where

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.380 
side to side so it doesn't know where
it's<00:01:42.280> coming<00:01:42.490> from<00:01:42.580> so<00:01:42.850> you<00:01:42.939> can't<00:01:43.119> anticipate

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390
