00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
guys want to check it out it's really

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.830 
guys want to check it out it's really
really<00:02:47.760> nice<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.090> feels<00:02:48.120> really<00:02:48.510> good<00:02:48.660> and

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
really nice it feels really good and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.229 
really nice it feels really good and
solid<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:49.350> my<00:02:49.440> hand<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:50.280> was<00:02:50.459> very<00:02:50.700> hard

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
solid in my hand it was very hard

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.330 
solid in my hand it was very hard
snapping<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.930> get<00:02:52.049> it<00:02:52.170> on<00:02:52.319> so<00:02:52.590> I'm<00:02:52.739> guessing

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
snapping to get it on so I'm guessing

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.160 
snapping to get it on so I'm guessing
that<00:02:53.700> it's<00:02:53.819> not<00:02:53.940> going<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.239> just<00:02:54.389> break<00:02:54.750> off<00:02:54.930> if

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
that it's not going to just break off if

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.949 
that it's not going to just break off if
you<00:02:55.260> fall<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:55.859> you<00:02:56.120> drop<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.150> or<00:02:57.480> anything<00:02:57.810> like

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
you fall if you drop it or anything like

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.330 
you fall if you drop it or anything like
that<00:02:58.489> it<00:02:59.489> feels<00:02:59.700> really<00:02:59.910> nice<00:03:00.120> guys<00:03:00.359> this<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:00.780> a
