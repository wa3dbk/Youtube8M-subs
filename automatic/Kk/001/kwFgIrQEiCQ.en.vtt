like<00:01:35.899> you're<00:01:36.049> throwing<00:01:36.259> an<00:01:36.409> egg<00:01:36.649> but<00:01:37.039> it<00:01:37.130> does

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
like you're throwing an egg but it does

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.709 
like you're throwing an egg but it does
not<00:01:37.369> like<00:01:37.670> hatch<00:01:37.939> you<00:01:38.149> could<00:01:38.329> you<00:01:38.630> know

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
not like hatch you could you know

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.149 
not like hatch you could you know
obviously<00:01:38.899> it's<00:01:39.259> not<00:01:39.289> gonna<00:01:39.469> hatch<00:01:39.649> a<00:01:39.829> chicken

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
obviously it's not gonna hatch a chicken

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.920 
obviously it's not gonna hatch a chicken
but<00:01:40.549> you<00:01:40.640> could<00:01:40.789> throw<00:01:40.969> these<00:01:41.119> things<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.630> you

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
but you could throw these things and you

but you could throw these things and you
could<00:01:42.049> just<00:01:42.079> break<00:01:42.409> windows<00:01:42.770> you<00:01:42.979> can<00:01:43.009> hurt

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
could just break windows you can hurt

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.620 
could just break windows you can hurt
mobs<00:01:43.610> you<00:01:43.789> can<00:01:43.909> do<00:01:44.000> whatever<00:01:44.149> you<00:01:44.299> like<00:01:44.359> and

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
this at grass they will disappear

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.330 
this at grass they will disappear
because<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:09.140> are<00:03:09.230> breaking<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.620> grass<00:03:09.799> but

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
because you are breaking the grass but

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
moment so let's throw set a flower and

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.660 
moment so let's throw set a flower and
it<00:03:15.019> doesn't<00:03:15.349> seem<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.560> be<00:03:15.680> able<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:15.980> work<00:03:16.099> but

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
it doesn't seem to be able to work but

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.550 
it doesn't seem to be able to work but
if<00:03:16.849> you<00:03:17.030> have<00:03:17.209> tea<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:17.540> tea<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:17.989> you<00:03:18.319> happen

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
if you have tea and tea and you happen

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.080 
if you have tea and tea and you happen
to<00:03:18.650> throw<00:03:18.799> some<00:03:19.040> bricks<00:03:19.280> at<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.519> it<00:03:19.700> does<00:03:19.940> have

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
to throw some bricks at it it does have

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.120 
to throw some bricks at it it does have
a<00:03:20.150> chance<00:03:20.690> of<00:03:20.840> activating<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:21.739> there<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.069> is

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
a chance of activating it so there it is

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.740 
a chance of activating it so there it is
I<00:03:22.340> just<00:03:22.639> activated<00:03:23.120> some<00:03:23.209> team<00:03:23.420> tee<00:03:23.600> it's

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
I just activated some team tee it's

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.410 
I just activated some team tee it's
gonna<00:03:23.870> explode<00:03:24.019> but<00:03:24.889> whoa<00:03:25.489> how<00:03:25.910> strange<00:03:26.209> it

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
gonna explode but whoa how strange it

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.509 
gonna explode but whoa how strange it
didn't<00:03:26.600> explode<00:03:26.840> okay<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.799> guess<00:03:27.950> that<00:03:28.100> was

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
didn't explode okay so I guess that was

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:29.979 
didn't explode okay so I guess that was
a<00:03:28.549> little<00:03:28.819> big<00:03:28.970> bug<00:03:29.180> but<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:29.750> could<00:03:29.870> throw

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
a little big bug but you could throw

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.110 
a little big bug but you could throw
that<00:03:30.079> sugarcane<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.859> it's<00:03:31.220> pretty<00:03:31.430> cool<00:03:31.700> you

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
that sugarcane and it's pretty cool you

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.490 
that sugarcane and it's pretty cool you
could<00:03:32.269> throw<00:03:32.450> these<00:03:32.569> at<00:03:32.750> glass<00:03:32.959> like<00:03:33.170> i<00:03:33.260> said

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
could throw these at glass like i said

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.110 
could throw these at glass like i said
earlier<00:03:33.739> before<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.340> just<00:03:34.519> throw<00:03:34.670> that<00:03:34.819> glass

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
earlier before you just throw that glass

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.629 
earlier before you just throw that glass
is<00:03:35.150> really<00:03:35.510> simple<00:03:35.690> but<00:03:36.170> for<00:03:36.829> ice<00:03:37.040> it<00:03:37.340> doesn't

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
is really simple but for ice it doesn't

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.009 
is really simple but for ice it doesn't
do<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:37.819> for<00:03:37.880> ice<00:03:38.150> I<00:03:38.420> was<00:03:38.540> like<00:03:38.630> specking<00:03:38.930> this

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
do it for ice I was like specking this

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.780 
do it for ice I was like specking this
to<00:03:39.109> work<00:03:39.230> for<00:03:39.260> ice<00:03:39.530> because<00:03:39.859> ice<00:03:40.099> isn't<00:03:40.400> really

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
to work for ice because ice isn't really

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.150 
to work for ice because ice isn't really
that<00:03:40.910> strong<00:03:41.500> compared<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.590> class<00:03:42.769> it's<00:03:42.980> like

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
that strong compared to class it's like

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.089 
that strong compared to class it's like
the<00:03:43.340> same<00:03:43.489> as<00:03:43.669> glass<00:03:43.880> it<00:03:44.230> it<00:03:45.230> just<00:03:45.260> breaks<00:03:45.650> very

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
the same as glass it it just breaks very

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.610 
the same as glass it it just breaks very
very<00:03:46.430> easily<00:03:46.730> so<00:03:47.150> that<00:03:47.540> is<00:03:47.870> basically<00:03:47.900> what

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
very easily so that is basically what

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.650 
very easily so that is basically what
the<00:03:48.889> throwable<00:03:49.340> bricks<00:03:49.730> Mont<00:03:50.060> does<00:03:50.359> it's

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
the throwable bricks Mont does it's

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.509 
the throwable bricks Mont does it's
really<00:03:51.169> affected<00:03:51.590> towards<00:03:51.709> skeletons<00:03:52.220> like<00:03:52.400> I

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
really affected towards skeletons like I

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.220 
really affected towards skeletons like I
said<00:03:52.819> I<00:03:53.030> keep<00:03:53.269> on<00:03:53.389> repeating<00:03:53.540> myself<00:03:53.840> because

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
said I keep on repeating myself because

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.650 
said I keep on repeating myself because
this<00:03:54.380> is<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.530> very<00:03:54.769> small<00:03:55.190> mod<00:03:55.489> and<00:03:55.700> I<00:03:56.150> had<00:03:56.359> to<00:03:56.510> do

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
this is a very small mod and I had to do

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.449 
this is a very small mod and I had to do
a<00:03:56.690> very<00:03:57.049> very<00:03:57.349> small<00:03:57.500> amount<00:03:57.889> today<00:03:58.040> because<00:03:58.430> I

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
a very very small amount today because I

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.159 
a very very small amount today because I
had<00:03:58.700> some<00:03:58.940> channel<00:03:59.299> news<00:03:59.510> that<00:03:59.720> I<00:03:59.750> want<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.049> get

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
had some channel news that I want to get

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
that's gonna be happening around my

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.530 
that's gonna be happening around my
channel<00:04:03.889> so<00:04:04.280> i<00:04:04.310> think<00:04:04.459> that<00:04:04.700> is<00:04:04.819> basically<00:04:05.329> it

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
channel so i think that is basically it

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.210 
channel so i think that is basically it
