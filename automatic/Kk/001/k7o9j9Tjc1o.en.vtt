00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.029
 In today's difference, it 's up to you. 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.250
 feed their fish properly and 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.010
 just remembering that this is the room 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.570
 from the continuation of the series to 46 in 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.570
 I start playing there 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.699
 the first thing you should do 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.740
 both of fish that has 15 fish here 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.840
 counting on the clean ones before you have 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:34.160
 contacts as normal fish around 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.250
 and there is also a fish food 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.870
 about the use of funds that it will 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:01:05.250
 put some float some drops 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:01:09.689
 bottom fish the cone that is how much of 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.180
 food is recommended for both of two 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.009
 food leaves then 15 fish will go 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:25.700
 eat 30 but not so I do not put 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.700
 always Polka Dot leaflets 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.390
 So we're going to get some 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:37.020
 People think they give our fish 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:42.659
 very little anyway and now you just 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:55.259
 Put ball band can measure in the 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:02:05.430
 square even show how the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:09.439
 Reason for abandonment now we go 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.439
 dump the event and watch them eat 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.599
 but this one is the work cover slowly 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:27.030
 not to scare the fish puts the 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:33.120
 two and no wonder orders 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:35.780
 Crazy people there and there they are 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.670
 eating person 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.900
 I know this video may sound like 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.400
 chuchu because it's pretty basic but if you 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.010
 does not give correct food for his 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.180
 fish and they can die and obviously 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.099
 almost everyone knows and it's good to stay 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.209
 knowing and being well informed of the 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.200
 situation 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.669
 As I already had several fish because of 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.680
 that they died for lack of 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:03.689
 or because I also put 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.669
 too much power can not 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.889
 more or less 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:10.409
 So you're putting in so much that is 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.909
 to put even and never put the most 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.150
 not even less than that 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.139
 Thank you for this is the most 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.049
 experiences like the one you find 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:21.769
 in the experiences of the week in our series 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.769
