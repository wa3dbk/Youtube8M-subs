00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:28.680
 a few others do not help a crap like that 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.949
 moment 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:46.650

 Of course I have it perfect again 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.520
 I do not have to distribute that hour 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.410
 respected but just a bit 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.780
 It will be longer to let it cool down 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.060
 now also accordingly 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.800
 frizzy I think maybe it was 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.510
 because I just too many 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.100
 Nuts still with plenty no matter 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.080
 sorrow I have here again 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.660
 rest of the almonds 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.750
 I can now dive that found 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.750
 So sweet is really cute 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:26.630
 also good 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:30.050
 then of course I have something else 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:34.170
 this is a mess here and now 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.780
 though chocolate sprinkles chocolate sprinkles 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.780
 can you also take a look like that 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.420
 looks 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:45.300
 ok does not last 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.770
 you have to press a bit firmly then 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.910
 it is not a ball anymore 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.640
 maybe it can be a bit more 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:54.570
 firmly 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:58.650
 yes not nice but they help and 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:02.430
 what was also sugar in the concept completely 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:08.880
 normal ordinary sugar can also 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:09.480
 take and with her that also nicer 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.820
 coating 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.810

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:20.120

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.120

 that is what it is now 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:34.199

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.199
 really much 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:42.009

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:55.509
 sugar variant agreed as it sees 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:56.759

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:21.810
 soft you can do a role in the 

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:21.810
