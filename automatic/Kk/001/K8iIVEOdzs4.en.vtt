00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.900
 well let's explain how the 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.539
 palette now from the point of view of 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.719
 color and we explain how you take the 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:15.440
 pallet in hand now let's see the 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:20.710
 colors already more or less and we put a 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:23.560
 series of oils here around 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.669
 and already in the order that more or less are used 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.649
 everyone here in this sector of this part 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.710
 of the palette we are going to place the 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:34.930
 brown of earth 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.750
 that are placed separately and then to 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.610
 from here with the reds 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.820
 the yellow blue green we're going 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.190
 using the same position as the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.190
 colors have the chromatic circle 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.340
 to give you an order because it's important 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.920
 that the palette is ordered from that 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.440
 way 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.870
 if we do not maintain an order in the palette 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.040
 it will never reach us as big as 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.140
 be this is a pretty big palette 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.720
 and we start with white the white 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.720
 has a position here in the center 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.470
 in the middle of the palette 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.469
 now we have lemon yellow 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.350
 next to the others we place it 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.240
 then we have an emerald green 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.380
 well then we said the mixture of 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.960
 the colors are going to do next 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.530
 color that generates the mixture for example 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.170
 if we are going to mix blue all the mixture 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.180
 that we make we are going to place it next 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.480
 of the mother color or next to the blue 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.950
 that is, we take color for the brush 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.740
 we spread on the surface of the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.080
 palette then let's put the case if 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.120
 we want to clarify it with white to make 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.650
 a mixture that works for a heaven or 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.440
 for a sea 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.540
 we take small amount we are placing 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.540
 small amount of white
