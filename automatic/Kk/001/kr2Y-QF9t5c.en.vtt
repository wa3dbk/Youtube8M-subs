 obesity are malnutrition 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.579
 sedentary lifestyle when 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.890
 certain genetic 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.800
 predisposition in this way 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.630
 heredity can only 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.890
 predetermine obesity and such obesity 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.180
 are called alimentary or exogenous 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.610
 constitutional recruit extra 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.830
 kilogram is easy but get rid of 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.740
 appeared body fat and habits 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.540
 there is not that easy some 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.850
 start eating more stressful 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.430
 in situations others are bad 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.189
 mood and so someone is unnoticeable for 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.259
 eats itself up a mountain product conveniently 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.070
 sitting in front of the TV or 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.799
 by computer 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.100
 and someone breaks the diet is not 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.290
 eats breakfast but overeats at night 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.720
 just gourmets who likes tasty 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.729
 eat women obesity can be 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.969
 associated with pregnancy and subsequent 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.159
 breastfeeding plays an important role and 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.710
 patient age fat accumulation 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.780
 sediments know that the older 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.490
 a person gets bigger 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.439
 the likelihood that she takes extra 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.850
 kilos 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.990
 blame for this decline in physical 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.869
 load slowdown exchange 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.479
 substances change hormonal background a 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.450
 while the habit of eating a lot remains 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.939
 formerly there is such a thing as 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.970
 secondary obesity which develops 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.820
 endocrine trauma diseases 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.920
 or brain tumors when taking 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.229
 some drugs 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.929
 however, the share of secondary obesity 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.299
 only 5 percent of the total 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.420
 number of overweight people 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.619
 what happens with obesity energy 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.630
 comes from food 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.360
 spent on the main exchange and 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.459
 exercise if energy with food 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.590
 comes in more than necessary for 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.900
 of the body, that is , the energy in the form 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.090
 fat is deposited in fat depots 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.370
 some on the stomach and upper half 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.040
 torso so the so-called develops 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.920
 android type obesity in others on 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.190
 thighs and they are talking then about the ginoid 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.450
 type of obesity can say that obesity 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.750
 this is a long lasting energy imbalance 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.120
 as a result of energy metabolism 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.579
 all organs and systems of the body are involved 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.970
 in particular due to the consumption of food 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.079
 central nervous system responds 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.750
 brain forms substances 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.440
 that stimulate or suppress 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.140
 appetite 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.579
 these same substances determine our 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.600
 taste preferences 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.600
 still stupidly
