00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.009 
butter out of the refrigerator and I'm
going<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.860> cut<00:02:21.129> it<00:02:21.250> in<00:02:21.400> half<00:02:21.510> lengthwise<00:02:22.510> and

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
going to cut it in half lengthwise and

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.119 
going to cut it in half lengthwise and
then<00:02:23.310> run<00:02:24.310> my<00:02:24.610> knife<00:02:24.940> through<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.099> cut<00:02:27.099> it

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
then run my knife through it and cut it

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.850 
then run my knife through it and cut it
into<00:02:27.430> some<00:02:27.910> smaller<00:02:28.330> cubes<00:02:28.959> now<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.470> reason<00:02:29.620> I

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
into some smaller cubes now the reason I

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.920 
into some smaller cubes now the reason I
do<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.069> is<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:30.550> I<00:02:30.580> find<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.150> creams<00:02:31.540> up

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
do this is that I find that it creams up

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.140 
do this is that I find that it creams up
much<00:02:32.290> easier<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.310> can<00:02:33.489> take<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.970> butter

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
much easier and I can take the butter

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.360 
much easier and I can take the butter
just<00:02:34.660> right<00:02:35.050> out<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.470> refrigerator<00:02:35.620> and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
just right out of the refrigerator and

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.699 
just right out of the refrigerator and
so<00:02:36.610> I'll<00:02:36.760> take<00:02:37.090> all<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.540> butter<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.260> put<00:02:38.560> it

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
so I'll take all that butter and put it

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.000 
so I'll take all that butter and put it
in<00:02:39.040> with<00:02:39.340> my<00:02:39.370> brown<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.420> white<00:02:40.780> sugar<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.680> get

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
in with my brown and white sugar and get

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.250 
in with my brown and white sugar and get
that<00:02:42.219> creaming<00:02:42.969> now<00:02:43.510> once<00:02:43.780> that's

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
that creaming now once that's

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.399 
that creaming now once that's
cream<00:02:44.470> together<00:02:44.799> I<00:02:45.250> have<00:02:45.760> two<00:02:46.209> eggs<00:02:46.540> I'm<00:02:47.230> going

now<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.389> reason<00:03:52.629> I'm<00:03:53.019> doing<00:03:53.260> this<00:03:53.500> now<00:03:54.040> is

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
now the reason I'm doing this now is

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.430 
now the reason I'm doing this now is
because<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:54.910> don't<00:03:55.299> want<00:03:55.389> to<00:03:55.629> overbeat<00:03:56.199> the

because I don't want to overbeat the

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.740 
because I don't want to overbeat the
cookies<00:03:56.889> if<00:03:57.250> i<00:03:57.549> were<00:03:57.699> to<00:03:57.790> put<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:58.090> flour<00:03:58.449> in

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
cookies if i were to put the flour in

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.259 
cookies if i were to put the flour in
and<00:03:59.230> mix<00:03:59.470> that<00:03:59.799> in<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.489> then<00:04:00.519> put<00:04:00.879> the<00:04:01.030> nuts

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
and mix that in and then put the nuts

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.300 
and mix that in and then put the nuts
and<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.810> chocolate<00:04:02.470> I<00:04:02.590> could<00:04:02.859> have<00:04:03.280> a

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
and the chocolate I could have a

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.309 
and the chocolate I could have a
tendency<00:04:03.910> to<00:04:03.940> overbeat<00:04:04.419> the<00:04:04.629> cookies<00:04:05.049> and

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
tendency to overbeat the cookies and

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.349 
tendency to overbeat the cookies and
these<00:04:05.949> chocolate<00:04:06.489> chips<00:04:06.730> will<00:04:06.940> start<00:04:07.209> to

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
these chocolate chips will start to

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.939 
these chocolate chips will start to
break<00:04:07.599> down<00:04:07.629> and<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.139> don't<00:04:08.349> want<00:04:08.530> that<00:04:08.620> to

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
break down and I don't want that to

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.280 
break down and I don't want that to
happen<00:04:08.980> so<00:04:09.519> i'll<00:04:09.910> go<00:04:10.090> ahead<00:04:10.120> and<00:04:10.449> mix<00:04:10.750> them<00:04:11.049> in

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
happen so i'll go ahead and mix them in

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.559 
happen so i'll go ahead and mix them in
now<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:12.069> then<00:04:12.699> i'm<00:04:12.819> going<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.060> take<00:04:13.329> all<00:04:13.510> of

now and then i'm going to take all of

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.990 
now and then i'm going to take all of
the<00:04:13.989> dry<00:04:14.230> ingredients<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:15.220> pour<00:04:15.639> that<00:04:15.699> right

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
the dry ingredients and pour that right

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.770
