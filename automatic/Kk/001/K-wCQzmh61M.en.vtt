00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
see this is a mini greenhouse of six of

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.610 
see this is a mini greenhouse of six of
their<00:04:32.650> strung<00:04:33.460> fruits<00:04:33.790> now<00:04:34.169> we've<00:04:35.169> just<00:04:35.200> got

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
their strung fruits now we've just got

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.560 
their strung fruits now we've just got
our<00:04:35.650> compost<00:04:36.160> goes<00:04:36.400> up<00:04:36.550> compa<00:04:37.060> some<00:04:37.210> have<00:04:37.480> this

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
our compost goes up compa some have this

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.880

really<00:04:38.080> poor<00:04:38.320> quality

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
really poor quality

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.510 
really poor quality
so<00:04:39.460> I'm<00:04:39.520> using<00:04:39.640> my<00:04:39.820> compost<00:04:40.390> now<00:04:40.680> it<00:04:41.680> is<00:04:41.890> sifted

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
so I'm using my compost now it is sifted

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.340 
so I'm using my compost now it is sifted
but<00:04:42.760> I<00:04:42.789> have<00:04:42.970> to<00:04:43.120> be<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.270> bit<00:04:43.479> more<00:04:43.630> careful<00:04:43.930> as

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
but I have to be a bit more careful as

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.119 
but I have to be a bit more careful as
it's

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
it's

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.119 
it's
more<00:04:45.279> heavy<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.999> bit<00:04:46.749> more<00:04:46.959> have<00:04:47.469> a<00:04:47.619> bigger

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
more heavy a bit more have a bigger

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:50.929 
more heavy a bit more have a bigger
chunk<00:04:48.489> so<00:04:48.909> I'll<00:04:49.449> be<00:04:49.689> a<00:04:49.719> bit<00:04:50.050> more<00:04:50.199> careful<00:04:50.499> now

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:50.939 
chunk so I'll be a bit more careful now

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:57.899 
chunk so I'll be a bit more careful now
when<00:04:51.939> I'll<00:04:52.709> sorting<00:04:53.709> this<00:04:53.800> out<00:04:54.389> so<00:04:55.389> you<00:04:56.909> know

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:57.909
