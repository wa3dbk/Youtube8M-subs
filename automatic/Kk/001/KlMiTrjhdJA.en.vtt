as we get into the slides throughout the
solar<00:03:57.400> Squad<00:03:57.730> a<00:03:57.760> few<00:03:57.970> slides<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:59.200> other<00:03:59.410> thing

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
solar Squad a few slides the other thing

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.680 
solar Squad a few slides the other thing
is<00:03:59.830> that<00:03:59.860> I<00:04:00.040> played<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:00.700> song<00:04:00.970> in<00:04:01.330> the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
performance with a swing feel okay or

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.229 
performance with a swing feel okay or
weighted<00:04:05.410> note<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:06.100> all<00:04:06.519> that<00:04:06.670> means<00:04:06.880> you<00:04:07.090> can

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
weighted note and all that means you can

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.940 
weighted note and all that means you can
hear<00:04:07.510> it<00:04:07.630> but<00:04:07.810> what<00:04:08.290> that<00:04:08.410> means<00:04:08.560> essentially

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
hear it but what that means essentially

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.280 
hear it but what that means essentially
is<00:04:09.209> well<00:04:10.209> I'll<00:04:10.330> just<00:04:10.480> play<00:04:10.630> it<00:04:10.660> straight<00:04:10.900> for

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
is well I'll just play it straight for

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.580 
is well I'll just play it straight for
you<00:04:11.380> first<00:04:11.560> you'll<00:04:11.799> hear

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.750 

but<00:04:16.590> I'll<00:04:16.680> play<00:04:16.799> with<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.070> swing<00:04:17.280> feel<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:17.640> it

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
but I'll play with the swing feel so it

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.000 
but I'll play with the swing feel so it
sounds<00:04:17.970> more<00:04:18.060> like<00:04:18.630> this<00:04:21.740> you<00:04:22.740> heard<00:04:22.920> the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
sounds more like this you heard the

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.340 
sounds more like this you heard the
difference<00:04:23.400> there<00:04:23.730> okay<00:04:24.360> now<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.870> faster

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
difference there okay now the faster

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.720 
difference there okay now the faster
that<00:04:25.470> you<00:04:25.530> play<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:25.980> more<00:04:26.130> difficult<00:04:26.610> it

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
that you play it the more difficult it

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.130 
that you play it the more difficult it
is<00:04:26.820> to<00:04:26.850> get<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.210> swing<00:04:27.510> feel<00:04:27.950> okay<00:04:28.950> so<00:04:29.010> mmm<00:04:29.940> so<00:04:30.240> as

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
is to get a swing feel okay so mmm so as

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.860 
is to get a swing feel okay so mmm so as
you<00:04:31.380> learn<00:04:31.560> it<00:04:31.770> more<00:04:31.920> up<00:04:32.040> to<00:04:32.190> speed<00:04:32.570> you<00:04:33.570> may<00:04:33.690> or

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
you learn it more up to speed you may or

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.020 
you learn it more up to speed you may or
may<00:04:33.900> not<00:04:34.140> be<00:04:34.740> able<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:35.010> retain<00:04:35.370> that<00:04:35.640> we're

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.940 
and then as I play those open e strings
after<00:05:37.790> them<00:05:38.030> will<00:05:38.210> shift<00:05:38.450> back<00:05:38.600> down<00:05:38.990> to<00:05:39.770> grab

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
after them will shift back down to grab

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.230 
after them will shift back down to grab
this<00:05:40.100> fifth<00:05:40.370> fret<00:05:40.520> again<00:05:40.670> with<00:05:40.880> my<00:05:41.030> ring

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240

finger and come back down and that's

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.350 
finger and come back down and that's
going<00:05:47.210> to<00:05:47.300> set<00:05:47.480> us<00:05:47.600> up<00:05:47.780> for<00:05:48.110> measure<00:05:48.830> five<00:05:49.360> or

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
going to set us up for measure five or

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.030 
going to set us up for measure five or
we're<00:05:50.540> going<00:05:50.690> to<00:05:50.810> just<00:05:51.200> keep<00:05:51.410> coming<00:05:51.770> down<00:05:51.890> the

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
we're going to just keep coming down the

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.850 
we're going to just keep coming down the
scale<00:05:55.180> okay<00:05:56.180> all<00:05:56.600> pretty<00:05:57.020> simple<00:05:57.440> stuff<00:05:57.680> when

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
scale okay all pretty simple stuff when

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.770 
scale okay all pretty simple stuff when
we<00:05:57.950> get<00:05:58.040> to<00:05:58.160> measure<00:05:58.340> six<00:05:58.730> you'll<00:05:59.540> have<00:05:59.660> to

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
we get to measure six you'll have to

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.990 
we get to measure six you'll have to
watch<00:05:59.960> it<00:06:00.140> because<00:06:00.230> there<00:06:00.620> is<00:06:00.650> a<00:06:00.940> quarter<00:06:01.940> note

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
watch it because there is a quarter note

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.020 
watch it because there is a quarter note
stuck<00:06:02.900> in<00:06:03.140> there<00:06:03.350> the<00:06:04.340> fourth<00:06:04.610> note<00:06:04.820> in<00:06:04.970> the

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
stuck in there the fourth note in the

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.910 
stuck in there the fourth note in the
measure<00:06:05.210> is<00:06:05.360> a<00:06:05.390> quarter<00:06:05.780> note<00:06:05.930> so<00:06:06.260> the<00:06:06.710> measure

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:06.920 
measure is a quarter note so the measure

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.670 
measure is a quarter note so the measure
six<00:06:07.310> sounds<00:06:07.970> like<00:06:08.120> this<00:06:11.230> so<00:06:12.230> you'll<00:06:12.380> notice<00:06:12.530> I

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
six sounds like this so you'll notice I

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.960 
six sounds like this so you'll notice I
do<00:06:12.740> two<00:06:13.010> up<00:06:13.160> strokes<00:06:13.460> in<00:06:13.610> a<00:06:13.640> row<00:06:13.790> that's

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
do two up strokes in a row that's

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.910 
do two up strokes in a row that's
because<00:06:14.300> that<00:06:14.390> fifth<00:06:14.660> fret<00:06:14.900> is<00:06:15.320> a<00:06:15.500> quarter

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:15.920 
because that fifth fret is a quarter

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.060 
because that fifth fret is a quarter
note<00:06:19.720> we<00:06:20.720> do<00:06:20.810> the<00:06:20.930> same<00:06:21.140> thing<00:06:21.320> measure<00:06:21.530> seven

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
note we do the same thing measure seven

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.490 
note we do the same thing measure seven
except<00:06:23.030> we<00:06:23.150> play<00:06:23.330> an<00:06:23.480> extra<00:06:23.810> second<00:06:24.200> fret<00:06:24.380> at

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
except we play an extra second fret at

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.890 
except we play an extra second fret at
the<00:06:24.590> end<00:06:24.740> of<00:06:24.830> that<00:06:24.890> measure<00:06:28.900> pretty

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
the end of that measure pretty

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.720 
the end of that measure pretty
straightforward<00:06:30.620> and<00:06:30.860> then<00:06:31.370> we're<00:06:31.520> going<00:06:31.670> to

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:31.730 
straightforward and then we're going to

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.310 
straightforward and then we're going to
wrap<00:06:32.000> up<00:06:32.270> the<00:06:32.450> first<00:06:32.690> time<00:06:32.870> through<00:06:33.170> this

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
wrap up the first time through this

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.920 
wrap up the first time through this
little<00:06:34.010> a<00:06:34.340> part<00:06:34.670> by<00:06:34.970> doing<00:06:35.240> this<00:06:35.330> great<00:06:35.600> little

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
little a part by doing this great little

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:43.720 
little a part by doing this great little
C<00:06:36.920> scale<00:06:37.280> lick<00:06:37.580> measure<00:06:38.030> eight<00:06:42.130> all<00:06:43.130> very

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
C scale lick measure eight all very

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.700 
C scale lick measure eight all very
straightforward<00:06:44.000> so<00:06:44.450> far<00:06:44.690> get<00:06:45.380> to<00:06:45.500> measure

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
straightforward so far get to measure

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:52.090 
straightforward so far get to measure
nine<00:06:46.010> same<00:06:46.700> type<00:06:46.910> of<00:06:46.940> thing

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.310 

don't<00:06:52.850> forget<00:06:53.090> that<00:06:53.240> I<00:06:53.330> have<00:06:53.450> a<00:06:53.480> video<00:06:53.840> that<00:06:53.900> I

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.320 
don't forget that I have a video that I

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.900 
don't forget that I have a video that I
play<00:06:54.500> the<00:06:54.650> whole<00:06:54.830> thing<00:06:55.070> very<00:06:55.100> very<00:06:55.640> slowly

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
play the whole thing very very slowly

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.270 
play the whole thing very very slowly
all<00:06:56.150> the<00:06:56.180> way<00:06:56.270> through<00:06:56.710> here<00:06:57.710> on<00:06:57.830> the<00:06:57.890> website

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 
all the way through here on the website

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.980 
all the way through here on the website
so<00:06:58.550> if<00:06:59.000> I'm<00:06:59.150> going<00:06:59.330> a<00:06:59.360> little<00:06:59.420> bit<00:06:59.570> too<00:06:59.720> fast

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990 
so if I'm going a little bit too fast

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.510 
so if I'm going a little bit too fast
for<00:07:00.200> you<00:07:00.290> here<00:07:00.500> you<00:07:00.950> can<00:07:01.010> watch<00:07:01.190> that<00:07:01.400> video

for you here you can watch that video
when<00:07:02.150> we<00:07:02.210> get<00:07:02.330> to<00:07:02.420> measure<00:07:02.600> 10<00:07:02.900> we're<00:07:03.080> going<00:07:03.230> to

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.290 
when we get to measure 10 we're going to

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.830 
when we get to measure 10 we're going to
play<00:07:03.500> the<00:07:03.680> a<00:07:03.710> part<00:07:04.220> again<00:07:04.970> essentially<00:07:05.570> okay

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 
play the a part again essentially okay

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.230 
play the a part again essentially okay
another<00:07:06.110> 8<00:07:06.650> measures<00:07:07.010> but<00:07:07.760> this<00:07:07.940> time<00:07:08.120> we're

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 
another 8 measures but this time we're

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.430 
another 8 measures but this time we're
going<00:07:08.330> to<00:07:08.390> add<00:07:08.540> just<00:07:08.840> a<00:07:08.990> little<00:07:09.020> bit<00:07:09.350> of

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 
going to add just a little bit of

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.900 
going to add just a little bit of
difficulty<00:07:09.830> to<00:07:10.130> it<00:07:10.220> it's<00:07:10.370> mainly<00:07:10.580> going<00:07:10.850> to

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:10.910 
difficulty to it it's mainly going to

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.580 
difficulty to it it's mainly going to
come<00:07:11.090> in<00:07:11.180> the<00:07:11.240> way<00:07:11.360> of<00:07:11.540> slides<00:07:12.080> and<00:07:12.380> blues

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.590 
come in the way of slides and blues

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.890
