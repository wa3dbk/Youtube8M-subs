in browser so let's pop up these two

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.660 
in browser so let's pop up these two
browsers<00:00:09.929> over<00:00:10.320> here<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.280> see<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.460> we

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
browsers over here and you see that we

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.600 
browsers over here and you see that we
are<00:00:11.849> on<00:00:11.880> gsm<00:00:12.540> arena<00:00:12.809> right<00:00:13.259> now<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.860> i<00:00:14.309> will

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
are on gsm arena right now and i will

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.490 
are on gsm arena right now and i will
compare<00:00:15.089> these<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.719> three<00:00:16.289> different

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
compare these in three different

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.599 
compare these in three different
categories<00:00:16.820> UI<00:00:17.820> display<00:00:18.859> features<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
categories UI display features and the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.029 
categories UI display features and the
speed<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.869> if<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.320> start<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.890> first

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
speed so if you start with the first

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
HTC one because first of all when you

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.529 
HTC one because first of all when you
assume<00:00:42.660> when<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.230> go<00:00:43.980> when<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.030> go<00:00:45.329> down<00:00:45.510> like

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
assume when you go when you go down like

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.670 
assume when you go when you go down like
this<00:00:47.000> let's<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.149> here

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
this let's see here

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.889 
this let's see here
you<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.829> see<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.039> sometimes<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.180> bar<00:00:51.629> at

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
you can see it sometimes the the bar at

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.680 
you can see it sometimes the the bar at
the<00:00:51.930> top<00:00:52.289> disappears<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.340> get<00:00:53.579> more<00:00:53.879> real

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the top disappears so you get more real

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.099 
the top disappears so you get more real
screen<00:00:55.379> space<00:00:55.920> for<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> screen<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.750> was

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
screen space for the screen so that was

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.720 
screen space for the screen so that was
a<00:00:58.140> very<00:00:58.350> very<00:00:58.469> clever<00:00:58.739> for<00:00:59.010> them<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.399> also

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
a very very clever for them and also

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.010 
a very very clever for them and also
think<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.090> looks<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> little<00:01:00.359> bit<00:01:00.539> more<00:01:00.690> clean

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
think it looks a little bit more clean

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.650 
think it looks a little bit more clean
up<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:01.530> at<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> top<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.100> HTC<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
up here at the top and HTC one and you

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.479 
up here at the top and HTC one and you
don't<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:03.989> those<00:01:04.199> back<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.100> forward<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
don't have those back you forward and

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.090 
don't have those back you forward and
back<00:01:05.640> buttons<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.500> really<00:01:07.500> half<00:01:07.740> then<00:01:08.010> they

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
back buttons and really half then they

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.330 
back buttons and really half then they
use<00:01:08.340> those<00:01:08.549> they<00:01:08.970> are<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> web<00:01:09.479> right<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:10.439> so

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
use those they are a web right here so

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.580 
use those they are a web right here so
you<00:01:11.400> get<00:01:11.580> more<00:01:11.850> space<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> bar

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you get more space here for for the bar

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.760 
you get more space here for for the bar
where<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.890> type<00:01:14.310> stuff<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:15.659> also<00:01:16.200> what<00:01:16.619> i<00:01:16.650> do

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
that the tab system is way quicker and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.560

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
cool here versus this a little bit

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.130 
cool here versus this a little bit
boring<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.880> slow<00:01:36.439> UI<00:01:37.439> here<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.909> GS<00:01:39.720> for

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
boring and slow UI here on the GS for

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.410 
boring and slow UI here on the GS for
not<00:01:40.799> quite<00:01:40.979> sure<00:01:41.009> why<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> little<00:01:42.270> bit

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
not quite sure why it is a little bit

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.510 
not quite sure why it is a little bit
like<00:01:42.600> slow<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> sluggish<00:01:43.380> when<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.040> open<00:01:44.460> it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
like slow and sluggish when you open it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.280 
like slow and sluggish when you open it
up<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:45.570> definitely<00:01:45.899> looks<00:01:46.020> more<00:01:46.079> impressive

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
we now go down to the display here I

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.350 
we now go down to the display here I
have<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:25.950> say<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.519> at<00:02:26.670> least<00:02:26.700> when<00:02:27.030> we<00:02:27.120> are<00:02:27.239> in

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
have to say that at least when we are in

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.910 
have to say that at least when we are in
the<00:02:27.450> browser<00:02:27.629> here<00:02:27.959> have<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.500> little<00:02:28.739> white

color I would have say that the winner

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.100 
color I would have say that the winner
prolly<00:02:31.319> goes<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.130> HTC<00:02:32.670> one<00:02:32.910> because<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
prolly goes to the HTC one because the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.229 
prolly goes to the HTC one because the
display<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.739> this<00:02:35.069> place<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.700> color<00:02:35.970> white

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
display is this place the color white

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.270 
display is this place the color white
here<00:02:36.599> so<00:02:36.900> much<00:02:37.050> better<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.590> it's<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.160> much

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
here so much better and it's so much

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.670 
here so much better and it's so much
brighter<00:02:38.459> actually<00:02:39.090> when<00:02:39.299> you<00:02:39.450> are<00:02:39.660> or<00:02:40.590> at

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
brighter actually when you are or at

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.070 
brighter actually when you are or at
least<00:02:40.709> when<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.430> did<00:02:41.670> see<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.239> Sun<00:02:42.480> was<00:02:42.690> in

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
least when I did see the Sun was in

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.710 
least when I did see the Sun was in
another<00:02:43.379> room<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.879> then<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.180> display<00:02:45.569> which

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
another room and then the display which

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.470 
another room and then the display which
is<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.080> much<00:02:46.260> broader<00:02:46.440> here<00:02:46.799> on<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.730> HTC<00:02:48.060> One

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
is so much broader here on the HTC One

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.589 
is so much broader here on the HTC One
definitely<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.580> definitely<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.700> good<00:02:51.569> thing

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
definitely so definitely a good thing

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.699 
definitely so definitely a good thing
over<00:02:52.290> there<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:53.810> overall<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:55.110> mean<00:02:55.200> both<00:02:55.560> these

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
over there and overall I mean both these

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.830 
over there and overall I mean both these
are<00:02:55.890> 1080<00:02:56.220> 1080<00:02:56.430> P<00:02:56.849> so<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.239> course<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.599> with

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
are 1080 1080 P so of course you with

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.860 
are 1080 1080 P so of course you with
good<00:02:58.170> resolution<00:02:58.440> on<00:02:58.920> both<00:02:59.099> these<00:02:59.280> two<00:02:59.870> both

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
good resolution on both these two both

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.740 
good resolution on both these two both
these<00:03:01.079> two<00:03:01.290> devices<00:03:02.090> but<00:03:03.090> then<00:03:03.239> we<00:03:03.360> also<00:03:03.480> have

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
these two devices but then we also have

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.289 
these two devices but then we also have
a<00:03:03.780> cool<00:03:04.049> feature<00:03:04.349> here<00:03:04.549> so<00:03:05.549> when<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:05.970> zoom<00:03:06.120> in

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299

a cool feature here so when you zoom in
on<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.380> HTC<00:03:07.769> One<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.099> get<00:03:08.250> text<00:03:08.489> reflow<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.209> if

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
on the HTC One you get text reflow so if

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.819

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
works actually so I didn't actually

works actually so I didn't actually
think<00:03:49.139> that<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.709> would<00:03:49.889> work<00:03:50.069> but<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.579> do<00:03:50.790> work

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
think that it would work but you do work

but you should be able to scroll with
your<00:05:24.759> hands<00:05:25.180> I've<00:05:25.330> been<00:05:25.449> displaying<00:05:25.900> that<00:05:26.020> in

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
other videos doesn't mean to cool things

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.989 
other videos doesn't mean to cool things
with<00:05:29.289> the<00:05:29.409> features<00:05:29.740> here<00:05:29.979> inside<00:05:30.249> of<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.550> s4

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:30.999 
with the features here inside of the s4

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.550 
with the features here inside of the s4
knows<00:05:31.240> that<00:05:31.509> you<00:05:31.719> have<00:05:31.870> the<00:05:31.960> including<00:05:32.349> a<00:05:32.409> mode

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
knows that you have the including a mode

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.040 
knows that you have the including a mode
which<00:05:32.770> I<00:05:33.009> don't<00:05:33.610> think<00:05:34.300> you<00:05:34.479> do<00:05:34.599> have<00:05:34.629> them<00:05:34.930> but

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
which I don't think you do have them but

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.339 
which I don't think you do have them but
you<00:05:35.229> may<00:05:35.499> have<00:05:35.529> them<00:05:36.009> somewhere<00:05:36.340> in<00:05:36.840> in<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:38.020> in

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
you may have them somewhere in in the in

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.100 
you may have them somewhere in in the in
the<00:05:38.560> in<00:05:38.919> the<00:05:38.949> HTC<00:05:39.460> One<00:05:39.849> and<00:05:40.330> I<00:05:40.509> also<00:05:40.810> think<00:05:40.990> that

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
the in the HTC One and I also think that

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.689 
the in the HTC One and I also think that
the<00:05:41.349> menus<00:05:41.680> everything<00:05:42.009> looks<00:05:42.340> a<00:05:42.400> little<00:05:42.520> bit

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
the menus everything looks a little bit

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.990 
the menus everything looks a little bit
more<00:05:43.150> cool<00:05:43.539> to<00:05:43.870> like<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.169> Roboto<00:05:44.529> font<00:05:44.879> in<00:05:45.879> the

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
more cool to like the Roboto font in the

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.760 
more cool to like the Roboto font in the
HTC<00:05:46.419> one<00:05:46.629> so<00:05:46.870> definitely<00:05:47.379> way<00:05:47.740> more

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
HTC one so definitely way more

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.740 
HTC one so definitely way more
improvements<00:05:48.430> over<00:05:48.550> there<00:05:48.849> and<00:05:49.060> that<00:05:49.629> you

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
improvements over there and that you

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.390 
improvements over there and that you
don't<00:05:49.870> have<00:05:50.110> to<00:05:50.229> scroll<00:05:50.529> super<00:05:50.860> much<00:05:51.039> here

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
don't have to scroll super much here

what else what else if we saw features I

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.980 
what else what else if we saw features I
would<00:05:59.860> actually<00:06:00.069> have<00:06:00.279> to<00:06:00.669> say<00:06:00.909> that<00:06:01.870> it's

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
would actually have to say that it's

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.679 
would actually have to say that it's
kind<00:06:02.199> of<00:06:02.349> I<00:06:02.789> would<00:06:03.789> actually<00:06:03.939> say<00:06:04.240> that<00:06:04.389> it's

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:04.689 
kind of I would actually say that it's

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:06.269 
kind of I would actually say that it's
extremely<00:06:05.020> useful<00:06:05.319> to<00:06:05.620> have<00:06:05.710> a<00:06:05.770> flash<00:06:06.039> pay

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:06.279 
extremely useful to have a flash pay

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:08.550 
extremely useful to have a flash pay
built<00:06:06.550> in<00:06:06.729> here<00:06:07.060> and<00:06:07.870> that<00:06:08.050> that<00:06:08.259> would<00:06:08.379> be<00:06:08.439> a

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
built in here and that that would be a

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.409 
built in here and that that would be a
feature<00:06:08.740> that<00:06:08.889> I<00:06:09.039> would<00:06:09.339> value<00:06:09.610> on<00:06:09.969> top<00:06:10.210> of

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
feature that I would value on top of

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.499 
feature that I would value on top of
everything<00:06:10.689> else<00:06:11.490> now<00:06:12.490> in<00:06:12.729> terms<00:06:12.939> of<00:06:13.120> speed

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:13.509 
everything else now in terms of speed

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:16.110 
everything else now in terms of speed
and<00:06:14.069> you<00:06:15.069> know<00:06:15.159> you<00:06:15.219> can<00:06:15.430> see<00:06:15.550> the<00:06:15.639> book<00:06:15.849> are

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
and you know you can see the book are

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.869 
and you know you can see the book are
super<00:06:16.509> smooth<00:06:16.930> here<00:06:20.219> let's<00:06:21.219> see<00:06:21.370> how<00:06:21.520> much<00:06:21.639> we

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:21.879 
super smooth here let's see how much we

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:28.879 
super smooth here let's see how much we
can<00:06:22.029> zoom<00:06:22.330> in

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.770 

so<00:06:29.520> maybe<00:06:29.759> you<00:06:29.969> can<00:06:30.120> submit<00:06:30.300> a<00:06:30.449> little<00:06:30.689> bit

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
so maybe you can submit a little bit

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.459 
so maybe you can submit a little bit
more<00:06:31.020> here<00:06:31.319> on<00:06:31.560> the<00:06:31.590> on<00:06:32.430> the<00:06:32.960> s4<00:06:33.960> but<00:06:34.169> then<00:06:34.349> I'll

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:34.469 
more here on the on the s4 but then I'll

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:36.950 
more here on the on the s4 but then I'll
HTC<00:06:34.949> one<00:06:35.129> of<00:06:35.250> course<00:06:35.490> you<00:06:35.639> do<00:06:35.789> see<00:06:36.030> more<00:06:36.300> text

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
HTC one of course you do see more text

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.749 
HTC one of course you do see more text
or<00:06:37.139> it's<00:06:37.500> perfect<00:06:37.949> because<00:06:38.039> they've<00:06:38.400> aligned

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 
or it's perfect because they've aligned

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:42.860 
or it's perfect because they've aligned
it<00:06:38.939> so<00:06:39.349> so<00:06:40.349> much<00:06:40.379> like<00:06:40.770> easier<00:06:41.219> to<00:06:41.460> read<00:06:41.870> and

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
it so so much like easier to read and

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.080 
it so so much like easier to read and
also<00:06:43.080> the<00:06:43.949> loading<00:06:44.280> speeds<00:06:44.490> should<00:06:44.789> be<00:06:44.909> about

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
also the loading speeds should be about

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.540 
also the loading speeds should be about
the<00:06:45.270> same<00:06:45.479> here<00:06:48.740> okay<00:06:49.740> that's<00:06:49.979> not<00:06:50.099> fair<00:06:50.370> of

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
the same here okay that's not fair of

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.839 
the same here okay that's not fair of
course<00:06:51.500> but<00:06:52.500> no<00:06:52.979> difference<00:06:53.370> in<00:06:53.550> loading

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:53.849 
course but no difference in loading

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:57.200 
course but no difference in loading
speed<00:06:54.060> that<00:06:54.270> tried<00:06:54.569> before<00:06:55.050> also<00:06:55.939> so<00:06:56.939> that

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
speed that tried before also so that

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.580 
speed that tried before also so that
could<00:06:57.539> be<00:06:57.659> good<00:06:57.810> and<00:06:58.020> here<00:06:58.139> you<00:06:58.199> can<00:06:58.319> see<00:06:58.469> the

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
could be good and here you can see the

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.529 
could be good and here you can see the
advantage<00:06:59.009> here<00:06:59.219> of<00:06:59.250> the<00:06:59.430> HTC<00:06:59.939> one<00:07:00.150> that<00:07:00.360> it

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:00.539 
advantage here of the HTC one that it

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:04.909 
advantage here of the HTC one that it
will<00:07:00.689> reflow<00:07:01.110> here<00:07:01.379> so<00:07:02.210> overall<00:07:03.289> we<00:07:04.289> just<00:07:04.800> have

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 
will reflow here so overall we just have

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:07.580 
will reflow here so overall we just have
to<00:07:05.069> say<00:07:05.219> that<00:07:05.370> the<00:07:05.490> winner<00:07:05.639> here<00:07:06.060> goes<00:07:06.360> to<00:07:06.719> the

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:07.590 
to say that the winner here goes to the

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.119 
to say that the winner here goes to the
HTC<00:07:08.159> One<00:07:08.430> for<00:07:08.909> his<00:07:09.270> features<00:07:09.810> and<00:07:10.199> then<00:07:10.979> they

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:11.129 
HTC One for his features and then they

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:13.999 
HTC One for his features and then they
can't<00:07:11.340> display<00:07:11.789> here<00:07:12.180> and<00:07:12.500> in<00:07:13.500> the<00:07:13.680> in<00:07:13.830> the

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:14.009 
can't display here and in the in the

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:15.439 
can't display here and in the in the
default<00:07:14.310> browser<00:07:14.520> on<00:07:14.879> both<00:07:15.060> these<00:07:15.270> two

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:15.449 
default browser on both these two

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.830 
default browser on both these two
smartphones<00:07:16.310> we<00:07:17.310> can<00:07:17.610> probably<00:07:18.029> easily<00:07:18.449> say

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 
smartphones we can probably easily say

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.209 
smartphones we can probably easily say
that<00:07:19.020> most<00:07:19.229> people<00:07:19.529> would<00:07:19.680> probably<00:07:19.919> enjoy

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:20.219 
that most people would probably enjoy

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:23.360 
that most people would probably enjoy
the<00:07:20.580> the<00:07:20.969> HTC<00:07:21.479> wants<00:07:21.900> the<00:07:22.139> browser<00:07:23.009> a<00:07:23.159> little

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.370 
the the HTC wants the browser a little

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.279 
the the HTC wants the browser a little
bit<00:07:23.460> more<00:07:23.729> so<00:07:24.000> you<00:07:24.810> might<00:07:24.960> have<00:07:25.050> a<00:07:25.139> different

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:25.289 
bit more so you might have a different

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:27.140 
bit more so you might have a different
opinion<00:07:25.439> you<00:07:26.009> can<00:07:26.129> tell<00:07:26.310> me<00:07:26.400> that<00:07:26.550> in<00:07:26.789> the

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150 
opinion you can tell me that in the
