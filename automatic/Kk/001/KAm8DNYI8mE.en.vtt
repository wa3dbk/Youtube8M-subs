00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.530
 and today we talk about chinese 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.719
 tape recorder 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.340
 and how to set the navigation I write 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.560
 because now the question is a young 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.140
 of a man he ordered himself with aliexpress 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.850
 the same cassette as I have him in 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.400
 bonus at least came flash card 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.230
 with these 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.160
 with cards yes but he does not leave him 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.680
 I'm not loading here especially for you 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.090
 write this video how to do so 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.079
 to navigate your job 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.780
 let's go to the monitor and those who 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.680
 looking at me will also be useful and so 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.840
 the guys in the radio has two slots as 1 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.440
 ps1 just do not see any DIG card to 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.320
 music can be this video and so on so 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.149
 so that we go into the navigation let's we 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.739
 first pull the flash drive from here and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.409
 pulled out a little cat put but 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.780
 I will not push it so that when we 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.390
 push 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:14.280
 it gives us no navigation from the box 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.229
 disk file or no maps and so 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.890
 next you need to go first 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.220

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.310

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.909
