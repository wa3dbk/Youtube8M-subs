00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.890 

last<00:00:29.380> week<00:00:29.530> we<00:00:29.680> did<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:29.920> m416<00:00:30.700> versus<00:00:31.150> the<00:00:31.240> m16

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
last week we did the m416 versus the m16

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.990 
last week we did the m416 versus the m16
the<00:00:32.110> two<00:00:32.260> top<00:00:32.560> tier<00:00:32.830> assault<00:00:33.160> rifles<00:00:33.550> and<00:00:33.700> the

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
the two top tier assault rifles and the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.580 
the two top tier assault rifles and the
Facebook<00:00:34.390> polls<00:00:34.600> were<00:00:34.750> pretty<00:00:35.080> conclusive

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
Facebook polls were pretty conclusive

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.140 
Facebook polls were pretty conclusive
that<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.920> majority<00:00:36.130> of<00:00:36.310> you<00:00:36.400> guys<00:00:36.460> wanted<00:00:37.030> to

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
that the majority of you guys wanted to

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.930 
that the majority of you guys wanted to
vote<00:00:37.300> for<00:00:37.360> the<00:00:37.600> m416<00:00:38.230> so<00:00:38.680> I<00:00:39.250> would<00:00:39.670> say<00:00:39.820> the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
vote for the m416 so I would say the

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.880 
vote for the m416 so I would say the
comments<00:00:40.480> though<00:00:40.600> were<00:00:40.780> kind<00:00:41.140> of<00:00:41.260> mixed<00:00:41.680> but

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
comments though were kind of mixed but

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.890 
comments though were kind of mixed but
in<00:00:42.040> the<00:00:42.130> Facebook<00:00:42.520> poll<00:00:42.700> the<00:00:42.850> m416<00:00:43.390> definitely

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
in the Facebook poll the m416 definitely

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.030 
in the Facebook poll the m416 definitely
got<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.170> edge<00:00:44.290> I<00:00:44.500> don't<00:00:44.650> know<00:00:44.739> if<00:00:44.860> that's

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
got the edge I don't know if that's

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.460 
got the edge I don't know if that's
because<00:00:45.760> of<00:00:45.880> the<00:00:45.970> disdain<00:00:46.180> towards<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.870> m16

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
because of the disdain towards the m16

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.190 
because of the disdain towards the m16
but<00:00:48.250> it<00:00:48.340> looks<00:00:48.460> like<00:00:48.580> the<00:00:48.700> m416<00:00:49.390> is<00:00:49.720> our<00:00:49.900> winner

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
but it looks like the m416 is our winner

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.330 
but it looks like the m416 is our winner
so<00:00:50.410> if<00:00:50.500> you<00:00:50.590> want<00:00:50.739> to<00:00:50.800> be<00:00:50.860> a<00:00:50.890> part<00:00:51.160> in<00:00:51.220> this

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
m4 17 are two weapons that I could not

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.520 
m4 17 are two weapons that I could not
ignore<00:01:01.150> I've<00:01:01.420> been<00:01:01.570> spammed<00:01:01.989> since

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
ignore I've been spammed since

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.799 
ignore I've been spammed since
close-quarters<00:01:03.070> camp<00:01:03.280> came<00:01:03.640> out<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:04.330> do<00:01:04.540> this

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
close-quarters camp came out to do this

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.510 
close-quarters camp came out to do this
showdown<00:01:05.199> but<00:01:05.470> since<00:01:05.710> so<00:01:05.860> many<00:01:05.950> people<00:01:06.100> either

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
showdown but since so many people either

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.640 
showdown but since so many people either
like<00:01:06.909> semi-autos<00:01:07.540> or<00:01:07.659> they<00:01:07.720> hate<00:01:07.960> them<00:01:08.140> I<00:01:08.320> was

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
like semi-autos or they hate them I was

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.870 
like semi-autos or they hate them I was
kind<00:01:08.890> of<00:01:08.950> nervous<00:01:09.250> about<00:01:09.370> doing<00:01:09.730> them<00:01:09.820> because

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
kind of nervous about doing them because

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.820 
kind of nervous about doing them because
I<00:01:10.060> didn't<00:01:10.360> want<00:01:10.630> to<00:01:10.750> create<00:01:11.290> an<00:01:11.409> episode<00:01:11.650> that

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
I didn't want to create an episode that

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.370 
I didn't want to create an episode that
caused<00:01:12.220> controversy<00:01:12.690> so<00:01:13.690> hopefully<00:01:14.050> even<00:01:14.170> if

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
caused controversy so hopefully even if

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.260 
caused controversy so hopefully even if
you<00:01:14.470> don't<00:01:14.710> like<00:01:14.860> semi-auto<00:01:15.370> sniper<00:01:15.490> rifles

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
you don't like semi-auto sniper rifles

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.850 
you don't like semi-auto sniper rifles
or<00:01:16.420> weapons<00:01:16.840> in<00:01:16.990> general<00:01:17.350> you<00:01:17.530> can<00:01:17.680> learn

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
or weapons in general you can learn

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.170 
or weapons in general you can learn
something<00:01:18.280> from<00:01:18.370> this<00:01:18.580> and<00:01:18.790> enjoy<00:01:19.000> this

episode<00:01:19.360> but<00:01:19.810> let's<00:01:19.960> take<00:01:20.080> a<00:01:20.140> look<00:01:20.320> at<00:01:20.409> the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
episode but let's take a look at the

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.800 
episode but let's take a look at the
stats<00:01:20.740> here<00:01:21.010> you<00:01:21.400> can<00:01:21.520> clearly<00:01:21.700> see<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.090> m4<00:01:22.360> 17

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
stats here you can clearly see the m4 17

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.600 
stats here you can clearly see the m4 17
does<00:01:23.080> do<00:01:23.260> a<00:01:23.290> little<00:01:23.530> bit<00:01:23.680> more<00:01:23.710> max<00:01:24.100> damage<00:01:24.340> at

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
does do a little bit more max damage at

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.149 
does do a little bit more max damage at
50<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.210> drops<00:01:25.450> off<00:01:25.630> at<00:01:25.810> 37<00:01:26.380> point<00:01:26.590> 5<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:27.070> the

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
50 and it drops off at 37 point 5 to the

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.940 
50 and it drops off at 37 point 5 to the
SKS<00:01:27.549> is<00:01:27.700> 27<00:01:28.390> but<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:28.810> SKS<00:01:29.229> does<00:01:29.470> have<00:01:29.650> a<00:01:29.680> better

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
SKS is 27 but the SKS does have a better

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.340 
SKS is 27 but the SKS does have a better
recoil<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.760> it<00:01:31.270> does<00:01:31.420> have<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.659> faster<00:01:32.140> rate<00:01:32.320> of

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
recoil and it does have a faster rate of

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.290 
recoil and it does have a faster rate of
fire<00:01:32.470> it<00:01:32.860> does<00:01:33.040> shoot<00:01:33.220> a<00:01:33.310> slightly<00:01:33.640> slower<00:01:34.060> but

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
fire it does shoot a slightly slower but

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.850 
fire it does shoot a slightly slower but
I<00:01:34.330> will<00:01:34.510> point<00:01:34.750> out<00:01:34.870> that<00:01:35.050> you<00:01:35.170> can<00:01:35.440> use<00:01:35.650> heavy

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
I will point out that you can use heavy

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.380 
I will point out that you can use heavy
barrel<00:01:36.160> and<00:01:36.280> SKS<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.850> kind<00:01:37.030> of<00:01:37.090> counteract

barrel and SKS to kind of counteract

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.920 
barrel and SKS to kind of counteract
that

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
that

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.230 
that
but<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.650> m4<00:01:38.890> 17<00:01:39.280> is<00:01:39.400> an<00:01:39.490> interesting<00:01:39.700> weapon

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
but the m4 17 is an interesting weapon

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.420 
but the m4 17 is an interesting weapon
as<00:01:40.330> you<00:01:40.450> see<00:01:40.630> me<00:01:40.810> get<00:01:40.960> a<00:01:40.990> marksman<00:01:41.620> 308<00:01:42.250> with

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
as you see me get a marksman 308 with

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.070 
as you see me get a marksman 308 with
that<00:01:42.580> now<00:01:42.760> that's<00:01:42.910> a<00:01:43.060> rarity<00:01:43.330> especially<00:01:43.960> with

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
that now that's a rarity especially with

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.780 
that now that's a rarity especially with
an<00:01:44.170> ACOG<00:01:44.530> I<00:01:44.830> wouldn't<00:01:45.490> really<00:01:45.610> consider

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
an ACOG I wouldn't really consider

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.940 
an ACOG I wouldn't really consider
either<00:01:46.270> these<00:01:46.540> weapons<00:01:46.990> quote<00:01:47.290> long-range

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
either these weapons quote long-range

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.730 
either these weapons quote long-range
weapons<00:01:48.340> however<00:01:48.600> they<00:01:49.600> both<00:01:49.630> do<00:01:50.110> possess<00:01:50.560> the

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
weapons however they both do possess the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.320 
weapons however they both do possess the
ability<00:01:50.830> to<00:01:51.160> reach<00:01:51.640> out<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:51.910> little<00:01:52.030> bit

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
ability to reach out a little bit

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.020 
ability to reach out a little bit
further<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:52.870> get<00:01:53.350> people<00:01:53.680> beyond<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.640> medium

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
further and get people beyond the medium

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.610 
further and get people beyond the medium
range<00:01:55.240> because<00:01:55.690> when<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.050> look<00:01:56.170> at<00:01:56.290> these<00:01:56.410> two

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
range because when you look at these two

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.870 
range because when you look at these two
weapons<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.040> kind<00:01:57.220> of<00:01:57.310> think<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.580> them<00:01:57.700> as

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
weapons you kind of think of them as

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.970 
weapons you kind of think of them as
medium-range<00:01:58.570> sniper<00:01:59.350> rifles<00:01:59.740> you<00:01:59.830> don't

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
medium-range sniper rifles you don't

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.380 
medium-range sniper rifles you don't
really<00:02:00.160> think<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.430> them<00:02:00.550> as<00:02:00.730> the<00:02:00.760> long-range

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
really think of them as the long-range

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.350 
really think of them as the long-range
marksman<00:02:02.020> rifles<00:02:02.410> but<00:02:02.560> I<00:02:02.830> would<00:02:03.160> say<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:04.030> max

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
marksman rifles but I would say the max

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.960 
marksman rifles but I would say the max
range<00:02:04.780> on<00:02:04.990> these<00:02:05.140> things<00:02:05.320> is<00:02:05.590> around<00:02:05.980> 500

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
range on these things is around 500

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.969 
range on these things is around 500
meters<00:02:07.270> maybe<00:02:07.540> after<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:08.440> you're<00:02:08.649> really

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
meters maybe after that you're really

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.499 
meters maybe after that you're really
going<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.310> struggle<00:02:09.580> because<00:02:10.000> there's<00:02:10.300> one

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
going to struggle because there's one

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.330 
going to struggle because there's one
thing<00:02:10.539> that<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:10.989> found<00:02:11.349> about<00:02:11.560> these<00:02:11.860> they're

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
thing that I found about these they're

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.820 
thing that I found about these they're
not<00:02:12.370> really<00:02:12.910> super<00:02:13.390> accurate<00:02:13.569> they're<00:02:14.110> you

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
not really super accurate they're you

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.050 
not really super accurate they're you
know<00:02:14.860> they're<00:02:15.160> they're<00:02:15.400> called<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.940> know

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
know they're they're called you know

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.449 
know they're they're called you know
DMR's<00:02:16.720> designated<00:02:17.470> marksman<00:02:17.830> rifles<00:02:18.250> but

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
DMR's designated marksman rifles but

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.550 
DMR's designated marksman rifles but
sometimes<00:02:19.239> they<00:02:19.420> do<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.540> really<00:02:19.900> bad<00:02:20.080> job<00:02:20.319> about

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
sometimes they do a really bad job about

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.920 
sometimes they do a really bad job about
that<00:02:20.800> because<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.790> aim-down-sight<00:02:22.420> accuracy

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
that because the aim-down-sight accuracy

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.320 
that because the aim-down-sight accuracy
on<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.319> m4<00:02:23.620> 17<00:02:24.069> is<00:02:24.220> actually<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.700> lowest<00:02:24.970> of

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
on the m4 17 is actually the lowest of

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.300 
on the m4 17 is actually the lowest of
these<00:02:25.450> semi-auto<00:02:25.900> snipers<00:02:26.500> it's<00:02:26.920> aim<00:02:27.129> down

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
these semi-auto snipers it's aim down

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.759 
these semi-auto snipers it's aim down
sight<00:02:27.640> spread<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:28.269> point<00:02:28.599> zero<00:02:28.870> five<00:02:29.230> versus<00:02:29.739> a

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
sight spread is point zero five versus a

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.530 
sight spread is point zero five versus a
lot<00:02:30.159> of<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.400> semi-autos<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.120> think<00:02:31.300> in<00:02:31.390> fact

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
lot of the semi-autos I think in fact

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.339 
lot of the semi-autos I think in fact
all<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:32.019> them<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.319> point<00:02:33.069> zero<00:02:33.640> one<00:02:34.360> one<00:02:34.900> six

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
all of them is point zero one one six

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.320 
all of them is point zero one one six
seven<00:02:35.620> some<00:02:36.040> crazy<00:02:36.370> long<00:02:36.640> number<00:02:36.940> like<00:02:37.120> that

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
seven some crazy long number like that

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.360 
seven some crazy long number like that
so<00:02:37.569> in<00:02:37.810> terms<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.319> accuracy<00:02:38.860> it's<00:02:38.980> definitely

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
so in terms of accuracy it's definitely

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.300 
so in terms of accuracy it's definitely
not<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.580> best<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.420> my<00:02:40.540> Auto<00:02:40.780> sniper<00:02:41.200> but<00:02:42.190> it

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
not the best in my Auto sniper but it

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.960 
not the best in my Auto sniper but it
does<00:02:42.460> have<00:02:42.670> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
does have the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.460 
does have the
it's<00:02:43.240> rate<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.390> fire<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.720> that's<00:02:44.020> kind<00:02:44.320> of<00:02:44.350> how

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
it's rate of fire and that's kind of how

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.870 
it's rate of fire and that's kind of how
they<00:02:44.620> balance<00:02:44.770> it<00:02:45.070> out<00:02:45.190> now<00:02:45.400> on<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.610> flip<00:02:45.850> side

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
they balance it out now on the flip side

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.570 
they balance it out now on the flip side
you've<00:02:46.210> got<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.510> SKS<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.650> SKS<00:02:48.130> is<00:02:48.310> aimed

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
you've got the SKS the SKS is aimed

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.630 
you've got the SKS the SKS is aimed
downside<00:02:49.030> accuracy<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:50.070> 0.1<00:02:51.070> so<00:02:51.310> if<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.490> look

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
downside accuracy is 0.1 so if you look

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.310 
downside accuracy is 0.1 so if you look
at<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.880> like<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.180> it's<00:02:52.420> got<00:02:52.810> almost<00:02:53.140> double

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
at it like that it's got almost double

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.250 
at it like that it's got almost double
the<00:02:53.860> spread<00:02:54.190> than<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.730> em<00:02:54.850> 417<00:02:55.630> in<00:02:55.840> terms<00:02:56.020> of

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
the spread than the em 417 in terms of

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260 
the spread than the em 417 in terms of
accuracy<00:02:56.800> when<00:02:56.980> aiming<00:02:57.130> down<00:02:57.250> sights<00:02:57.610> one

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
accuracy when aiming down sights one

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.120 
accuracy when aiming down sights one
thing<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.720> SKS<00:02:59.140> does<00:02:59.410> have<00:02:59.650> over<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.070> in

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
thing that the SKS does have over the in

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.700 
thing that the SKS does have over the in
417<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.210> rate<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.570> fire<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.410> fact

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
417 is the rate of fire and the fact

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.620 
417 is the rate of fire and the fact
that<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:03.010> has<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.280> better<00:03:03.610> recoil<00:03:04.210> now<00:03:04.420> if<00:03:04.510> you

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
that it has a better recoil now if you

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.360 
that it has a better recoil now if you
go<00:03:04.720> back<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.110> look<00:03:05.170> at<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.380> stat<00:03:05.620> chart<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.100> put

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
go back and look at the stat chart I put

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.100 
go back and look at the stat chart I put
up<00:03:06.520> you'll<00:03:06.940> notice<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.300> I<00:03:07.390> put<00:03:07.420> for<00:03:08.020> the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
up you'll notice that I put for the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.500 
up you'll notice that I put for the
recoil<00:03:08.500> in<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.680> in<00:03:08.770> 417<00:03:09.340> I<00:03:09.430> put<00:03:09.610> weird<00:03:09.940> because

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
recoil in the in 417 I put weird because

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.210 
recoil in the in 417 I put weird because
it<00:03:10.630> has<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.750> very<00:03:11.020> strange<00:03:11.410> recoil<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.040> have<00:03:12.190> a

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
it has a very strange recoil I have a

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.820 
it has a very strange recoil I have a
hard<00:03:12.550> time<00:03:13.110> predicting<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.200> recoil<00:03:14.620> in<00:03:14.710> it

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
hard time predicting the recoil in it

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.500 
hard time predicting the recoil in it
personally<00:03:15.280> because<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:15.760> is<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:15.940> little<00:03:16.360> bit

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
personally because it is a little bit

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.600 
personally because it is a little bit
more<00:03:16.720> wild<00:03:17.320> is<00:03:17.530> it's<00:03:17.800> unlike<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.220> lot<00:03:18.490> of<00:03:18.520> the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
more wild is it's unlike a lot of the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.980 
more wild is it's unlike a lot of the
weapons<00:03:19.000> in<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.180> game<00:03:19.330> because<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.570> does<00:03:19.810> have

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
weapons in the game because it does have

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.380 
weapons in the game because it does have
negative<00:03:20.470> recoil<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.070> left<00:03:21.340> as<00:03:21.550> a<00:03:21.610> very

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
negative recoil to the left as a very

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.840 
negative recoil to the left as a very
high<00:03:22.600> upward<00:03:23.050> recoil<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:24.280> it's<00:03:24.430> got<00:03:24.580> a<00:03:24.610> really

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
high upward recoil and it's got a really

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.780 
high upward recoil and it's got a really
hard<00:03:25.300> pull<00:03:25.600> to<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.870> right<00:03:25.900> as<00:03:26.290> well<00:03:26.560> so<00:03:27.010> we

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
hard pull to the right as well so we

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.610 
hard pull to the right as well so we
kind<00:03:28.030> of<00:03:28.120> get<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.240> weapon<00:03:28.570> that<00:03:28.780> behaves<00:03:29.440> a

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
kind of get a weapon that behaves a

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.170 
kind of get a weapon that behaves a
little<00:03:29.860> bit<00:03:29.980> differently<00:03:30.400> than<00:03:30.640> what<00:03:30.850> we<00:03:31.000> see

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
little bit differently than what we see

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.820 
little bit differently than what we see
in<00:03:31.209> battlefield<00:03:31.720> usually<00:03:32.050> a<00:03:32.080> weapon<00:03:32.590> pulls

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
in battlefield usually a weapon pulls

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.320 
in battlefield usually a weapon pulls
one<00:03:33.130> direction<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:33.760> that's<00:03:33.910> it

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
one direction and that's it

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.960 
one direction and that's it
very<00:03:35.080> rarely<00:03:35.410> do<00:03:35.709> we<00:03:35.800> have<00:03:35.890> a<00:03:35.950> weapon<00:03:36.340> that<00:03:36.370> can

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
very rarely do we have a weapon that can

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.430 
very rarely do we have a weapon that can
pull<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.420> right<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:37.780> left<00:03:38.050> bite<00:03:38.260> right

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
pull to the right and left bite right

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.080 
pull to the right and left bite right
and<00:03:38.650> left<00:03:38.860> right<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.250> left<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.580> it's<00:03:39.850> kind<00:03:40.060> of

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
and left right and left and it's kind of

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.420 
and left right and left and it's kind of
kind<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.510> tricky<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.870> use<00:03:40.990> whereas<00:03:41.800> the<00:03:41.890> SKS

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
kind of tricky to use whereas the SKS

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.570 
kind of tricky to use whereas the SKS
it's<00:03:42.970> notorious<00:03:43.780> for<00:03:44.050> having<00:03:44.200> very<00:03:44.770> very<00:03:45.310> low

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
it's notorious for having very very low

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.090 
it's notorious for having very very low
recoil<00:03:45.850> because<00:03:46.600> all<00:03:46.780> its<00:03:46.959> pulls<00:03:47.260> are<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.950> the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
recoil because all its pulls are to the

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.540 
recoil because all its pulls are to the
center<00:03:48.250> so<00:03:48.670> it's<00:03:49.150> really<00:03:49.630> really<00:03:50.140> easy<00:03:50.550> to

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
center so it's really really easy to

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.949 
center so it's really really easy to
snipe<00:03:51.790> people<00:03:51.970> at<00:03:52.209> longer<00:03:52.360> ranges<00:03:52.720> with<00:03:52.870> the

snipe people at longer ranges with the

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.960 
snipe people at longer ranges with the
SKS<00:03:53.470> even<00:03:53.860> though<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.160> bolt<00:03:54.340> velocity<00:03:54.880> on

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
SKS even though the bolt velocity on

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.640 
SKS even though the bolt velocity on
this<00:03:55.120> thing<00:03:55.300> isn't<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.630> best<00:03:55.840> even<00:03:56.500> though

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
this thing isn't the best even though

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.960 
this thing isn't the best even though
the<00:03:56.769> aim-down-sight<00:03:57.310> accuracy<00:03:57.730> on<00:03:57.850> this

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
the aim-down-sight accuracy on this

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.750 
the aim-down-sight accuracy on this
thing<00:03:58.120> isn't<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.450> best<00:03:58.690> it<00:03:58.900> is<00:03:59.160> possible<00:04:00.160> so

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
thing isn't the best it is possible so

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.280 
thing isn't the best it is possible so
it's<00:04:00.880> definitely<00:04:01.239> possible<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.870> get<00:04:02.080> some

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
it's definitely possible to get some

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.600 
it's definitely possible to get some
long<00:04:02.470> range<00:04:02.650> kills<00:04:02.920> especially<00:04:03.430> if<00:04:03.519> you're

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
long range kills especially if you're

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.920 
long range kills especially if you're
getting<00:04:03.760> head<00:04:04.030> shots<00:04:04.060> because<00:04:04.480> this<00:04:04.720> is<00:04:04.900> a

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
getting head shots because this is a

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.840 
getting head shots because this is a
four<00:04:05.320> bullet<00:04:05.620> kill<00:04:05.830> so<00:04:06.280> if<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:06.430> get<00:04:06.550> some<00:04:06.700> head

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
four bullet kill so if you get some head

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.310 
four bullet kill so if you get some head
shots<00:04:07.090> you<00:04:07.239> could<00:04:07.360> be<00:04:07.450> looking<00:04:07.750> at<00:04:07.900> some<00:04:08.110> two

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
shots you could be looking at some two

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.930 
shots you could be looking at some two
bullet<00:04:08.650> kills<00:04:08.890> so<00:04:09.130> that's<00:04:09.280> pretty<00:04:09.550> impressive

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
bullet kills so that's pretty impressive

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.729 
bullet kills so that's pretty impressive
considering<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.720> SKS<00:04:11.170> is<00:04:11.380> more<00:04:11.560> of<00:04:11.650> a

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
considering that the SKS is more of a

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.250 
considering that the SKS is more of a
medium<00:04:11.890> range<00:04:12.310> weapon<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:12.940> it<00:04:13.510> does<00:04:13.690> possess

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
medium range weapon and it does possess

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.409 
medium range weapon and it does possess
the<00:04:14.440> ability<00:04:14.799> to<00:04:14.830> reach<00:04:15.100> out<00:04:15.340> I<00:04:15.610> do<00:04:16.030> think

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
the ability to reach out I do think

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.360 
the ability to reach out I do think
however<00:04:16.540> the<00:04:16.930> SKS<00:04:17.350> is<00:04:17.380> better<00:04:17.739> suited<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.340> a

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
however the SKS is better suited to a

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.190 
however the SKS is better suited to a
mid<00:04:18.790> range<00:04:19.060> roll<00:04:19.390> I<00:04:19.419> think<00:04:19.720> that's<00:04:19.870> really

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
mid range roll I think that's really

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.930 
mid range roll I think that's really
where<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:20.500> excels<00:04:20.830> considering<00:04:21.669> that<00:04:21.760> if<00:04:21.880> you

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
where it excels considering that if you

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.610 
where it excels considering that if you
put<00:04:22.120> some<00:04:22.300> lower<00:04:22.479> zoom<00:04:22.750> optics<00:04:23.229> on<00:04:23.350> it<00:04:23.500> maybe

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
put some lower zoom optics on it maybe

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.140 
put some lower zoom optics on it maybe
like<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.950> flash<00:04:24.190> suppressor<00:04:24.370> or<00:04:24.729> even<00:04:25.060> the

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
like the flash suppressor or even the

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.210 
like the flash suppressor or even the
suppressor<00:04:25.690> some<00:04:26.320> people<00:04:26.590> like<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.860> use<00:04:26.890> for

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
suppressor some people like to use for

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.040 
suppressor some people like to use for
grip<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:27.640> use<00:04:27.729> it<00:04:27.850> in<00:04:27.970> close<00:04:28.210> quarters<00:04:28.660> this

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
grip and use it in close quarters this

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.510 
grip and use it in close quarters this
thing<00:04:29.260> can<00:04:29.410> be<00:04:29.530> pretty<00:04:29.770> deadly<00:04:30.070> you<00:04:30.340> know<00:04:30.430> I've

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
thing can be pretty deadly you know I've

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.800 
thing can be pretty deadly you know I've
had<00:04:30.640> some<00:04:30.700> good<00:04:30.970> success<00:04:31.180> with<00:04:31.570> flash

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
had some good success with flash

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.480 
had some good success with flash
suppressor<00:04:32.290> and<00:04:32.410> foregrip<00:04:32.919> on<00:04:33.130> this<00:04:33.280> thing

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
suppressor and foregrip on this thing

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.100 
suppressor and foregrip on this thing
because<00:04:33.640> it<00:04:33.790> makes<00:04:34.000> it<00:04:34.150> almost<00:04:34.300> recoilless

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
because it makes it almost recoilless

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.690 
because it makes it almost recoilless
now<00:04:35.290> it<00:04:35.410> does<00:04:35.590> increase<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.130> aim<00:04:36.250> down<00:04:36.430> sight

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
now it does increase the aim down sight

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.550 
now it does increase the aim down sight
spread<00:04:36.729> but<00:04:37.600> that's<00:04:37.750> something<00:04:38.200> you<00:04:38.229> have<00:04:38.530> to

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
spread but that's something you have to

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.370 
spread but that's something you have to
trade<00:04:38.890> off<00:04:39.070> now<00:04:39.390> which<00:04:40.390> weapon<00:04:40.810> is<00:04:40.960> best<00:04:41.200> in

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
trade off now which weapon is best in

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.780 
trade off now which weapon is best in
which<00:04:41.560> scenario<00:04:41.740> now<00:04:42.130> I<00:04:42.160> don't<00:04:42.250> think<00:04:42.490> there's

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
which scenario now I don't think there's

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.100 
which scenario now I don't think there's
a<00:04:42.880> clear-cut<00:04:43.120> winner<00:04:43.450> this<00:04:43.720> week<00:04:43.930> because

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
a clear-cut winner this week because

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.020 
a clear-cut winner this week because
they<00:04:44.229> are<00:04:44.440> kind<00:04:44.860> of<00:04:44.979> different<00:04:45.040> I<00:04:45.460> mean<00:04:45.580> one

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
they are kind of different I mean one

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.460 
they are kind of different I mean one
can<00:04:46.180> do<00:04:46.360> things<00:04:46.540> better<00:04:46.660> than<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.110> other<00:04:47.260> I

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
can do things better than the other I

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.469 
can do things better than the other I
think<00:04:48.040> for<00:04:48.250> close<00:04:48.460> quarters<00:04:48.820> engagements<00:04:48.970> if

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
think for close quarters engagements if

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.340 
think for close quarters engagements if
you're<00:04:49.570> going<00:04:49.720> to<00:04:49.840> take<00:04:49.930> in<00:04:50.080> their<00:04:50.200> close

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
you're going to take in their close

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.170 
you're going to take in their close
quarters<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:50.919> SKS<00:04:51.370> is<00:04:51.520> always<00:04:51.820> going<00:04:52.000> to<00:04:52.120> win

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
quarters the SKS is always going to win

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.089 
quarters the SKS is always going to win
and<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.720> reasoning<00:04:53.110> behind<00:04:53.289> that<00:04:53.590> is<00:04:53.830> because

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
and the reasoning behind that is because

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:55.860 
and the reasoning behind that is because
it<00:04:54.400> has<00:04:54.520> better<00:04:54.729> hipfire

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
it has better hipfire

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.719 
it has better hipfire
it<00:04:56.080> has<00:04:56.289> better<00:04:56.590> aim<00:04:56.830> down<00:04:57.039> sight<00:04:57.279> accuracy

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
it has better aim down sight accuracy

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.390 
it has better aim down sight accuracy
while<00:04:57.909> moving<00:04:58.409> so<00:04:59.409> it<00:04:59.529> does<00:04:59.770> possess<00:05:00.069> the

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
while moving so it does possess the

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.219 
while moving so it does possess the
ability<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.819> be<00:05:01.569> a<00:05:01.599> little<00:05:01.900> bit<00:05:02.020> more

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
ability to be a little bit more

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.290 
ability to be a little bit more
versatile<00:05:02.889> I<00:05:03.009> think<00:05:03.279> than<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.490> in<00:05:03.669> 417

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
versatile I think than the in 417

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.140 
versatile I think than the in 417
because<00:05:04.629> I<00:05:05.080> find<00:05:05.949> the<00:05:06.039> in<00:05:06.129> 417<00:05:06.669> to<00:05:06.759> be<00:05:06.879> very

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
because I find the in 417 to be very

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.089 
because I find the in 417 to be very
very<00:05:07.330> difficult<00:05:07.539> to<00:05:07.870> get<00:05:08.080> people<00:05:08.259> at<00:05:08.680> longer

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
very difficult to get people at longer

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:10.679 
very difficult to get people at longer
and<00:05:09.370> medium<00:05:09.669> ranges<00:05:09.969> you'll<00:05:10.150> see<00:05:10.270> some<00:05:10.449> shots

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:10.689 
and medium ranges you'll see some shots

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:12.059 
and medium ranges you'll see some shots
here<00:05:10.900> I'm<00:05:11.050> just<00:05:11.229> they're<00:05:11.469> all<00:05:11.620> over<00:05:11.949> the<00:05:12.039> place

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.069 
here I'm just they're all over the place

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:13.619 
here I'm just they're all over the place
where<00:05:12.460> as<00:05:12.520> with<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.729> SKS<00:05:13.150> even<00:05:13.419> though<00:05:13.479> it's

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:13.629 
where as with the SKS even though it's

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:15.600 
where as with the SKS even though it's
not<00:05:13.749> as<00:05:13.930> accurate<00:05:14.379> it<00:05:14.830> has<00:05:14.889> a<00:05:14.979> faster<00:05:15.430> rate<00:05:15.580> of

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
not as accurate it has a faster rate of

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.399 
not as accurate it has a faster rate of
fire<00:05:15.729> has<00:05:16.180> less<00:05:16.419> recoil<00:05:16.719> so<00:05:17.080> it's<00:05:17.169> a<00:05:17.229> lot

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
fire has less recoil so it's a lot

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.499 
fire has less recoil so it's a lot
easier<00:05:17.710> to<00:05:17.830> compensate<00:05:18.430> for<00:05:18.610> things<00:05:18.879> because

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
easier to compensate for things because

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:20.730 
easier to compensate for things because
you're<00:05:19.659> not<00:05:19.749> worrying<00:05:20.110> about<00:05:20.139> your<00:05:20.409> weapon

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
you're not worrying about your weapon

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.140 
you're not worrying about your weapon
jumping<00:05:21.129> all<00:05:21.249> over<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.550> screen<00:05:21.819> and<00:05:21.969> stuff

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
jumping all over the screen and stuff

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.119 
jumping all over the screen and stuff
like<00:05:22.270> that<00:05:22.539> so<00:05:22.809> there's<00:05:23.680> not<00:05:23.860> a<00:05:23.889> lot<00:05:24.099> of

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:24.129 
like that so there's not a lot of

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:25.709 
like that so there's not a lot of
differences<00:05:24.610> between<00:05:24.789> these<00:05:25.029> two<00:05:25.089> they<00:05:25.659> do

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:25.719 
differences between these two they do

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:27.570 
differences between these two they do
have<00:05:25.990> different<00:05:26.349> damage<00:05:26.680> models<00:05:27.009> but<00:05:27.460> in

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
have different damage models but in

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.420 
have different damage models but in
terms<00:05:27.759> of<00:05:27.909> being<00:05:27.969> the<00:05:28.330> rolls<00:05:28.779> I<00:05:29.139> think<00:05:29.439> in<00:05:29.740> 417

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
terms of being the rolls I think in 417

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.399 
terms of being the rolls I think in 417
is<00:05:30.550> definitely<00:05:30.969> better<00:05:31.150> at<00:05:31.330> longer<00:05:31.599> ranges<00:05:32.199> in

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
is definitely better at longer ranges in

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.980 
is definitely better at longer ranges in
certain<00:05:32.889> situations<00:05:33.550> but<00:05:34.539> I<00:05:34.569> wouldn't<00:05:34.900> really

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
certain situations but I wouldn't really

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.079 
certain situations but I wouldn't really
count<00:05:35.349> the<00:05:35.499> the<00:05:35.710> SKS<00:05:36.370> out<00:05:36.580> because<00:05:36.819> like<00:05:36.999> I

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:37.089 
count the the SKS out because like I

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:38.879 
count the the SKS out because like I
said<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.389> low<00:05:37.569> recoil<00:05:37.810> makes<00:05:38.229> it<00:05:38.349> really<00:05:38.560> easy

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
said the low recoil makes it really easy

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.469 
said the low recoil makes it really easy
to<00:05:39.009> just<00:05:39.279> stay<00:05:39.430> on<00:05:39.460> target<00:05:39.759> and<00:05:39.999> just<00:05:40.180> be<00:05:40.300> very

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
to just stay on target and just be very

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.510 
to just stay on target and just be very
consistent<00:05:40.930> with<00:05:41.289> your<00:05:41.439> shots<00:05:41.680> so<00:05:41.949> let<00:05:42.430> me

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
consistent with your shots so let me

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.829 
consistent with your shots so let me
know<00:05:42.639> in<00:05:42.759> the<00:05:42.789> Facebook<00:05:43.180> poll<00:05:43.330> which<00:05:43.509> one<00:05:43.689> you

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:43.839 
know in the Facebook poll which one you

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:45.239 
know in the Facebook poll which one you
guys<00:05:44.020> think<00:05:44.349> because<00:05:44.589> I<00:05:44.710> don't<00:05:44.860> really<00:05:45.009> have<00:05:45.129> a

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:45.249 
guys think because I don't really have a

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:46.709 
guys think because I don't really have a
clear-cut<00:05:45.520> winner<00:05:45.699> so<00:05:46.089> I'm<00:05:46.180> looking<00:05:46.449> for<00:05:46.599> your
