we<00:04:12.620> tracked<00:04:12.830> down<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.010> food

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
we tracked down the food

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.439 
we tracked down the food
I<00:04:14.370> was<00:04:14.640> here

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.390 

the<00:04:19.449> thermo

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.930 

like<00:04:22.790> no<00:04:23.030> noise

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
like no noise

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.709 
like no noise
we<00:04:25.300> sent<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.600> car<00:04:25.780> off<00:04:25.930> of<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.200> tower

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.239 

one<00:04:37.220> more<00:04:37.370> time

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:40.249 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:43.029 

okay<00:04:41.249> after<00:04:41.849> a<00:04:41.879> couple<00:04:42.090> more<00:04:42.360> times<00:04:42.569> of

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
okay after a couple more times of

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.339 
okay after a couple more times of
checking<00:04:44.039> to<00:04:44.069> pull<00:04:44.279> it<00:04:44.370> out<00:04:45.169> you<00:04:46.169> get

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
checking to pull it out you get

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:55.330 
checking to pull it out you get
semi-clean<00:04:46.949> for<00:04:47.340> coming<00:04:47.759> out<00:04:47.879> of<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.120> tank

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:03.320 

pumped<00:04:56.340> out<00:04:56.430> a<00:04:56.490> little<00:04:56.699> bit<00:04:56.969> over<00:05:01.999> makes<00:05:02.999> a<00:05:03.120> bit

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
pumped out a little bit over makes a bit

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.700 
pumped out a little bit over makes a bit
of<00:05:03.360> noise<00:05:03.479> but<00:05:03.960> that's<00:05:04.710> okay<00:05:06.080> if<00:05:07.080> you<00:05:07.139> if

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
of noise but that's okay if you if

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.379 
of noise but that's okay if you if
you're<00:05:07.889> poor<00:05:08.580> strange<00:05:08.909> system<00:05:09.090> grab

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
you're poor strange system grab

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.969 
you're poor strange system grab
somewhere<00:05:09.719> and<00:05:09.960> starts<00:05:10.259> making<00:05:10.409> noise

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
somewhere and starts making noise

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.589 
somewhere and starts making noise
just<00:05:11.460> shut<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:11.699> car<00:05:11.849> off<00:05:11.909> let<00:05:12.270> it<00:05:12.300> sit<00:05:12.569> for

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
just shut the car off let it sit for

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.989 
just shut the car off let it sit for
like<00:05:12.810> 5-10<00:05:13.110> minutes<00:05:13.740> what<00:05:14.430> are<00:05:14.580> the<00:05:14.699> air

00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:14.999 
like 5-10 minutes what are the air

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:17.869 
like 5-10 minutes what are the air
bubbles<00:05:15.479> I<00:05:15.659> gather<00:05:16.620> together<00:05:16.860> we<00:05:17.370> gather<00:05:17.669> up

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
bubbles I gather together we gather up

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:20.929 
bubbles I gather together we gather up
so<00:05:18.870> when<00:05:19.620> you<00:05:19.770> restart<00:05:20.249> the<00:05:20.430> car<00:05:20.639> it's<00:05:20.819> not

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:20.939 
so when you restart the car it's not

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:24.649 
so when you restart the car it's not
going<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.180> be<00:05:21.270> sucking<00:05:21.509> bubbles<00:05:22.139> in<00:05:22.319> and<00:05:23.659> just

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
going to be sucking bubbles in and just

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.570 
going to be sucking bubbles in and just
let<00:05:24.839> it<00:05:24.960> idle<00:05:25.229> don't<00:05:25.889> don't<00:05:26.159> turn<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:26.430> wheel

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
let it idle don't don't turn the wheel

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.040 
let it idle don't don't turn the wheel
or<00:05:26.759> anything<00:05:26.819> like<00:05:27.089> that<00:05:27.150> just<00:05:27.300> let<00:05:27.599> her<00:05:27.689> idle

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
or anything like that just let her idle

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.999 
or anything like that just let her idle
for<00:05:28.259> 5-10<00:05:29.219> minutes<00:05:29.249> and<00:05:30.499> it'll<00:05:31.499> quiet<00:05:31.800> down

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
for 5-10 minutes and it'll quiet down

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.219 
for 5-10 minutes and it'll quiet down
then<00:05:32.520> still<00:05:33.449> going<00:05:33.599> to<00:05:33.659> be<00:05:33.749> a<00:05:33.779> little<00:05:34.050> bit<00:05:34.139> of

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
then still going to be a little bit of

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.679 
then still going to be a little bit of
noise<00:05:34.349> left<00:05:34.699> now<00:05:35.699> take<00:05:35.909> it<00:05:36.060> for<00:05:36.210> right<00:05:36.419> maybe

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:36.689 
noise left now take it for right maybe

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:39.309 
noise left now take it for right maybe
10<00:05:36.930> 15<00:05:37.080> min<00:05:37.409> I<00:05:37.439> right<00:05:37.680> it's<00:05:38.460> going<00:05:38.610> to<00:05:38.669> go<00:05:38.849> away

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:14.539 
this guy's we did a fan clutch is not

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:18.689 
this guy's we did a fan clutch is not
good<00:07:14.750> and<00:07:15.819> you<00:07:16.819> could<00:07:16.970> tell<00:07:17.180> that<00:07:17.240> very<00:07:17.629> easily

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:18.699 
good and you could tell that very easily

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:22.330 
good and you could tell that very easily
you<00:07:19.699> let<00:07:20.090> the<00:07:20.180> car<00:07:20.389> run<00:07:20.569> up<00:07:20.750> to<00:07:21.590> a<00:07:21.620> normal

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:22.340 
you let the car run up to a normal

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.490 
you let the car run up to a normal
operating<00:07:22.729> temperature<00:07:25.720> she's<00:07:26.720> hot<00:07:26.960> so<00:07:27.349> the

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.500 
operating temperature she's hot so the

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.529 
operating temperature she's hot so the
clock<00:07:27.740> should<00:07:28.009> be<00:07:28.190> engaged<00:07:28.610> at<00:07:29.120> least<00:07:29.419> a

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:29.539 
clock should be engaged at least a

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:32.790 
clock should be engaged at least a
little<00:07:29.659> bit<00:07:30.669> and<00:07:31.669> when<00:07:31.970> you<00:07:32.060> shut<00:07:32.270> the<00:07:32.300> car<00:07:32.539> off

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 
little bit and when you shut the car off

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:38.950 
little bit and when you shut the car off
observe<00:07:33.800> the<00:07:33.979> fan<00:07:34.159> observe<00:07:34.610> defend<00:07:37.960> this

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 
observe the fan observe defend this

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.529 
observe the fan observe defend this
thing<00:07:39.139> keeps<00:07:39.440> on<00:07:39.590> spinning

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:40.539 
thing keeps on spinning

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:43.480 
thing keeps on spinning
that<00:07:41.539> means<00:07:41.750> the<00:07:41.900> clutch<00:07:42.139> is<00:07:42.440> not<00:07:42.770> engaged<00:07:43.190> at

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:43.490 
that means the clutch is not engaged at

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.610 
that means the clutch is not engaged at
all<00:07:44.620> even<00:07:45.620> if<00:07:45.860> the<00:07:45.889> car<00:07:46.130> is<00:07:46.280> cold<00:07:47.349> you<00:07:48.349> cannot

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:48.620 
all even if the car is cold you cannot

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.710 
all even if the car is cold you cannot
do<00:07:48.800> that<00:07:48.830> so<00:07:49.520> this<00:07:49.699> guy's<00:07:49.940> thumb<00:07:50.300> clutch<00:07:50.539> is

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 
do that so this guy's thumb clutch is

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.760 
do that so this guy's thumb clutch is
not<00:07:50.900> good<00:07:51.280> and<00:07:52.990> right<00:07:53.990> now<00:07:54.139> it<00:07:54.349> doesn't<00:07:54.530> matter

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:54.770 
not good and right now it doesn't matter

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.089 
not good and right now it doesn't matter
it's<00:07:55.069> cold<00:07:55.370> he's<00:07:55.940> driving<00:07:56.360> in<00:07:56.449> cold<00:07:56.840> weather

00:07:57.089 --> 00:07:57.099 
it's cold he's driving in cold weather

00:07:57.099 --> 00:08:01.330 
it's cold he's driving in cold weather
probably<00:07:58.099> won't<00:07:58.310> overheat<00:07:59.259> but<00:08:00.259> if<00:08:00.949> it's<00:08:01.190> got

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:01.340 
probably won't overheat but if it's got

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.399 
probably won't overheat but if it's got
to<00:08:01.400> be<00:08:01.460> hot<00:08:01.639> in<00:08:01.669> the<00:08:01.879> summer<00:08:02.150> this<00:08:02.960> might<00:08:03.229> be<00:08:03.379> a

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:03.409 
to be hot in the summer this might be a

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:05.860 
to be hot in the summer this might be a
problem
