was a dead silence / sitrep pro
functionality<00:01:13.979> fist<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.430> i<00:01:14.490> think<00:01:14.820> i<00:01:15.180> think

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
functionality fist and i think i think

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.109 
functionality fist and i think i think
the<00:01:15.810> entire<00:01:16.500> intent<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.070> sitrep<00:01:17.790> pro<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.090> i

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
the entire intent of sitrep pro and i

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.330 
the entire intent of sitrep pro and i
haven't<00:01:18.360> really<00:01:18.570> used<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.960> whole<00:01:19.080> lot

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
haven't really used it a whole lot

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.649 
haven't really used it a whole lot
what's<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.490> entirely<00:01:20.790> cancel<00:01:21.330> out<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> dead

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
what's to entirely cancel out the dead

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.719 
what's to entirely cancel out the dead
silence<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.830> would<00:01:22.979> hear<00:01:23.430> their

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
silence so that you would hear their

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.580 
silence so that you would hear their
footsteps<00:01:23.780> normally<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:24.930> they<00:01:25.080> even<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.470> they

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
footsteps normally if they even if they

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.160 
footsteps normally if they even if they
had<00:01:25.710> dead<00:01:25.890> silence<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.780> but<00:01:27.780> i<00:01:27.810> don't<00:01:28.080> think

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
had dead silence on but i don't think

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.319 
had dead silence on but i don't think
that<00:01:28.439> was<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.829> case<00:01:29.400> or<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.729> has<00:01:30.000> been<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
that was the case or that has been the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.810 
that was the case or that has been the
case<00:01:30.360> i<00:01:30.780> think<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:31.680> sort<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.490> less<00:01:32.790> than

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
case i think it's it's sort of less than

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.940 
case i think it's it's sort of less than
than<00:01:33.509> normal<00:01:33.960> possibly<00:01:34.409> i<00:01:34.470> know<00:01:34.590> maybe<00:01:34.890> you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
than normal possibly i know maybe you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.760 
than normal possibly i know maybe you

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
they say they're fixing stuff but what

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.880 
they say they're fixing stuff but what
why<00:01:42.270> don't<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.509> add<00:01:42.630> some<00:01:42.869> detail<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:43.619> what

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
think that's it they actually made it so

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.399 
think that's it they actually made it so
