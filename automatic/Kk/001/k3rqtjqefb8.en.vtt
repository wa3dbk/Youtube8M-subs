I took a few demos out and to see for
myself<00:01:54.159> and<00:01:54.310> put<00:01:54.430> it<00:01:54.490> on<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.640> RTC<00:01:55.030> machine<00:01:55.330> if

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
myself and put it on the RTC machine if

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.060 
myself and put it on the RTC machine if
you<00:01:56.080> put<00:01:56.290> it<00:01:56.350> at<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:56.500> 3<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:56.860> 9<00:01:56.950> o'clock

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
you put it at the 3 and 9 o'clock

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.100 
you put it at the 3 and 9 o'clock
positions<00:01:57.670> only<00:01:57.850> you'll<00:01:58.510> increase<00:01:58.780> swim

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
positions only you'll increase swim

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.020 
positions only you'll increase swim
weight<00:01:59.320> by<00:01:59.530> about<00:01:59.770> three<00:02:00.190> points<00:02:00.550> and<00:02:00.670> that'll

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
weight by about three points and that'll

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.370 
weight by about three points and that'll
really<00:02:01.180> increase<00:02:01.630> that<00:02:01.780> torsional<00:02:02.260> stability

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
really increase that torsional stability

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.350 
really increase that torsional stability
yeah<00:02:03.370> I'll<00:02:03.520> put<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.760> at<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.940> 12<00:02:04.150> o'clock

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
yeah I'll put it at the 12 o'clock

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.930 
yeah I'll put it at the 12 o'clock
position<00:02:04.450> and<00:02:05.080> that<00:02:05.710> will<00:02:05.830> increase<00:02:06.130> swing

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
position and that will increase swing

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.729 
position and that will increase swing
weight<00:02:07.120> by<00:02:07.240> about<00:02:07.390> 6<00:02:07.720> points<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:08.619> can

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
weight by about 6 points and you can

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.109 
weight by about 6 points and you can
actually<00:02:08.860> put<00:02:09.129> it<00:02:09.190> in<00:02:09.250> all<00:02:09.369> three<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.909> that

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
actually put it in all three and that

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.360 
actually put it in all three and that
will<00:02:10.209> increase<00:02:10.539> swing<00:02:11.079> weight<00:02:11.260> by<00:02:11.469> about<00:02:11.980> 9

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
will increase swing weight by about 9

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.860 
will increase swing weight by about 9
points<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:12.879> for<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.569> most<00:02:13.749> maneuverable<00:02:14.109> set

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
points and for the most maneuverable set

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.690 
points and for the most maneuverable set
use<00:02:15.260> no<00:02:15.470> slide<00:02:15.770> weights<00:02:15.950> in<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.250> lattice<00:02:16.520> but

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
use no slide weights in the lattice but

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.910 
use no slide weights in the lattice but
cap<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.210> that's<00:02:17.780> really<00:02:18.020> how<00:02:18.230> easy<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:18.740> to

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
cap and that's really how easy it is to

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.040 
cap and that's really how easy it is to
customize<00:02:19.550> these<00:02:19.970> rackets<00:02:20.420> for<00:02:20.600> more

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
customize these rackets for more

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.960 
customize these rackets for more
information<00:02:21.530> or<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.710> demo<00:02:22.010> one<00:02:22.250> go<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.790> our
