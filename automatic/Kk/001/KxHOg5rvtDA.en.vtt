00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.480 
duty I I I used to believe that I would
have<00:01:56.930> a<00:01:56.990> really<00:01:57.320> steady<00:01:57.620> hand<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.190> it<00:01:58.310> would

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
have a really steady hand and it would

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.430 
have a really steady hand and it would
sort<00:01:58.970> of<00:01:59.030> calm<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.450> senses<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.080> make<00:02:00.260> you<00:02:00.409> a

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
sort of calm the senses and make you a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.020 
sort of calm the senses and make you a
little<00:02:00.710> bit<00:02:00.799> more<00:02:00.979> reckless<00:02:01.430> I<00:02:01.610> guess<00:02:01.790> and

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
little bit more reckless I guess and

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.060 
little bit more reckless I guess and
sometimes<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.080> recklessness<00:02:03.560> would<00:02:03.920> pay

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
sometimes that recklessness would pay

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.800 
sometimes that recklessness would pay
