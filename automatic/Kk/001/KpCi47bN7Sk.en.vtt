00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
video I'm going to be doing a review of

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.530 
video I'm going to be doing a review of
the<00:00:08.460> Rio<00:00:08.639> b1<00:00:09.179> plus<00:00:09.420> vacuum<00:00:10.610> okay<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.480> start

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
the Rio b1 plus vacuum okay so to start

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.580 
the Rio b1 plus vacuum okay so to start
off<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.950> vacuum<00:00:14.360> isn't<00:00:15.360> really<00:00:16.080> doesn't

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
off this vacuum isn't really doesn't

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.109 
off this vacuum isn't really doesn't
really<00:00:16.740> do<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:16.949> much<00:00:17.250> other<00:00:17.550> than<00:00:17.640> via

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
really do that much other than via

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.340 
really do that much other than via
vacuum<00:00:18.619> it<00:00:19.619> runs<00:00:19.830> off<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:21.020> standard<00:00:22.020> Rio

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
vacuum it runs off to the standard Rio

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.570 
vacuum it runs off to the standard Rio
be<00:00:22.560> 18<00:00:23.189> volt<00:00:23.789> batteries<00:00:24.289> the<00:00:25.289> one<00:00:25.410> plus<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.430> any

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
be 18 volt batteries the one plus so any

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.540 
be 18 volt batteries the one plus so any
of<00:00:26.760> them<00:00:26.910> will<00:00:27.150> work<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:28.199> does<00:00:28.529> eat<00:00:28.949> batteries

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
of them will work it does eat batteries

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.060 
of them will work it does eat batteries
fairly<00:00:29.939> quick<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:31.140> probably<00:00:31.500> about<00:00:31.619> get

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
fairly quick you probably about get

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.100 
fairly quick you probably about get
about<00:00:32.250> 15<00:00:32.730> minutes<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.300> use<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.750> one<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:33.930> these

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
about 15 minutes of use on one of these

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.100 
about 15 minutes of use on one of these
compacts<00:00:34.790> with<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.000> which<00:00:36.480> isn't<00:00:36.750> all<00:00:37.079> that

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
compacts with it which isn't all that

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.049 
compacts with it which isn't all that
much<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:39.230> it's<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:40.770> too<00:00:40.980> bad<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.879> can

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
much but it's it's not too bad you can

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.750 
much but it's it's not too bad you can
vacuum<00:00:42.270> some<00:00:42.719> stuff<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.430> so<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.579> comes

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
vacuum some stuff with it so it comes

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.290 
vacuum some stuff with it so it comes
with<00:00:45.140> this<00:00:46.140> attachment<00:00:46.829> which<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.879> fits<00:00:48.120> in

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
with this attachment which just fits in

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.770 
with this attachment which just fits in
here<00:00:49.219> like<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.390> end<00:00:51.539> you

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
here like that and then on the end you

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.869 
here like that and then on the end you
either<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.649> where<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.640> slide

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
either have that and where you slide

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.420 
either have that and where you slide
that<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.449> have<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> brush<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:56.190> that

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
that up and you have a brush and that

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.549 
that up and you have a brush and that
just<00:00:56.699> sits<00:00:57.270> down<00:00:57.360> here<00:00:58.699> it's<00:00:59.699> tinted<00:01:00.359> yellow

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
just sits down here it's tinted yellow

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.110 
just sits down here it's tinted yellow
which<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.710> always<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.430> old<00:01:02.609> plastic

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
which I always think of as old plastic

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.060 
which I always think of as old plastic
but<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.570> actually<00:01:03.989> really<00:01:04.260> strong<00:01:04.500> plastic

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
but it's actually really strong plastic

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.420 
but it's actually really strong plastic
I<00:01:05.280> wouldn't<00:01:05.880> be<00:01:05.970> worried<00:01:06.210> about<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.510> breaking

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
I wouldn't be worried about it breaking

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.450 
I wouldn't be worried about it breaking
so<00:01:08.430> there's<00:01:08.729> an<00:01:08.880> on/off<00:01:09.030> switch<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:10.159> then<00:01:11.159> in

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
so there's an on/off switch and then in

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.469 
so there's an on/off switch and then in
here<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.570> press<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.049> button<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:15.119> opens

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
here you press that button and it opens

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.020 
here you press that button and it opens
it<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.290> then<00:01:16.439> here's<00:01:16.680> your<00:01:16.920> your<00:01:17.340> vacuum<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
it so then here's your your vacuum the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.810 
it so then here's your your vacuum the
motor<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.710> fan<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:20.460> here's<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
motor and the fan and then here's the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.649 
motor and the fan and then here's the
filter<00:01:21.119> system<00:01:21.439> so<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.890> comes<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:24.540> this

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
filter system so this comes out and this

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.020 
filter system so this comes out and this
is<00:01:24.810> all<00:01:24.930> clean<00:01:25.200> right<00:01:25.409> now<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.860> your<00:01:26.580> dirt<00:01:26.850> is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
is all clean right now so your dirt is

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.030 
is all clean right now so your dirt is
gonna<00:01:27.299> gather<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.900> there<00:01:28.110> there's<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> little

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
gonna gather in there there's a little

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.160 
gonna gather in there there's a little
stopper<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.420> doesn't<00:01:30.630> fall<00:01:30.750> back<00:01:30.810> out

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
stopper so that it doesn't fall back out

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.160 
stopper so that it doesn't fall back out
and<00:01:31.460> then<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> first<00:01:33.210> filter<00:01:33.450> so

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
and then this is the first filter so

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.690 
and then this is the first filter so
that<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.530> wipe<00:01:34.860> off<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.430> that'll<00:01:35.640> be

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
that you just wipe off and that'll be

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.469 
that you just wipe off and that'll be
fine<00:01:35.729> then<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.780> here<00:01:37.640> it's<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> second<00:01:39.150> filter

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
fine then in here it's the second filter

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.469 
fine then in here it's the second filter
they<00:01:40.200> say<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.740> one's<00:01:40.979> clean<00:01:41.310> will<00:01:42.119> clean<00:01:42.329> by

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
they say this one's clean will clean by

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.810 
they say this one's clean will clean by
my<00:01:42.659> standards<00:01:42.899> they<00:01:43.890> say<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> replace<00:01:44.759> it

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
my standards they say to replace it

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.030 
my standards they say to replace it
every<00:01:47.820> time<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.329> change<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.110> or<00:01:49.200> whatever<00:01:49.470> or

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
every time you change it or whatever or

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.690 
every time you change it or whatever or
something<00:01:50.070> like<00:01:50.430> that

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
something like that

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.100 
something like that
what<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.909> shoot<00:01:53.909> compressed<00:01:54.840> air

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
what I do is I just shoot compressed air

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.910 
what I do is I just shoot compressed air
through<00:01:55.860> all<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:58.140> gaps<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.710> there

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
through all of the the gaps in there

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.649 
through all of the the gaps in there
with<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> needle<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.759> it<00:02:00.149> cleans<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.570> out

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
with a needle and it cleans it out

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.429 
with a needle and it cleans it out
really<00:02:00.930> nicely

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
really nicely

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.770 
really nicely
I<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.850> take<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.000> needle<00:02:03.390> on<00:02:03.479> an<00:02:03.659> air

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
I just take a needle on an air

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.240 
I just take a needle on an air
compressor<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.320> shoot<00:02:04.649> through<00:02:04.829> all<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.070> them

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
compressor and shoot through all of them

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.499 
compressor and shoot through all of them
and<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:06.329> does<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.540> trick<00:02:06.840> for<00:02:06.869> me<00:02:08.209> so<00:02:09.209> I

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
and that does the trick for me so I

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.390 
and that does the trick for me so I
haven't<00:02:10.080> had<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.470> replace<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.890> filter<00:02:11.190> yet

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
haven't had to replace the filter yet

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.630 
haven't had to replace the filter yet
but<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.030> don't<00:02:12.959> I

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
but I don't I

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.700 
but I don't I
now<00:02:13.819> if<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.090> decreases<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.110> life<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.590> the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
now if that decreases the life of the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.650 
now if that decreases the life of the
machine<00:02:15.830> at<00:02:16.190> all<00:02:16.280> but<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:16.730> think<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:17.180> seems<00:02:17.510> to

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
machine at all but I think it seems to

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.220 
machine at all but I think it seems to
work<00:02:17.690> good

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
work good

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.620 
work good
you<00:02:19.069> can<00:02:19.250> certainly<00:02:19.790> hear<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:20.000> difference<00:02:20.420> when

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
you can certainly hear a difference when

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.030 
you can certainly hear a difference when
the<00:02:20.750> filters<00:02:21.110> start<00:02:21.319> getting<00:02:21.590> dirty<00:02:21.890> it

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
the filters start getting dirty it

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.490 
the filters start getting dirty it
starts<00:02:22.850> it's<00:02:23.390> almost<00:02:23.600> like<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:23.930> revs<00:02:24.140> too<00:02:24.319> high

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
starts it's almost like it revs too high

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.280 
starts it's almost like it revs too high
but<00:02:24.850> it's<00:02:25.850> not<00:02:25.940> really<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.690> case<00:02:26.870> since<00:02:27.080> it's

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
but it's not really the case since it's

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.720 
but it's not really the case since it's
a<00:02:27.350> motor<00:02:27.590> but<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:29.480> hear<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.750> difference<00:02:30.730> when

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
a motor but you hear a difference when

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.300 
a motor but you hear a difference when
you<00:02:31.820> clean<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.180> it's<00:02:32.330> good<00:02:32.570> so<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.920> has<00:02:34.070> that

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
you clean it it's good so it has that

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.449 
you clean it it's good so it has that
has<00:02:34.610> been<00:02:34.880> tier<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.959> handle<00:02:36.320> is<00:02:36.740> pretty<00:02:37.280> nice

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
has been tier the handle is pretty nice

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.520 
has been tier the handle is pretty nice
it<00:02:37.730> balances<00:02:38.150> out<00:02:38.300> good<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:38.810> about<00:02:39.050> it<00:02:39.350> the

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
it balances out good so about it the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.880 
it balances out good so about it the
right<00:02:39.680> angle<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.070> vacuum<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:42.080> think<00:02:42.739> it's

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
right angle to vacuum I think it's

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.699 
right angle to vacuum I think it's
pretty<00:02:43.040> good<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.489> costs<00:02:43.850> about<00:02:44.510> 25<00:02:45.080> bucks<00:02:45.350> if

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
pretty good it costs about 25 bucks if

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.220 
pretty good it costs about 25 bucks if
you're<00:02:46.430> gonna<00:02:46.580> be<00:02:47.030> cleaning<00:02:47.390> stuff<00:02:47.750> up<00:02:47.989> here

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
you're gonna be cleaning stuff up here

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.449 
you're gonna be cleaning stuff up here
and<00:02:48.350> there<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.500> think<00:02:48.800> it's<00:02:48.920> worth<00:02:49.100> it

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
and there I think it's worth it

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.940 
and there I think it's worth it
I've<00:02:50.120> definitely<00:02:50.660> think<00:02:51.230> it's<00:02:51.380> worth<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.739> for

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
I've definitely think it's worth it for

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.759 
I've definitely think it's worth it for
a<00:02:51.980> while<00:02:52.130> I've<00:02:52.250> used<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.820> for<00:02:53.110> so<00:02:54.110> let's<00:02:54.500> get<00:02:54.650> to

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
a while I've used it for so let's get to

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.400 
a while I've used it for so let's get to
a<00:02:54.800> vacuum<00:02:55.220> test<00:02:55.489> okay<00:02:56.239> so<00:02:56.300> I've<00:02:56.750> got<00:02:56.780> some<00:02:57.170> dirt

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
a vacuum test okay so I've got some dirt

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.130 
a vacuum test okay so I've got some dirt
and<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:58.160> white<00:02:58.370> pad<00:02:58.940> thing<00:02:59.330> so<00:02:59.660> I'm<00:02:59.750> gonna<00:02:59.959> put

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
and the white pad thing so I'm gonna put

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.759 
and the white pad thing so I'm gonna put
the<00:03:00.260> dirt<00:03:00.440> on<00:03:00.620> there<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:03.230> we'll<00:03:03.440> see<00:03:03.620> how<00:03:03.739> it

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
the dirt on there so we'll see how it

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:20.000 
the dirt on there so we'll see how it
vacuums<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.340> up

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.710 

as<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.310> can<00:03:21.490> see<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.820> vacuums<00:03:22.240> it<00:03:22.420> up<00:03:22.540> pretty

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
as you can see it vacuums it up pretty

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.580 
as you can see it vacuums it up pretty
good<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:23.140> kind<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.410> stuck<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.280> this<00:03:24.460> so<00:03:25.290> now<00:03:26.290> I'm

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
good it kind of stuck to this so now I'm

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.940 
good it kind of stuck to this so now I'm
gonna<00:03:26.740> try<00:03:27.070> is<00:03:28.470> on<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:30.100> surface<00:03:30.580> like<00:03:30.730> carpet<00:03:31.950> so

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
gonna try is on a surface like carpet so

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.220 
gonna try is on a surface like carpet so
put<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.400> dirt<00:03:33.580> on<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.880> carpet<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.750> this<00:03:38.020> is

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
put the dirt on the carpet and this is

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:53.440 
put the dirt on the carpet and this is
fine<00:03:38.500> carpet

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.660 

now<00:03:54.450> as<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:54.900> can<00:03:55.020> see<00:03:55.080> it<00:03:55.380> works<00:03:55.560> pretty<00:03:55.770> good

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
now as you can see it works pretty good

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.100 
now as you can see it works pretty good
it<00:03:56.850> gets<00:03:57.030> all<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.330> dirt<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.750> does<00:03:57.960> it

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
it gets all the dirt and it does it

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.780 
it gets all the dirt and it does it
really<00:03:58.350> fast<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.800> actually<00:03:59.130> has<00:03:59.280> quite<00:03:59.520> a<00:03:59.550> lot

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
really fast it actually has quite a lot

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.480 
really fast it actually has quite a lot
of<00:03:59.820> suction<00:04:00.210> power<00:04:00.740> you<00:04:01.740> just<00:04:01.980> have<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.310> get

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
of suction power you just have to get

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.550 
of suction power you just have to get
the<00:04:02.640> right<00:04:02.820> head<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.780> if<00:04:04.080> you're<00:04:04.230> trying<00:04:04.380> to

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
the right head is if you're trying to

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.560 
the right head is if you're trying to
get<00:04:05.280> something<00:04:05.520> in<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.880> corner<00:04:06.120> you're<00:04:06.450> gonna

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
get something in the corner you're gonna

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.570 
get something in the corner you're gonna
need<00:04:06.810> this<00:04:07.020> thing<00:04:07.320> that<00:04:07.950> actually<00:04:08.340> helps

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
need this thing that actually helps

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.030 
need this thing that actually helps
quite<00:04:08.760> a<00:04:08.790> bit<00:04:09.030> but<00:04:09.390> I'd<00:04:10.320> say<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.650> works<00:04:10.830> pretty

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
quite a bit but I'd say it works pretty

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.480 
quite a bit but I'd say it works pretty
good<00:04:11.370> it's<00:04:12.240> easy<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.720> maintain<00:04:13.410> since<00:04:14.130> I<00:04:14.310> can

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
good it's easy to maintain since I can

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.229 
good it's easy to maintain since I can
just<00:04:14.670> blow<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:15.030> filter<00:04:15.330> with<00:04:15.480> compressed<00:04:15.840> air

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
just blow the filter with compressed air

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.870 
just blow the filter with compressed air
now<00:04:18.239> on<00:04:18.510> thick<00:04:18.840> carpet<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:20.370> stuff<00:04:20.640> the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
now on thick carpet the stuff the

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.610 
now on thick carpet the stuff the
thicker<00:04:21.090> sort<00:04:21.390> of<00:04:21.480> carpet<00:04:21.840> it<00:04:21.959> doesn't<00:04:22.440> work

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
thicker sort of carpet it doesn't work

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.270 
thicker sort of carpet it doesn't work
so<00:04:22.860> good<00:04:23.600> it'll<00:04:24.600> vacuum<00:04:25.110> stuff<00:04:25.380> off<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:25.950> but

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
so good it'll vacuum stuff off of it but

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.250 
so good it'll vacuum stuff off of it but
it<00:04:26.460> can't<00:04:26.700> get<00:04:27.030> stuff<00:04:27.330> up<00:04:27.480> that's<00:04:27.690> stuck<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:27.930> it

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
it can't get stuff up that's stuck to it

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.170 
it can't get stuff up that's stuck to it
I<00:04:28.530> mean<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:29.010> would<00:04:29.130> need<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.310> roller<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.730> do<00:04:30.000> that

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
I mean it would need a roller to do that

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.590 
I mean it would need a roller to do that
but<00:04:31.050> just<00:04:31.290> as<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.650> little<00:04:32.490> vacuum<00:04:32.880> that<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.390> think

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
but just as a little vacuum that I think

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.660 
but just as a little vacuum that I think
it's<00:04:33.720> great<00:04:33.870> is<00:04:34.050> this<00:04:34.200> cordless<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:34.680> that

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670
