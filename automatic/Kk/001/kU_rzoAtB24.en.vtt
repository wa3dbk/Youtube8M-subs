with these I think this is a nice way to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.700 
with these I think this is a nice way to
use<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.719> too<00:01:36.899> because<00:01:37.170> sometimes<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.619> have

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
use this up too because sometimes I have
