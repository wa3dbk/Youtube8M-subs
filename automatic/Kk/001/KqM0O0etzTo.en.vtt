legato<00:00:27.789> technique<00:00:27.939> legato<00:00:28.449> is<00:00:28.720> a<00:00:29.080> mix<00:00:29.619> of<00:00:29.859> two

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
legato technique legato is a mix of two

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:31.620 
legato technique legato is a mix of two
different<00:00:30.670> techniques<00:00:30.970> which<00:00:31.269> are<00:00:31.390> called

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
different techniques which are called

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.390 
different techniques which are called
hammer-ons<00:00:32.110> and<00:00:32.290> pull-offs<00:00:32.379> i'm<00:00:32.890> sure<00:00:33.250> most

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
hammer-ons and pull-offs i'm sure most

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.460 
hammer-ons and pull-offs i'm sure most
of<00:00:33.550> you<00:00:33.610> already<00:00:33.730> know<00:00:34.000> this<00:00:34.360> but<00:00:34.570> let<00:00:35.440> me

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
of you already know this but let me

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.200 
of you already know this but let me
demonstrate<00:00:36.100> this<00:00:36.519> for<00:00:36.699> you<00:00:36.820> really<00:00:37.030> quick

demonstrate this for you really quick

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.539 
demonstrate this for you really quick
hammer<00:00:37.870> on<00:00:38.080> is<00:00:38.379> when<00:00:38.860> you<00:00:38.949> play<00:00:39.129> a<00:00:39.160> note<00:00:39.370> with<00:00:39.519> a

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:39.549 
hammer on is when you play a note with a

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:44.820 
hammer on is when you play a note with a
pic<00:00:39.790> and<00:00:40.500> then<00:00:43.290> producer<00:00:44.290> know<00:00:44.440> just<00:00:44.710> by

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
pic and then producer know just by

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.509 
pic and then producer know just by
lowering<00:00:45.129> a<00:00:45.280> finger<00:00:45.909> hard<00:00:46.510> enough<00:00:46.629> to<00:00:47.049> produce

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
lowering a finger hard enough to produce

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.490 
lowering a finger hard enough to produce
a<00:00:48.519> different<00:00:49.210> note<00:00:49.360> now<00:00:49.540> this<00:00:49.750> note<00:00:49.960> should

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
a different note now this note should

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.549 
a different note now this note should
sound<00:00:51.129> equal<00:00:51.580> in<00:00:51.820> volume<00:00:52.299> and<00:00:52.360> tone<00:00:52.600> to<00:00:53.440> the

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
sound equal in volume and tone to the

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.100 
sound equal in volume and tone to the
note<00:00:53.710> that<00:00:53.860> you're<00:00:53.949> using<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.220> pig<00:00:54.430> for<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.960> if

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
note that you're using the pig for so if

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.229 
note that you're using the pig for so if
your<00:00:56.290> technique<00:00:56.680> is<00:00:56.860> proficient<00:00:57.729> then<00:00:58.119> you

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
your technique is proficient then you

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.689 
your technique is proficient then you
should<00:00:58.449> have<00:00:58.479> no<00:00:58.839> problem<00:00:59.489> generating<00:01:00.489> notes

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
should have no problem generating notes

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.810 
should have no problem generating notes
that<00:01:00.970> are<00:01:01.000> absolutely<00:01:01.869> fluid<00:01:02.619> and<00:01:02.830> smoothest

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
that are absolutely fluid and smoothest

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.640 
that are absolutely fluid and smoothest
because<00:01:04.150> they<00:01:04.299> will<00:01:04.420> have<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.659> same<00:01:04.839> note<00:01:05.080> the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
because they will have the same note the

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.710 
because they will have the same note the
same<00:01:05.860> tone<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.250> volume<00:01:06.340> if<00:01:06.760> your<00:01:07.180> volume<00:01:07.600> is

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
same tone and volume if your volume is

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.260 
same tone and volume if your volume is
all<00:01:07.840> for<00:01:08.140> attorneys<00:01:08.650> of<00:01:08.860> organ<00:01:09.310> rhythm<00:01:09.640> then

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
all for attorneys of organ rhythm then

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.120 
all for attorneys of organ rhythm then
you<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:11.049> technique<00:01:11.380> one<00:01:11.590> bit<00:01:11.890> transparent

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
you the technique one bit transparent

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.999 
you the technique one bit transparent
and<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.990> you're<00:01:14.140> always<00:01:14.259> striving<00:01:14.469> to<00:01:14.829> have

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
and so you're always striving to have

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.919 
and so you're always striving to have
transparent<00:01:15.670> technique<00:01:15.939> which<00:01:16.119> means<00:01:16.329> the

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
transparent technique which means the

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.289 
transparent technique which means the
technique<00:01:17.289> does<00:01:17.590> not<00:01:17.770> deviate<00:01:18.520> your

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
technique does not deviate your

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.929 
technique does not deviate your
attention<00:01:19.810> from<00:01:20.049> the<00:01:20.289> music<00:01:20.619> so<00:01:20.950> try<00:01:21.789> to<00:01:21.820> keep

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
attention from the music so try to keep

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.389 
attention from the music so try to keep
that<00:01:22.149> in<00:01:22.210> mind<00:01:22.420> when<00:01:22.570> you<00:01:22.659> play<00:01:22.810> this<00:01:23.369> pull<00:01:24.369> off

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
that in mind when you play this pull off

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:25.770 
that in mind when you play this pull off
is<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.759> same<00:01:24.939> thing<00:01:24.969> you<00:01:25.210> play<00:01:25.359> a<00:01:25.390> note<00:01:25.600> with

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
is the same thing you play a note with

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.910 
is the same thing you play a note with
the<00:01:25.869> pic

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
the pic

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.030 
the pic
and<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:28.810> you<00:01:29.810> know<00:01:30.020> take<00:01:30.320> out<00:01:30.530> take<00:01:30.799> away<00:01:30.979> the

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
and you you know take out take away the

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.380 
and you you know take out take away the
finger<00:01:31.369> that<00:01:31.520> was<00:01:31.640> playing<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:31.970> first<00:01:32.119> note

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
finger that was playing the first note

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.810 
finger that was playing the first note
and<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:33.380> next<00:01:33.590> note<00:01:33.799> is<00:01:33.830> produced<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.460> again

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
and the next note is produced and again

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.030 
and the next note is produced and again
volume<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.509> tone<00:01:35.630> should<00:01:35.960> be<00:01:36.080> exactly<00:01:36.920> the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
volume and tone should be exactly the

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.679 
volume and tone should be exactly the
same<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.700> combination<00:01:37.909> of<00:01:38.240> this<00:01:38.390> could<00:01:38.570> be

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
same so a combination of this could be

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:45.580 
same so a combination of this could be
for<00:01:38.899> example<00:01:38.960> playing<00:01:39.380> 7<00:01:39.860> 8<00:01:39.979> 10<00:01:44.229> this<00:01:45.229> is<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.350> mix

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
for example playing 7 8 10 this is a mix

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.710 
for example playing 7 8 10 this is a mix
between<00:01:45.710> hammer-ons<00:01:46.399> and<00:01:46.490> pull-offs<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:47.090> of

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
between hammer-ons and pull-offs and of

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.850 
between hammer-ons and pull-offs and of
course<00:01:47.930> you<00:01:47.990> can<00:01:48.140> get<00:01:48.259> about<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.590> lot<00:01:48.710> more

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
course you can get about a lot more

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.529 
course you can get about a lot more
complicated<00:01:49.159> that<00:01:49.670> when<00:01:49.940> you<00:01:50.060> have<00:01:50.240> different

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
complicated that when you have different

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.990 
complicated that when you have different
combination<00:01:51.229> of<00:01:51.380> of<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:52.039> two<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:52.490> this<00:01:52.670> liquid

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
combination of of the two so this liquid

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.149 
combination of of the two so this liquid
never<00:01:53.149> played<00:01:53.330> today<00:01:53.710> let<00:01:54.710> me<00:01:54.770> play<00:01:55.039> this

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
never played today let me play this

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.039 
never played today let me play this
really<00:01:55.430> slow<00:01:55.549> for<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:55.970> once<00:01:56.210> with<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.689> tab

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
really slow for you once with the tab

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.990 
really slow for you once with the tab
and<00:01:57.320> then<00:01:57.799> we'll<00:01:57.979> get<00:01:58.100> into<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.670> little<00:01:58.700> more

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
and then we'll get into a little more

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:17.150 
and then we'll get into a little more
detail<00:01:59.330> on<00:01:59.420> it<00:01:59.479> all<00:01:59.689> right<00:01:59.840> here<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.679> goes

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.470 

okay<00:02:18.160> so<00:02:18.220> as<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.790> can<00:02:18.910> see<00:02:19.150> it's<00:02:19.360> an

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
okay so as you can see it's an

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.200 
okay so as you can see it's an
alternation<00:02:19.900> between<00:02:20.080> Freddy<00:02:20.650> notes<00:02:20.920> and

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
alternation between Freddy notes and

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.270 
alternation between Freddy notes and
open<00:02:22.210> string<00:02:22.480> G<00:02:23.610> all<00:02:24.610> right<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:26.950> so

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
open string G all right and this this so

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.030 
open string G all right and this this so
this<00:02:27.490> scale<00:02:28.390> is<00:02:28.660> actually<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.230> G<00:02:29.500> minor<00:02:29.710> scale

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
this scale is actually a G minor scale

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.470 
this scale is actually a G minor scale
but<00:02:30.280> because<00:02:30.520> we're<00:02:30.640> playing<00:02:30.820> on<00:02:30.970> top<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.270> C

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
but because we're playing on top of C

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.250 
but because we're playing on top of C
minor<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:32.290> becomes<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.770> seed<00:02:33.520> Orion<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.260> I'm

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
minor it becomes a seed Orion and I'm

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.370 
minor it becomes a seed Orion and I'm
not<00:02:35.410> sure<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:36.750> clear<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:38.050> all<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.200> you

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
not sure this is a clear to all of you

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.380 
not sure this is a clear to all of you
if<00:02:38.560> it's<00:02:38.770> if<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.100> is<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.400> great<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:39.850> if<00:02:40.180> not

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
if it's if it is that great and if not

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.210 
if it's if it is that great and if not
just<00:02:40.630> listen<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.230> sound<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.890> can<00:02:41.920> play

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
just listen to the sound you can play

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.670 
just listen to the sound you can play
this<00:02:42.340> rift<00:02:42.580> once<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.120> learn<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.330> on<00:02:43.690> top<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.530> a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
this rift once you learn it on top of a

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.950 
this rift once you learn it on top of a
G<00:02:44.830> minor<00:02:45.010> scale<00:02:45.400> or<00:02:45.580> chord<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.270> then<00:02:46.810> play

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
G minor scale or chord and then play

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.050 
G minor scale or chord and then play
again<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:47.470> top<00:02:47.710> of<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:47.860> semen<00:02:48.250> recorded<00:02:48.910> here

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
again on top of the semen recorded here

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.940 
again on top of the semen recorded here
a<00:02:49.120> lot<00:02:49.270> of<00:02:49.330> differences<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.260> difference

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
a lot of differences and the difference

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.830 
a lot of differences and the difference
is<00:02:51.070> only<00:02:51.250> in<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.730> harbor<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.330> created<00:02:52.750> by

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
is only in the harbor that is created by

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.980 
is only in the harbor that is created by
the<00:02:52.900> cord<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:53.920> this<00:02:54.730> is<00:02:54.790> actually<00:02:55.000> see<00:02:55.840> the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
the cord and so this is actually see the

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.960 
the cord and so this is actually see the
Dorian<00:02:56.350> now<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.190> other<00:02:57.310> thing<00:02:57.490> you<00:02:57.670> want<00:02:57.880> to

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
Dorian now the other thing you want to

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.190 
Dorian now the other thing you want to
might<00:02:58.240> want<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.540> check<00:02:58.750> out<00:02:58.900> is<00:02:58.960> the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
might want to check out is the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.920 
might want to check out is the
alternation<00:02:59.920> between<00:02:59.950> Freddy<00:03:00.730> nodes<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.270> the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
alternation between Freddy nodes and the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.710 
alternation between Freddy nodes and the
open<00:03:02.320> string<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.770> pedal<00:03:03.040> note<00:03:03.220> G<00:03:03.640> so<00:03:04.360> we're

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
open string the pedal note G so we're

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.660 
open string the pedal note G so we're
not<00:03:04.870> doing<00:03:05.110> this

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.860 

the<00:03:10.670> whole<00:03:10.820> time<00:03:11.030> because<00:03:11.540> then<00:03:11.690> it<00:03:11.780> gets

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
the whole time because then it gets

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.360 
the whole time because then it gets
really<00:03:12.110> predictable<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.890> there<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.250> no

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
really predictable and there is no

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.700 
really predictable and there is no
rhythm<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:13.820> you<00:03:14.060> still<00:03:14.270> get<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:15.620> know

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
rhythm to it you still get you know

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.140 
rhythm to it you still get you know
really<00:03:15.860> squared<00:03:17.200> rhythmic<00:03:18.550> value<00:03:19.550> to<00:03:19.730> it<00:03:19.880> and

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
really squared rhythmic value to it and

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.460 
really squared rhythmic value to it and
so<00:03:20.600> what<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:20.870> want<00:03:20.990> to<00:03:21.050> do<00:03:21.140> is<00:03:21.320> actually

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
so what you want to do is actually

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.580 
so what you want to do is actually
create<00:03:21.920> variations<00:03:22.910> by<00:03:23.750> using<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.320> pedal

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
create variations by using the pedal

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.260 
create variations by using the pedal
note<00:03:24.740> in<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:25.160> different<00:03:25.610> way<00:03:25.730> so<00:03:25.790> you<00:03:26.090> might

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
note in a different way so you might

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.620 
note in a different way so you might
have<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.450> melody<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:28.040> moves<00:03:28.630> sometimes

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
have the melody that moves sometimes

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.510 
have the melody that moves sometimes
alternating<00:03:30.470> one<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:30.830> one<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.190> then

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
alternating one and one and then

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.030 
alternating one and one and then
sometimes<00:03:31.910> playing<00:03:32.240> two<00:03:32.390> three<00:03:32.600> four<00:03:32.810> notes

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
sometimes playing two three four notes

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.400 
sometimes playing two three four notes
without<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.880> pedal<00:03:35.120> not<00:03:35.270> showing<00:03:35.540> up<00:03:35.630> alright

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
without the pedal not showing up alright

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.990 
without the pedal not showing up alright
so<00:03:36.590> let's<00:03:36.770> play<00:03:36.980> if<00:03:37.280> you<00:03:37.430> hear<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.760> slow

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
so let's play if you hear the slow

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.600 
so let's play if you hear the slow
version<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.390> I<00:03:38.510> play<00:03:38.660> before<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:40.190> don't

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
version that I play before you don't

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.860 
version that I play before you don't
really<00:03:40.730> notice<00:03:40.910> this<00:03:41.210> alternation<00:03:41.690> between

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
really notice this alternation between

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.440 
really notice this alternation between
open<00:03:42.410> string<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:42.860> Freddie<00:03:43.700> notes<00:03:43.940> because

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
open string and Freddie notes because

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.180 
open string and Freddie notes because
the<00:03:44.930> notes<00:03:45.140> of<00:03:45.260> play<00:03:45.410> so<00:03:45.590> slow<00:03:45.770> that<00:03:45.800> your<00:03:46.070> ear

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
the notes of play so slow that your ear

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.620 
the notes of play so slow that your ear
actually<00:03:46.610> registers<00:03:47.030> all<00:03:47.210> of<00:03:47.300> them<00:03:47.450> as

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
actually registers all of them as

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.020 
actually registers all of them as
separate<00:03:48.590> now<00:03:49.070> if<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:49.280> played<00:03:49.430> a<00:03:49.460> bit<00:03:49.670> faster

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
separate now if you played a bit faster

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.160 
separate now if you played a bit faster
which<00:03:50.180> is<00:03:50.300> actually<00:03:50.420> what<00:03:50.630> happens<00:03:50.990> on<00:03:51.050> the

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
which is actually what happens on the

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.660 
which is actually what happens on the
record<00:03:51.580> then<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:53.750> pedal<00:03:54.020> note<00:03:54.460> is<00:03:55.460> not

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
record then the pedal note is not

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.390 
record then the pedal note is not
actually<00:03:55.970> been<00:03:56.090> perceived<00:03:56.480> is<00:03:56.750> more<00:03:56.990> of<00:03:57.170> a

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
actually been perceived is more of a

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.790 
actually been perceived is more of a
kind<00:03:58.400> of<00:03:58.460> like<00:03:58.580> a<00:03:58.610> bass<00:03:58.850> line<00:03:59.410> that<00:04:00.410> of<00:04:00.650> course

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
kind of like a bass line that of course

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.880 
kind of like a bass line that of course
keep<00:04:01.070> steady<00:04:01.340> but<00:04:02.080> by<00:04:03.080> being<00:04:03.290> over<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.710> same

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
keep steady but by being over the same

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.830 
keep steady but by being over the same
know<00:04:04.070> it<00:04:04.220> creates<00:04:04.580> a<00:04:04.820> rhythmic<00:04:05.360> variation

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
know it creates a rhythmic variation

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.290 
know it creates a rhythmic variation
depending<00:04:05.960> on<00:04:06.290> how<00:04:06.410> many<00:04:06.470> notes<00:04:06.890> you<00:04:07.250> Fred<00:04:07.550> at

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
depending on how many notes you Fred at

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.330 
depending on how many notes you Fred at
the<00:04:08.420> same<00:04:08.600> time<00:04:08.750> so<00:04:08.930> you<00:04:08.990> can<00:04:09.140> have<00:04:09.230> 1<00:04:09.500> 1<00:04:09.770> 1<00:04:10.070> and

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
the same time so you can have 1 1 1 and

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.750 
the same time so you can have 1 1 1 and
3<00:04:10.580> or<00:04:10.790> 1<00:04:11.120> 12<00:04:11.630> 13<00:04:12.350> and<00:04:12.620> it<00:04:13.220> creates<00:04:13.550> movement

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
3 or 1 12 13 and it creates movement

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.240 
3 or 1 12 13 and it creates movement
where<00:04:14.480> whereas<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.410> rhythm<00:04:15.740> if<00:04:15.890> you<00:04:16.100> actually

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
where whereas the rhythm if you actually

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.860 
where whereas the rhythm if you actually
write<00:04:16.549> this<00:04:16.640> on<00:04:16.820> paper<00:04:17.030> then<00:04:17.660> you'll<00:04:17.810> have

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
write this on paper then you'll have

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.650 
write this on paper then you'll have
just<00:04:18.530> 16<00:04:19.130> notes<00:04:19.340> all<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.390> way<00:04:20.480> through

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
just 16 notes all the way through

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.540 
just 16 notes all the way through
alright<00:04:21.320> so<00:04:21.440> let<00:04:21.560> me<00:04:21.620> play<00:04:21.770> again<00:04:22.070> just<00:04:22.460> a

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
alright so let me play again just a

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.890 
alright so let me play again just a
little<00:04:22.760> bit<00:04:22.880> faster<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:25.660> that<00:04:26.660> way<00:04:26.750> you'll

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
little bit faster and that way you'll

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.380 
little bit faster and that way you'll
see<00:04:27.080> if<00:04:27.320> you<00:04:27.740> can<00:04:27.890> figure<00:04:28.040> out<00:04:28.300> where<00:04:29.300> the

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
see if you can figure out where the

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.000 
see if you can figure out where the
pedal<00:04:29.630> notes<00:04:29.810> are<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.260> what<00:04:30.620> effect<00:04:30.890> they

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
pedal notes are and what effect they

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:40.320 
pedal notes are and what effect they
have<00:04:31.040> all<00:04:31.400> right<00:04:31.550> here<00:04:32.000> goes

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.249 

right<00:04:41.330> so<00:04:41.539> you<00:04:41.629> should<00:04:41.659> actually<00:04:41.990> have

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
right so you should actually have

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:43.869 
right so you should actually have
noticed<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.680> lot<00:04:42.830> more<00:04:42.979> rhythm<00:04:43.190> in<00:04:43.400> this<00:04:43.550> and

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:43.879 
noticed a lot more rhythm in this and

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.140 
noticed a lot more rhythm in this and
the<00:04:44.720> last<00:04:44.840> thing<00:04:45.199> you<00:04:45.319> want<00:04:45.500> to<00:04:45.530> check<00:04:45.590> out<00:04:45.830> is

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
the last thing you want to check out is

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.800 
the last thing you want to check out is
the<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:49.460> effect<00:04:49.759> that<00:04:49.819> it<00:04:49.909> has<00:04:50.000> depending<00:04:50.720> on

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
the the effect that it has depending on

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.779 
the the effect that it has depending on
what<00:04:50.960> court<00:04:51.289> you<00:04:51.409> play<00:04:51.590> on<00:04:51.710> top<00:04:51.949> of<00:04:52.099> it<00:04:52.190> or

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
what court you play on top of it or

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.570 
what court you play on top of it or
underneath<00:04:53.150> it<00:04:53.449> so<00:04:54.159> right<00:04:55.159> now<00:04:55.190> I'm<00:04:55.400> going<00:04:55.520> to

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
underneath it so right now I'm going to

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.890 
underneath it so right now I'm going to
play<00:04:55.699> with<00:04:55.909> the<00:04:56.090> rhythm<00:04:56.240> tracks<00:04:56.569> from<00:04:56.720> the

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
play with the rhythm tracks from the

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.980 
play with the rhythm tracks from the
record<00:04:57.259> and<00:04:57.440> you<00:04:58.250> should<00:04:58.460> hear<00:04:59.090> a<00:04:59.360> different

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
record and you should hear a different

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.670 
record and you should hear a different
kind<00:05:00.139> of<00:05:00.199> flavor<00:05:00.409> because<00:05:00.650> when<00:05:01.069> we<00:05:01.159> do<00:05:01.310> it

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
kind of flavor because when we do it

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.950 
kind of flavor because when we do it
without<00:05:03.680> any<00:05:03.979> rhythm<00:05:04.220> tracks<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:05.270> your<00:05:05.780> ear

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
without any rhythm tracks you your ear

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.980 
without any rhythm tracks you your ear
actually<00:05:06.379> registers<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:07.009> open<00:05:07.340> string<00:05:07.610> as

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
actually registers the open string as

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.779 
actually registers the open string as
the<00:05:08.990> tonality<00:05:09.500> but<00:05:09.770> it's<00:05:09.919> not<00:05:09.949> this<00:05:10.580> is<00:05:10.639> not<00:05:10.729> a

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789
