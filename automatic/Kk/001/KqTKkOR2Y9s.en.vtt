on<00:02:14.140> my<00:02:14.739> server<00:02:15.040> they<00:02:15.340> go<00:02:15.489> for<00:02:15.690> 125<00:02:16.690> gold<00:02:17.019> curve

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
on my server they go for 125 gold curve

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.979 
on my server they go for 125 gold curve
carnelians<00:02:18.640> on<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.849> other<00:02:18.970> hand<00:02:19.120> go<00:02:19.360> for<00:02:19.569> 15
