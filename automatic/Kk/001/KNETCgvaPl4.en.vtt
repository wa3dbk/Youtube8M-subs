00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.230 
unfortunately which was that the session
in<00:01:50.280> Denver<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.550> hurt<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> most

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
in Denver that hurt the most

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.270 
in Denver that hurt the most
it<00:01:51.420> was<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.690> a<00:01:51.780> session<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.280> conditioning

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
it was just a session of conditioning

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.310 
it was just a session of conditioning
mixtures<00:01:53.640> we<00:01:53.729> think<00:01:53.910> the<00:01:53.970> altitude<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
mixtures we think the altitude and the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.109 
mixtures we think the altitude and the
heat<00:01:57.350> came<00:01:58.350> through<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.800> so<00:01:59.369> I've<00:01:59.700> got<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.910> stick

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
heat came through it so I've got a stick

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.550 
heat came through it so I've got a stick
with<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.330> no<00:02:00.360> helmet<00:02:00.869> have<00:02:00.990> they<00:02:01.110> looked<00:02:01.380> after

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
with it no helmet have they looked after

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.840 
with it no helmet have they looked after
you<00:02:01.710> sort<00:02:01.830> of<00:02:01.890> mentally<00:02:02.310> as<00:02:02.399> well<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.820> you

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
you sort of mentally as well have you

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.070 
you sort of mentally as well have you
have<00:02:03.120> you<00:02:03.240> got<00:02:03.390> away<00:02:03.659> from<00:02:03.720> rugby

particularly<00:02:04.590> out<00:02:04.650> in<00:02:04.799> Denver<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.400> think<00:02:05.729> that

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
particularly out in Denver I think that

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.580 
particularly out in Denver I think that
get<00:02:06.270> into<00:02:06.510> Denver<00:02:06.780> was<00:02:06.900> it<00:02:07.020> was<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> good<00:02:07.409> thing

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
get into Denver was it was a good thing

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.800 
get into Denver was it was a good thing
being<00:02:08.190> away<00:02:08.429> with<00:02:08.640> know<00:02:09.600> where<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
being away with know where the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.960 
being away with know where the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
commitments X except would be and the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.729 
commitments X except would be and the
chill-out<00:02:12.239> time<00:02:12.330> we<00:02:12.660> had<00:02:12.780> there<00:02:12.989> was<00:02:13.440> good<00:02:13.590> for

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
chill-out time we had there was good for

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.320
