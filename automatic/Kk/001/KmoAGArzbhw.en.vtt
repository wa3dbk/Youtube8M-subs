 consolidate the future of our countries 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.140
 in Latin America this ability sr 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.570
 specific in intimate clothing allows the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.600
 student learn everything you have to 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.420
 see with industrial employer that 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.480
 pattern design has to do with how 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.940
 we elaborate how we get the molds in 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.800
 intimate female clothes so that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.769
 we teach for example how it is built 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.460
 I can build a children's game 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:05.150
 in two ways or on measures taking 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.090
 specific measures to the client 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.880
 or with industrial sizes why is it so 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.440
 important to learn to master about 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.680
 measures because it is that not all my 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.940
 clients have anatomical proportions 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.340
 standard then ladies with a lot 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.800
 belly there are ladies with little tail there 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.010
 Ladies with a lot of hips and in each case 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.770
 If I want to customize that product 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.260
 I want to customize the mantel I can 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.700
 Take my client's measurements and do 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.469
 the boss 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.560
 then in the course we teach how 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:39.049
 build the back front mold of 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.390
 the crotch and from that mold 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.329
 basic how to start playing with the 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.649
 design and how to make variations so that 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.140
 you learn how to make a silk 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.240
 dental a floss how can you 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.000
 make a party with lace with strips of 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.920
 way that the possibilities when one 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.399
 know the techniques of pattern design are 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.710
 While listening to endless limits 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.719
 is going to put his creativity because it is 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.840
 the one who knows how to make the molds has the 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:08.599
 able to offer their clients of 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.329
 offer the market different things 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.250
 Novelties in each season 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.890
 then we teach everything that is the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.200
 part of bread pattern also 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.849
 we teach to thunder the bra 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.709
 brasier is a spectacular thing because 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.810
 everyone a single bra and all the 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.910
 world imagines that the brassiere is very 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.739
 complicated and we see the cups and we 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.180
 we imagine that it is difficult that that 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.159
 only large factories do it 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.170
 in our course we teach how to 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.359
 they make the three basic cups of a 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.450
 chair and how from those glasses 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:41.790
 horizontal or mixed verticals we can 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.840
 find any design normally 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.840
 We have seen 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.720
 non-industrial empirical spaces that 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.810
 people work with tweezers and with the 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.970
 dressed and makes him clamps but 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.709
 unfortunately that process does not achieve 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.870
 the expected results and 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.210
 results that the end customer expects 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.400
 in adjustment and in damage 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.740
 then we will teach how to 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.930
 build a vertical cup which are 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.460
 the measures to make those glasses a 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.500
 horizontal cup to make a strapless 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.420
 and from that you have the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.060
 basic you can find any model 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.160
 let's teach you stop if you're like 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.110
 makes the outline of the bra that is 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.960
 where is going to the cup how to 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.570
 how it builds back handled and 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.030
 from that we will teach how to do 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.500
 including a pleasure about means I 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.690
 I can make my client funny 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.640
 about measures taking two measures that 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.860
 I'm going to advance one is called the 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.590
 nipple height and another is called the 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.020
 submammary contour with those two measures 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.730
 and with the right techniques not 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.950
 they build any type of bra 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.320
 even if I want to make a bra 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.660
 detail in something I can do if I 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.910
 I want to make the molds for a bra 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.550
 with a scheduled cup that are those 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.710
 styles where you do not notice 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.680
 the cut what comes completely 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.870
 lined up so I apologize we're 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.800
 oriented and focused to that people 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.319
 learn pattern design area 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.359
 panties vibrations 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.120
 also the speech we teach to climb 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.829
 how to make the increments from 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.989
 the basic size for you to get 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.939
 a skate in any size so that 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.880
 get a pleasure in any size and 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:21.729
 let's teach listen to me how it is 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.180
 that the subject of the 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:28.210
 Sizing in letters and numbers always 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.000
 we've heard about the 32 ve of the 30 and 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.650
 12 but you talk to any 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.419
 small intimate clothing manufacturer and not 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.000
 They know how to handle the subject because all the 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.120
 world sells or 32 or 34 but we do not manage 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.880
 the letters internationally the sizing 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.940
 of a bra is expressed with two 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.710
 units one that is the number that is the 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.199
 number tells me about the back of the 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.570
 client and another one that is a letter that I 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.400
 talk about the customer's glass we're going to 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:59.680
 teach to climb for you to learn 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.930
 they took out 32 a 32 b 32 c 32 d and learn 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.880
 to even handle double compass w 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.889
 we teach that in the process of 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.330
 climbing in the course we're also going to 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.970
 teach 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.370
 garments of the engineers that we guide 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.280
 the whole process we will teach how to 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.919
 manufactures a bra with base a bra 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.680
 without base a brazil of cup programmed 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.590
 a floss attached by a dental floss 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.569
 and all the most sensational of all this 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.419
 is that everything is taught listen to me well 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:30.659
 with familiar machines your machine 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.639
 family is one way because it is that 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:35.379
 placing the right needle by placing 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.050
 allegri what is appropriate and you have the 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:41.199
 possibility of manufacturing any garment 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.360
 listen well with the same quality and with 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.340
 the same industrial finishes of 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.860
 way then we wait for you in 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.620
