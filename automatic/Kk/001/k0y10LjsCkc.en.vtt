a look at a lot of my videos I had at

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.649 
a look at a lot of my videos I had at
least<00:01:49.500> about<00:01:49.860> almost<00:01:50.520> 100<00:01:50.880> videos<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.329> record

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
least about almost 100 videos I record

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.020 
least about almost 100 videos I record
it<00:01:51.750> using<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.079> kodak<00:01:52.439> zi8<00:01:52.920> camera<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:54.000> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
it using the kodak zi8 camera and it's a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.060 
it using the kodak zi8 camera and it's a
great<00:01:54.329> camera<00:01:54.630> because<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.350> records<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.920> high

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
great camera because it records in high

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.130 
great camera because it records in high
definition<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.180> video<00:01:57.479> files<00:01:57.719> are<00:01:57.930> quite

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
definition and the video files are quite

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.889 
definition and the video files are quite
small<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.710> comparison<00:01:59.180> so<00:02:00.180> that's<00:02:00.509> that's

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
small in comparison so that's that's

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.510 
small in comparison so that's that's
what<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.170> would<00:02:01.380> recommend<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.950> know<00:02:02.250> there's<00:02:02.460> a
