00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
finish a little bit further down the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.630 
finish a little bit further down the
tail<00:03:24.600> down<00:03:24.840> didn't<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.260> yeah<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> time<00:03:26.220> it's

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
tail down didn't you yeah a time it's

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.820 
tail down didn't you yeah a time it's
just<00:03:27.000> all<00:03:27.150> those<00:03:27.540> tests<00:03:28.020> i<00:03:28.080> mean<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.380> way

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
just all those tests i mean the the way

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.980 
just all those tests i mean the the way
the<00:03:29.250> conditions<00:03:29.730> were<00:03:29.820> everything<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.690> doubt

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
the conditions were everything to doubt

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.260 
the conditions were everything to doubt
pretty<00:03:31.200> badly<00:03:31.440> i<00:03:31.590> think<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.970> could<00:03:33.120> get<00:03:33.240> a

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
pretty badly i think and you could get a

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.510 
pretty badly i think and you could get a
clean<00:03:33.510> run<00:03:33.690> chill<00:03:33.960> or<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.890> know<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.250> didn't

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
clean run chill or you know you didn't

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.310 
clean run chill or you know you didn't
was<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:36.210> dusty<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:36.930> know<00:03:37.020> if<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.170> did

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
was that dusty and you know if you did

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.260 
was that dusty and you know if you did
catch<00:03:37.530> riders<00:03:37.950> or<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.760> know<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:38.910> could<00:03:39.030> throw

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
catch riders or you know you could throw

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.450 
catch riders or you know you could throw
it<00:03:39.420> away<00:03:39.510> pretty<00:03:39.930> easily<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:40.320> when<00:03:41.130> everyone

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
it away pretty easily so when everyone

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.580 
it away pretty easily so when everyone
did<00:03:41.610> well<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.910> hang<00:03:42.300> on<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.600> it<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:42.750> hollister

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
then pretty consistent it didn't really

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.350 
then pretty consistent it didn't really
achieve<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.520> goals<00:06:11.700> I<00:06:11.820> wanted<00:06:11.970> to<00:06:12.150> I<00:06:12.180> was

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
achieve the goals I wanted to I was

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.390 
achieve the goals I wanted to I was
hoping<00:06:12.570> for<00:06:12.630> a<00:06:13.050> top<00:06:13.350> five<00:06:13.500> in<00:06:13.740> class<00:06:13.950> was<00:06:14.220> just

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
hoping for a top five in class was just

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.850 
hoping for a top five in class was just
off<00:06:14.520> that<00:06:14.550> but<00:06:15.060> I'm<00:06:15.620> outrider<00:06:16.620> would<00:06:16.770> have

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
off that but I'm outrider would have

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.110 
off that but I'm outrider would have
liked<00:06:16.950> to<00:06:16.979> be<00:06:17.160> a<00:06:17.190> bit<00:06:17.340> higher<00:06:17.490> but<00:06:17.790> you<00:06:18.030> know

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
liked to be a bit higher but you know

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.000 
liked to be a bit higher but you know
14th<00:06:18.960> probably<00:06:19.350> isn't<00:06:19.500> too<00:06:19.590> bad<00:06:19.740> with<00:06:19.919> the

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
14th probably isn't too bad with the

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.969 
14th probably isn't too bad with the
field<00:06:20.220> we<00:06:20.370> had<00:06:20.520> so<00:06:20.930> yeah<00:06:21.930> just<00:06:22.140> try<00:06:22.710> and<00:06:22.770> carry

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
field we had so yeah just try and carry

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:24.219 
field we had so yeah just try and carry
it<00:06:23.040> on<00:06:23.100> into<00:06:23.250> the<00:06:23.460> national<00:06:23.820> with<00:06:23.910> an<00:06:24.030> arm

it on into the national with an arm

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:26.630 
it on into the national with an arm
hopefully<00:06:25.229> pick<00:06:25.380> up<00:06:25.530> a<00:06:25.620> bit<00:06:25.740> of<00:06:25.830> speed<00:06:26.010> and<00:06:26.220> get

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
hopefully pick up a bit of speed and get

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.430 
hopefully pick up a bit of speed and get
towards<00:06:27.030> the<00:06:27.090> front<00:06:27.270> oh<00:06:27.450> yeah<00:06:27.960> well<00:06:28.290> I'd

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229 
know but it felt good to finish on a

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:57.320 
know but it felt good to finish on a
good<00:06:55.440> note<00:06:55.620> finish<00:06:56.190> strong<00:06:56.370> like<00:06:56.639> that<00:06:56.820> it

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
good note finish strong like that it

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.540 
good note finish strong like that it
wasn't<00:06:57.900> so<00:06:58.050> much<00:06:58.080> joel<00:06:58.650> it<00:06:58.949> was<00:06:59.070> the<00:06:59.190> fact<00:06:59.430> that

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
wasn't so much joel it was the fact that

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.450 
wasn't so much joel it was the fact that
last<00:06:59.850> year<00:07:00.090> I<00:07:00.210> had<00:07:00.389> David<00:07:00.960> Knight<00:07:01.250> behind<00:07:02.250> me

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
last year I had David Knight behind me

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.700 
last year I had David Knight behind me
exactly<00:07:03.330> the<00:07:03.389> same<00:07:03.570> sort<00:07:03.840> of<00:07:03.900> situation<00:07:04.020> and

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
exactly the same sort of situation and

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.310 
exactly the same sort of situation and
and<00:07:04.919> I<00:07:05.580> threw<00:07:05.760> it<00:07:05.850> away<00:07:05.940> so<00:07:06.449> that<00:07:06.479> was<00:07:06.990> running

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.320 
and I threw it away so that was running

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.200 
and I threw it away so that was running
through<00:07:07.470> my<00:07:07.590> mind<00:07:07.770> more<00:07:08.070> than<00:07:08.130> anything<00:07:08.490> but

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
through my mind more than anything but

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.600 
through my mind more than anything but
