00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
so as you can see really nice pages I

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.850 
so as you can see really nice pages I
would<00:01:15.150> probably<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> next<00:01:16.229> book<00:01:16.560> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
would probably do the next book and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.740 
would probably do the next book and
portrait<00:01:17.700> style<00:01:17.909> rather<00:01:18.330> than<00:01:18.540> landscape

portrait style rather than landscape

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.690 
portrait style rather than landscape
because<00:01:19.590> it'll<00:01:19.830> be<00:01:19.920> easier<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.369> keep<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
plan on making many more because this

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.670 
plan on making many more because this
