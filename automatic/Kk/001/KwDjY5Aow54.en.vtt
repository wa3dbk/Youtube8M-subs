00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 i will be added guys and welcome in 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.540
 this nov in which we will talk about the last ones 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.849
 news regarding apple and the 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.929
 his world placed the jailbreak of the last 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.610
 week 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:18.029
 let's start with the most interesting topic 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:21.119
 both the jailbreak pod2g maybe the most 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.390
 famous hacker has always updated i 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.500
 his primary phone to s7 this 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.519
 tweets and also this one on tweets 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.279
 confirm that hackers do not 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.100
 will work on ios 6.1 jailbreak 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.430
 point 3 or 6 point 1.4 but will pass 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.340
 directly to ios 7.0 this why 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.789
 as they say their yes yes they are 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.930
 waiting for more and more 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.640
 release would be ios set indeed not 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.590
 it would make sense to waste time and resources 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.800
 on a minor update which it can 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.280
 be the 6.1 point when you can go 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.430
 directly different then 7.0 first 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.170
 that apple does not release the version 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.320
 ios 7 final and the iphone 5 not there 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.290
 they will be untethered jailbreak so yes 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.590
 thinks that they will succeed 7 or 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.000
 September or October and the iPhone 5 s 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.640
 he also thinks of himself in September 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.770
 a news that always about the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.790
 jailbreak but a bit different branch 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.369
 posixninja describe as a crap 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.470
 indeed the latter disappointed us 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.290
 failing to perform the jailbreak 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.570
 iphone 4 tethered soy the 67th goal 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.970
 remember that arezzo has one 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.740
 particular property for which it should 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.829
 be able to gil the tea so 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.990
 all iphone 4 iphone 3gs thread on 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.020
 any posixninja firmware version 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.690
 he therefore declared that he has been for some time 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.810
 at work on a tour 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.970
 based on the bootrom jailbreak for those who don't 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.800
 knew the bootrom jailbreak is a 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.050
 particular type of jailbreak for 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.390
 example the one used by king snow that 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.340
 it only builds explore hardware that apple 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.800
 can not correct with a simple 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.110
 software update in fact for 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.130
 remove hardware bugs should 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.530
 release a man device thanks to 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.260
 hardware box the tethered jailbreak his 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.950
 the device will always be possible 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.190
 regardless of the version 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.290
 software is in fact always rejected 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.410
 to block any version of ios on 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.930
 iphone 4 and 3gs ipod touch 4 which indeed 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.500
 are those devices with a bug 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.450
 a2 called line wayne discovered in 2010 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.980
 from the cage ott 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.530
 however, there is a problem with the devices 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.390
 suffering from the wayne bug line are old 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.230
 they are so old that three of them 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.690
 the ipad 1 the iphone 3gs and ipod touch of 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.460
 fourth generation but not even received 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.550
 the update to ios set 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.020
 the iPhone 5 all new devices 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.000
 therefore they were never effects from 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.430
 hardware bug or at least no one has any 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.320
 never discovered one and therefore the era of rhine 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.690
 and the gb reboot is not practically 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.880
 unfortunately apparently over 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.950
 posixninja is on its way to 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.870
 find a new hardware bug not 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.150
 we know about which anti devices 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.420
 Semites and months ago he had declared the 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.380
 devices from the processor a5 up 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.209
 then iphone 4s 5 ipad 432 mini and ipod 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.120
 touch 5 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.820
 we just have to wait and see what 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.769
 pull out the famous hacker every hour 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.050
 we are sure that before releasing the 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.269
 untethered jailbreak that I will remember 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.130
 only his seventeen hackers 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.500
 will wait for the final version of 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.350
 the latter therefore had 7 which 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.739
 release is scheduled for October and also the 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.420
 release precisely of the new iphone 5 sa 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.550
 judge by how hackers talk 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.280
 spies are well advanced with theirs 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.500
 new untethered jailbreak 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.050
 then summarizing the ongoing projects 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.260
 two are the untethered jailbreak of s 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.930
 7 for all the devices that it seems 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.450
 be well advanced but will not come 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.280
 released before ios and 7 alpha e 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.700
 iphone 5s 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.190
 and then the second project is the new one 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.230
 posixninja tool of which no one knows 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.660
 almost nothing except that will allow the 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.060
 jailbreak butron tete net about all 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.560
 supported devices that is all 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.200
 those that will present the hardware bug 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.880
 discovered by posixninja independently 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.340
 from the diary version alles that mount 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.160
 so if for example one of these 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.900
 devices will be any iPhone 5 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.190
 version will release for the iPhone 5 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.340
 also had 7.1 and 7.2 already will be immediately 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.380
 available tethered jailbreak well 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.650
 let's move on to another kind of novelty 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.860
 let's pass the rumors new confirmations for 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.570
 the iPhone 5 will be presented in September 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.290
 in gold version and with the recognition 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.140
 additionally fingerprints apple is a 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.850
 good point with the development of the iphone 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.150
 economic and even this is thought to come 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.990
 presented in September in more colors 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.720
 also it is then to work on an iphone from 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.669
 4.7 inches and a 5.7-inch iphone 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.890
 then two tablets 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.600
 I just hope that the present more 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.340
 soon because it would be really beautiful 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.900
 breakthrough on ios 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.730
 finally I remind you that it was released 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.710
 now the first beta for a week now 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.810
