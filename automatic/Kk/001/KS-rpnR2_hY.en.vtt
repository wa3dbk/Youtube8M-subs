00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:52.100

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:54.709
 of the series signed ings schools we open 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:54.709
 what's inside this case looks like a 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.780
 matters 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:13.380
 let's leave it here we have inside 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.450

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.100
 now to not spoil someone who 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.780
 maybe he wants to take it I can see 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:31.400
 only the first page the second one 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:36.330
 small page the third page and then 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.970
 the last page and the penultimate page 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:45.440
 and that's it 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.440

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:07.140
 there is not much in the center of the map 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:22.980
 more space like fucking right time but 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:26.490
 I am here also here is the code is 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.800
 finally the game obviously in between 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:34.550
 the other is something I hate about slots 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.550

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.639

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:25.010
 the booklet is said this by removing a 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:25.010
 you codes other codes from how many codes 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.920
 historical days okay goal but me 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.540

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:53.180
 already seen some anticipated gameplay 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:58.010

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:00.680
 really cute 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.260
