00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
going to try putting in these

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.030 
going to try putting in these
ingredients<00:01:12.600> see<00:01:13.200> what<00:01:13.350> happens<00:01:13.710> all<00:01:13.979> right

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040

start<00:01:15.030> off<00:01:15.229> one<00:01:16.229> banana

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.790 

put<00:01:23.410> it<00:01:23.530> two<00:01:23.740> bananas<00:01:25.350> went<00:01:26.350> in<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.560> second

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
put it two bananas went in a second

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.470 
put it two bananas went in a second
let's<00:01:29.800> see<00:01:30.070> I<00:01:30.340> think<00:01:30.550> we<00:01:30.850> should<00:01:31.060> probably<00:01:31.150> put

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
let's see I think we should probably put

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:39.480 
let's see I think we should probably put
in<00:01:31.570> some<00:01:31.690> ice<00:01:31.870> water<00:01:31.990> actually<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:39.280> just<00:01:39.310> need

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
in some ice water actually you just need

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.890 
in some ice water actually you just need
a<00:01:39.610> little<00:01:39.700> bit<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:39.940> water<00:01:40.180> because<00:01:40.600> we<00:01:40.720> don't

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
a little bit of water because we don't

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.390 
a little bit of water because we don't
want<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.080> be<00:01:41.260> completely<00:01:41.830> mush<00:01:43.590> okay<00:01:44.590> so<00:01:45.220> that

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
want to be completely mush okay so that

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.380 
want to be completely mush okay so that
was<00:01:45.490> like<00:01:45.670> a<00:01:45.970> cup<00:01:46.930> of<00:01:47.110> water<00:01:47.380> nice<00:01:48.030> now<00:01:49.030> instead

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
was like a cup of water nice now instead

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.640 
was like a cup of water nice now instead
of<00:01:49.450> putting<00:01:49.600> in<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.870> kilian<00:01:50.080> last<00:01:50.440> we're

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
of putting in the kilian last we're

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.310 
of putting in the kilian last we're
going<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.830> put<00:01:51.010> it<00:01:51.100> in<00:01:51.330> second<00:01:52.330> because<00:01:52.510> I<00:01:52.990> know

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
going to put it in second because I know

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.510 
going to put it in second because I know
from<00:01:53.470> prior<00:01:53.680> experience<00:01:53.740> that<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.340> longer

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
from prior experience that the longer

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.010 
from prior experience that the longer
you<00:01:54.730> blend<00:01:55.150> an<00:01:55.450> avocado<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.920> less<00:01:58.020> drinkable

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
you blend an avocado the less drinkable

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.320 
you blend an avocado the less drinkable
it<00:01:59.140> gets<00:01:59.290> in<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.530> more<00:01:59.710> kind<00:02:00.400> of<00:02:00.550> solid<00:02:01.090> I

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
it gets in the more kind of solid I

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:13.680
