00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
a silicon pad and then with a rolling

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.240 
a silicon pad and then with a rolling
technique<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.750> teach<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.320> she<00:00:55.890> creates

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250

it's shaped like a football is what

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.569 
it's shaped like a football is what
protects<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.530> from<00:01:01.559> shampooing<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
protects it from shampooing and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.119 
protects it from shampooing and
conditioning<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> that's<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.500> bottom<00:01:04.890> row

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
conditioning so that's the bottom row

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.910

which<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.880> scattered<00:01:06.420> then<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.710> row

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
which is in a scattered then the row

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.000 
which is in a scattered then the row
above<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.490> which<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.820> just<00:01:09.060> above<00:01:09.479> her<00:01:10.290> ear<00:01:10.799> and
