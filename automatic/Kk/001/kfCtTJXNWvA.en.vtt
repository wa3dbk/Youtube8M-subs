00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.620
 Hello my name is Armen Zealand 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.030
 Instructor of the Moscow Academy of Parkour 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.299
 Today we present to your attention 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.930
 second part of the tutorial on doing one 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.300
 these k clip technique again a lot 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.110
 so the tuturial will be slightly sure 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.119
 ragged than I can not explain 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.980
 some details are all here format and 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.149
 time allocated for video lesson 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.629
 some highlights necessarily 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.550
 tell you need to try to rotate in 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.980
 one plane ie without strong 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.089
 biases first such habit 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.539
 allow you to do 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:45.109
 one and even these powerful ears from the spot 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.050
 Secondly 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.969
 the load will not be horizontal of you 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.789
 will not cover everybody that he does not 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.579
 demolish the side and this text will turn out 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.149
 these techniques 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.239
 more secure the third option is when 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.509
 we do la ment 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:08.740
 stream tab this may be true 

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:12.130
 for example when you make that 8th place 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.330
 or suppose to mow for this to you 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:19.930
 you need to choose a color and throw the body forward 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.280
 at the expense of so air change position 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:28.020
 hands and go back to such as 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.020
 for example you are in the word nick 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.990
 it is very important not to forget to strip during 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.660
 runtime items 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.750
 it is not only 180 it is about 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.420
 All elements are very important to remember 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.420
 that element is performed on water it 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.230
 save power and save energy 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.790
 will allow you longer and all move 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.800
 the next element to which and 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:02.320
 180 through a massive foot movement 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.750
 what is the inertial element which 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.940
 allows with minimal effort 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:12.880
 make a transition to click for this if 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.480
 you do it clockwise then 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.970
 preferably left hand straight 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.220
 normal straight grip immediately put 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.220
 rite is an example 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.150
 if you do the other way 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:36.210
 look at the fences right hand 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.730
 usually straight park left 2 situations 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.010
 when you find yourself back 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.480
 obstacles or the sides prevents 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.610
 this situation 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.200
 so as not to waste time not to turn 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.150
 still do n't do any other 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.390
 elements it makes sense to work out the technique 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.900
 transition 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.790
 Kotlin through reverse speed let's say you 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.250
 did roll or just landed 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.500
 stenochku does not matter about the author and perilki 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.860
 want to immediately go there 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.860
 This situation makes sense 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.370
 and the most effective dispensers I ask 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:22.470
 this is a reverse network that is you 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:26.440
 need to put your foot on the burner to carry 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.140
 another and go to the hotel 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.710
 then gradually work out your 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.960
 movements 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.330
 which will allow you again when 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.950
 minimum burst up efficiently 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.890
 go back again like this 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.950
 does not look back or sideways 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.980
 obstacles expose hand jump out 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:49.840
 due to push ry blocks and mach 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:54.370
 another depending on the situation is possible 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.050
 will be assembled sometimes perform 108 through 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.940
 forgiveness guess. 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.040
 while there are two main techniques 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.520
 walk as far as you need 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.520
 meet 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.690
 equipment 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.690
 Russia circulation through the fifth so 1 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.510
 if people look mysteriously nothing 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.510
 fifth point on 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.990
 that blind we do not complete a turn in 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.180
 one side and then not a full turn for 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.870
 another one or we do a full turn here 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:40.259
 This technique of performing valente through not 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.659
 full 360 degree rotation i.e. 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:46.830
 we begin as if we will do 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:49.020
 element 350 but do twist 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.300
 go to the boiler accordingly 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.780
 palm setting such as 360 you 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.569
 jump so much 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:01.849
 swept about him staging hands back 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:01.849
 bass indicate the direction of rotation 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.000
 in another efficient and fast way 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.639
 fulfillment 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.120
 180 is jumping over 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.340
 obstacles with a turn did rest 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.830
 grabbing the railing or 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.009
 the walls and the transition to the track like this 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.009
 looks like 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.930
 what is needed for this 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.449
 it needs a lot 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.310
 clarity sharpened on what you want 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.889
 make that last moment not 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.770
 change your mind understand what you exactly 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.990
 jump up for or under the couch 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.780
 in 3 5 not for jumping not for 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.699
 something else about jumping while in 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.840
 a certain phase of the legs will go away 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:56.440
 style and you should understand that 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.509
 grab stitching 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:03.729
 you can only on the flight point version 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:05.560
 and so the main points when doing 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.560
 quality you need to remember that 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.410
 a strong horizontal date offset and 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.930
 offsets left or right excessively 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.380
 loaded with arms and lead to the risk among 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.030
 breakdown 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:21.759
 it is firstly secondly performing vanity 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:24.160
 any call try to carry it out 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:26.530
 through a vertical friend that is with 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.220
 jumping up if you need 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:32.259
 horizontal speed then she can 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.930
 be received either by 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:37.090
 initial run escape as far as you 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.300
 Prague either by small traffic 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.810
 hands like romance or on a computer always 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.570
 try to 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:46.240
 amortize landing ie 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:49.750
 squat you touched your feet 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.699
 edges or walls and try smoothly 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.940
 slows down squat have 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:56.880
 in view of the fact that at that moment when the leg 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.460
 bends more than 90 degrees 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.530
 maximum load should already be removed 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.599
 otherwise there is a risk of damage to the joints. 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:07.240
 I hope this tutorial will help you 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:09.250
 learn to perform small perform 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.180
 him effectively and safely see you on 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.180
 workout beat
