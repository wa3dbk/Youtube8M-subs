00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
handout is taken the first eight bars or

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.200 
handout is taken the first eight bars or
so<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.860> what<00:01:38.040> Brahms<00:01:38.340> wrote<00:01:38.520> which<00:01:39.090> is

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
so of what Brahms wrote which is

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.390 
so of what Brahms wrote which is
beautiful<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.930> then<00:01:40.439> I've<00:01:40.560> rewritten<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.280> in

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
beautiful and then I've rewritten it in

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.609 
beautiful and then I've rewritten it in
the<00:01:41.520> second<00:01:41.880> line<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.270> put<00:01:42.689> everything<00:01:42.960> more

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the second line to put everything more

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.920 
the second line to put everything more
or<00:01:43.680> less<00:01:44.009> into<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:44.909> octave<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.689> kind<00:01:45.869> of

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
or less into one octave it's kind of

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.260 
or less into one octave it's kind of
evening<00:01:46.470> out<00:01:46.560> those<00:01:46.799> leaps<00:01:47.159> now<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.090> won't

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
evening out those leaps now this won't

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.060 
evening out those leaps now this won't
sound<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:48.869> beautiful<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.409> what<00:01:49.590> Brahms<00:01:49.860> wrote

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
sound as beautiful as what Brahms wrote

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.490 
sound as beautiful as what Brahms wrote
but<00:01:50.640> it's<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.880> really<00:01:51.299> effective<00:01:51.630> practice

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
but it's a really effective practice

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.569 
but it's a really effective practice
tool<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:53.250> us

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
tool for us

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.370 
tool for us
and<00:01:53.670> I'm<00:01:54.210> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> illustrate<00:01:54.540> how<00:01:55.110> this

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
and I'm going to illustrate how this

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.280 
and I'm going to illustrate how this
might<00:01:55.590> help<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.009> at<00:01:56.460> home<00:01:56.899> let's<00:01:57.899> look<00:01:58.079> at<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
might help you at home let's look at the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.319 
might help you at home let's look at the
first<00:01:58.530> two<00:01:58.829> measures<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.700> what<00:02:00.210> you'll

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
first two measures of this what you'll

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.870 
first two measures of this what you'll
see<00:02:00.659> there<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.649> at<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.369> end<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> bar

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
see there is that at the end of the bar

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.969 
see there is that at the end of the bar
it<00:02:03.000> leaps<00:02:03.149> from<00:02:03.299> open<00:02:03.659> G<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.259> high<00:02:04.409> b-flat

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
it leaps from open G to high b-flat

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.940 
it leaps from open G to high b-flat
that's<00:02:05.549> not<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:05.969> easy<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.680> play<00:02:07.920> it

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
that's not so easy to do if I play it

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.040 
that's not so easy to do if I play it
first<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.729> way<00:02:08.849> it's<00:02:09.090> written<00:02:09.300> down<00:02:09.450> below

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
first the way it's written down below

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.290 
first the way it's written down below
gives<00:02:10.800> me<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> sense<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.700> what<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.060> melody

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
gives me a sense of what the melody

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.760 
gives me a sense of what the melody
might<00:02:12.720> be

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
might be

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.920 
might be
and<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.040> fact<00:02:14.280> there<00:02:15.030> are<00:02:15.120> many<00:02:15.300> ways<00:02:15.630> we<00:02:15.660> can

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
and in fact there are many ways we can

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.020 
and in fact there are many ways we can
phrase<00:02:16.350> this<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.890> make<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.160> sound<00:02:17.340> musical

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
phrase this and make it sound musical

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.300 
phrase this and make it sound musical
and<00:02:18.300> beautiful<00:02:18.840> for<00:02:19.380> right<00:02:19.500> now<00:02:19.530> I'm<00:02:19.860> going<00:02:19.920> to

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
and beautiful for right now I'm going to

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.370 
and beautiful for right now I'm going to
pretend<00:02:20.820> like<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:21.390> want<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.840> aim<00:02:22.020> for<00:02:22.050> those

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
pretend like I want to aim for those

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.010 
pretend like I want to aim for those
first<00:02:22.650> two<00:02:22.890> bars<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.430> sort<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.790> go<00:02:24.360> up<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.900> then

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
first two bars to sort of go up and then

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.600 
first two bars to sort of go up and then
go<00:02:25.170> down<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.380> little<00:02:25.620> bit<00:02:25.740> of<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.010> nuance<00:02:26.220> and

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
go down a little bit of a nuance and

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.670 
go down a little bit of a nuance and
then<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.820> phrase<00:02:27.030> will<00:02:27.330> continue<00:02:27.930> now<00:02:28.500> that's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
then the phrase will continue now that's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.100 
then the phrase will continue now that's
quite<00:02:29.160> easy<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.550> do<00:02:29.910> if<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.480> do<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.990> low

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
quite easy to do if I do it in the low

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.720 
quite easy to do if I do it in the low
register<00:02:36.410> kind<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.470> makes<00:02:37.650> sense<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.160> moves

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
register kind of makes sense it moves

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.210 
register kind of makes sense it moves
forward<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.630> open<00:02:40.050> G<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.830> then<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.100> sort

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
forward to the open G and then it sort

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.430 
forward to the open G and then it sort
of<00:02:41.310> ebbs<00:02:41.490> back<00:02:41.760> like<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.120> little<00:02:42.450> wave<00:02:42.630> what<00:02:43.410> I

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
of ebbs back like a little wave what I

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.200 
of ebbs back like a little wave what I
would<00:02:43.710> do<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:43.950> play<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.460> that<00:02:44.640> octave

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
would do is play it in that octave

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.060 
would do is play it in that octave
several<00:02:45.990> times<00:02:46.230> till<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.590> really<00:02:46.830> feels

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
several times till it really feels

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.250 
several times till it really feels
comfortable<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.760> then<00:02:48.300> I'll<00:02:48.570> try<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:48.990> slip

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
comfortable and then I'll try and slip

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.470 
comfortable and then I'll try and slip
in<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.500> higher<00:02:49.680> octave<00:02:49.980> as<00:02:50.370> Brahms<00:02:50.820> wrote<00:02:51.060> it

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
in the higher octave as Brahms wrote it

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:06.590 
in the higher octave as Brahms wrote it
and<00:02:51.660> try<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.410> maintain<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.890> same<00:02:53.190> feel<00:03:05.600> and

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
and try and maintain that same feel and

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.540 
and try and maintain that same feel and
I<00:03:06.960> would<00:03:07.080> do<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:07.380> few<00:03:07.500> times<00:03:07.770> but<00:03:08.310> doing

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
I would do that a few times but doing

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.030 
I would do that a few times but doing
the<00:03:08.730> low<00:03:08.910> octave<00:03:09.390> really<00:03:09.750> helps<00:03:10.110> me<00:03:10.320> feel<00:03:10.830> the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
the low octave really helps me feel the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.740 
the low octave really helps me feel the
nuances<00:03:11.550> of<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.730> phrase<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.390> encourage

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
nuances of the phrase and I encourage

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.870 
nuances of the phrase and I encourage
you<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.900> try<00:03:13.140> this<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.620> could<00:03:14.160> look<00:03:14.250> at<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.490> next

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
you to try this I could look at the next

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.330 
you to try this I could look at the next
two<00:03:15.030> bars<00:03:15.210> which<00:03:15.930> has<00:03:16.110> an<00:03:16.260> even<00:03:16.350> scarier<00:03:16.800> leap

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
two bars which has an even scarier leap

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.520 
two bars which has an even scarier leap
see<00:03:17.880> written<00:03:18.480> in<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.810> middle<00:03:19.110> of<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.290> staff

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
see written in the middle of the staff

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.310 
see written in the middle of the staff
up<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.550> that<00:03:20.670> high<00:03:20.940> e-flat<00:03:21.510> that's<00:03:22.050> kind<00:03:22.260> of

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
up to that high e-flat that's kind of

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.710 
up to that high e-flat that's kind of
scary<00:03:22.470> but<00:03:23.250> if<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.460> do<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:23.730> down<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.150> octave<00:03:24.360> I

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
scary but if I do it down the octave I

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.260 
scary but if I do it down the octave I
can<00:03:24.900> see<00:03:25.110> it's<00:03:25.560> actually<00:03:25.710> a<00:03:25.980> beautiful<00:03:26.280> fairly

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
can see it's actually a beautiful fairly

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:35.240 
can see it's actually a beautiful fairly
simple<00:03:27.660> phrase<00:03:33.650> when<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.680> do<00:03:34.800> it<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.040> way<00:03:35.220> I

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
simple phrase when I do it that way I

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.460 
simple phrase when I do it that way I
may<00:03:35.550> choose<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:36.060> phrase<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.540> similarly<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.230> the

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
may choose to phrase it similarly to the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.440 
may choose to phrase it similarly to the
first<00:03:37.830> two<00:03:38.130> bars<00:03:38.340> feels<00:03:38.970> like<00:03:39.120> those<00:03:39.270> eighth

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
first two bars feels like those eighth

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.810 
first two bars feels like those eighth
notes<00:03:39.480> are<00:03:39.930> beautiful<00:03:40.530> moving<00:03:40.830> action<00:03:41.370> note

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
notes are beautiful moving action note

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.610 
notes are beautiful moving action note
they<00:03:42.000> take<00:03:42.210> us<00:03:42.360> to<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.660> C<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.200> then<00:03:43.320> we<00:03:43.440> can

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
they take us to the C and then we can

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.710 
they take us to the C and then we can
taper<00:03:43.860> off<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.130> little<00:03:44.490> bit<00:03:44.760> now<00:03:45.540> that's

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
taper off a little bit now that's

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.150 
taper off a little bit now that's
trickier<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.260> do<00:03:46.350> in<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.500> high<00:03:46.650> octave<00:03:47.040> but

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
trickier to do in the high octave but

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.920 
trickier to do in the high octave but
again<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.430> would<00:03:47.700> do<00:03:47.820> it<00:03:47.850> several<00:03:48.180> times<00:03:48.600> in<00:03:48.840> the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
again I would do it several times in the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.080 
again I would do it several times in the
low<00:03:49.080> octave<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:49.710> then<00:03:50.250> try<00:03:50.490> moving<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:51.000> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
low octave and then try moving to the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:04.460 
low octave and then try moving to the
high<00:03:51.270> register

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.840 

now<00:04:05.470> it<00:04:05.590> doesn't<00:04:05.800> mean<00:04:06.040> that<00:04:06.100> leaps<00:04:06.459> going<00:04:06.760> to

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
now it doesn't mean that leaps going to

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.240 
now it doesn't mean that leaps going to
feel<00:04:07.030> easy<00:04:07.360> in<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:07.990> high<00:04:08.140> register<00:04:08.380> but<00:04:09.160> I'll

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
feel easy in the high register but I'll

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.370 
feel easy in the high register but I'll
have<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.459> better<00:04:09.730> sense<00:04:10.209> of<00:04:10.420> how<00:04:10.690> I<00:04:10.720> want<00:04:11.200> the

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
have a better sense of how I want the

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.610 
have a better sense of how I want the
music<00:04:11.500> framed<00:04:12.130> or<00:04:12.490> shaped<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:13.570> want<00:04:13.990> the<00:04:14.260> C

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
music framed or shaped so I want the C

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.009 
music framed or shaped so I want the C
to<00:04:15.070> be<00:04:15.190> my<00:04:15.400> peak<00:04:15.670> and<00:04:15.910> then<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.299> lift<00:04:16.540> off<00:04:16.750> for

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
to be my peak and then to lift off for

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.140 
to be my peak and then to lift off for
the<00:04:17.109> E<00:04:17.140> flat<00:04:17.500> doing<00:04:18.310> it<00:04:18.430> in<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.549> low<00:04:18.700> octave

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
the E flat doing it in the low octave

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.060 
the E flat doing it in the low octave
for<00:04:19.359> some<00:04:19.570> reason<00:04:19.870> really<00:04:20.230> helps<00:04:20.500> me<00:04:20.680> get<00:04:20.890> that

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
for some reason really helps me get that

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.310 
for some reason really helps me get that
feeling<00:04:21.760> into<00:04:21.910> my<00:04:22.150> head<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:22.720> into<00:04:22.870> my<00:04:23.080> body

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
feeling into my head and into my body

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.620 
feeling into my head and into my body
and<00:04:23.590> it's<00:04:24.160> pretty<00:04:24.460> comfortable<00:04:25.060> to<00:04:25.270> do<00:04:25.390> in<00:04:25.540> the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
and it's pretty comfortable to do in the

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.740 
and it's pretty comfortable to do in the
low<00:04:25.750> register<00:04:26.640> psychologically<00:04:27.640> I<00:04:27.850> think<00:04:28.660> if

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
low register psychologically I think if

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.630 
low register psychologically I think if
we've<00:04:28.930> done<00:04:29.169> that<00:04:29.320> phrase<00:04:29.650> comfortably<00:04:30.400> many

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
we've done that phrase comfortably many

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.460 
we've done that phrase comfortably many
times<00:04:31.000> and<00:04:31.330> then<00:04:31.450> we<00:04:31.540> just<00:04:31.720> pop<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:32.110> up<00:04:32.230> an

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
times and then we just pop it up an

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.580 
times and then we just pop it up an
octave<00:04:32.560> or<00:04:33.010> two<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.520> still<00:04:34.240> feels<00:04:34.690> easier<00:04:35.320> and

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
octave or two it still feels easier and

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.460 
octave or two it still feels easier and
it's<00:04:35.710> a<00:04:35.830> really<00:04:36.160> useful<00:04:36.400> practice<00:04:37.150> tool<00:04:37.470> so

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
it's a really useful practice tool so

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.960 
it's a really useful practice tool so
the<00:04:38.620> next<00:04:38.860> thing<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:39.250> might<00:04:39.430> do<00:04:39.610> after<00:04:39.940> that

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
the next thing I might do after that

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.570 
the next thing I might do after that
might<00:04:40.540> be<00:04:40.660> to<00:04:40.780> try<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.050> whole<00:04:41.440> line<00:04:41.860> in<00:04:42.340> the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
might be to try the whole line in the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.909 
might be to try the whole line in the
lower<00:04:42.760> octave<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:43.810> then<00:04:44.110> try<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.410> whole<00:04:44.680> line

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
lower octave and then try the whole line

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.920 
lower octave and then try the whole line
and<00:04:44.950> the<00:04:45.190> higher<00:04:45.370> octave<00:04:45.669> it<00:04:45.970> helps<00:04:46.690> us<00:04:46.900> shape

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
and the higher octave it helps us shape

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.170 
and the higher octave it helps us shape
the<00:04:47.410> phrase<00:04:47.650> now<00:04:47.890> I'm<00:04:48.310> not<00:04:48.610> saying<00:04:49.000> that's

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
the phrase now I'm not saying that's

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.120 
the phrase now I'm not saying that's
exactly<00:04:49.780> how<00:04:49.930> you<00:04:49.960> should<00:04:50.169> phrase<00:04:50.620> this<00:04:50.890> piece

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
exactly how you should phrase this piece

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.590 
exactly how you should phrase this piece
there's<00:04:51.400> lots<00:04:51.669> of<00:04:51.880> different<00:04:52.270> ways<00:04:52.360> of<00:04:52.540> doing

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
there's lots of different ways of doing

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.870 
there's lots of different ways of doing
it<00:04:52.900> just<00:04:53.350> using<00:04:53.680> that<00:04:53.770> as<00:04:53.830> an<00:04:54.070> example<00:04:54.580> of<00:04:54.700> how

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
it just using that as an example of how

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.300 
it just using that as an example of how
I<00:04:54.910> might<00:04:55.300> practice<00:04:55.870> it<00:04:56.050> so<00:04:56.710> perhaps<00:04:56.980> for<00:04:57.220> the

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
I might practice it so perhaps for the

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.490 
I might practice it so perhaps for the
next<00:04:57.550> step<00:04:57.760> I'll<00:04:58.300> try<00:04:58.630> that<00:04:58.660> whole<00:04:59.140> line

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
next step I'll try that whole line

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:16.289 
next step I'll try that whole line
written<00:05:00.070> down<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.610> octave

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:16.299 

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:19.719 

when<00:05:17.299> I<00:05:17.330> do<00:05:17.479> it<00:05:17.689> like<00:05:17.809> that<00:05:17.869> evening<00:05:18.739> it<00:05:18.830> out<00:05:18.979> it

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
when I do it like that evening it out it

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.339 
when I do it like that evening it out it
actually<00:05:19.849> feels<00:05:20.149> really<00:05:20.269> comfortable<00:05:20.779> and

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
actually feels really comfortable and

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.169 
actually feels really comfortable and
through<00:05:21.799> exploring<00:05:22.369> that<00:05:22.489> I<00:05:22.549> might<00:05:22.819> decide

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:23.179 
through exploring that I might decide

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:25.299 
through exploring that I might decide
where<00:05:23.719> I<00:05:23.749> want<00:05:24.199> to<00:05:24.289> crescendo<00:05:24.559> or<00:05:24.979> where<00:05:25.189> it

00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:25.309 
where I want to crescendo or where it

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:27.729 
where I want to crescendo or where it
feels<00:05:25.519> natural<00:05:25.789> to<00:05:26.059> diminuendo<00:05:26.629> again<00:05:27.589> I

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:27.739 
feels natural to diminuendo again I

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:30.009 
feels natural to diminuendo again I
would<00:05:27.979> play<00:05:28.189> that<00:05:28.399> several<00:05:28.879> times<00:05:28.909> and<00:05:29.449> then<00:05:29.989> I

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:30.019 
would play that several times and then I

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:31.359 
would play that several times and then I
would<00:05:30.289> try<00:05:30.499> it<00:05:30.559> as<00:05:30.739> written

00:05:31.359 --> 00:05:31.369 
would try it as written

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:34.779 
would try it as written
now<00:05:32.029> this<00:05:32.989> tends<00:05:33.499> to<00:05:33.799> apply<00:05:34.069> more<00:05:34.369> to<00:05:34.610> more

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
now this tends to apply more to more

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.369 
now this tends to apply more to more
advanced<00:05:35.209> music<00:05:35.419> because<00:05:35.929> you're<00:05:36.049> not<00:05:36.169> going

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:36.379 
advanced music because you're not going

advanced music because you're not going
to<00:05:36.439> find<00:05:36.709> these<00:05:36.919> big<00:05:37.189> leaps<00:05:37.579> written<00:05:38.209> into

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
to find these big leaps written into

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.569 
to find these big leaps written into
easier<00:05:38.839> music<00:05:39.289> but<00:05:39.860> there's<00:05:40.009> another<00:05:40.309> way<00:05:40.549> you

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:40.579 
easier music but there's another way you

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:43.359 
easier music but there's another way you
can<00:05:40.849> adapt<00:05:41.149> this<00:05:41.389> to<00:05:41.449> yourself<00:05:42.199> if<00:05:42.589> you<00:05:43.249> are

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:43.369 
can adapt this to yourself if you are

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:45.189 
can adapt this to yourself if you are
playing<00:05:43.699> more<00:05:43.999> easier<00:05:44.539> or<00:05:44.839> intermediate

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
playing more easier or intermediate

playing more easier or intermediate
level<00:05:45.769> music<00:05:46.119> inevitably<00:05:47.119> there's<00:05:47.389> parts<00:05:47.839> of

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:47.989 
level music inevitably there's parts of

00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:50.290 
level music inevitably there's parts of
our<00:05:48.139> music<00:05:48.529> where<00:05:48.800> in<00:05:48.979> the<00:05:49.129> high<00:05:49.369> register<00:05:49.639> it

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
our music where in the high register it

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.869 
our music where in the high register it
just<00:05:50.659> feels<00:05:50.899> uncomfortable<00:05:51.399> it<00:05:52.399> might<00:05:52.699> not

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:52.879 
just feels uncomfortable it might not

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.879 
just feels uncomfortable it might not
have<00:05:53.089> a<00:05:53.119> big<00:05:53.239> leap<00:05:53.659> but<00:05:53.929> it<00:05:54.050> might<00:05:54.199> have<00:05:54.469> a<00:05:54.499> part

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
have a big leap but it might have a part

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:56.979 
have a big leap but it might have a part
of<00:05:54.979> melody<00:05:55.459> in<00:05:55.639> a<00:05:55.849> higher<00:05:56.119> range<00:05:56.419> that<00:05:56.689> doesn't
