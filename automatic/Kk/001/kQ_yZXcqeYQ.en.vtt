00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.530 
then maybe you can lie down like like
how<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.010> do<00:02:39.310> at<00:02:39.459> home<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:40.060> know<00:02:40.209> where<00:02:40.390> you

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
how you do at home you know where you

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.479 
how you do at home you know where you
live<00:02:40.720> at<00:02:41.140> home<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:41.380> go<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.800> sleep

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
live at home and go to sleep

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.850 
live at home and go to sleep
maybe<00:02:42.970> when<00:02:43.270> you're<00:02:43.420> anxious<00:02:43.630> out<00:02:44.050> places<00:02:44.500> you

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
maybe when you're anxious out places you

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.680 
maybe when you're anxious out places you
could<00:02:45.070> lick<00:02:45.310> him<00:02:45.520> yawn<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.030> blink<00:02:46.300> your<00:02:46.510> eyes

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690

and<00:02:47.050> lie<00:02:47.200> down<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.950> then<00:02:48.520> maybe<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.880> will<00:02:48.970> be

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
and lie down and then maybe it will be

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.340 
and lie down and then maybe it will be
easier<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.810> organize<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.620> thoughts<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.930> when

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350
