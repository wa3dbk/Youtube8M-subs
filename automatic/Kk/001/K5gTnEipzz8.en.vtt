pretty happy about that and now can
install<00:03:37.400> my<00:03:37.640> electronics<00:03:38.239> I<00:03:39.040> got<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.160> motor

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
install my electronics I got the motor

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.370 
install my electronics I got the motor
installed<00:03:40.940> or<00:03:41.209> went<00:03:41.390> in<00:03:41.480> pretty<00:03:41.660> well<00:03:41.810> the

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
installed or went in pretty well the

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.890 
installed or went in pretty well the
water<00:03:42.590> jacket<00:03:42.860> went<00:03:43.220> on<00:03:43.340> remarkably<00:03:44.329> easy<00:03:44.660> I

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
water jacket went on remarkably easy I

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.610 
water jacket went on remarkably easy I
added<00:03:45.799> a<00:03:45.920> little<00:03:46.220> bit<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.519> grease<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.260> two

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
added a little bit of grease to the two

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.039 
added a little bit of grease to the two
o-rings<00:03:48.860> and<00:03:49.489> it<00:03:49.610> slid<00:03:49.910> right<00:03:49.940> on<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.810> it's

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
o-rings and it slid right on and it's

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.590 
o-rings and it slid right on and it's
locked<00:03:51.440> itself<00:03:51.890> in<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.459> won't<00:03:52.700> go<00:03:53.000> anywhere

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
locked itself in and won't go anywhere

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.060 
locked itself in and won't go anywhere
um<00:03:54.549> so<00:03:55.549> that<00:03:55.760> was<00:03:55.940> super<00:03:56.510> easy<00:03:56.540> I<00:03:57.110> did<00:03:57.530> overlook

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
um so that was super easy I did overlook

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.370 
um so that was super easy I did overlook
the<00:03:58.430> fact<00:03:58.640> that<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.120> new<00:03:59.269> motor<00:03:59.510> has<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.840> 1/8

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
the fact that the new motor has a 1/8

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.140 
the fact that the new motor has a 1/8
shaft<00:04:00.829> and<00:04:01.190> my<00:04:01.930> collar<00:04:02.930> has<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:04.150> McCulloch

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
shaft and my collar has a McCulloch

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.520 
shaft and my collar has a McCulloch
coupler<00:04:05.570> has<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:06.519> 5<00:04:07.519> millimeter<00:04:07.790> shaft<00:04:08.530> opening

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
coupler has a 5 millimeter shaft opening

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.770 
coupler has a 5 millimeter shaft opening
so<00:04:10.519> I<00:04:10.549> had<00:04:10.760> to<00:04:10.880> get<00:04:11.030> an<00:04:11.299> adapter<00:04:11.630> and<00:04:12.380> step<00:04:13.130> the

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
so I had to get an adapter and step the

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.810 
so I had to get an adapter and step the
eight<00:04:14.780> inch<00:04:15.260> shaft<00:04:15.709> up<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.340> five<00:04:16.549> millimeter

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
eight inch shaft up to a five millimeter

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.719 
eight inch shaft up to a five millimeter
shaft<00:04:17.450> that's<00:04:18.079> on<00:04:18.410> there<00:04:18.709> and<00:04:18.919> then<00:04:19.250> the

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
shaft that's on there and then the

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.789 
shaft that's on there and then the
collet<00:04:20.330> went<00:04:20.570> right<00:04:20.750> over<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:21.500> collet

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
collet went right over the collet

in now you can see the ESC went in just

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.560 
in now you can see the ESC went in just
as<00:05:10.889> simply<00:05:11.160> as<00:05:11.340> I<00:05:11.490> said<00:05:11.699> it<00:05:11.820> would<00:05:12.060> I've

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
as simply as I said it would I've

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.939

the<00:05:14.010> cooling<00:05:14.370> system<00:05:14.400> just<00:05:15.060> so<00:05:15.180> I<00:05:15.240> could<00:05:15.449> kind

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
the cooling system just so I could kind

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.500 
the cooling system just so I could kind
of<00:05:15.690> get<00:05:15.810> a<00:05:15.870> grasp<00:05:16.139> on<00:05:16.440> what's<00:05:16.800> going<00:05:17.099> where<00:05:17.510> you

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
of get a grasp on what's going where you

rear rudder pickup this leads to the
other<00:05:43.280> pickup<00:05:44.280> below<00:05:44.580> and<00:05:45.030> I<00:05:45.690> will<00:05:45.750> be<00:05:46.139> using

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
other pickup below and I will be using

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.540 
other pickup below and I will be using
the<00:05:46.800> Y<00:05:47.039> connectors<00:05:47.669> that<00:05:47.940> I<00:05:48.690> got<00:05:48.930> to<00:05:49.470> join<00:05:50.130> and

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
the Y connectors that I got to join and

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.040 
the Y connectors that I got to join and
take<00:05:50.909> them<00:05:51.180> down<00:05:51.419> to<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:53.449> to<00:05:54.449> the<00:05:54.570> one<00:05:54.780> tube

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
take them down to the to the one tube

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.250 
take them down to the to the one tube
that<00:05:55.440> will<00:05:55.680> run<00:05:55.949> from<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.430> motor<00:05:58.940> and<00:06:00.260> then

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
that will run from the motor and then

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.680 
that will run from the motor and then
out<00:06:01.710> of<00:06:01.770> the<00:06:02.190> other<00:06:02.280> side<00:06:02.580> of<00:06:02.729> the<00:06:02.820> motor<00:06:03.060> will

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
out of the other side of the motor will

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.649 
out of the other side of the motor will
run<00:06:04.400> to<00:06:05.400> the<00:06:05.669> outlet<00:06:06.570> on<00:06:07.080> the<00:06:07.229> opposite<00:06:07.710> side

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:08.659 
run to the outlet on the opposite side

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.529 
run to the outlet on the opposite side
pretty<00:06:09.659> simple<00:06:10.229> cooling<00:06:11.030> the<00:06:12.030> only<00:06:12.210> reason<00:06:12.479> I

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
pretty simple cooling the only reason I

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.930 
pretty simple cooling the only reason I
have<00:06:12.690> a<00:06:12.720> Y<00:06:13.020> is<00:06:13.380> because<00:06:14.039> the<00:06:14.220> boat<00:06:14.370> comes<00:06:14.669> with

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
have a Y is because the boat comes with

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.290 
have a Y is because the boat comes with
a<00:06:14.970> rudder<00:06:15.389> pickup<00:06:15.960> and<00:06:16.310> I<00:06:17.310> found<00:06:18.030> that<00:06:18.150> it<00:06:18.270> was

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
a rudder pickup and I found that it was

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.510 
a rudder pickup and I found that it was
insufficient<00:06:19.020> so<00:06:19.320> I'm<00:06:19.680> supplementing<00:06:20.490> that

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
insufficient so I'm supplementing that

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.589 
insufficient so I'm supplementing that
with<00:06:20.760> a<00:06:21.300> lower<00:06:22.289> pickup<00:06:22.860> and<00:06:23.570> shooting<00:06:24.570> that

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
with a lower pickup and shooting that

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:27.469 
with a lower pickup and shooting that
right<00:06:24.990> to<00:06:25.169> the<00:06:25.289> motor<00:06:25.669> which<00:06:26.669> will<00:06:27.270> probably

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 
right to the motor which will probably

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:31.129 
right to the motor which will probably
hold<00:06:27.750> the<00:06:27.930> most<00:06:28.110> heat<00:06:28.440> so<00:06:29.180> and<00:06:30.180> then<00:06:30.479> as<00:06:30.720> I<00:06:31.080> said

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
hold the most heat so and then as I said

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:32.839 
hold the most heat so and then as I said
the<00:06:31.409> other<00:06:31.560> side<00:06:31.800> goes<00:06:32.039> right<00:06:32.250> out<00:06:32.279> the<00:06:32.430> side

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:32.849 
the other side goes right out the side

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:34.580 
the other side goes right out the side
so<00:06:33.690> I'm<00:06:33.750> going<00:06:33.779> to<00:06:33.960> go<00:06:34.110> ahead<00:06:34.169> and<00:06:34.409> get<00:06:34.560> all

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
so I'm going to go ahead and get all

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
so I'm going to go ahead and get all
this<00:06:34.950> hooked<00:06:35.250> up<00:06:35.490> and<00:06:35.729> then

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
this hooked up and then

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.279 
this hooked up and then
all<00:06:36.729> I'll<00:06:37.000> have<00:06:37.210> to<00:06:37.389> do<00:06:37.539> is<00:06:37.659> start<00:06:37.900> cleaning

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
all I'll have to do is start cleaning

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.679 
all I'll have to do is start cleaning
out<00:06:38.379> the<00:06:38.530> wiring<00:06:38.740> so<00:06:39.669> the<00:06:39.789> wiring<00:06:40.180> is<00:06:40.300> all<00:06:40.419> done
