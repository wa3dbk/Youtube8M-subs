he says see we're measuring three

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.800 
he says see we're measuring three
intervals<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.890> went<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.980> 0<00:02:26.220> 42<00:02:26.700> 0<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.090> 60<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.570> 0

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
intervals I went to 0 42 0 and 60 to 0

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.390 
intervals I went to 0 42 0 and 60 to 0
and<00:02:28.910> our<00:02:29.910> 60<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.420> 0<00:02:30.630> was<00:02:30.900> 136<00:02:31.560> point<00:02:31.830> nine<00:02:32.100> four

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
and our 60 to 0 was 136 point nine four

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.210 
and our 60 to 0 was 136 point nine four
so<00:02:32.850> pretty<00:02:33.270> look<00:02:33.480> pretty<00:02:33.720> close<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:34.050> 137<00:02:34.860> yeah

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
so pretty look pretty close to 137 yeah

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.600 
so pretty look pretty close to 137 yeah
almost<00:02:35.520> 130<00:02:36.000> found<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.770> now<00:02:37.770> guys<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:38.580> you

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
almost 130 found it now guys just so you

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.979 
almost 130 found it now guys just so you
know<00:02:38.700> we've<00:02:38.970> run<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.360> couple<00:02:39.750> times

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
know we've run this a couple times

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:40.940 
know we've run this a couple times
because<00:02:40.170> we<00:02:40.380> had<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.620> get<00:02:40.770> everything

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
because we had to get everything

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.540 
because we had to get everything
together<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:42.330> breaks<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.989> they're<00:02:43.290> not

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
together so the breaks that they're not

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.890 
together so the breaks that they're not
mostly<00:02:44.550> but<00:02:44.910> they're<00:02:45.030> not<00:02:45.150> cold<00:02:45.330> either<00:02:45.480> yes

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
mostly but they're not cold either yes

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.170 
mostly but they're not cold either yes
and<00:02:46.709> we're<00:02:47.010> what<00:02:47.370> what<00:02:47.790> would<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.000> say<00:02:48.150> about

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
and we're what what would you say about

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.729 
and we're what what would you say about
two<00:02:48.630> minutes<00:02:48.810> between<00:02:49.080> runs

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
two minutes between runs

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.100 
two minutes between runs
yeah<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:50.760> that's<00:02:51.060> not<00:02:51.180> even<00:02:51.600> three<00:02:51.780> minutes

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
yeah it's that's not even three minutes

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.170 
yeah it's that's not even three minutes
but<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.500> called<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:53.040> cool<00:02:53.430> outside<00:02:54.060> I'd

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
but it's called that a cool outside I'd

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.640 
but it's called that a cool outside I'd
say<00:02:54.360> it's<00:02:54.480> what<00:02:54.570> about<00:02:54.750> 40<00:02:55.019> degrees<00:02:55.110> 40

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
say it's what about 40 degrees 40

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.320 
say it's what about 40 degrees 40
degrees<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:56.130> said<00:02:56.340> let's<00:02:56.940> check<00:02:57.209> the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
degrees I said let's check the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.620 
degrees I said let's check the
temperature<00:02:57.810> when<00:02:57.989> we<00:02:58.140> come<00:02:58.830> through<00:02:58.860> stop<00:02:59.630> so

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
temperature when we come through stop so

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.850 
temperature when we come through stop so
the<00:03:00.750> cool<00:03:00.930> temperature<00:03:01.380> does<00:03:01.560> help<00:03:01.769> the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
the cool temperature does help the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.259 
the cool temperature does help the
breaks<00:03:02.070> cool<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.640> much<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:02.910> I'm<00:03:03.000> starting

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
breaks cool that much and I'm starting

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.199 
breaks cool that much and I'm starting
from<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.600> same<00:03:03.810> point<00:03:03.870> each<00:03:04.500> time<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:05.190> put<00:03:06.120> it

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
from the same point each time I put it

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.970 
from the same point each time I put it
in<00:03:06.330> park<00:03:06.570> it's<00:03:07.290> 57<00:03:07.800> degrees<00:03:08.220> outside

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
in park it's 57 degrees outside

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.410 
in park it's 57 degrees outside
wind<00:03:10.980> chill<00:03:11.160> yes<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.610> there's<00:03:11.970> human<00:03:12.209> some

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
wind chill yes and there's human some

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.440 
wind chill yes and there's human some
humidity<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:12.989> air<00:03:13.489> so<00:03:14.489> we<00:03:14.820> go<00:03:14.970> back<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.360> the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
humidity in the air so we go back to the

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.140 
humidity in the air so we go back to the
breaking<00:03:15.870> screen<00:03:16.170> on<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.700> iPhone<00:03:17.700> app<00:03:18.120> you

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
breaking screen on the iPhone app you

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.560 
breaking screen on the iPhone app you

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.270 

oh<00:04:06.350> these<00:04:07.350> cones<00:04:07.710> are<00:04:07.920> a<00:04:07.980> visual

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
oh these cones are a visual

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.280 
oh these cones are a visual
approximation<00:04:09.210> I<00:04:09.420> mean<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:09.690> numbers<00:04:10.080> are

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
approximation I mean the numbers are

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.010 
approximation I mean the numbers are
actually<00:04:10.550> given<00:04:11.550> to<00:04:11.580> us<00:04:11.790> by<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.000> VBox<00:04:12.420> but<00:04:12.750> if

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
actually given to us by the VBox but if

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.070 
actually given to us by the VBox but if
you<00:04:13.110> look<00:04:14.540> we're<00:04:15.540> probably<00:04:15.800> a<00:04:16.800> good<00:04:18.080> 10-15

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
you look we're probably a good 10-15

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.260 
you look we're probably a good 10-15
feet<00:04:19.380> longer<00:04:19.830> with<00:04:20.310> more<00:04:20.850> weight<00:04:21.060> in<00:04:21.209> the

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
feet longer with more weight in the

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.790 
feet longer with more weight in the
truck<00:04:21.450> of<00:04:21.600> course<00:04:21.630> there's<00:04:21.989> also<00:04:22.140> brake<00:04:22.500> faith

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
truck of course there's also brake faith

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.590 
truck of course there's also brake faith
that<00:04:22.980> comes<00:04:23.190> into<00:04:23.430> play<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.300> more<00:04:24.480> that

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
that comes into play and the more that

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.350 
that comes into play and the more that
we<00:04:24.720> do<00:04:24.840> this<00:04:24.990> test<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.860> more<00:04:26.070> brake<00:04:26.940> fade<00:04:27.180> we

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
we do this test the more brake fade we

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.600 
we do this test the more brake fade we
get<00:04:27.540> so<00:04:27.720> keep<00:04:27.900> that<00:04:28.020> in<00:04:28.080> mind

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.850 

so<00:04:33.610> let's<00:04:33.910> look<00:04:34.030> at<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.240> details<00:04:37.050> 103.8<00:04:38.050> okay

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
so let's look at the details 103.8 okay

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.120 
so let's look at the details 103.8 okay
so<00:04:39.700> that's<00:04:40.600> about<00:04:40.780> like<00:04:41.200> three<00:04:41.440> and<00:04:41.500> a<00:04:41.590> half

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
so that's about like three and a half

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.920 
so that's about like three and a half
Oh<00:04:42.160> different<00:04:42.940> almost<00:04:43.210> four<00:04:43.390> feet<00:04:43.420> different

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
Oh different almost four feet different

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.540 
Oh different almost four feet different
almost<00:04:44.290> four<00:04:44.680> so<00:04:46.140> 270<00:04:47.140> pounds<00:04:47.590> adds<00:04:47.800> that<00:04:48.400> much

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
almost four so 270 pounds adds that much

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.550 
almost four so 270 pounds adds that much
that's<00:04:49.030> about<00:04:49.300> right<00:04:49.480> I<00:04:49.540> guess<00:04:49.900> I<00:04:50.170> mean<00:04:50.410> you

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560

now we're almost at 1660 ABS oh yeah
okay<00:05:43.270> that<00:05:43.630> worked<00:05:44.430> well<00:05:45.430> let's<00:05:45.669> look<00:05:45.820> at<00:05:45.910> the

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
okay that worked well let's look at the

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.629 
okay that worked well let's look at the
details<00:05:48.120> well<00:05:49.120> forty<00:05:49.539> seven<00:05:49.900> point<00:05:50.110> four<00:05:50.639> so

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
details well forty seven point four so

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.370 
details well forty seven point four so
on<00:05:51.970> top<00:05:52.150> of<00:05:52.210> what<00:05:52.419> we<00:05:52.539> saw<00:05:52.720> earlier<00:05:53.169> having

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
on top of what we saw earlier having

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.430 
on top of what we saw earlier having
feet<00:05:53.740> on<00:05:53.979> top<00:05:54.190> of<00:05:54.400> two<00:05:54.580> people<00:05:54.970> and<00:05:55.440> almost

feet on top of two people and almost
eleven<00:05:57.280> feet<00:05:57.520> difference<00:05:58.300> yeah<00:05:58.840> figure<00:05:59.590> that

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
eleven feet difference yeah figure that

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.900 
eleven feet difference yeah figure that
11<00:06:00.070> feet<00:06:00.280> said<00:06:00.880> so<00:06:01.360> Romany<00:06:01.780> pretty<00:06:02.139> close<00:06:02.910> what

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
11 feet said so Romany pretty close what

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.400 
11 feet said so Romany pretty close what
you're<00:06:04.090> looking<00:06:04.300> at<00:06:04.389> here<00:06:04.449> is<00:06:04.720> a<00:06:04.870> graphic

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
you're looking at here is a graphic

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.590 
you're looking at here is a graphic
representation<00:06:06.340> of<00:06:06.460> the<00:06:06.520> stopping<00:06:07.090> distances

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
representation of the stopping distances

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.600 
representation of the stopping distances
it's<00:06:07.930> approximate<00:06:08.470> but<00:06:08.650> I<00:06:08.919> wanted<00:06:09.310> to<00:06:09.370> show

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
it's approximate but I wanted to show

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.670 
it's approximate but I wanted to show
you<00:06:09.639> using<00:06:10.060> Andre<00:06:10.570> so<00:06:11.110> that's<00:06:11.289> where<00:06:11.470> Andre

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
you using Andre so that's where Andre

you using Andre so that's where Andre
first<00:06:12.639> did<00:06:13.000> with<00:06:13.330> six<00:06:13.599> feet<00:06:13.840> two<00:06:14.110> zero

first did with six feet two zero

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.689 
first did with six feet two zero
breaking<00:06:15.039> stuff<00:06:15.419> here's<00:06:16.419> where<00:06:17.250> Andre<00:06:18.250> did<00:06:18.610> it

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
breaking stuff here's where Andre did it

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.480 
breaking stuff here's where Andre did it
with<00:06:18.789> me<00:06:19.199> yeah<00:06:20.199> come<00:06:20.530> on<00:06:20.650> down<00:06:20.860> and<00:06:21.070> then<00:06:21.370> this
