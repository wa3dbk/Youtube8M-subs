 Today we will learn the right way to put nail polish in order to protect it and protect it from pigmentation 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:51.300
 (Top Coat) is a topcoat layer that is a protective layer for nail protection 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:37.800
 Paint the nail in the desired color and we have chosen pink today 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:59.000
 Apply a second layer of paint until the color becomes more intense and clear 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Leave paint to dry completely 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 This is the final form hoping to be appreciated 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Peace, mercy and blessings of God
