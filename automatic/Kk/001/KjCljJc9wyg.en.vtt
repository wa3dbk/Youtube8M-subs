absolutely<00:03:03.489> amazing<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.840> be<00:03:04.959> quite

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
absolutely amazing and be quite

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.899 
absolutely amazing and be quite

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
expensive one unlike the others which

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.479 
expensive one unlike the others which
are<00:03:07.000> about<00:03:07.239> three<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:08.079> four<00:03:08.590> quid<00:03:08.920> maybe<00:03:09.190> I
