00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.090
In our night sky, towards the constellation of Sagittarius, lies the center of our galaxy.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:31.019
The core of our galaxy has always been obscured from us, hiding behind a thick veil of interstellar

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.039
gas and dust some 26,000 light years from Earth.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.280
Wavelengths of light shorter than those in the visible range cannot get through to us.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.659
Photons are absorbed and scattered as they travel from stars in the core out to the spiral arms where

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:55.039
we live - and it is only recently that we have had the proper telescopes in place that allow us to peer behind this curtain

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.699
Using instruments like the Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory and the

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.570
Keck Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawai'i, astronomers have begun imaging the galactic center in

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.390
infrared wavelengths. These longer wavelengths are able to pass right through the gas and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.239
dust strewn throughout the galaxy and illuminate our detectors, showing us for the first time

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:24.899
the center of our home galaxy.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.260
And what they've found there is astonishing.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.800
These are actual infrared observations of stars near the galactic core orbiting an unseen

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.600
and massive object, this is something we could never have seen just a decade ago.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.500
Now, by carefully observing the motions of these stars over several years, astronomers

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.500
have been able to infer the existence of a black hole, these stars are doomed, eventually

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:04.069
destined to be devoured in the black hole's powerful gravitational field.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.519
There is a darkness in the heart of our galaxy, and there is probably one at the center of

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.040
every other galaxy. These supermassive black holes in the cores of galaxies are among the

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.360
most colossal objects in the universe, ranging in size from millions of times the size of

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.860
our Sun to the largest weighing in at over 10 billion times that amount.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.760
Supermassive black holes are devouring stars at a prodigious rate and emitting vast quantities

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.040
of energy in the form of x-rays and gamma ray in the process.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.319
They are among the most luminous objects ever seen. The brightest of these active galactic nuclei can emit more

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.479
energy than all the other stars in their galaxy combined.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.940
They are called quasars.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.540
These active galaxy centers, powered by supermassive black holes, have only recently come under

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.090
close scrutiny and it's only over the past decade or so that astronomers have been able

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.290
to carefully map and measure the activity in the center of our galaxy.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.400
These stars betray the black hole to us, while we can't see it directly, the orbits of these

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.500
doomed stars tell us right where it is.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.650
They also tell us how large it is: the black hole at the center of our galaxy is four million

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.650
times larger than our Sun.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.349
But there's more. In December 2011, using observations taken over the course of several

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.809
years, a massive cloud of hydrogen gas was discovered heading directly towards the black hole.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.200
The hydrogen cloud is about three times the mass of the Earth and is made visible from

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:04.209
the glow of nearby stars as it passes. It
is travelling at 8 million kilometers per hour.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.680
Sometime over the next few years, this cloud will pass very close to the black hole, allowing

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.690
astronomers to see for the first time, a direct collision of a gas cloud with a black hole.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.380
Just a few short decades ago, astronomers thought black holes were theoretical objects

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.380
existing only in mathematical models and obscure theories. Now, not only do we know them to

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.710
exist, but we have direct observational evidence of it. What's more, these dark harbingers

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.599
of destruction, while emitting no light of their own, are the driver for some of the

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.559
brightest and brilliant objects ablaze in the cosmos.
