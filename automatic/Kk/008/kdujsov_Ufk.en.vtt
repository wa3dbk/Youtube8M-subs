let's<00:00:03.719> go<00:00:04.020> back<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.590> our<00:00:04.890> map<00:00:05.520> base<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.470> where

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
let's go back to our map base and where

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.660 
let's go back to our map base and where
we're<00:00:07.620> going<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.830> draw<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.129> simple<00:00:08.700> island<00:00:10.670> I'm

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
we're going to draw a simple island I'm

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:25.870 
we're going to draw a simple island I'm
going<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.910> say<00:00:12.769> 4z<00:00:13.769> equals<00:00:16.070> 20<00:00:17.070> 22<00:00:17.900> 22<00:00:18.900> 33<00:00:19.820> okay

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.900 

so<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:27.000> we're<00:00:27.119> drawing<00:00:27.359> at<00:00:27.920> if<00:00:28.920> we're<00:00:29.130> our<00:00:29.400> map

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
so if we're drawing at if we're our map

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.049 
so if we're drawing at if we're our map

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
will go to 22 coordinate 22 on the W and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.680 
will go to 22 coordinate 22 on the W and
draw<00:00:46.020> 2<00:00:46.440> 33<00:00:47.129> whatever<00:00:47.760> tile<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.329> want<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.660> to

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
draw 2 33 whatever tile we want it to

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:58.880 
draw 2 33 whatever tile we want it to
we'll<00:00:49.620> say<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:50.370> C<00:00:50.760> equals<00:00:52.610> 20<00:00:53.610> 22<00:00:54.890> 31<00:00:57.890> sarms

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
we'll say for C equals 20 22 31 sarms

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.189 
we'll say for C equals 20 22 31 sarms
picking<00:00:59.309> some<00:00:59.520> random<00:00:59.850> letters<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:00.840> our

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
picking some random letters here for our

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:12.700 
picking some random letters here for our
loops<00:01:01.789> and<00:01:03.470> here<00:01:04.470> we'll<00:01:04.619> say<00:01:04.860> ty<00:01:05.100> list<00:01:06.950> z<00:01:07.950> c<00:01:09.409> and

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710

terrain<00:01:13.710> type<00:01:14.600> equals<00:01:15.890> wrasse<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:18.509> let's<00:01:18.630> draw

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
terrain type equals wrasse so let's draw

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.490 
terrain type equals wrasse so let's draw
some<00:01:19.110> grass<00:01:19.470> there<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:21.720> we'll<00:01:22.140> throw<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.439> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
some grass there and we'll throw in a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.969 
some grass there and we'll throw in a
couple<00:01:22.619> mountains<00:01:23.130> too<00:01:24.290> we<00:01:25.290> do<00:01:25.380> not<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
couple mountains too we do not have to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.390 
couple mountains too we do not have to
this<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.700> creates<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.299> square<00:01:28.200> or<00:01:28.560> rectangle

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
this just creates a square or rectangle

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.910 
this just creates a square or rectangle
from<00:01:30.240> 22<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.750> 33<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.710> 22<00:01:32.280> 231<00:01:33.770> that's<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
from 22 to 33 and 22 231 that's the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.730 
from 22 to 33 and 22 231 that's the
easiest<00:01:35.159> way<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> draw<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:36.150> small<00:01:37.049> island<00:01:37.350> or

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
easiest way to draw a small island or

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.289 
easiest way to draw a small island or
something<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.250> also<00:01:41.490> punch<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.030> some

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
something so we can also punch in some

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.240 
something so we can also punch in some
manual<00:01:42.990> coordinates<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.740> will<00:01:43.860> say<00:01:43.979> tile

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
manual coordinates here will say tile

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.630 
manual coordinates here will say tile
list<00:01:45.409> that's<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.590> value<00:01:47.009> good<00:01:47.220> value<00:01:47.549> will

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
list that's a value good value will

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.270 
list that's a value good value will
start<00:01:48.950> 27-25<00:01:51.110> will<00:01:52.110> set<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> terrain<00:01:52.770> type<00:01:53.070> on

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
start 27-25 will set the terrain type on

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.690 
start 27-25 will set the terrain type on
that<00:01:53.490> specific<00:01:54.390> tile<00:01:54.860> to<00:01:55.860> be<00:01:56.399> all

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
that specific tile to be all

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.039 
that specific tile to be all
hills<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.969> going<00:02:01.149> to<00:02:01.180> just<00:02:01.420> do<00:02:01.539> a<00:02:01.570> few<00:02:01.869> of

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
hills and I'm going to just do a few of

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.999 
hills and I'm going to just do a few of
these<00:02:02.170> here<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:02.799> copy<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:03.520> paste<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:05.740> for

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
these here and copy and paste just for

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:17.580 
these here and copy and paste just for
fun<00:02:06.219> let's<00:02:06.630> do<00:02:07.630> 28<00:02:08.140> 25<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:13.050> 28<00:02:14.050> 24<00:02:16.170> will<00:02:17.170> do<00:02:17.319> one

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
fun let's do 28 25 and 28 24 will do one

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.830 
fun let's do 28 25 and 28 24 will do one
more<00:02:17.830> with<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:18.330> mountain<00:02:19.330> instead<00:02:19.630> of

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
more with a mountain instead of

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:30.780 
more with a mountain instead of
foothills<00:02:20.410> so<00:02:20.800> we'll<00:02:20.890> say<00:02:21.190> about<00:02:22.860> 28<00:02:25.170> 28<00:02:26.730> 6<00:02:29.790> set

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
foothills so we'll say about 28 28 6 set

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.850 
foothills so we'll say about 28 28 6 set
that<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.209> a<00:02:31.239> mountain

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.220 

and<00:02:34.210> we'll<00:02:35.210> just<00:02:35.360> see<00:02:35.510> what<00:02:35.600> happens<00:02:35.660> when<00:02:36.140> we

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
and we'll just see what happens when we

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.770 
and we'll just see what happens when we
run<00:02:36.260> that

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.440 

and<00:02:41.110> as<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.800> can<00:02:41.950> see<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.340> drew<00:02:42.640> our<00:02:42.880> mountains

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
and as you can see it drew our mountains

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.570 
and as you can see it drew our mountains
to<00:02:44.140> those<00:02:44.319> coordinates<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.100> can<00:02:45.250> see<00:02:45.459> the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
to those coordinates and you can see the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.240 
to those coordinates and you can see the
coordinates<00:02:46.060> on<00:02:46.240> there<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.709> it's<00:02:47.980> kind<00:02:48.220> of

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
coordinates on there so it's kind of

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.309 
coordinates on there so it's kind of
hard<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.490> see<00:02:48.730> them<00:02:48.850> over<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.420> actual<00:02:50.050> tiles

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
hard to see them over the actual tiles

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.410 
hard to see them over the actual tiles
there<00:02:50.650> but<00:02:50.860> they're<00:02:51.580> drawing<00:02:51.850> in<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.060> proper

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
there but they're drawing in the proper

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.240 
there but they're drawing in the proper
locations<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:56.110> let's<00:02:56.470> go<00:02:56.590> ahead<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:56.740> turn<00:02:57.010> off

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
locations so let's go ahead and turn off

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.180 
locations so let's go ahead and turn off
our<00:02:57.930> go<00:02:58.930> back<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.230> our<00:02:59.350> world<00:02:59.560> screen<00:02:59.950> here

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
our go back to our world screen here

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.790 
our go back to our world screen here
real<00:03:00.310> quick<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:00.670> turn<00:03:00.880> off<00:03:01.090> our<00:03:01.800> coordinate

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
real quick and turn off our coordinate

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.860 
real quick and turn off our coordinate
view<00:03:05.730> run<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:06.940> one<00:03:07.120> more<00:03:07.300> time<00:03:09.360> all<00:03:10.360> right<00:03:10.569> I

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
view run that one more time all right I

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.630 
view run that one more time all right I
like<00:03:11.830> what<00:03:12.010> I'm<00:03:12.130> seeing<00:03:12.160> here<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:14.350> using<00:03:15.280> what

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
like what I'm seeing here so using what

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.030 
like what I'm seeing here so using what
you<00:03:15.820> have<00:03:15.850> learned<00:03:16.570> here<00:03:17.140> you<00:03:17.440> can<00:03:17.650> actually

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
you have learned here you can actually

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.580 
you have learned here you can actually
go<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.519> add<00:03:18.790> in<00:03:21.780> let's<00:03:22.780> see<00:03:22.959> where's<00:03:23.170> our<00:03:23.320> tile

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
go and add in let's see where's our tile
