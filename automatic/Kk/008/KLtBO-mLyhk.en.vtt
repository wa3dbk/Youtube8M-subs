00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.009
 video it will be a report so 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.390
 roughly speaking I explained to you my 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.550
 last race how did it go 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.960
 the results I did and what 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.160
 I liked what I liked least for 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.809
 introduce yourself a little bit this race 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.059
 it's the trail of the wild coast ruler 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.100
 the wild coast that is in its sixth 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.940
 edition and that took place on February 15 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.369
 2015 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.289
 a quaking Sunday so the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.810
 tremblade which is here in charente 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.439
 sea ​​near the sea super 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.560
 relocation so is this winch two 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.880
 separate races 1 18 km and 1.28 g in 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.890
 do I often lose kourouma 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.309
 perimeter of plus or minus 2 hours of 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.010
 Bordeaux 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.390
 little races like that here if a 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.010
 weekend I am available and that is 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.850
 a nice race bim I go for it 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.730
 and here is my number telli we have 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.770
 paid the race 16 euros so 16 euros 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.449
 the inscription is that slab knowing 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.070
 that if we did it before I believe that 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.300
 it was even cheaper finally sure 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.500
 it's even cheaper I do not know 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.300
 it was 14 12 euros 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.000
 but it was even cheaper leaving 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.989
 was given at 9 o'clock so it was on 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.030
 the sand very funny with as far as the eye can see 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.549
 the ocean the tide was very low so 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.970
 it was quite pretty with the glow of 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.520
 morning 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.220
 I really enjoyed actually started 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.080
 on the beach near the sea take a 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.090
 big breath of air that really made it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.290
 really really good it gives and 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.540
 full of energy actually 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.340
 and then the atmosphere from the start was summer 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.409
 given what end it was good franquette 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.540
 everyone was laughing at the smile 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.700
 the potato's lips it was really 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.170
 owl is very relaxed very very 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.659
 family despite eventually the world 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.060
 because 1500 people on a small 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.990
 beach barca weighs is not to say that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.329
 I do not remember 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.159
 honestly to hear the bench the prefect 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.350
 go from start but everyone is 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.509
 gone at the same time so well I'm 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.399
 left also after we had stops 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.829
 for a good ten minutes 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.409
 there were small passages of 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.299
 small trails where we had to sneak 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.500
 and kamba issued 500 people who leave 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.360
 at the same time we are only going 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.450
 drop 1 so we did not take their 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.860
 pace very quickly but hey we were 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.719
 there to have fun so there was 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.870
 no issue there is no fire to the lake 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.729
 as they say and here we are 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.310
 quickly arrive in the forest and it was great 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.710
 in fact we did not make any route during 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.530
 during this course it was 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.650
 it was perfect what finally 18 km in the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.480
 forest except for the small trails and 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.400
 from time to time we were typing sacred 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.940
 wall 200 m difference in altitude is not 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.790
 whew 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.740
 but sometimes it was impossible 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.260
 to run and had to put a market 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.320
 when and not used to doing 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.970
 regularly uneven between walking 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.870
 fast and run very, very slowly 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.480
 frankly the border is thin I 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.820
 could vary the land are worth a new 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.580
 course run in the forest by trails 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.530
 whose mud in the sand all that in 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.780
 only one race was really top 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:57.000
 I finish this race in 1h48 1:48 to 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.870
 18 kilometers so it's a rhythm of 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.150
 5 minutes 59 to the kilometer a little bit 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.040
 below the rate at which I'm going 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.290
 usually but there was so much 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.360
 of obstacles to this race that this 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.470
 explains this nothing to do with a 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.880
 race on bitumen 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.530
 again I advise you 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.130
 strongly this winch for a next 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.620
 edition 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.360
 I personally know that here 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.850
 maybe not next year but 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.340
 in 2 3 years I will try to try the 28 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.440
 km because really really loved 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.420
 this experience was a great 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.430
 race after that is what it takes 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.350
 to really know is that certainly when 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.360
 we do races that are sponsored 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.580
 by very big sports brands or 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.770
 who are in very big cities of 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.540
 France there are more show off ya more than 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.820
 this there is more of that there are 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.680
 partnership gifts that are prettier 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.860
 there are running t-shirts too 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.959
 that they are nicer after all 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.519
 we do not care at all, it's not about 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.959
 me important when we run a race 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.050
 really a great tee and not 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.610
 to have I do not know the crest in a 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.200
 super big city and all that is to have 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.000
 really a good atmosphere 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.060
 there are also very good races in 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.340
 campaign that really deserve their 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.900
 little success here voila hope this 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.610
 video you do more like homework 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.410
 share with you my first race of 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.850
 the year 2015 and I find you very 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.310
 quickly with a us 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.620
 report since the limare I 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.020
 will take the start of the half marathon of 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.300
 betting with the active meat team I have too much 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.300
 hurry it's going to be super hazard very fast
