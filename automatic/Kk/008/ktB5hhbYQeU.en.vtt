tips I'm going to start working on the

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.190 
tips I'm going to start working on the
branches<00:01:33.460> and<00:01:33.759> i'll<00:01:34.119> be<00:01:34.240> using<00:01:34.420> I<00:01:34.840> brake<00:01:35.170> for

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
branches and i'll be using I brake for

branches and i'll be using I brake for
manicures<00:01:36.039> by<00:01:36.250> OPI<00:01:38.159> looks<00:01:39.159> like<00:01:39.490> this<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
manicures by OPI looks like this and

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:57.800 
manicures by OPI looks like this and
we're<00:01:44.170> going<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.409> stab<00:01:44.799> a<00:01:45.539> blog

and we're just going to draw some rich

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.600 
and we're just going to draw some rich
branches<00:02:17.200> now<00:02:18.200> doesn't<00:02:18.680> have<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.920> be<00:02:19.040> perfect

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
branches now doesn't have to be perfect

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.890 
branches now doesn't have to be perfect
lines<00:02:20.300> cuz<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:21.050> know<00:02:21.850> branches<00:02:22.850> are<00:02:23.210> perfect

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
lines cuz you know branches are perfect

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.360 
lines cuz you know branches are perfect
lines<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:26.900> can<00:02:27.200> be<00:02:27.350> a<00:02:27.380> little<00:02:27.590> messy<00:02:27.800> you

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
lines so it can be a little messy you

00:02:28.370 --> 00:03:26.750 
lines so it can be a little messy you
want<00:02:28.640> them<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.940> be

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:55.870 

so<00:03:27.760> something<00:03:28.420> like<00:03:28.450> that

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880

okay so now that we're done with our

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.880 
okay so now that we're done with our
branches<00:03:58.520> we're<00:03:58.760> going<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:58.940> work<00:03:59.120> on<00:03:59.360> the

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
branches we're going to work on the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.430 
branches we're going to work on the
cherry<00:04:00.890> blossoms<00:04:01.960> I'm<00:04:02.960> going<00:04:03.170> to<00:04:03.230> be<00:04:03.290> using

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
cherry blossoms I'm going to be using

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.740 
cherry blossoms I'm going to be using
sugar<00:04:04.400> high<00:04:04.810> by<00:04:05.810> China<00:04:06.080> Glaze<00:04:06.430> it's<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.490> nice<00:04:07.750> on

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
sugar high by China Glaze it's a nice on

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:17.070 
sugar high by China Glaze it's a nice on
bright<00:04:09.200> pink<00:04:09.500> color<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:10.790> down<00:04:11.000> that<00:04:11.240> honor

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
and while you do the dots just gonna

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:55.870 
and while you do the dots just gonna
drag<00:04:43.300> them<00:04:43.540> to<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:43.750> middle

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.400 

nice<00:04:56.840> little<00:04:57.620> flower<00:04:57.830> like<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:59.170> I'm<00:05:00.170> just

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
nice little flower like that I'm just

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.620 
nice little flower like that I'm just
going<00:05:00.620> to<00:05:00.680> do<00:05:00.920> a<00:05:01.250> couple<00:05:01.430> of<00:05:01.730> them<00:05:01.940> on<00:05:02.420> the

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
going to do a couple of them on the

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:39.970 
going to do a couple of them on the
branches

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.040 

should<00:05:40.520> be<00:05:40.610> simply<00:05:40.940> doing<00:05:41.150> just<00:05:41.480> these<00:05:41.690> five

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
should be simply doing just these five

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:50.239 
should be simply doing just these five
little<00:05:42.500> dots

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:50.249 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:53.140 

so<00:05:50.579> something<00:05:51.299> like<00:05:51.329> that

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
so something like that

so something like that
ok<00:05:53.900> so<00:05:53.960> after<00:05:54.320> the<00:05:54.680> flowers<00:05:55.520> I've<00:05:55.700> tried<00:05:55.910> a

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
ok so after the flowers I've tried a

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.030 
ok so after the flowers I've tried a
little<00:05:56.120> bit<00:05:56.360> we're<00:05:56.540> going<00:05:56.780> to<00:05:56.990> UM<00:05:57.290> dot<00:05:57.860> the

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
little bit we're going to UM dot the

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.940 
little bit we're going to UM dot the
middle<00:05:58.310> as<00:05:58.850> you<00:05:59.090> can<00:05:59.270> see<00:05:59.510> my<00:05:59.810> pointer<00:06:00.380> here

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
middle as you can see my pointer here

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.570 
middle as you can see my pointer here
sort<00:06:01.550> of<00:06:02.110> we're<00:06:03.110> going<00:06:03.260> to<00:06:03.320> take<00:06:03.590> the<00:06:04.220> Polish

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
sort of we're going to take the Polish

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:10.570 
sort of we're going to take the Polish
I'll<00:06:04.730> be<00:06:04.850> used<00:06:05.090> with<00:06:05.270> branches<00:06:08.950> and<00:06:09.950> then

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
I'll be used with branches and then

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.540 
I'll be used with branches and then
you're<00:06:11.060> going<00:06:11.210> to<00:06:11.270> take<00:06:11.860> something<00:06:12.860> like<00:06:13.490> a

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
you're going to take something like a

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:22.050
