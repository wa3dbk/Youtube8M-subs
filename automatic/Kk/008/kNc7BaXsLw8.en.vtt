00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
probably want to do is to set up of

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.230 
probably want to do is to set up of
stinky<00:00:18.660> like<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.199> um<00:00:19.650> basically<00:00:20.520> put<00:00:21.029> a

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
stinky like this um basically put a

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.810 
stinky like this um basically put a
workbench<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.289> middle<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.800> HS<00:00:23.279> dunny

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
workbench in the middle and HS dunny

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.109 
workbench in the middle and HS dunny
dispenser<00:00:24.480> right<00:00:24.779> next<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:26.119> basically

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
dispenser right next to it and basically

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.269 
dispenser right next to it and basically
what<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.689> will<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.109> that's<00:00:28.590> normally

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
what this will do is that's normally

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.640 
what this will do is that's normally
when<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.789> would<00:00:30.060> make<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> crafting<00:00:31.260> recipe

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
when you would make a crafting recipe

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.220 
when you would make a crafting recipe
inside<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.099> workbench<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.820> exit<00:00:33.750> out<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
inside the workbench and exit out of the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.959 
inside the workbench and exit out of the
inventory<00:00:34.469> everything<00:00:35.250> would<00:00:35.579> drop<00:00:35.790> out

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
inventory everything would drop out

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.150 
inventory everything would drop out
right<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.360> front<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.809> however<00:00:37.620> now<00:00:37.829> when

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
right in front of you however now when

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.040 
right in front of you however now when
you<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.520> formation<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.570> stays<00:00:40.020> in

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
you have this formation it stays in

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.260 
you have this formation it stays in
there<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:40.950> sort<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.340> crafting<00:00:41.879> recipe

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270

now when you trigger or send a redstone
signal<00:00:45.420> into<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.410> workbench<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.579> actually

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
signal into the workbench it actually

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.600

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
the spencer it can actually go into a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.420 
the spencer it can actually go into a
chest<00:01:21.390> if<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.590> entity<00:01:22.799> actually

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
chest if it if the entity actually

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.539 
chest if it if the entity actually
touches<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.180> know<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.549> melon

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
touches it so you know here it's melon

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.490 
touches it so you know here it's melon
PP<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:28.110> recipe<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> melon<00:01:29.850> block<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.780> it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
PP the recipe is to a melon block so it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.440 
PP the recipe is to a melon block so it
stores<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.100> automatically<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.939> right<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.329> we

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
stores it automatically so right here we

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.020 
stores it automatically so right here we
have<00:01:33.479> seven<00:01:33.990> melons<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.619> here<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.130> if<00:01:35.310> i<00:01:35.430> do
