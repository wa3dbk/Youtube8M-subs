00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.050
 turn of the nzxt phantom 530 so a new 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.320
 ghosts that truly resembles 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.449
 ghosts first of the name more harmonious 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.830
 and with a touch of alienware 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.079
 for those who knew the case 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.649
 alienware of the time we always have the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.840
 door to the front with bays 5.25 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.940
 inches that goes out on top we have 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.850
 fans the usb outlets 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.590
 audio output and power ' 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.670
 we are on something that is very 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.670
 very simple in design 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.340
 from a chassis point of view also 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.660
 on something rather classic that 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.879
 stays very good with a lot 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.000
 location for the hard drives of 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.549
 the bay 5 25 inches of access 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.979
 backplate passages for the cable 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.320
 management and some cash at the level of 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.000
 ventilation we have 1,200 in front and a 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.320
 140 mm at the back 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.770
 we will show you now what we 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.470
 can do else with the version 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.850
 white who is here 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.620
 it is in this white version 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.020
 this little accessory that is very 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.420
 sympathetic this fund is like a 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.570
 so had to then we have a backplate 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.250
 more here a heatsink with a 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.170
 80 fan blowing his air 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.970
 on vrm and everything is compatible 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.980
 with acp ue and this world directly 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.710
 on a plate of ayew so in fact a 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.810
 sort of bac tray including a mini backplate 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.430
 and one on plyer over it 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.590
 also cable management office for 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.660
 watercooling pipes a good 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.470
 idea it should propose around 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.140
 50 euros in tariff we finish with 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:04.960
 finish not at all a little trick of 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:07.110
 the black version of the 530 ghost with a 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.220
 complete watercooling integration 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.280
 finally the last case that will be 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.560
 available it's the h2 130 to the tale will have 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.050
 a black version a white version 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.250
 a case that wants to dedicate itself to silence 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.920
 we have a door with insulation 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.140
 behind three bays 5 25 inches the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.110
 year ventilation in 120 mm and the 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.730
 chassis and is of the classic type with 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.430
 insulation on the front doors and 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.230
 back no cash 7 expansion slots 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.180
 hdd cages rather conventional and a 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.430
 rate that should be around 69 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.980
 euros about because she's going to see at 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.540
 nzxt and we'll see you soon with 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.010
 a little review to finish two one on 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.350
 one in the fog but no one does not 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.680
 not sure at all if you are told 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.680
 ac or later
