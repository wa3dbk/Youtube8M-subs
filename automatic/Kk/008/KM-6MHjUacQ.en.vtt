success<00:02:50.280> for<00:02:51.280> everybody<00:02:51.760> involved<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.990> point

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
success for everybody involved a point

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.369 
success for everybody involved a point
of<00:02:53.620> real<00:02:53.800> pride

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.089 

the<00:03:01.219> things<00:03:01.519> that<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:01.819> really<00:03:02.299> was<00:03:03.230> quite

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
the things that I really was quite

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.030 
the things that I really was quite
curious<00:03:04.430> about<00:03:05.019> was<00:03:06.019> what<00:03:06.260> was<00:03:06.439> being<00:03:06.709> done<00:03:06.980> in

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
curious about was what was being done in

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.830 
curious about was what was being done in
the<00:03:07.249> Peachtree<00:03:07.609> corridor

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
the Peachtree corridor

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.089 
the Peachtree corridor
and<00:03:09.349> we<00:03:09.560> went<00:03:09.829> down<00:03:10.159> into<00:03:10.639> the<00:03:11.060> shaft<00:03:11.659> and<00:03:12.099> it

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
and we went down into the shaft and it

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.660 
and we went down into the shaft and it
was<00:03:13.280> like<00:03:13.519> going<00:03:13.790> down<00:03:14.180> into<00:03:14.569> a<00:03:14.599> mine<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.670> the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
was like going down into a mine and the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.390 
was like going down into a mine and the
granite<00:03:17.389> walls<00:03:17.750> which<00:03:18.409> was<00:03:18.620> being<00:03:18.920> bored

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
granite walls which was being bored

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.069 
granite walls which was being bored
water<00:03:22.400> dripping<00:03:22.819> and<00:03:23.349> I<00:03:24.349> had<00:03:24.680> this<00:03:25.060> incredible

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
water dripping and I had this incredible

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.229 
water dripping and I had this incredible
feeling<00:03:27.079> that<00:03:27.319> I<00:03:27.829> was<00:03:28.189> entering<00:03:28.609> another

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
feeling that I was entering another

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.259 
feeling that I was entering another
world<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.349> that's<00:03:31.129> where<00:03:31.519> the<00:03:31.760> construction

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
world and that's where the construction

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.399 
world and that's where the construction
of<00:03:32.599> Marta<00:03:33.109> was<00:03:33.290> taking<00:03:33.769> place<00:03:34.040> that<00:03:34.760> tunnel

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
of Marta was taking place that tunnel

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:39.099 
of Marta was taking place that tunnel
symbolized<00:03:36.409> to<00:03:36.680> me<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.609> fact<00:03:37.909> that<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:38.840> was

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
symbolized to me the fact that this was

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.619 
symbolized to me the fact that this was
a<00:03:39.139> prodigious<00:03:39.769> job<00:03:40.250> but<00:03:40.969> it<00:03:41.090> was<00:03:41.209> going<00:03:41.419> to<00:03:41.480> get

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
a prodigious job but it was going to get

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.069 
a prodigious job but it was going to get
done<00:03:41.900> at<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.980> core<00:03:43.280> at<00:03:43.699> the<00:03:43.760> core<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.569> think<00:03:44.629> we

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
done at the core at the core I think we

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.020 
done at the core at the core I think we
we<00:03:46.010> we<00:03:46.370> did<00:03:46.609> we<00:03:47.180> did<00:03:47.750> we<00:03:47.959> did<00:03:48.109> the<00:03:48.379> right<00:03:48.530> thing

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
we we did we did we did the right thing

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.020 
we we did we did we did the right thing
we<00:03:50.030> got<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.239> lot<00:03:50.480> of<00:03:50.629> dedicated<00:03:51.409> people<00:03:52.030> who

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
we got a lot of dedicated people who

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.599 
we got a lot of dedicated people who
worked<00:03:53.359> hard<00:03:53.659> and<00:03:54.159> who<00:03:55.159> worked<00:03:55.459> selflessly<00:03:57.609> to

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
worked hard and who worked selflessly to

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.179 
worked hard and who worked selflessly to
make<00:03:58.819> this<00:03:59.030> thing<00:03:59.239> happen<00:03:59.359> and<00:04:00.019> and<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:01.129> think

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:01.189 
make this thing happen and and I think

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:10.450 
make this thing happen and and I think
the<00:04:01.609> results<00:04:02.510> speak<00:04:02.599> for<00:04:03.290> itself

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.030 

when<00:04:11.460> people<00:04:11.670> ask<00:04:12.000> me<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.930> they<00:04:13.530> have<00:04:13.740> over

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
when people ask me and they have over

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.770 
when people ask me and they have over
the<00:04:14.130> years<00:04:14.190> when<00:04:14.760> will<00:04:14.940> more<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.240> be<00:04:15.360> finished

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
the years when will more to be finished

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.160 
the years when will more to be finished
I<00:04:16.049> always<00:04:16.709> answer<00:04:16.920> I<00:04:17.100> hope<00:04:17.430> never<00:04:17.959> because<00:04:18.959> it

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
I always answer I hope never because it

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.380 
I always answer I hope never because it
should<00:04:19.440> just<00:04:19.650> keep<00:04:19.920> expanding<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.820> be<00:04:21.359> a

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
should just keep expanding and be a

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.090 
should just keep expanding and be a
benefit<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.290> surrounding<00:04:22.800> metropolitan

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
benefit to the surrounding metropolitan

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.420 
benefit to the surrounding metropolitan
area<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:24.180> see<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.600> system<00:04:25.170> that<00:04:25.500> is<00:04:25.800> modern

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
area I see a system that is modern

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.930 
area I see a system that is modern

extend<00:04:38.310> those<00:04:38.490> trunk<00:04:38.850> lines<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:40.710> that's

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
extend those trunk lines and that's

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.670 
extend those trunk lines and that's
going<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.370> happen<00:04:41.490> within<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:42.060> next<00:04:42.300> 30

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
doubt in my mind I think it will

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.850 
doubt in my mind I think it will
continue<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.450> serve<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:48.990> needs<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.560> millions

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
continue to serve the needs of millions

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.590 
continue to serve the needs of millions
of<00:04:50.220> people<00:04:50.700> it<00:04:51.270> will<00:04:51.540> reduce<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:52.080> impact<00:04:52.860> of

of people it will reduce the impact of

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.900 
of people it will reduce the impact of
pollution<00:04:54.600> and<00:04:55.230> it<00:04:55.710> will<00:04:55.890> contribute<00:04:56.310> to<00:04:56.580> his
