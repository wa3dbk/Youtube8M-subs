 we are already an existing user with a 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.200

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.890
 We will register as a new user 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.470

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.380
 email and a password one 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.409

 the email and the password on the screen 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.869
 the next screen that is going to 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.679
 show is this with the different 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.320
 data options to restore as 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.840

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.790
 let's say the data we click the option of 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.190
 data when we click the option of 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.229
 data here shows us already the different 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.330
 options to make the copy or 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.170
 backup as contacts records of 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.229

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.300
 browser data and let's go 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.179
 activating or deactivating independence 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.610
 of the elements we want to make 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.170
 copies and we wanted to make copies 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.459
 of all of all the foods we are going to 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.280
 activate them all of course and if 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.650
 we only want 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.230
 to make copies of just for example 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.140
 of messages or only of photos we are going to 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.660
 activate the same elements we are going to 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.000
 try to activate only a few because 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.240
 if we are going to activate if we activate it all 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.270
 it may take a little longer what is the 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.200
 backup we're going to only is 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.300
 take photos 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.330
 and we're going to click where the 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.280
 ready option so that it already starts to 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.160
 perform 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.750
 what is the backup or the 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.819
 backup as you can see shows us 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.610
 this screen with the different 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.920
 options to have the backup 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.690
 and in case one time already or the first 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.230
 Once we register we already have a 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.629
 jig 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.560
 and space to store everything is the 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:08.900
 Content online in the cloud for 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.879
 access it from anywhere 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.380
 here we can also update if 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:18.720
 we want to buy 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:22.630
 a subscription to the application but 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.850
 pay but I believe with the option d 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.340
 this application in the free version 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.870
 we can do anything here 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.540
 also the configuration option 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.890
 we can do the configuration as 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.660
 can see here the options that we 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.610
 shows make a backup 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.370
 just make a backup just 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.190
 when when we are connecting to wifi 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.650
 so that it does not go out to the network mobile network 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.650
 allow notifications in the bar 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.440
 if we want so that anything does not 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.660
 shows us a notification in our 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.610
 mobile device schedule the copy of 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.450
 security at a given time of 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.490
 day also change the battery level 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.440
 make the safe copy only by 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.570
 example when we are half or more of 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.330
 half of the battery so that we do not 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.610
 we are without it and the 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.470
 device here since the 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.230
 configuration we can do the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.380
 relevant settings to this 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.209
 application the truth is very interesting 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.269
 application 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.039
 to backup or backup 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.710
 of all the content if at any time 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:29.440
 our android device can 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.330
 present around or you have to format 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.330
 it or we just change it from a 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.639
 device and we want to have the same 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.910
 contacts or call records or 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.130
 the same messages we had in 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.169
 our old android the same files 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.780
 of our music from our documents 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.220
