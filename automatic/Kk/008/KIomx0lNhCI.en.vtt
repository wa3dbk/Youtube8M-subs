00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.050
 evolution and this is the fifth part of my 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.119
 Russian city in minecraft 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.759

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.640
 there will be small updates and proper 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:29.970
 in this part I will show schools well 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.590
 so let's see how by the way 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.550
 we could only notice him for a bit 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.309
 change skin 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.770
 let's see what update we have 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.800
 in this city we have these 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.940
 residential buildings 3 more residential buildings 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:50.490
 here is the first house 2 house and there is a third one 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:54.600
 house water yes and what do we have further further 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.360
 we have a school so let's go 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.360
 say what for what i built these 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.750
 at home so we have in the city of Magadan 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.970
 star 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.769
 we have city asha inflicted city 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.350
 Metro we have a city school and even 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.630
 houses if I had not built these three 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.820
 residential buildings we would have only one 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.100
 so I decided to build such residential 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.109
 buildings for me it was not difficult 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.799
 because of course I helped 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:20.429
 evolution 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.200
 but mostly we focused on school 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:27.149
 let's see what we got 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.689
 school school us is u have here in 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.990
 yard 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.219
 these three houses I don't know maybe 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.840
 surrounded by a fence yet 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.090
 but generally we have such a school 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.840
 it turned out quite beautiful 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.479
 beautiful school 1 is written 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.399
 here is vodka there is a school itself 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.969
 made of bricks and made of 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.869
 bricks 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:52.259
 with a brick block more precisely so we have here 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.960
 there is such a small and there is a garden girl 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.420

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.750
 there is a volleyball court too 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.399
 pretty nicely done and here but 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.700
 the truth is I probably donâ€™t know we 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.770
 throw or not yes you can throw 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.379
 sure thing but with difficulty 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.810
 as you can see some things are standing here 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.430
 us among the judge I did not know how to do 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.290
 because it was hard enough 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.000
 make it stand in 10 by drawing 12 you can 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.549
 sit back if you are tired 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.769

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.319
 the other half 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:32.430
 what kind of things are you I in general here we have 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.590
 on the other half of the football field and here 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.799
 we play how to become brown 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.049
 the team is against such clothes 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:43.420
 purple teams were walking on the face worth 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.880
 white and there they have brown flocks up 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.270
 in general, then what 's next we 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.550

 He is called not to get wet under 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.390
 rain and color stand to become so 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:14.170
 let's go further so we see 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.450
 we can change our shoes here 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.360

 In the eyes of this board to this board I 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.920
 changed specifically for this type so 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.900

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.060
 change the door back but in general we 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.190
 here we see here such tables for 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:04.660
