00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
kind of like this here's an example

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.070 
kind of like this here's an example
let's<00:01:14.759> say<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> web<00:01:15.240> address<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.630> something

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
let's say the web address is something

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.070 
let's say the web address is something
like<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:18.000> basically<00:01:18.509> we're<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.960> do

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
like this so basically we're going to do

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.560 
like this so basically we're going to do
is<00:01:19.520> take<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.729> web<00:01:20.880> address<00:01:21.000> i<00:01:21.330> showed<00:01:21.540> you

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
is take the web address i showed you

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.100 
is take the web address i showed you
before<00:01:21.690> and<00:01:22.560> then<00:01:22.920> take<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> loss<00:01:24.110> six

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
before and then take the loss six

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.960 
before and then take the loss six
numbers<00:01:25.530> from<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.970> game<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.960> web<00:01:28.170> address<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
numbers from the game be web address and

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.779 
numbers from the game be web address and
work<00:01:29.970> together<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.979> as<00:01:31.979> shown<00:01:32.610> like

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
work together with that as shown like

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.570 
work together with that as shown like
this<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:34.229> then<00:01:34.380> after<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.830> it<00:01:35.100> will<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.399> to

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
this and then after that it will have to

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.270 
this and then after that it will have to
put<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.180> mozilla<00:01:36.630> firefox<00:01:37.229> because<00:01:37.590> some

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
put on mozilla firefox because some

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.669 
put on mozilla firefox because some
reason<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.640> doesn't<00:01:38.789> work<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.210> regular<00:01:39.630> air<00:01:39.869> to

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
reason it doesn't work on regular air to

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.320 
reason it doesn't work on regular air to
go<00:01:40.830> on<00:01:40.950> mozilla<00:01:41.850> firefox<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.690> then<00:01:44.240> put<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
go on mozilla firefox and then put the

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.270 
go on mozilla firefox and then put the
web<00:01:45.479> address<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.319> next<00:01:46.560> once<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.009> put<00:01:47.190> in
