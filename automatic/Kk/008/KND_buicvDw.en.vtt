because<00:00:45.899> if<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.110> move<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.500> you'll<00:00:46.620> have<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
because if you move it you'll have to

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.160 
because if you move it you'll have to
wiggle<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.219> around<00:00:47.280> again<00:00:47.730> another<00:00:48.690> more

simple technique for getting some
objects<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.480> stay<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.930> creating<00:00:52.590> an<00:00:52.710> immovable

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
