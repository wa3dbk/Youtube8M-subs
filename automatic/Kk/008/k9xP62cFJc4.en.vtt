00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.890
 when we are on top of a vehicle that 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.050
 we can do it with play with the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.460

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.580

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.950

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.270

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.510
 the very easy bike mounted on it 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.490
 motorbike we obviously go to the language 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.930
 body and we move a little bit like I'm 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.910
 saying me to the weapons menu 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.890
 then we make sure that it can carry 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.570
 shielding yes we're going to 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.480

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.170

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.690
 I'm going to pass radio abolishing this 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.549
 It takes a long time and as you see guys once 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.890
 we already appear in the game where 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.659
 We were featured mounted on the motorcycle 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.650
 and the only thing left to do without 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.030
 get off of it 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.160
 we have to go back to armor 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.530
 body and move the menu of the 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.720
 weapons a little worth everything and guys 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.200
 I move the weapons menu and when I get off 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.910
