00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
eyeball it real quick try and see where

eyeball it real quick try and see where
where<00:01:38.510> things<00:01:38.750> are<00:01:38.930> you<00:01:39.080> don't<00:01:39.260> to<00:01:39.350> spend<00:01:39.560> a

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
where things are you don't to spend a

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.320 
where things are you don't to spend a
whole<00:01:39.710> lot<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:39.920> time<00:01:40.160> and<00:01:40.430> trying<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.180> figure

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
whole lot of time and trying to figure

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.550 
whole lot of time and trying to figure
out<00:01:41.360> how<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.510> get<00:01:41.960> into<00:01:42.140> one<00:01:42.230> of<00:01:42.290> these<00:01:42.380> things

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
out how to get into one of these things

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.900 
out how to get into one of these things
a<00:01:42.710> little<00:01:43.070> bit<00:01:43.250> different<00:01:43.660> this<00:01:44.660> one<00:01:44.840> as<00:01:45.910> screw

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
a little bit different this one as screw

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.750 
a little bit different this one as screw
is<00:01:47.030> going<00:01:47.210> all<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.360> way<00:01:47.420> around<00:01:48.460> which<00:01:49.460> should

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
is going all the way around which should

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.490 
is going all the way around which should
release<00:01:50.120> the<00:01:50.870> bulk<00:01:51.110> of<00:01:51.230> it

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
release the bulk of it

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.910 
release the bulk of it
and<00:01:52.220> it<00:01:52.940> looks<00:01:53.120> like<00:01:53.240> this<00:01:54.080> wheel<00:01:54.380> right<00:01:54.590> here

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
and it looks like this wheel right here

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.440 
and it looks like this wheel right here
it's<00:01:55.730> kind<00:01:55.940> of<00:01:55.970> grooved

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
it's kind of grooved

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.940 
it's kind of grooved
so<00:01:56.990> you<00:01:57.920> can<00:01:58.040> probably<00:01:58.330> unscrew<00:01:59.330> that<00:01:59.360> and

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
so you can probably unscrew that and

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.899 
so you can probably unscrew that and
take<00:02:00.950> this<00:02:01.460> black<00:02:02.150> plastic<00:02:02.330> piece<00:02:02.810> off

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
take this black plastic piece off

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.680 
take this black plastic piece off
so<00:02:04.420> let's<00:02:04.540> get<00:02:04.630> started<00:02:05.130> all<00:02:06.130> right<00:02:06.640> so<00:02:07.600> it

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
so let's get started all right so it

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:18.240 
so let's get started all right so it
looks<00:02:07.900> like<00:02:07.960> we've<00:02:08.229> got<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:09.990> Torx<00:02:10.990> bit

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.390 

just<00:02:18.670> kick<00:02:19.090> off<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.480> screw<00:02:20.130> I've<00:02:21.130> already

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
just kick off the screw I've already

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.080
