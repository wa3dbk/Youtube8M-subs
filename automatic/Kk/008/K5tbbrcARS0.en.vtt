00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
know not thinking about logically if

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.060 
know not thinking about logically if
they<00:01:42.509> yeah<00:01:42.660> they<00:01:42.960> extend<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.710> didn't<00:01:43.979> look

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
they yeah they extend it didn't look

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.120 
they yeah they extend it didn't look
like<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.250> regular<00:01:44.520> sedan<00:01:45.710> they<00:01:46.710> would<00:01:46.860> get<00:01:46.950> too

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
like a regular sedan they would get too

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.960 
like a regular sedan they would get too
big<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.550> back

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
big in the back

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.020 
big in the back
yeah<00:01:48.090> too<00:01:48.690> long<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.899> think<00:01:49.080> yeah<00:01:49.410> made<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.710> look

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
yeah too long I think yeah made it look

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.800 
yeah too long I think yeah made it look
proportional<00:01:51.030> then<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.330> wheelbase<00:01:51.630> would

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
proportional then the wheelbase would

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.870 
proportional then the wheelbase would
get<00:01:51.960> too<00:01:52.110> long<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.560> yeah<00:01:52.740> too<00:01:53.130> slow<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.490> handle

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
get too long and yeah too slow to handle

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.219 
get too long and yeah too slow to handle
