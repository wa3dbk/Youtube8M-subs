first thing you're going to need to do
is<00:00:17.660> create<00:00:18.660> an<00:00:18.779> object<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.500> then<00:00:20.010> ah<00:00:20.990> a<00:00:21.990> new

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
is create an object and then ah a new

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.589 
is create an object and then ah a new
material<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.510> make<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:25.160> reflective<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.599> just

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
material and make it reflective so just

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.359 
material and make it reflective so just
make<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:28.140> now<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:29.300> like<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.369> change

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
make it for now and like that and change

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.119 
make it for now and like that and change
the<00:00:32.550> color<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:34.610> yeah<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.129> just

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
the color and yeah like that so just

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.350 
the color and yeah like that so just
drag<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.460> over<00:00:38.670> here<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:40.040> as<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.100> see<00:00:41.520> North

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
drag it over here and as you see North

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.779 
drag it over here and as you see North
flexion<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:44.070> first<00:00:44.309> thing<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.610> need<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
flexion so the first thing you need to

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.240 
flexion so the first thing you need to
do<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:46.670> crane<00:00:47.670> or<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.469> my<00:00:49.469> voice<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:50.010> crack

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
do is crane or a my voice going crack

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.189 
do is crane or a my voice going crack
with<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.640> because<00:00:50.910> i<00:00:52.430> always<00:00:53.430> go<00:00:53.670> ah<00:00:56.420> yeah<00:00:57.420> so

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
with that because i always go ah yeah so

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.359 
with that because i always go ah yeah so
a<00:00:59.129> light<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.180> well<00:01:00.649> creighton<00:01:01.649> array<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:03.140> then

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
a light as well creighton array and then

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.080 
a light as well creighton array and then
scale<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> array<00:01:05.729> up<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.939> then

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
scale the array up like that and then

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.840 
scale the array up like that and then
just<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.840> know<00:01:09.960> make<00:01:10.799> its<00:01:10.950> shadow<00:01:11.220> map<00:01:11.549> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
just you know make its shadow map and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.200 
just you know make its shadow map and
then<00:01:13.820> just<00:01:14.820> mess<00:01:15.330> around<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.780> intensity<00:01:17.210> like

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
then just mess around the intensity like

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.469 
then just mess around the intensity like
that<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.070> going<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.159> not<00:01:20.310> duplicate<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.150> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that and going to not duplicate that and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.760 
that and going to not duplicate that and
rotate<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:23.720> that<00:01:25.580> like<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.610> oh<00:01:27.770> like

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
rotate it like that like that oh like

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.280 
rotate it like that like that oh like
that<00:01:29.040> yeah<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:32.570> next<00:01:33.570> thing<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.900> gotta<00:01:34.079> do<00:01:34.259> is

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
that yeah so next thing we gotta do is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.810 
that yeah so next thing we gotta do is
create<00:01:35.070> these<00:01:35.280> reflections<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:37.579> create<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.640> new

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
create these reflections so create a new

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.569 
create these reflections so create a new
play<00:01:39.770> like<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.899> a<00:01:42.899> new<00:01:43.439> material<00:01:43.619> like

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
play like that and a new material like

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.380 
play like that and a new material like
that<00:01:45.259> uncheck<00:01:46.259> color<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.890> specular<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.000> go

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that uncheck color and specular and go

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.010 
that uncheck color and specular and go
to<00:01:48.450> luminance<00:01:49.159> make<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.420> like<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.750> about

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
to luminance make it like that to about

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.969 
to luminance make it like that to about
a<00:01:52.140> thousand<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:54.680> something<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.770> I'm

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
a thousand like that something like I'm

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.560 
a thousand like that something like I'm

guys<00:02:08.270> so<00:02:09.270> adapt<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.470> play

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
guys so adapt you play

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.550 
guys so adapt you play
and<00:02:12.900> then<00:02:13.260> what<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.310> gotta<00:02:14.490> do<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.180> like

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
and then what you gotta do is just like

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.970 
and then what you gotta do is just like
move<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.770> up<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.310> then<00:02:18.140> in<00:02:19.140> fact<00:02:19.500> change<00:02:19.860> this

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
move it up and then in fact change this

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.060 
move it up and then in fact change this
pad<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.720> 100<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.930> then<00:02:24.440> green<00:02:25.440> area<00:02:25.860> light

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
pad to 100 and then green area light

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:36.350 
pad to 100 and then green area light
like<00:02:26.460> that<00:02:28.610> then<00:02:31.970> ah<00:02:32.970> yeah<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:35.120> let<00:02:36.120> me<00:02:36.210> to

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
like that then ah yeah so let me to

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.270 
like that then ah yeah so let me to
rotate<00:02:36.780> this<00:02:37.080> like<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:38.370> about<00:02:38.550> 90<00:02:38.820> degrees

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
rotate this like to about 90 degrees

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.790 
rotate this like to about 90 degrees
like<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.690> whoops<00:02:43.340> like<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.820> then

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
like that whoops like that and then

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.720 
like that whoops like that and then
scale<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.830> up<00:02:48.740> like<00:02:49.740> this<00:02:51.590> like<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:53.610> it

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
scale it up like this like that so it

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.590 
scale it up like this like that so it
fits<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.360> cube<00:02:55.140> right<00:02:55.740> i<00:02:55.950> mean<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.880> plane

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
fits the cube right i mean the the plane

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.040 
fits the cube right i mean the the plane
and<00:02:58.170> then<00:02:58.650> next<00:02:59.580> thing<00:02:59.730> we<00:02:59.910> gotta<00:03:00.120> do<00:03:00.330> is<00:03:00.950> go<00:03:01.950> G

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
and then next thing we gotta do is go G

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.380 
and then next thing we gotta do is go G
to<00:03:04.050> like<00:03:04.230> compose<00:03:04.920> these<00:03:05.130> together<00:03:05.340> like<00:03:06.120> that

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
to like compose these together like that

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
to like compose these together like that
it<00:03:07.230> basically<00:03:07.440> creates<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.310> soft<00:03:08.580> box<00:03:08.850> for<00:03:09.410> the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
it basically creates a soft box for the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.500 
it basically creates a soft box for the
cube<00:03:11.070> so<00:03:11.910> next<00:03:12.840> thing<00:03:13.020> we're<00:03:13.140> going<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.290> do<00:03:13.470> is

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
cube so next thing we're going to do is

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.980 
cube so next thing we're going to do is
shift<00:03:15.510> click<00:03:15.840> both<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.680> these<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.280> then

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
shift click both of these and then

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.790 
shift click both of these and then
cinema<00:03:18.990> 4d<00:03:19.260> tags<00:03:19.820> compositing<00:03:21.260> uncheck<00:03:22.260> these

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
cinema 4d tags compositing uncheck these

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.960 
cinema 4d tags compositing uncheck these
two<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.060> then<00:03:25.020> do<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.350> same<00:03:25.970> for

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
two and this and then do the same for

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.860 
two and this and then do the same for
these<00:03:27.180> as<00:03:27.420> well<00:03:28.250> like<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.690> got<00:03:30.840> a

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
these as well like that so you got a

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.070 
these as well like that so you got a
nice<00:03:31.020> soft<00:03:31.380> box<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.760> then<00:03:32.910> duplicate<00:03:33.810> this

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
nice soft box and then duplicate this

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.310 
nice soft box and then duplicate this
and<00:03:34.920> made<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:36.080> thousand<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:37.320> then<00:03:39.320> create

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
and made this a thousand and then create

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.340 
and made this a thousand and then create
another<00:03:40.500> plane<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:42.120> then<00:03:42.540> just<00:03:42.840> move<00:03:43.080> this

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
another plane and then just move this

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.680 
another plane and then just move this
like<00:03:43.650> any<00:03:44.430> way<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.300> would<00:03:45.360> like<00:03:45.540> the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
like any way you would like the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.590 
like any way you would like the
reflection<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.410> be<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:47.160> if<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.910> put<00:03:48.090> some<00:03:48.270> caps

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
reflection to be so if I put some caps

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.360 
reflection to be so if I put some caps
on<00:03:48.840> this<00:03:48.990> cube<00:03:49.800> right<00:03:49.980> here<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:52.340> move<00:03:53.340> this

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
on this cube right here and move this

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.560 
on this cube right here and move this
plane<00:03:53.820> over<00:03:54.330> here<00:03:54.540> like<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:56.330> maybe<00:03:57.330> like

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
plane over here like that maybe like

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.449 
plane over here like that maybe like
this<00:03:57.780> angle<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:59.000> then<00:04:00.000> make<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:01.110> not<00:04:02.070> be<00:04:02.220> seen

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
this angle and then make it not be seen

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.120 
this angle and then make it not be seen
by<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.640> camera<00:04:03.230> you'll<00:04:04.230> see<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.620> get<00:04:04.800> nice

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
by the camera you'll see you get nice

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.900 
by the camera you'll see you get nice
reflection<00:04:05.820> like<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:07.550> look<00:04:08.550> at<00:04:08.700> that

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
reflection like that look at that

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.620 
reflection like that look at that
beautiful<00:04:10.190> beautiful<00:04:11.239> almost<00:04:12.239> as<00:04:12.480> beautiful

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
beautiful beautiful almost as beautiful

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.789 
beautiful beautiful almost as beautiful
as<00:04:12.959> my<00:04:13.110> muscles<00:04:13.620> yeah<00:04:14.959> man<00:04:15.959> sounds<00:04:16.290> like<00:04:16.440> I<00:04:16.620> got

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
as my muscles yeah man sounds like I got

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.770 
as my muscles yeah man sounds like I got
a<00:04:16.830> cold<00:04:17.100> man<00:04:17.989> but<00:04:18.989> yeah<00:04:19.260> like

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
a cold man but yeah like

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.030 
a cold man but yeah like
that's<00:04:21.500> how<00:04:21.739> you<00:04:21.799> made<00:04:22.040> like<00:04:22.900> nice

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
that's how you made like nice

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.290 
that's how you made like nice
reflections<00:04:25.040> like<00:04:25.190> that<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:27.910> this<00:04:28.910> saves<00:04:29.210> you

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
reflections like that and this saves you

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.300 
reflections like that and this saves you
using<00:04:29.660> hasty<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:30.139> images<00:04:30.830> so<00:04:31.639> if<00:04:31.940> we<00:04:33.280> train<00:04:34.280> a

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
using hasty I images so if we train a

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.230 
using hasty I images so if we train a
new<00:04:34.430> plane<00:04:34.880> like<00:04:35.180> this<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:36.910> move<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.120> over

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
new plane like this and move it over

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.210 
new plane like this and move it over
here<00:04:38.419> like<00:04:39.020> that<00:04:39.290> and<00:04:40.240> then<00:04:42.040> move<00:04:43.040> it<00:04:43.190> over

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
here like that and then move it over

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.270 
here like that and then move it over
here<00:04:43.460> like<00:04:43.790> that<00:04:44.030> look<00:04:44.360> at<00:04:44.540> that<00:04:44.750> man<00:04:45.280> even

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
here like that look at that man even

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.150 
here like that look at that man even
then<00:04:46.490> can't<00:04:46.790> even<00:04:47.000> do<00:04:47.120> something<00:04:47.360> like<00:04:47.480> this

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
then can't even do something like this

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.300 
then can't even do something like this
not<00:04:49.160> even<00:04:49.190> not<00:04:49.730> not<00:04:49.940> even<00:04:49.970> saying<00:04:50.480> like<00:04:51.110> I<00:04:51.470> mean

at<00:05:03.440> he's<00:05:03.560> nasty<00:05:03.860> ass<00:05:04.130> reflections<00:05:04.910> right<00:05:05.090> here

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
at he's nasty ass reflections right here

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.450 
at he's nasty ass reflections right here
man<00:05:05.650> so<00:05:07.060> if<00:05:08.060> you<00:05:08.240> want<00:05:08.450> these<00:05:09.070> reflections<00:05:10.070> to

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
man so if you want these reflections to

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.520 
man so if you want these reflections to
like<00:05:10.669> stay<00:05:11.120> with<00:05:11.300> cube<00:05:11.660> all<00:05:12.200> g<00:05:12.650> d's<00:05:12.890> and<00:05:14.530> when

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
like stay with cube all g d's and when

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.920 
like stay with cube all g d's and when
you<00:05:15.650> rotate<00:05:15.979> the<00:05:16.100> cube<00:05:16.340> the<00:05:17.150> reflections<00:05:17.720> will

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
you rotate the cube the reflections will

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.090 
you rotate the cube the reflections will
like<00:05:18.140> stay<00:05:18.560> with<00:05:18.800> it<00:05:18.950> so<00:05:20.410> yeah<00:05:21.410> thanks<00:05:21.979> for
