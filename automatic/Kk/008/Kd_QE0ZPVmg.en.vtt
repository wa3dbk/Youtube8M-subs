00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
dragging out completed guitars this is

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
dragging out completed guitars this is
when<00:00:12.639> I<00:00:12.670> made<00:00:12.940> a<00:00:12.969> couple<00:00:13.240> years<00:00:13.510> ago<00:00:13.660> and<00:00:15.510> it's

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
when I made a couple years ago and it's

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.689 
when I made a couple years ago and it's
basically<00:00:16.960> different<00:00:17.410> from<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:17.680> other<00:00:17.830> two

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
basically different from the other two

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.580 
basically different from the other two
that<00:00:18.939> I<00:00:19.060> showed<00:00:19.570> you<00:00:19.720> earlier<00:00:19.779> in<00:00:20.170> that<00:00:20.350> it's<00:00:20.500> a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
that I showed you earlier in that it's a

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.950 
that I showed you earlier in that it's a
twelfth<00:00:20.949> fret<00:00:21.100> neck

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
twelve frets from the neck of the body

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.939 
twelve frets from the neck of the body
instead<00:00:24.699> of<00:00:24.849> fourteen<00:00:25.589> and<00:00:26.849> that's<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
instead of fourteen and that's the

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.760 
instead of fourteen and that's the
design<00:00:30.339> that<00:00:30.550> this<00:00:30.699> model<00:00:31.300> is<00:00:31.770> considerably

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
design that this model is considerably

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.850 
design that this model is considerably
different<00:00:33.100> than<00:00:33.579> a<00:00:34.510> 14th<00:00:34.989> fret<00:00:35.200> neck<00:00:35.470> because

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
different than a 14th fret neck because

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.180 
different than a 14th fret neck because
when<00:00:36.040> you<00:00:36.130> have<00:00:36.340> a<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.890> know<00:00:39.010> you're

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
when you have a you know you're

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.640 
when you have a you know you're
basically<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:40.450> space<00:00:40.750> from<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.110> 12th<00:00:41.440> of<00:00:41.560> the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
basically the space from the 12th of the

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.600 
basically the space from the 12th of the
14th<00:00:42.160> fret<00:00:42.580> is<00:00:43.390> moved<00:00:43.720> back<00:00:44.050> farther<00:00:44.610> which

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
14th fret is moved back farther which

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.150 
14th fret is moved back farther which
means<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:46.000> tone<00:00:46.210> with<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.420> turn<00:00:46.890> pushes<00:00:47.890> the

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
means the tone with the turn pushes the

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.550 
means the tone with the turn pushes the
bracing<00:00:48.670> back<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:49.420> sounds<00:00:49.810> hold<00:00:49.960> back<00:00:50.230> and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
bracing back the sounds hold back and

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.120 
bracing back the sounds hold back and
the<00:00:51.070> bridge<00:00:51.340> back<00:00:51.820> and<00:00:52.000> you<00:00:52.090> can<00:00:52.240> see<00:00:52.450> is<00:00:52.570> more

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
the bridge back and you can see is more

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.680 
the bridge back and you can see is more
centrally<00:00:54.130> located<00:00:54.640> in<00:00:54.880> the<00:00:54.970> wider<00:00:55.210> part<00:00:55.570> of

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
centrally located in the wider part of

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.710 
centrally located in the wider part of
the<00:00:55.780> lower<00:00:55.960> pal<00:00:56.580> or<00:00:57.580> a<00:00:57.610> 14th<00:00:58.120> fret<00:00:58.360> guitar

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
the lower pal or a 14th fret guitar

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.010 
the lower pal or a 14th fret guitar
you'll<00:00:58.960> notice<00:00:59.320> that<00:00:59.470> the<00:00:59.590> bridges<00:00:59.950> up<00:01:00.130> higher

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
you'll notice that the bridges up higher

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.359 
you'll notice that the bridges up higher
here<00:01:02.020> so<00:01:02.710> this<00:01:02.860> is<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.130> most<00:01:03.340> open<00:01:03.869> loose<00:01:05.369> part

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
here so this is the most open loose part

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.179 
here so this is the most open loose part
of<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.030> top<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.689> it's<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.049> highest<00:01:08.229> amount

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
of the top that it's the highest amount

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.149 
of the top that it's the highest amount
of<00:01:09.400> a<00:01:09.550> platoon<00:01:10.090> of<00:01:10.420> vibrates<00:01:10.870> so<00:01:11.710> consequently

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
of a platoon of vibrates so consequently

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.160 
of a platoon of vibrates so consequently
you<00:01:12.550> get<00:01:12.760> a<00:01:12.790> different<00:01:13.330> tone<00:01:13.510> battle<00:01:13.840> guitar

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
you get a different tone battle guitar

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.690 
you get a different tone battle guitar
because<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.680> those<00:01:15.030> basic<00:01:16.560> differences<00:01:17.560> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.790 

typically<00:01:21.700> a<00:01:21.729> twelfth<00:01:22.120> fret<00:01:22.240> guitar<00:01:22.800> will

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
typically a twelfth fret guitar will

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.790 
typically a twelfth fret guitar will
