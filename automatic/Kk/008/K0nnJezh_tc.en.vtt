the driver one of the things we did is

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.290 
the driver one of the things we did is
we<00:00:42.960> took<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.290> drivers<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.010> put<00:00:44.190> them<00:00:44.280> into<00:00:44.430> 7g

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
we took the drivers and put them into 7g

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.870 
able to handle it there's tons of risk
there<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:04.890> came<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.130> the<00:01:05.370> concept<00:01:05.790> of

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
there so we came up the concept of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.850 
there so we came up the concept of
building<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.330> robot<00:01:06.810> car<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.350> actually<00:01:07.680> drive

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
building a robot car to actually drive

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.410 
building a robot car to actually drive
through<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.100> loop<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.970> designed<00:01:09.330> the
