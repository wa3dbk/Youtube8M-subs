00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.970
 hello today we prepare one 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.620
 marinating which will then be used for fish 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.990
 grilled 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.970
 so first let's take some lemon 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:25.150
 and we squeeze it and remove the seeds not 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.820
 so much lemon just because the fish 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.750
 when it is fresh and it is good it does not have 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.600
 need to have so much lemon we put 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:40.210
 a little salt and so we go to 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:44.290
 dissolve the salt and in the lemon and that 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:48.730
 a very fast operation 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:51.070
 let's put some pepper at this point 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.750
 take we recommend you use this 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:01:02.410
 rosemary and sage therefore chopped 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:05.379
 quite fine here in this way e 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:09.820
 let's go and put them 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:14.740
 with our lemon and salt at the moment 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:20.350
 pepper ready well so 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:24.369
 take some sage leaves here 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:31.869
 two sheets of sage so let's go to 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:35.579
 do these fine even one fine 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:41.759
 once the sage is finally made 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:50.819
 we propose all together we mix and 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:50.819
 let's add the oil like this 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.550
 we are all good foolish yes 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:05.960
 evolutions well with the lemon we take 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.780
 now some basil leaves without 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.790
 cut it knife but only 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.980
 tearing it to avoid it being possible 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.670
 oxidize we mix everything together 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.550
 let it rest for half an hour 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.920
 then with our magic brush 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.140
 we are going to wet the fish we put it 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.850
 on the grid we bathe him immediately by a 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.400
 part we turn it over we bathe it 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.220
 on the other hand this brine allows 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.310
 in addition to giving a slight taste but if the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.600
 good fish in a need 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.270
 too much of other tastes though 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.270
 allows you to keep it softer 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.460
