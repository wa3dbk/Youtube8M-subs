00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.790
 from a company favorite so who 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.040
 I wonder what kind of video of course 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.650
 stay with me and the first thing 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.260
 I will show it to be such a palette 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.349
 for makeup the makeup of this palette is included 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.950
 three shades of blush and even lip shadows 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.200
 pomade 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.030
 this trip is a very good option for 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.090
 traveling because she is very 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.370
 small and compact night complain 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.200
 Rouge is a very beautiful peach 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.920
 shade with a lot of golden 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.500
 spangle 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.750
 but these golden sparkles are only visible 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.940
 with artificial light bring 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.040
 old lighting these rouge were 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.290
 almost dull but slightly 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.280
 notice this in principle to me they 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.930
 really liked 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.410
 despite what you might think 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:06.120
 that they are pretty bright but on the face 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.070
 they were very bright and saturated 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.110
 the following is such here 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.479
 dark brown matte shadows from all of you 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.909
 give no and like no more shade 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.130
 everything he is very bright good 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.380
 pigmented it is easily dialed on 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.580
 the brush is well tolerated on the nickname and 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.270
 good stew 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.650
 the next shade is that you 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.840
 light beige with mother of pearl and 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.990
 many silver and gold 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.630
 sequin this shade it is not us 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.490
 liked a little less than 1 because 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.549
 what's typed he is good 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.070
 new with the shading it almost erased 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.530
 so unfortunately I did n't like him 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.770
 very and the last shade of this such 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.170
 colors brown with silver large 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.450
 glitter he also typed notice 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.869
 well tolerated for ages well too 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.000
 on when the shading is erased so that 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.750
 make up in this subject shades 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.550
 shadows 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.350
 try but here's the most to me 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.130
 liked this dark brown 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.020
 shade and the last is such here 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.660
 lipstick you might think that 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.940
 she is very bright very so saturated 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.030
 in fact on the lips she looks like 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.670
 balm or gloss on the lips of new cleaning 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.620
 imperceptibly so the trip is basically me 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.959
 really liked it as i said 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.709
 very good option for travel 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.930
 for travel 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.670
 since in principle , watering is possible here 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.830
 make a full makeup 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.320
 if that i show it will be like this 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.480
 here's a hand cream paradise islands composition 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.590
 this cream includes thai flower name 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.110
 this manga 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.209
 I had such a shower gel so I 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.340
 already knew what it would smell like 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.880
 cream and of course I enjoy it 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.800
 ordered , the cream is very nice like me 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.590
 already I talked about shower gel in 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.520
 this cream is similar to the smell is not here 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.750
 one hundred percent fruit aroma 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.970
 mango 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.190
 As for the consistency of the cream, it is 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.220
 not dense it is even more so 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.950
 watery liquid cream is very 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.170
 quickly absorbed into the skin of the hands it is very 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.610
 sparingly because here 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.769
 see she carried a small amount 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.030
 cream on hand but it was enough for me 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:18.549
 absolutely the entire surface of the hand so 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.590
 that creamy enough for a long time 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.330
 concerns its moisturizing properties then me 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.910
 they also pleased the cream very well 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.730
 moisturize the skin of the hands and also very well 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.799
 and softens the reception was pleased mukla 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.890
 I was advised to you by the investigator that I 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.170
 bought it again this 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.190
 here is a bio arctic shampoo with extracts 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.320
 let's cloudberries 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.840
 I think that about this shampoo I 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.079
 I tell almost every video about 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.810
 Ordering a faberlic, I can say that shampoo 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:50.140
 very cool go ordering girls 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.900
 said the fourth time after his hair 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.360
 smooth shiny and obedient as well 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.060
 after his hair is a very long time 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.280
 stay clean especially i like 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.590
 use this siton shampoo with 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.540
 the same balm for hair in general 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.240
 shampoo very cool tips for you 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.490
 be sure to try it in 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.770
 exactly that you will not be disappointed and sure 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.990
 that you will like it and the following that I 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.670
 it has acquired such a balm for 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.980
 lips and all winter 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.130
 despite the fact that the castle be called 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.410
 winter but it fits very well also 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.540
 for other times of the year it is especially 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.880
 good for fall and spring 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.100
 but it can also be used in summer 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.170
 I almost used this balm before 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.300
 the end here I have left quite a bit 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.610
 a little bit and i'm absolutely sure that 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.200
 Once and finally winter necessarily will get 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.240
 imagine one more such balm than me 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.910
 I liked it so much but firstly it is very 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.400
 well moisturizes and softens lips 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.030
 secondly it has a very pleasant aroma and 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.400
 third 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.440
 purification of such comfort and 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.080
 moisture content on the dome is maintained on 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.240
 all day so i stayed 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.890
 just really happy is one of 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.710
 the best balms that I generally 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.960
 once used so too 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.000
 I advise you to try it 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.300
 and the next matte will show this here 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.310
 Here is a faberlic holographic varnish for me 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.680
 I also really liked me 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.350
 It turned out such a very successful order 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.810
 As for that, it is not enough for him 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.970
 beautiful shade but that's exactly what he 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.970
 holographic noticeable only when 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.740
 artificial lighting or the sun 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.210
 when find out just the room then Allah 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.820
 beautiful shade of him but not visible that 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.370
 holographic can say no 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.340
 also really liked the fact that the varnish is very 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.800
 dries quickly while you paint 2 arm 1 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.350
 the hand is already completely dry it is very and 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.520
 very comfortable also with varnish pretty 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.370
 dense coating 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.820
 And I put 2 layers because here in 2 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.220
 layer 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.320
 he looks just perfect so 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.750
 In principle , these two remain as pretty 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.780
 his stand among the two or three days in general 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.940
 like any average varnish 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.040
 I can advise him too 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.780
 and the last thing I'll show it here 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.640
 such is the perfumed vodichka 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.190
 which is called don finch 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.770
 she didn't like it either 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:11.760
 because she is very, very cool 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:15.560
 the aroma is very so tender fresh 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.110
 spring citrus fragrance here to me 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.740
 it seems this smell is one hundred percent 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.510
 the smell of such a fresh orange is very 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.669
 cool flavor just insanely not 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.919
 liked his not very firmness 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:31.100
 big where for two or three hours but principle 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:33.020
 this is enough for me especially since 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.960
 on clothes this scent keeps 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.870
 much longer so too he me 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.639
 I liked it too and I can advise it 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.160
 in general girls it was all my order 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:45.139
 from the faberlik company so if you 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.120
 I liked this video do not forget 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.040
 put your finger up and subscribe to 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.070
