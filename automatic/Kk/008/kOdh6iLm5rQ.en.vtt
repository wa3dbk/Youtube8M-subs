the<00:03:41.090> RAM<00:03:41.270> and<00:03:41.510> their<00:03:41.600> computers<00:03:42.140> they<00:03:42.470> want<00:03:42.650> to

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
the RAM and their computers they want to

the RAM and their computers they want to
speed<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.070> up

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
speed it up

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.620

but<00:03:44.240> they<00:03:44.480> often<00:03:45.440> buy<00:03:45.980> missed<00:03:46.340> match<00:03:46.610> ram<00:03:47.180> and

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
but they often buy missed match ram and

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.140 
but they often buy missed match ram and
they<00:03:48.110> ended<00:03:48.350> up<00:03:48.640> installing<00:03:49.640> it<00:03:49.970> in<00:03:50.030> their

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
they ended up installing it in their

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
computers and then start having problems

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.820 
computers and then start having problems
or<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.730> just<00:03:52.790> doesn't<00:03:53.030> take<00:03:53.510> and<00:03:53.810> they<00:03:54.560> wonder

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
or it just doesn't take and they wonder

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.730 
or it just doesn't take and they wonder
why<00:03:54.950> they<00:03:55.100> get<00:03:55.190> no<00:03:55.370> video<00:03:55.640> on<00:03:55.790> their<00:03:55.910> screen<00:03:56.740> so

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
why they get no video on their screen so

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.820 
why they get no video on their screen so
as<00:03:57.860> you<00:03:57.980> can<00:03:58.070> see<00:03:58.130> here<00:03:58.430> we<00:03:58.520> got<00:03:58.550> ddr3<00:03:59.480> I<00:04:00.020> got

as you can see here we got ddr3 I got

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.830 
as you can see here we got ddr3 I got
stick<00:04:01.490> of<00:04:01.640> two<00:04:01.880> gigabytes<00:04:02.510> here<00:04:02.870> and<00:04:03.640> I<00:04:04.840> have

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
stick of two gigabytes here and I have

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.030 
stick of two gigabytes here and I have
four<00:04:06.140> slots<00:04:06.430> my<00:04:07.430> other<00:04:07.820> slot<00:04:08.300> slot<00:04:08.570> three<00:04:09.080> it's

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
four slots my other slot slot three it's

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.690 
four slots my other slot slot three it's
got<00:04:10.190> an<00:04:10.280> identical<00:04:11.110> Ram<00:04:12.110> stick<00:04:12.470> in<00:04:12.620> there<00:04:12.860> I'm

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
got an identical Ram stick in there I'm

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.479 
got an identical Ram stick in there I'm
using<00:04:13.940> it<00:04:14.270> in<00:04:14.300> dual<00:04:14.570> channel<00:04:14.990> mode<00:04:15.170> and<00:04:15.500> I

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
using it in dual channel mode and I

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.130 
using it in dual channel mode and I
don't<00:04:16.670> have<00:04:17.090> anything<00:04:17.270> in<00:04:17.450> slots<00:04:17.780> two<00:04:17.989> and

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
don't have anything in slots two and

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.680 
don't have anything in slots two and
four<00:04:18.410> so<00:04:18.440> I<00:04:18.950> could<00:04:19.670> just<00:04:19.940> go<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:20.330> use<00:04:20.510> this

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
four so I could just go and use this

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.540 
four so I could just go and use this
information<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.880> go<00:04:22.880> online<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:24.550> Google

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
information and go online and Google

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.960 
information and go online and Google
this<00:04:25.730> and<00:04:26.090> find<00:04:26.680> some<00:04:27.680> exact<00:04:28.100> matching<00:04:28.610> memory

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
this and find some exact matching memory
