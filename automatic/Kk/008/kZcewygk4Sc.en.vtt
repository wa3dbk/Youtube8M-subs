 I get to see the jitters I don't want you to live too long 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.539
 they must have taken all the samples and if I have those families 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.509
 we go home with him, I can wait here for the ship instead of 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:19.999
 to sail with you 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.320
 you are an assist and the third has already been told 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.859
 and so you must now also act as my assistant alfred jodocus kwak 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.860
 although welcome 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.050
 welcome 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.080
 this is alfred jodocus kwak my assistant london the director of this 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.520
 company 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.450
 well I know who do you see they are waiting for you not to tell what kind of problems 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.910
 we have and we have taken a few samples of that rock that you can do that 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.760
 I hope you can tell English what that is for the layoffs 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.760
 that is amazing 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.070
 Oh yeah 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.100
 call this 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.970
 the man 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.970
 stupid 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.340
 the only thing going on there is halting hello 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.150
 hello normal 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.119
 k 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.369
 divers in the cinema already strange 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.530
 kh 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.210
 may look 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.520
 picard 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.520
 8 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.320
 the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.190
 so you also see osn 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.009
 what is it that is especially proud 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.389
 tell us well then native people come in 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:15.319
 that is not yet clear 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.269
 but it sounded like they discovered something like that 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.039
 and yes assistant did not see anything worth 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:25.219
 9 also for us it is completely unclear I wanted to tell in it 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.710
 that this is a very special thing for the rock 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.710
 and that requires further research, so to speak 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:35.149
 would you like to try again with those red and white borders but with 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.149
 the largest possible diamond on the farmer 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.279
 since the man of diamonds 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:49.459
 namely, a very good diamond expert 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.889
 do you have someone employed by the diamonds 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.790
 you do not have to iron the diamond with this, but it does 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.099
 the project is therefore still 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.839
 it is a beautiful face groping top of you really 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.469
 the dispute is up 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:06.459
 needs someone who's church 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.790
 hold the largest diamond that became 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.790
 we are going to try again by tapping into those who had been fired 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:14.400
 a length 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.459
 gabri a proposal to our diamond an expert 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.199
 he alfred 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.920
 how long not seen beijing 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.730
 alves 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.829
 why are you always 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.719
 the actor the ribbon after the duel 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.829
 I did not know him the assistant of the Diocese Brugge though 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:39.459
 prof 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.459
 anp 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:45.949
 tip 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:49.379
 come 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.549
 the 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:52.729
 points 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:54.429
 anp 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:57.239
 click here amsterdam the portfolio 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.069
 I don't thank you at home 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.939
 I no longer have any more with the director, okay, but carefully 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.139
 haha yes 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:18.840
 no, because a few later 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.849
 about 150 meters I don't think so 10 

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:26.520
 jeje mina it will therefore be hamad to get to know labor 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.120
 no you don't just do that 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.390
 the municipality has Thursday 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.880
 and if you do that no one succeeds burglar find it really wrong type 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.509
 that's what they want to know 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.939
 samuel grass to participate in the bottom of the sea 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:42.940
 after not so long ago 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.559
 I was around here 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:47.559
 I am glad I am here with thieves 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.620
 the ball now lies with the dismissed director a 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.620
 be very careful be very careful 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.469
 that off towards st 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:14.139
 I am sure that the balance will succeed in continuing with the foundations 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.069
 to break 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.430
 but even with the municipality 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.520
 I always have no chicken 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.520
 Feyenoord I believe it will still work 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:27.610
 when men 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.610
 I don't name a man anymore 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:48.680
 maurice the farmer 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.249
 booked 8 why not 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:52.379
 I have 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:55.379
 all of them 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.419
 tottenham on the rise 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.169
 by the central banks 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.210
 yes he never mind 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.349
 He also notes that Iran 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.349
 don't do it too fast 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.180
 4 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.950
 that the resignation is really something very special me 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.279
 absolutely 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:18.749
 maybe the 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:20.969
 maybe you have an idea 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.110
 I don't know for sure yet, but maybe it's not a hollow at all 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.460
 beaten 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.450
 but I mean we have a little league that was in the sea long ago 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:31.029
 fallen or something 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.780
 also can 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.629
 or maybe in a spaceship 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:37.879
 that can be made thanks to the strong comeback unknown I already there 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:40.570
 we don't know here 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.680
 Not every case we have to go down to investigate 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.539
 can you arrange a submarine 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.539
 I have already done I expect to offer everything 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.809
 I work on cancer myself 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:55.180
 and why are you screaming here 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.789
 experts 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:00.729
 I am really not wrong I have discovered that the diamonds are not just like that 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:02.059
 lost weight 

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:05.059
 a lot clearer it is not a separate one 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.580
 are you sure that it was very well secured via the site 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.860
 in a nutshell, that is cut off in the hand 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.860
 not someone from the north station 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.360
 he sat among the big culprits his talk not such a nonsense ridiculous 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.589
 director peter paul rubens 

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:25.749
 the sunshine first with the submarine 

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:26.909
 is it again 

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:30.110
 the sunshine is stopping the ship from captain 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.659
 how a coincidence 

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:35.569
 what this never lets go with the other way around 

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:36.719
 did you take it 

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:37.780
 a game with 

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.430
 already seen because the car steps 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.919
 he then left busy 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:45.919
 succeed the ideal man city delfland 

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:55.750
 ajacied remain maintained how deep can you actually go captain 

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:58.669
 the 100 meter government 

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:01.149
 the air of is 200 meters long 

00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:03.590
 rarely can captain diving 

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:04.389
 who actually goes
