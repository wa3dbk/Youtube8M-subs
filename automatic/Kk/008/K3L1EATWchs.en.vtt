makes<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.250> labor<00:01:08.430> go<00:01:08.729> faster<00:01:09.270> no<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.830> when

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
makes the labor go faster no but when

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.890 
makes the labor go faster no but when
the<00:01:11.130> contractions<00:01:11.790> come<00:01:12.119> down<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.479> an<00:01:12.570> empty

uterus they hurt a lot more but they do

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.649 
uterus they hurt a lot more but they do
more<00:01:16.229> work<00:01:16.460> that<00:01:17.460> depends<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.119> how<00:01:18.299> dilated

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
more work that depends on how dilated

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
the contractions take about as long to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.310 
the contractions take about as long to
widen<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.729> cervix<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> baby<00:01:24.900> comes

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
widen the cervix so that the baby comes

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.859 
widen the cervix so that the baby comes
out<00:01:25.610> why<00:01:26.610> would<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> doctor<00:01:27.150> need<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.659> break

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
out why would the doctor need to break
