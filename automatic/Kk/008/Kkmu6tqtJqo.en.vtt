00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 bulgov madness roshchin administration 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.799
 Obama is preparing for a military strike 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.049
 in Syria 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.780
 however, the president says that not yet 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.759
 made a final decision last 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.830
 several days the administration is desperate 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.350
 tried to find any intelligence 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.289
 information that would serve as weighty 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.939
 reason for attacking Syria today 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.640
 we finally saw this report 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.279
 its not classified 4 page version 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.640
 he was presented to the public by the state secretary 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.710
 john kerry said the following dash 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.600
 degree of reliability of information 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.320
 american intelligence community is very 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.129
 high 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.500
 very much a matter of common sense is 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.210
 proof is the facts and now 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.129
 the main issue is not us 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.379
 known and that we all together everything 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.170
 the world now with this do heads and 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.390
 newborn yes yes reef way to pay 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.030
 according to their document there are such 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.579
 row evaluation of our intelligence with 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.410
 high degree of certainty the most 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.170
 convincing argument that can take 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.600
 on the arsenal of the usa 2 community 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.369
 lack of evidence in this way 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.260
 US intelligence does not confirm 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.060
 evidence the reliability of which 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.680
 according to the white house is undeniable 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.979
 the report does not provide evidence 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.540
 per se only conclusions besides 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.030
 need to remember that it was not 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.100
 its secret version in it 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.600
 satellite images are mentioned and 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.900
 intercepted messages 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.979
 The main argument of the report is 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.200
 the Assad government has 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.750
 huge warehouses of chemical weapons and 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.850
 their means of delivery 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.369
 most likely and is responsible for 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.680
 attacks in the suburbs of Damascus produced 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.450
 last week for the last few 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.070
 days a number of employees from except from 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.110
 United States wishing to stay 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.030
 unknown persons said that those 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.909
 evidence which are located w 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.590
 not unconditionally faithful also 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.390
 from the speech of state secretary john kerry 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.369
 it follows that the main argument 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.409
 striking a series are those 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.810
 terrible shots that we saw 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.310
 several times the report link to video 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.140
 social media posts 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.630
 however, they cannot be reliably 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.060
 establish who carried out these attacks 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.860
 against the attack on the series come forward not 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.750
 only the Americans themselves but 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.850
 the international community and although 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.220
 state secretary 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.680
 I talked about the so-called international 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.320
 support whatever support he had 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.720
 mean it will not come from the un and 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.910
 no matter what the United States military action is not 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.110
 They unleashed against Syria as a result of these 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.520
 actions will contradict 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.620
 international law 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.050
 NATO Secretary General said that 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.070
 NATO is not going to participate in the military 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.500
 the invasion of Syria 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.360
 safety advice he should get 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.090
 investigation results of un inspectors 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.960
 however, even this investigation will not help 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.010
 find out who is guilty of horrible attacks 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.840
 lead investigators 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.120
 only authorized to establish the fact 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.360
 use of chemical weapons but not 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.040
 so it was applied this way 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.660
 the main question will remain unanswered 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.660
 even after getting the results 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.470
 investigations however here the US has already taken out 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.660
 your verdict 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.660
 Need to flippers it with vegetables recipe
