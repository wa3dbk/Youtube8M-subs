at the end I was like oh my god I have

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.890 
at the end I was like oh my god I have
to<00:01:24.100> try<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:24.310> because<00:01:24.640> they're<00:01:25.330> real<00:01:25.600> from

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900

Benefit<00:01:26.290> is<00:01:26.320> $22<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:27.400> this<00:01:28.240> one<00:01:28.479> is<00:01:28.659> very

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
Benefit is $22 and this one is very

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.830 
Benefit is $22 and this one is very
similar<00:01:29.260> to<00:01:29.409> it<00:01:29.650> in<00:01:29.770> my<00:01:29.920> opinion<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:31.510> brush<00:01:31.690> is

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
similar to it in my opinion the brush is

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.120 
similar to it in my opinion the brush is
definitely<00:01:32.200> a<00:01:32.229> little<00:01:32.350> bit<00:01:32.500> more<00:01:32.650> flexible

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
definitely a little bit more flexible

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.800 
definitely a little bit more flexible
than<00:01:33.340> their<00:01:33.760> real<00:01:33.939> that<00:01:34.240> one<00:01:34.390> is<00:01:34.510> a<00:01:34.540> little<00:01:34.659> bit

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
than their real that one is a little bit

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.230 
than their real that one is a little bit
harder<00:01:35.140> but<00:01:35.710> arch<00:01:36.520> is<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.700> little<00:01:36.939> bit<00:01:37.030> stiffer

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
harder but arch is a little bit stiffer

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.490 
harder but arch is a little bit stiffer
but<00:01:37.330> this<00:01:37.600> is<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.869> brush<00:01:38.080> when<00:01:38.229> they<00:01:38.320> get<00:01:38.470> a

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
but this is the brush when they get a

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.160 
but this is the brush when they get a
little<00:01:38.710> bit<00:01:38.799> closer<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:39.659> guys<00:01:40.659> can<00:01:40.930> see

are very long and sometimes they get

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.960 
are very long and sometimes they get
kind<00:02:00.939> of<00:02:02.040> mixed<00:02:03.040> in<00:02:03.250> with<00:02:03.400> my<00:02:03.460> lower<00:02:03.729> lash<00:02:03.939> line

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
kind of mixed in with my lower lash line

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.609 
kind of mixed in with my lower lash line
so<00:02:04.299> I<00:02:04.360> really<00:02:04.689> have<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:05.020> make<00:02:05.140> sure<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:05.470> I<00:02:05.500> get

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
so I really have to make sure that I get

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.729 
so I really have to make sure that I get
that<00:02:05.979> last<00:02:06.369> lash<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:07.420> that<00:02:07.570> it<00:02:07.689> goes<00:02:07.990> up<00:02:08.290> versus

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
that last lash so that it goes up versus

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.910 
that last lash so that it goes up versus
down<00:02:09.149> um<00:02:10.149> I<00:02:10.329> did<00:02:10.509> notice<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:10.899> there's<00:02:11.860> a

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
down um I did notice that there's a

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.170 
down um I did notice that there's a
little<00:02:12.190> bit<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.340> clumping<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.910> don't<00:02:13.060> know<00:02:13.120> if

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180

out right in this part here there's a
little<00:02:18.130> bit<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.250> clumping<00:02:18.640> which<00:02:18.910> really<00:02:19.150> when

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
little bit of clumping which really when

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.020 
little bit of clumping which really when

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
reviews because I just think that what

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.479 
reviews because I just think that what
they're<00:03:21.810> advertising<00:03:22.319> is<00:03:22.650> not<00:03:22.680> what<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.280> get

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
they're advertising is not what you get

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
by this but I do think this is a great

by this but I do think this is a great
mascara<00:03:26.099> for<00:03:26.879> the<00:03:27.180> price<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.660> again<00:03:27.870> it's<00:03:28.049> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
mascara for the price and again it's the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.789 
mascara for the price and again it's the

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
line but I also wanted to show you guys

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.810 
line but I also wanted to show you guys
how<00:05:18.030> easily<00:05:18.270> this<00:05:18.630> master<00:05:19.050> applies<00:05:19.320> and<00:05:19.650> it's

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
how easily this master applies and it's

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.820 
how easily this master applies and it's
very<00:05:20.820> similar<00:05:21.090> to<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.840> benefit<00:05:22.590> they're<00:05:22.800> real

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
very similar to the benefit they're real

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.270 
very similar to the benefit they're real
which<00:05:23.250> I<00:05:23.400> really<00:05:23.730> like<00:05:24.560> this<00:05:25.560> one<00:05:25.740> is<00:05:25.890> the

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
which I really like this one is the

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.650 
which I really like this one is the
brush<00:05:26.460> is<00:05:26.610> a<00:05:26.640> little<00:05:26.880> bit<00:05:27.000> more<00:05:27.120> flexible<00:05:27.600> to

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
brush is a little bit more flexible to

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.520 
brush is a little bit more flexible to
me<00:05:27.990> in<00:05:28.110> my<00:05:28.230> opinion<00:05:28.440> then<00:05:28.920> the<00:05:30.530> benefit

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
me in my opinion then the benefit

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.950 
me in my opinion then the benefit
they're<00:05:31.710> real<00:05:31.740> but<00:05:32.250> as<00:05:32.430> you<00:05:32.580> can<00:05:32.730> see<00:05:32.840> it's<00:05:33.840> a

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
they're real but as you can see it's a

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.990 
they're real but as you can see it's a
full<00:05:34.170> decent<00:05:34.680> sized<00:05:34.860> brush<00:05:35.250> and<00:05:35.580> it<00:05:35.670> does<00:05:35.790> have

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
full decent sized brush and it does have

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.300 
full decent sized brush and it does have
a<00:05:36.030> little<00:05:36.390> bit<00:05:36.480> of<00:05:36.510> a<00:05:36.660> ball<00:05:37.380> at<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.890> end<00:05:37.920> which

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
a little bit of a ball at the end which

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.490 
a little bit of a ball at the end which
is<00:05:38.460> very<00:05:38.640> very<00:05:38.910> close<00:05:39.150> to<00:05:39.420> the<00:05:39.540> one<00:05:39.630> from<00:05:39.870> there

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
is very very close to the one from there

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.710 
is very very close to the one from there
real<00:05:40.710> for<00:05:41.250> benefit<00:05:41.640> and<00:05:41.820> this<00:05:42.360> one<00:05:42.510> is<00:05:42.600> only

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
real for benefit and this one is only

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.780 
real for benefit and this one is only
like<00:05:43.050> eight<00:05:43.260> dollars<00:05:43.410> at<00:05:43.770> most<00:05:44.040> but<00:05:44.460> as<00:05:44.670> you

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
like eight dollars at most but as you

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.000 
like eight dollars at most but as you
can<00:05:44.910> see<00:05:44.970> from<00:05:45.390> this<00:05:45.510> side<00:05:45.720> to<00:05:46.050> this<00:05:46.170> side<00:05:46.230> you

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
can see from this side to this side you

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.530 
can see from this side to this side you
can<00:05:47.190> definitely<00:05:47.340> notice<00:05:47.670> I<00:05:48.060> know<00:05:48.150> that<00:05:48.330> I<00:05:48.390> have

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
can definitely notice I know that I have

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.940 
can definitely notice I know that I have
some<00:05:48.720> dark<00:05:48.930> I<00:05:49.050> show<00:05:49.230> so<00:05:49.380> it's<00:05:49.470> kind<00:05:49.620> of<00:05:49.650> hard<00:05:49.770> to

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
some dark I show so it's kind of hard to

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.730 
some dark I show so it's kind of hard to
see<00:05:50.130> my<00:05:50.370> actual<00:05:50.640> lashes<00:05:51.530> but<00:05:52.530> they're

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
see my actual lashes but they're

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.460 
see my actual lashes but they're
somewhat<00:05:53.520> long<00:05:53.840> so<00:05:54.840> I'm<00:05:54.960> just<00:05:55.110> gonna<00:05:55.230> apply

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
somewhat long so I'm just gonna apply

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.650 
somewhat long so I'm just gonna apply
one<00:05:56.340> coat<00:05:56.550> and<00:05:56.580> it<00:05:56.760> does<00:05:56.940> have<00:05:57.180> a<00:05:57.210> little<00:05:57.540> bit

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
one coat and it does have a little bit

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.570 
one coat and it does have a little bit
on<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:57.990> outer<00:05:58.350> part<00:05:58.800> of<00:05:59.040> here<00:05:59.400> in<00:05:59.490> the

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
on the outer part of here in the

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.820 
on the outer part of here in the
beginning<00:05:59.700> of<00:05:59.970> the<00:06:00.120> brush<00:06:00.930> a<00:06:01.200> little<00:06:01.560> bit<00:06:01.680> of

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
beginning of the brush a little bit of

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.380 
beginning of the brush a little bit of
clumps<00:06:02.100> but<00:06:02.250> I<00:06:02.340> never<00:06:02.550> find<00:06:02.910> that<00:06:03.030> that's<00:06:03.270> an

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
clumps but I never find that that's an

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.390 
clumps but I never find that that's an
issue<00:06:03.540> if<00:06:03.810> it<00:06:03.960> is<00:06:04.080> for<00:06:04.440> you<00:06:04.590> just<00:06:04.860> wipe<00:06:05.130> it<00:06:05.280> down

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
issue if it is for you just wipe it down

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.610 
issue if it is for you just wipe it down
but<00:06:06.300> that's<00:06:06.540> really<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:07.020> only<00:06:07.080> part<00:06:07.410> that

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
but that's really the only part that

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.030 
but that's really the only part that
gets<00:06:07.710> excess<00:06:08.600> formula<00:06:09.600> so<00:06:10.380> I<00:06:10.650> like<00:06:10.830> to<00:06:10.860> just

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
gets excess formula so I like to just

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.440 
gets excess formula so I like to just
start<00:06:11.340> at<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.520> base<00:06:11.640> of<00:06:11.670> my<00:06:11.820> lashes<00:06:11.850> and<00:06:12.390> just

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
start at the base of my lashes and just

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.880 
start at the base of my lashes and just
wiggle<00:06:12.750> the<00:06:13.140> brush<00:06:15.170> and<00:06:16.170> I<00:06:16.290> like<00:06:16.440> using<00:06:16.650> the

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
wiggle the brush and I like using the

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.310 
wiggle the brush and I like using the
ball<00:06:17.040> to<00:06:17.430> kind<00:06:17.640> of<00:06:17.700> flip<00:06:18.030> these<00:06:18.270> out<00:06:18.600> into<00:06:19.170> like

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
ball to kind of flip these out into like

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.420 
ball to kind of flip these out into like
a<00:06:19.350> cat<00:06:19.650> eye<00:06:20.150> and<00:06:21.560> then<00:06:22.560> some<00:06:22.890> people<00:06:23.100> like<00:06:23.280> to

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
a cat eye and then some people like to

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.720 
a cat eye and then some people like to
hold<00:06:23.880> it<00:06:24.030> there<00:06:24.210> and<00:06:24.420> kind<00:06:24.810> of<00:06:24.900> close<00:06:25.380> your<00:06:25.620> eye

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
sees the other side that has formula and

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.260 
sees the other side that has formula and

times and this is what I do this type on
mascara<00:07:03.849> sometimes<00:07:04.810> I<00:07:04.930> do<00:07:04.990> two<00:07:05.860> coats<00:07:06.129> with

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.460 
mascara sometimes I do two coats with

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.369 
mascara sometimes I do two coats with
this<00:07:06.699> mascara<00:07:07.090> I've<00:07:07.300> done<00:07:07.539> that<00:07:07.689> this<00:07:08.020> is<00:07:08.080> just

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:08.379 
this mascara I've done that this is just

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:11.010 
this mascara I've done that this is just
one<00:07:08.650> generous<00:07:09.129> coating<00:07:09.370> using<00:07:09.729> all<00:07:10.240> the<00:07:10.780> sides

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020 
one generous coating using all the sides

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.570 
one generous coating using all the sides
of<00:07:11.229> the<00:07:11.289> brush<00:07:11.909> and<00:07:13.439> that's<00:07:14.439> pretty<00:07:15.039> much<00:07:15.370> it

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
of the brush and that's pretty much it

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.850 
of the brush and that's pretty much it
very<00:07:15.909> simple<00:07:16.240> very<00:07:16.389> easy<00:07:16.509> but<00:07:16.960> yet<00:07:17.169> you<00:07:17.680> can

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860 
very simple very easy but yet you can

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.649 
very simple very easy but yet you can
see<00:07:18.159> the<00:07:18.370> lashes<00:07:18.759> now<00:07:18.909> that<00:07:19.240> you<00:07:19.360> weren't<00:07:19.509> able

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:19.659 
see the lashes now that you weren't able

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:21.390 
see the lashes now that you weren't able
to<00:07:19.900> see<00:07:20.050> before<00:07:20.199> and<00:07:20.439> it<00:07:20.680> does<00:07:20.860> really<00:07:21.159> help

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 
to see before and it does really help

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.179 
to see before and it does really help
kind<00:07:21.699> of<00:07:21.789> magnify<00:07:22.330> and<00:07:22.659> multiply<00:07:23.650> the<00:07:23.710> lashes

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:24.189 
kind of magnify and multiply the lashes

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:25.740 
kind of magnify and multiply the lashes
and<00:07:24.400> just<00:07:24.789> basically<00:07:25.180> gives<00:07:25.419> you<00:07:25.569> that

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:25.750 
and just basically gives you that

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.309 
and just basically gives you that
separation<00:07:26.259> that<00:07:26.439> I<00:07:26.740> don't<00:07:27.279> find<00:07:27.550> very<00:07:27.969> easy

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 
separation that I don't find very easy

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:30.629 
separation that I don't find very easy
with<00:07:29.319> other<00:07:29.560> mascaras<00:07:30.129> I<00:07:30.189> feel<00:07:30.370> like<00:07:30.490> I<00:07:30.520> have

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 
with other mascaras I feel like I have

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.429 
with other mascaras I feel like I have
to<00:07:30.729> work<00:07:30.909> with<00:07:30.939> them<00:07:31.240> or<00:07:31.479> use<00:07:31.779> a<00:07:31.810> comb<00:07:32.139> very

00:07:32.429 --> 00:07:32.439 
to work with them or use a comb very

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:34.890 
to work with them or use a comb very
quickly<00:07:32.680> before<00:07:32.979> it<00:07:33.189> dries<00:07:33.400> so<00:07:34.060> this<00:07:34.719> is

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:34.900 
quickly before it dries so this is

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.959 
quickly before it dries so this is
alright<00:07:35.349> so<00:07:35.500> I<00:07:35.560> hope<00:07:35.740> that<00:07:36.039> you<00:07:36.279> guys<00:07:36.460> enjoyed
