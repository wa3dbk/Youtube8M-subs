00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
starting to get like a little bit of

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:35.279 
starting to get like a little bit of
color<00:00:23.490> though<00:00:23.670> I'm<00:00:23.789> pretty<00:00:23.970> sure

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:35.289 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:03:01.949 

yeah<00:00:35.949> I'm<00:00:36.100> gonna<00:00:36.280> throw<00:00:36.550> in<00:00:36.670> some<00:00:36.699> crickets

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:15.890 

and<00:03:02.500> he's<00:03:02.769> going<00:03:03.099> slow

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.080

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.960 

I<00:03:18.120> don't<00:03:18.690> think<00:03:18.840> he's<00:03:18.960> happy<00:03:19.670> you<00:03:20.670> leave<00:03:20.820> a

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:45.699 
I don't think he's happy you leave a
door<00:03:21.210> crickets<00:03:21.570> doing<00:03:22.080> something

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
yeah I don't know about it I'm gonna

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.789 
yeah I don't know about it I'm gonna
leave<00:03:47.659> them<00:03:47.780> alone<00:03:47.989> since<00:03:48.290> it<00:03:48.469> seemed<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.709> be

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
leave them alone since it seemed to be

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.410 
leave them alone since it seemed to be
kind<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.159> bugging<00:03:49.459> them<00:03:52.000> definitely<00:03:53.000> cool

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
kind of bugging them definitely cool

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.360 
kind of bugging them definitely cool
though<00:03:53.629> hopefully<00:03:54.170> I<00:03:54.379> can<00:03:54.469> get<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.709> female<00:03:54.950> soon

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
though hopefully I can get a female soon

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.890 
though hopefully I can get a female soon
enough<00:03:57.519> need<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.609> find<00:03:58.879> one<00:03:59.090> first<00:03:59.390> though

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
enough need to find one first though

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.929 
enough need to find one first though
pretty<00:04:00.290> not<00:04:01.159> super<00:04:01.489> rare<00:04:01.640> though<00:04:01.790> it's

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:01.939 
pretty not super rare though it's

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:03.699 
pretty not super rare though it's
definitely<00:04:02.269> a<00:04:02.299> hell<00:04:02.420> of<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.629> lot<00:04:02.810> more<00:04:02.840> likely

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
definitely a hell of a lot more likely

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.039 
definitely a hell of a lot more likely
of<00:04:03.739> me<00:04:04.010> finding<00:04:04.969> some<00:04:05.120> female<00:04:05.420> in<00:04:05.629> below<00:04:05.900> B

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049
