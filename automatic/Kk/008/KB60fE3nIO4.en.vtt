00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:14.989
 and now we are going to talk about a plant very well known to everyone and that the photo 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:18.910
 of a study at a large field university researchers use the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.560
 hype as theme for the works 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.580
 the plant of the family of grasses has several uses since feeding 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.730
 animale holland passing through landscaping 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.269
 and even the making of musical instruments 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.260
 in the case of this research, bamboo is the raw material for civil construction. 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.550
 details you check for now on daniel s 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.040
 the cigarette 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.320
 bit a garage or even a house made of bamboo 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.750
 in other parts of the country the material is often used but in bush 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.780
 the last round in little space 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.850
 leave you as crosscutters the work in large field ensures that they have replaced the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.310
 flag for the wood 'in any type of construction 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.690
 could mean 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.590
 economy you can reduce a work today imports 40% 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.170
 and when I say this from the popular action leaflet I'm not talking about 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.650
 shirt managers and other type of franchise 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.710
 and it will be that the quality is good even for civil construction ' 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.240
 I've always been an example. 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.840
 the man who leads 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.280
 the taj mahal in india he has more than 900 years to live everything tidy in the new 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.770
 we also have constructions in colombia with more than 100 years 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.310
 there is no way if you deal in the river sweet 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.930
 preserve and care it will last 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.090
 almost permanent 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.149
 the bangu comes from the grass family, that's right 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.810
 the type of grass that can also serve as animal feed and even in 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.470
 prevention of erosion of the media mesh to this in a very large way 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.409
 she ends up making a gun in her hand 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.380
 a support that a spider web holding the earth to control the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.340
 erosion by year researchers and academics of universities 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.920
 large country houses 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.910
 began to study the plant the work is part of a network that brings together all 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.540
 regions of the country financed by the federal government through the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.290
 national scientific and technological development cnpq for viviane that 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.630
 still among the university students participating in the research prepare the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.940
 varieties for planting the process made in the laboratory technically 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.809
 known as pingo vitro while in the field of blackberry 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:44.759
 in time the beach in him I know to say that we would accelerate this process 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:50.639
 contaminants as was a guard who faced with these things the main one is 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.549
 have a plant in santander 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.930
 is that any infection so far three varieties have been planted 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.300
 at the university's research center 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.690
 and will be taken to the large field fact and offered to the population with 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.160
 80 actions on the use must be kept in mind since the species can go from 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.900
 half a meter to 30 meters in height are more than one thousand three hundred species 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.970
 one of the main challenges of the research is to discover an efficient natural way ' 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.579
 to fight the world's most common pest 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.140
 known as snail are these little insects here behavior 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:29.219
 their 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:30.939
 is being evaluated 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.829
 the whole time in an unprecedented way and with the help of cameras the system 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.959
 was installed by academics of computer science 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.919
 in this part of the research a piece of cassava is being used in place of the 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:48.930
 bangu the snails are attracted by the friend students and teachers want 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.409
 to identify natural repellents for pests with high fixing power 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.959
 there are methods that will be 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.439
 Here are efficient chemical action methods that attack very lenient and 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.849
 there are also natural methods that an extract of questions only 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.449
 that they are not residents so I can not do 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.829
 it is a long competition and if and when it was treated 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:13.789
 this season 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:17.479
 everything to make a house for example that is the purpose of many varieties of 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.660
 bread Brazil we have Brazil 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.030
 Another research front is to study the use of bamboo in human 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.680
 all this is very related to the Japanese culture is the use of bamboo 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.990
 that year in the gigantinho 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.759
 the last one 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.419
 only that they are not discovering that others also have others who are 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:37.660
 edible 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.770
 he has a son during meetings and ends with the intentions of 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.880
 trip is not going to say that it is an income show but it will compete in 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.430
 a range of 1 much of the muricy 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.750
 this is a very common musician is the document on the internet will be more than 2 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.220
 years of study 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.100
 all the work will turn into a mapping with information about the 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.260
 cultivation and the use of bamboo what we want to get 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.710
 announce prefectures and in the attack 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.139
 where it is possible to plant the flock is 40 pt today asked people with 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.639
 insurance is with all its potential the great fight does not use 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.690
 he is breaking this cultural barrier ' 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.749
 what else does it exist 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:24.300
 long time I even like 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.569
 that the people 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:28.520
 inspection and internet search 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.759
 know more this productive chain
