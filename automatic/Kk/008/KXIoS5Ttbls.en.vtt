00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.289 
all the buttons here you have to hold
down<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.860> initiate<00:02:15.280> them<00:02:15.489> so<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.880> start/stop

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
down to initiate them so the start/stop

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:17.940 
down to initiate them so the start/stop
engine<00:02:16.630> might<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:16.900> have<00:02:17.019> to<00:02:17.140> hold<00:02:17.350> you<00:02:17.620> cannot

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
engine might you have to hold you cannot

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.030 
engine might you have to hold you cannot
just<00:02:18.250> tap<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:20.049> adaptive<00:02:20.530> dynamics

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
just tap it and the adaptive dynamics

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.400 
just tap it and the adaptive dynamics
you<00:02:21.160> hold<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.549> down<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.730> initiate<00:02:22.239> that<00:02:22.410> and

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
you hold it down to initiate that and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.319 
you hold it down to initiate that and
that<00:02:23.530> will<00:02:23.739> change<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.340> ride<00:02:24.609> quality<00:02:24.820> it'll

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
that will change the ride quality it'll

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.280 
that will change the ride quality it'll
make<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.600> bit<00:02:25.720> firmer<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:28.690> soft<00:02:28.959> ride<00:02:29.140> is

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
make it a bit firmer the soft ride is

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.500 
make it a bit firmer the soft ride is
actually<00:02:29.380> pretty<00:02:29.739> yet<00:02:29.980> it's<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.640> good

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
actually pretty yet it's a good

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.960 
actually pretty yet it's a good
sensation<00:02:31.720> for<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.290> road<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:33.609> would<00:02:33.760> say

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
sensation for the road and I would say

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.539 
sensation for the road and I would say
it's<00:02:34.239> just<00:02:35.019> shy<00:02:35.290> of<00:02:35.320> being<00:02:35.739> an<00:02:35.829> actual<00:02:36.250> soft

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
it's just shy of being an actual soft

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.660 
it's just shy of being an actual soft
ride<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.000> it's<00:02:37.120> still<00:02:37.269> a<00:02:37.299> bit<00:02:37.450> firm<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:39.280> we<00:02:39.310> dial

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
ride so it's still a bit firm so we dial

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.770 
ride so it's still a bit firm so we dial
in<00:02:39.850> our<00:02:39.970> drive<00:02:40.180> using<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:40.690> knob<00:02:40.900> here<00:02:42.780> clean

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
in our drive using this knob here clean

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.190 
in our drive using this knob here clean
it<00:02:44.019> tucks<00:02:44.260> away<00:02:44.500> when<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:44.799> not<00:02:44.950> being<00:02:45.220> used

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
it tucks away when it's not being used

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.020 
it tucks away when it's not being used
push<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.350> knob<00:02:47.500> down<00:02:47.859> into<00:02:48.579> the<00:02:48.670> right<00:02:48.850> to

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
push the knob down into the right to

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.979 
push the knob down into the right to
select<00:02:49.239> sport<00:02:49.690> mode

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.690 

so<00:02:52.500> look<00:02:52.650> clunky<00:02:52.859> it'd<00:02:53.129> be<00:02:53.219> nice<00:02:53.370> if<00:02:53.549> it<00:02:53.609> was

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
so look clunky it'd be nice if it was

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.190 
so look clunky it'd be nice if it was
smooth<00:02:54.180> or<00:02:54.480> something<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.870> feels<00:02:55.019> really

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
smooth or something it feels really

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.839 
smooth or something it feels really
mechanical<00:02:55.829> it'd<00:02:56.069> be<00:02:56.159> nice<00:02:56.310> if<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.519> was<00:02:56.609> kind

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
mechanical it'd be nice if it was kind

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.569 
mechanical it'd be nice if it was kind
of<00:02:56.909> how<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.090> some<00:02:57.299> of<00:02:57.359> their<00:02:57.450> feeling<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:02.400> right

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
of how to some of their feeling so right

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.069 
of how to some of their feeling so right
now<00:03:02.700> everything's<00:03:03.180> set<00:03:03.359> up<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.599> normal<00:03:03.930> mode

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
now everything's set up in normal mode

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.849 
now everything's set up in normal mode
and<00:03:04.909> as<00:03:05.909> you<00:03:06.120> can<00:03:06.299> probably<00:03:06.810> sense<00:03:07.349> this<00:03:07.709> is

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
and as you can probably sense this is

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.069 
and as you can probably sense this is
some<00:03:08.040> rough<00:03:08.159> road<00:03:08.370> we<00:03:08.549> just<00:03:08.730> went<00:03:08.879> over<00:03:09.079> the

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
some rough road we just went over the

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.050 
some rough road we just went over the
ride<00:03:10.319> is<00:03:10.620> still<00:03:10.920> pretty<00:03:11.370> firm<00:03:11.819> in<00:03:12.090> this

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
ride is still pretty firm in this

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.699 
ride is still pretty firm in this
there's<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.209> slight<00:03:15.659> sensation<00:03:16.379> of<00:03:16.469> floating

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
there's a slight sensation of floating

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.530 
there's a slight sensation of floating
along<00:03:17.159> and<00:03:17.459> that's<00:03:17.639> nice<00:03:17.939> it<00:03:18.150> makes<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.480> a

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
along and that's nice it makes it a

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.129 
along and that's nice it makes it a
comfortable<00:03:18.989> sporty<00:03:19.920> vehicle<00:03:20.480> now<00:03:21.480> in<00:03:21.629> the<00:03:21.719> XF

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
comfortable sporty vehicle now in the XF

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.819 
comfortable sporty vehicle now in the XF
when<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.680> go<00:03:22.799> into<00:03:22.950> adaptive<00:03:23.700> dynamics<00:03:24.829> the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
when you go into adaptive dynamics the

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.890 
when you go into adaptive dynamics the
speedometer<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:26.849> tachometer<00:03:27.150> don't<00:03:27.599> turn

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
speedometer and tachometer don't turn

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.640 
speedometer and tachometer don't turn
red<00:03:28.560> in<00:03:28.799> both<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.669> f-type<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.389> the<00:03:30.599> XJ<00:03:31.079> you

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
red in both the f-type and the XJ you

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.229 
red in both the f-type and the XJ you
get<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.829> nice<00:03:32.040> little<00:03:32.340> red<00:03:32.549> glow<00:03:32.760> there<00:03:33.030> that

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
get a nice little red glow there that

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.479 
get a nice little red glow there that
tells<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.599> that<00:03:33.720> you're<00:03:33.959> in<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.859> adaptive

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
tells you that you're in the adaptive

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.110 
tells you that you're in the adaptive
dynamics<00:03:35.909> mode<00:03:36.799> so<00:03:37.799> adaptive<00:03:38.340> dynamics<00:03:38.849> takes

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
dynamics mode so adaptive dynamics takes

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.449 
dynamics mode so adaptive dynamics takes
care<00:03:39.359> of<00:03:39.450> your<00:03:39.599> suspension<00:03:40.069> sport<00:03:41.069> mode<00:03:41.219> takes

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
care of your suspension sport mode takes

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.619 
care of your suspension sport mode takes

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
care of your revs so in sport mode you

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.420 
care of your revs so in sport mode you

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
will hang on to rubs around the 3,000

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.030
