whole thing the problem with staining

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.889 
whole thing the problem with staining
the<00:01:01.649> whole<00:01:01.890> thing<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.789> those<00:01:03.359> areas<00:01:03.660> that

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the whole thing is that those areas that

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.620 
the whole thing is that those areas that
still<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.530> polyurethane<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.299> pull

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
still have polyurethane on if you pull

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.600 
still have polyurethane on if you pull
if<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.049> stain<00:01:07.470> over<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.010> top<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
if you stain over the top of the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.570 
if you stain over the top of the
polyurethane<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.840> won't<00:01:10.110> dry<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.369> does

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
polyurethane it won't dry and if it does

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.030 
polyurethane it won't dry and if it does
dry<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.210> will<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.450> continuously<00:01:13.229> sticky<00:01:13.830> and

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
dry it will be continuously sticky and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.130 
dry it will be continuously sticky and
tacky<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.930> what<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.229> want<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.680> is

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
tacky so really what you want to do is

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.950 
tacky so really what you want to do is
use<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> feather<00:01:19.590> technique<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.600> just<00:01:21.600> stain

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960

the<00:01:22.229> areas<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.740> need<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.400> stained<00:01:23.850> first

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
the areas that need to be stained first

myself up to it and roll up to it and
then<00:02:58.640> I<00:02:58.670> would<00:02:58.940> do<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.450> same<00:02:59.570> thing<00:03:00.019> I<00:03:00.110> roll<00:03:00.590> it

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
then I would do the same thing I roll it

stain inside the damaged area you can

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.520 
stain inside the damaged area you can
see<00:03:08.150> that<00:03:08.330> was<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.510> much<00:03:08.720> better<00:03:08.900> staining

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
see that was a much better staining

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.940

you<00:03:17.900> take<00:03:18.170> polyurethane<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.280> I've<00:03:19.459> mixed<00:03:19.850> my

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
you take polyurethane and I've mixed my

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.289 
you take polyurethane and I've mixed my
own<00:03:20.209> polyurethane<00:03:21.140> here<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.820> what<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.000> like<00:03:23.269> to

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
own polyurethane here and what I like to

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.020 
own polyurethane here and what I like to
do<00:03:23.630> this<00:03:24.049> is<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.470> little<00:03:25.220> different<00:03:28.000> what<00:03:29.000> I

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030

like<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.450> do<00:03:29.600> is<00:03:29.720> I<00:03:29.840> like<00:03:29.989> to<00:03:30.049> dip<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:30.769> long<00:03:31.459> stick

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
like to do is I like to dip a long stick

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.470 
like to do is I like to dip a long stick
inside<00:03:32.480> here<00:03:33.019> so<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:33.920> runs<00:03:34.160> down<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.850> tip<00:03:35.180> and

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
inside here so it runs down the tip and

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.560 
inside here so it runs down the tip and
then<00:03:36.410> at<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.739> same<00:03:36.980> time<00:03:37.840> what<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:38.870> do<00:03:39.130> is<00:03:40.299> I<00:03:41.299> put

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
then at the same time what I do is I put

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.350 
then at the same time what I do is I put
it<00:03:41.690> right<00:03:41.720> over<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.410> crack<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:43.519> I<00:03:43.910> work<00:03:44.150> it

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
it right over the crack and I work it

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.470 
it right over the crack and I work it
right<00:03:44.660> down<00:03:44.930> that<00:03:45.290> area<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:46.370> it<00:03:46.489> fills<00:03:46.940> in<00:03:47.269> that

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
right down that area so it fills in that

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.870 
right down that area so it fills in that
void<00:03:50.590> just<00:03:51.590> like<00:03:51.769> that<00:03:52.010> so<00:03:52.489> you're<00:03:52.609> doing<00:03:52.730> a

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
void just like that so you're doing a

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.240 
void just like that so you're doing a
little<00:03:53.150> bit<00:03:53.389> of<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.630> front<00:03:53.900> of<00:03:54.049> a<00:03:54.200> repair<00:03:54.680> here

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
little bit of a front of a repair here

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.900 
little bit of a front of a repair here
same<00:03:55.460> time<00:03:55.760> get<00:03:56.690> some<00:03:56.900> on<00:03:57.140> there<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:58.430> it<00:03:58.550> flows

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
same time get some on there so it flows

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.200 
same time get some on there so it flows
down<00:03:59.710> you're<00:04:00.710> just<00:04:00.950> going<00:04:01.070> to<00:04:01.100> take<00:04:01.340> drops<00:04:01.790> and

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
down you're just going to take drops and

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.730 
down you're just going to take drops and
you're<00:04:02.300> going<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:02.480> fill<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:02.900> area<00:04:03.380> with

you're going to fill that area with

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.470 
you're going to fill that area with
drops<00:04:06.190> then<00:04:07.190> you<00:04:07.340> take<00:04:07.550> this<00:04:07.730> drop<00:04:08.060> work<00:04:08.330> it

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
drops then you take this drop work it

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:20.080 
drops then you take this drop work it
right<00:04:08.690> back<00:04:08.870> over<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.290> this<00:04:09.440> area<00:04:17.109> okay<00:04:19.090> now

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
right back over to this area okay now

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.370

after<00:04:20.510> this<00:04:21.260> dries<00:04:22.360> you're<00:04:23.360> going<00:04:23.630> to<00:04:23.780> have<00:04:23.990> a

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
after this dries you're going to have a

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.730 
after this dries you're going to have a
little<00:04:25.190> bit<00:04:25.370> on<00:04:25.640> each<00:04:25.910> side<00:04:26.570> that<00:04:27.020> doesn't

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.340 
little bit on each side that doesn't
belong<00:04:28.330> because<00:04:29.330> you're<00:04:29.510> kind<00:04:29.780> of<00:04:29.870> bled<00:04:30.320> over
