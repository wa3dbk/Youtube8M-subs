you're only moving one foot at a time
let's<00:01:30.090> try<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.329> combine<00:01:30.540> those<00:01:30.810> two<00:01:30.869> steps<00:01:31.320> in

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
let's try to combine those two steps in

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.770 
let's try to combine those two steps in
a<00:01:32.159> slow<00:01:32.369> motion<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.299> go<00:01:33.450> we're<00:01:33.720> gonna

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
a slow motion here we go we're gonna

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.429 
a slow motion here we go we're gonna
bring<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.140> up<00:01:34.970> step<00:01:36.000> hands<00:01:36.630> close<00:01:37.110> when<00:01:37.350> you

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
bring it up step hands close when you

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.700 
bring it up step hands close when you
