00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:08.690
 Hello everyone, today we'll see how to make a 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.300
 scooby doo square will be very simple 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:15.839
 as five minutes will be enough 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.990
 everyone can do it taking two into account 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.570
 if 23 very simple rules then 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.570
 let's see immediately how to make it 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:33.470
 we take two doors of about 40 50 cm 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:38.690
 with one we make a classic world node 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:44.710
 we know beautiful and the other we insert it 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.710
 the interior and from here 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.059
 and so far this passage is all easy 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.210
 we know it very well because it occurs 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.210
 always 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.490
 now we have to turn it this way 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:11.240
 and we must remember two three 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.369
 basic rules to be able to do 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.369
 our square scooby doo 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:23.200
 then rule number one we take a 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.790
 boss in this case and we have to 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.140
 place it by forming a circle with one 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:37.310
 alone in this way not here but here 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:40.700
 that we form them this alone now 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.680
 we will have to move always formed 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.170
 this year we should always move into 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.530
 clockwise 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:54.259
 always in this case the first step 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:58.640
 so let's take this string and the 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:04.310
 we pass in this way and from da ju ve ne 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:08.330
 went to this not so no so that 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.660
 so- so and we pass it this way 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:16.190
 this is fundamental and we form 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.390
 another one we hear a little bit and 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.420
 we form another just now 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.940
 now we take one from his other 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.400
 next rope we are there 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.819
 moving clockwise 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:35.750
 this his next and let's go to 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:39.200
 insert in his we have formed and 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.140
 let us turn this one into another 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.530
 the pole we belong to 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.890
 ok now 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:53.470
 but from this other slot we will go to 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:56.440
 put the last last rope that is 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:03.250
 remained free and therefore always in this 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:10.260
 so then from here we enter inside 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:18.850
 we will not do so we will do so it will form 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:22.320
 then we will go to pull our no's of de 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:27.930
 mend our knots and will have to appear 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.930
 obligatory on our humble 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:37.799
 this 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.799
 this drawing if these will appear marks 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.450
 if it appears in this drawing of ours 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.670
 stupid 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:04:01.720
 will succeed near a little bit 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:04:03.900
 smile but I have to get out of this 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.900
 drawing 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:14.470
 so if there is from here then another was born 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:18.760
 part I don't always go about affirming one 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:22.930
 his doing touch on the same on the 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:26.979
 same rope that I then remember I have to 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:31.360
 take the rope that touches that 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:37.710
 crosses the only one for my sole is 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.710
 this one with this one is this one 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.820
 so we did the nose now the 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:56.889
 this rope that would be near tourists 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:05:00.460
 and the rope that I did was to the 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:04.810
 rope that touches and it had with 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:10.470
 this born her German and I make a 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:15.750
 further I'm going to do her 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:20.410
 on and the rope that touches my own 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:23.729
 that is, this is in turn the 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.729
 I insert inside 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:35.380
 finally the last rope that touches the 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:38.430
 my own is this you find 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.430
 enter so 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.770
 but win over 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.740
 to push 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.740
 and always appears 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:16.659
 andrea we are for the same design 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.659
 let's do this until the end 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.260
 let's keep doing the same 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.260
 method 

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:42.389
 no scooby doo and finished 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:47.580
 as you can see it was very simple for 

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:51.469
 making it is really beautiful 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:55.439
 we can all badly keychain 

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:59.900
 we can do hope you like it e 

00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:59.900
 to the next to the next video bye
