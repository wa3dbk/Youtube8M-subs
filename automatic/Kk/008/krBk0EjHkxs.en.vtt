transition to electronic who'll have a

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.369 
transition to electronic who'll have a
chart<00:00:50.980> and<00:00:51.970> they<00:00:52.420> might<00:00:52.629> cut<00:00:52.870> down<00:00:52.900> a<00:00:53.079> note

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.189 
chart and they might cut down a note
here<00:00:53.680> and<00:00:53.800> there<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:56.559> know<00:00:58.110> mm-hmm

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
here and there you know mm-hmm

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.850 
here and there you know mm-hmm
absolutely<00:00:59.830> yes<00:01:00.570> well<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.600> lot<00:01:01.780> of<00:01:01.809> it<00:01:02.080> has

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
absolutely yes well a lot of it has

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.830 
absolutely yes well a lot of it has
changed<00:01:02.939> and<00:01:03.939> I<00:01:05.310> believe<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.729> this<00:01:07.420> is<00:01:07.630> going

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
changed and I believe that this is going

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.109 
changed and I believe that this is going
to<00:01:07.930> be<00:01:08.110> a<00:01:08.380> much<00:01:08.770> better<00:01:09.159> way<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.549> chart

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
to be a much better way to chart

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.890 
to be a much better way to chart
basically<00:01:13.119> I'm<00:01:13.420> able<00:01:13.689> to<00:01:13.750> have<00:01:13.869> a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
basically I'm able to have a

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.710 
basically I'm able to have a
conversation<00:01:14.170> with<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:15.189> patient<00:01:15.479> face<00:01:16.479> to

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
conversation with the patient face to

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.590 
conversation with the patient face to
face<00:01:17.820> without<00:01:18.820> any<00:01:19.090> distractions<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:21.600> obtain

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
face without any distractions and obtain

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.649 
face without any distractions and obtain
a<00:01:23.369> exact<00:01:24.369> note<00:01:24.670> of<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.689> event<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.540> it

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
a exact note of the event and so it

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:29.760 
a exact note of the event and so it
builds<00:01:28.840> a<00:01:28.960> better<00:01:29.079> relationship<00:01:29.740> between

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
builds a better relationship between

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.050 
builds a better relationship between
patient<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.520> physician

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
patient and physician

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.989 
patient and physician
it<00:01:32.219> makes<00:01:33.219> the<00:01:33.340> patient<00:01:33.670> feel<00:01:33.700> more

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999 
it makes the patient feel more

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:37.109 
it makes the patient feel more
comfortable<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:35.460> you're<00:01:36.460> making<00:01:36.880> eye

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.260 
in front of the TV you ready no it's
basically<00:02:39.650> time<00:02:40.430> away<00:02:40.760> from<00:02:40.790> their<00:02:41.240> families

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
basically time away from their families

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
basically time away from their families
which<00:02:42.260> can<00:02:42.620> get<00:02:42.770> costly<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:43.670> I<00:02:44.510> was<00:02:44.930> doing<00:02:45.200> that

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
which can get costly so I was doing that

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.280 
which can get costly so I was doing that
for<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.560> period<00:02:45.740> of<00:02:45.950> time<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.690> know<00:02:47.810> it's

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
for a period of time and I you know it's

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
for a period of time and I you know it's
very<00:02:48.350> draining<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:50.630> it's<00:02:51.350> not<00:02:51.680> something

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
very draining and it's not something

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.970 
very draining and it's not something
that<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.870> look<00:02:54.020> forward<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.560> at<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.770> end<00:02:54.860> of

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
that you look forward to at the end of

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.930 
that you look forward to at the end of
the<00:02:55.070> day<00:02:55.250> writing<00:02:55.760> your<00:02:55.880> notes<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:58.250> kept

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
the day writing your notes so you kept

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.460 
the day writing your notes so you kept
thinking<00:02:59.180> about<00:02:59.240> different<00:02:59.540> ways<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.080> just

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
thinking about different ways and just

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.620 
thinking about different ways and just
so<00:03:00.680> happened<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:01.310> came<00:03:01.460> across<00:03:01.610> of<00:03:02.240> medics

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
so happened that I came across of medics

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.810 
so happened that I came across of medics
which<00:03:03.200> has<00:03:03.410> been<00:03:03.560> absolutely<00:03:03.950> fantastic<00:03:04.130> I've

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
which has been absolutely fantastic I've

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.550 
which has been absolutely fantastic I've
been<00:03:04.940> able<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.210> get<00:03:05.420> my<00:03:05.630> life<00:03:05.870> back<00:03:05.900> I'm<00:03:06.410> no

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
been able to get my life back I'm no

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.170 
been able to get my life back I'm no
longer<00:03:07.630> at<00:03:08.630> home<00:03:08.690> typing<00:03:09.560> up<00:03:09.890> notes<00:03:10.370> for<00:03:10.760> hours

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
longer at home typing up notes for hours

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.400 
longer at home typing up notes for hours
and<00:03:11.450> hours<00:03:12.130> basically<00:03:13.130> it<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:14.510> know<00:03:14.630> it<00:03:15.200> on

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
and hours basically it you know it on

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.340 
and hours basically it you know it on
the<00:03:16.190> most<00:03:16.790> important<00:03:17.270> hand<00:03:17.480> allowed<00:03:18.050> me<00:03:18.320> to

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
the most important hand allowed me to

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.620 
the most important hand allowed me to
connect<00:03:18.800> with<00:03:18.920> my<00:03:19.070> patients<00:03:19.250> better<00:03:19.700> and<00:03:20.060> then

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
connect with my patients better and then

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.530 
connect with my patients better and then
as<00:03:21.140> a<00:03:21.200> second<00:03:21.770> reward<00:03:22.130> I<00:03:22.460> got<00:03:22.910> more<00:03:23.120> time<00:03:23.330> with

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
as a second reward I got more time with

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.200 
as a second reward I got more time with
my<00:03:23.690> family<00:03:23.900> which<00:03:24.350> has<00:03:24.500> been<00:03:24.680> great<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:25.820> had<00:03:26.180> a

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
my family which has been great I had a

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.910 
my family which has been great I had a
lot<00:03:26.390> of<00:03:26.420> questions<00:03:26.840> when<00:03:27.110> looking<00:03:27.590> into<00:03:27.830> AG

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
lot of questions when looking into AG

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.340 
lot of questions when looking into AG
medics<00:03:28.450> probably<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.570> most<00:03:29.750> important<00:03:30.200> was

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
medics probably the most important was

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.780 
medics probably the most important was
security<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.160> was<00:03:31.760> sort<00:03:32.060> of<00:03:32.180> on<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:33.170> edge<00:03:33.350> on

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
security I was sort of on the edge on

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.490 
security I was sort of on the edge on
figuring<00:03:34.790> out<00:03:34.880> if<00:03:35.120> this<00:03:35.360> is<00:03:35.570> a<00:03:35.600> platform<00:03:36.260> that

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
figuring out if this is a platform that

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.630 
figuring out if this is a platform that
I<00:03:36.530> feel<00:03:36.830> comfortable<00:03:37.220> enough<00:03:37.760> with<00:03:38.710> and<00:03:39.710> where

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
I feel comfortable enough with and where

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.950 
I feel comfortable enough with and where
my<00:03:40.940> patient<00:03:41.420> files<00:03:41.660> are<00:03:41.900> safe<00:03:42.440> with<00:03:42.680> so<00:03:42.890> for

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
my patient files are safe with so for

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.530 
my patient files are safe with so for
for<00:03:45.070> electronic<00:03:46.070> records<00:03:46.100> I<00:03:46.730> use<00:03:46.910> practice

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
for electronic records I use practice

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.500 
for electronic records I use practice
Fusion<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:48.670> medics<00:03:49.670> apparently<00:03:50.090> is<00:03:50.180> able<00:03:50.390> to

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
Fusion and medics apparently is able to

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.050 
Fusion and medics apparently is able to
work<00:03:50.630> with<00:03:50.930> multiple<00:03:51.910> electronic<00:03:52.910> health

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
work with multiple electronic health

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.640 
work with multiple electronic health
records<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:54.550> they<00:03:55.550> have<00:03:55.940> assured<00:03:56.060> me<00:03:56.510> that

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
records and they have assured me that

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.640 
records and they have assured me that
safety<00:03:57.650> is<00:03:57.680> their<00:03:58.070> number<00:03:58.520> one<00:03:59.080> and<00:04:00.080> security

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
safety is their number one and security

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.910 
safety is their number one and security
is<00:04:00.709> their<00:04:00.890> number<00:04:01.220> one<00:04:01.270> priority<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:03.530> that's

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
is their number one priority and that's

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.810 
is their number one priority and that's
kind<00:04:04.340> of<00:04:04.430> what<00:04:04.670> got<00:04:05.120> me<00:04:05.330> along<00:04:05.600> with<00:04:05.750> it
