00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 you need to remember that yogurt is still 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.980
 needs to be done correctly in order to 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.230
 all bacteria are preserved there 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.150
 back you need to boil the milk and give 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.830
 cool down to keep sterile 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.450
 it is in this pot and before that 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.160
 as you said when we studied 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.619
 cooking homemade yogurt is necessary 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.750
 sterilize and saucepan and cup 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.939
 if we use it and spoon 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.600
 that is, give all the boiling water well 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.060
 this milk has already cooled to 40 degrees 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.250
 to keep bacteria alive 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.260
 there if you temperature is higher then they 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.820
 just die well if suddenly milk 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.559
 it will be cold then they will be very 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.320
 uncomfortable so this temperature 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.879
 as tanyush said in principle is 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.670
 prerequisite for cooking 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.100
 delicious homemade yogurt 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.450
 we stand in small portions in the soul 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.430
 I have good news for you this 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.410
 a bag is enough for three liters 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.420
 of milk 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.399
 but we use for 1 liter 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.710
 approximately it means that we have 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.230
 there will be more bacteria there than if we 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.670
 3 liters prepared concentration 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.039
 beneficial bacteria will be the same 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.769
 high and density yogurt is also not 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.170
 it will be different that a liter is 3 liters 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.970
 will be the same density the only thing 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.090
 what will this differ in time 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.820
 fermentation if for 1 liter we need 8 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.830
 hours then 3 liters we need 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.110
 about ten o'clock that is with us 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.360
 get faster by the way tanyusha you 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.520
 noticed that earlier in the spring many people 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.830
 it doesn't matter how we feel we are not getting enough sleep 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.049
 reduced performance appear 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.119
 problems with skin and hair nails 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.460
 and all because in winter our bodies 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.170
 got much less vitamins than 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.930
 needed and now we need 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.180
 fill in the lack of vitamins a 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.000
 absorption of vitamins from the food that we 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.890
 eat meets the intestines and not to lose 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.090
 the vitamins that we eat are important 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.320
 maintain a healthy microflora 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.270
 intestines 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.180
 this can be done with natural 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.880
 homemade yogurts that contain live 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.680
 varnish the and bifidobacteria therefore need 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.750
 remember that the more species there will be 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.549
 bacteria products the faster and 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.590
 recovery will be more effective 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.000
 microflora and to be sure 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.490
 what's in your yogurt 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.129
 there are really living ones you need 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.209
 bacteria cook them yourself and special 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.580
 bacterial starters 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.590
 to 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.770
 torus and can be bought at any pharmacy that 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.380
 we actually do yes if 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.300
 your pan like that she has 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.370
 such a fat one that will hold 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.740
 the temperature is still warm and the bottom 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.600
 there will be another five hours probably holder 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.670
 on maintain the heat there 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.620
 as a yogurt maker, yes, there is always 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.930
 these jars are heated and we will have 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.760
 warm up but but there is still small 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.670
 nuance one if you play 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.530
 you can make glass jars 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.600
 use a hot water bottle or just 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.670
 wrap in a warm wool blanket if 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.230
 pan amide's such a thick bottom that 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.710
 There is to create such a greenhouse 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.500
 conditions 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.010
 woolen blanket you tomorrow on dyusha 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.230
 Yogurt will be ready in the morning and his 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.180
 I wrap him further along with 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.500
 yogurt woolen blanket gave 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.360
 that I love good friends 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.580
 listen so we are now with you without 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.650
 yoghurt remained on the nyush option 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:08.170
 magic fridge get here 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.250
 the amount of yogurt will turn out after that 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.530
 how does he get ready 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.450
 here a liter of yoghurt also sharpens a very 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.190
 Do you like milk ? 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.620
 the same amount of yogurt is obtained that is 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.090
 we recall that homemade yogurt after 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.840
 cooking when it's already full 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.280
 ready need to be refrigerated until 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.750
 necessarily after to yogurt 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.030
 got ready to be sure he needed 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.280
 put in sterile clean dishes 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.870
 close the lid and only after that 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.320
 send the fridge where he can 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.320
 to be stored
