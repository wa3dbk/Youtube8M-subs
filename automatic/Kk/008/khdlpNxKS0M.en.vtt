00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.420
 bench shadow stayed in the first game 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.280
 of sao paulo on liberators arrives 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.519
 being against the Corinthians had to be 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.529
 in the iteration and once more once more 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.880
 today it was very difficult to hold me 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.460
 I even apologize the twitter guys 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.169
 who accompanied me there because I really 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.259
 I stayed so I was extremely 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.509
 angry because once again his 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.000
 muricy ramalho the technician that we have 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.429
 much to be thankful for for what he played in 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.190
 São Paulo as a player for titles 

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:40.079
 who conquered as technical trio 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.750
 Brazilian, we have to thank you more 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.019
 one more time in a deciding game 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.079
 muricy ramalho decided to climb a 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.059
 unction paulinetti unpublished from são paulo 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.280
 unprecedented lineup for a deciding match 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.949
 and whenever muricy does this I say 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.379
 always was not once were at least 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.670
 10 incidentally it was my intuit was at least 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.129
 ten times he did this to people 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.569
 to lose bragantino thus of chapecoense and 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.030
 playing decisive game that we fall 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:07.049
 and now we have to face the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.700
 corinthians 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.009
 to get morals on the liberators 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.020
 first game there he decided to get the 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.149
 player who until then had the best 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.729
 offensive index of sao paulo michel 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.890
 the best index by the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.170
 paulo has the highest number of goals per 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.369
 infiltrating the middle and dislocating the face 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.649
 for side 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.140
 that's right that yours saw what happened 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.770
 Sao Paulo was weak on the sides. 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.740
 weak flyers in the marking the maico more 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.409
 a bad game the goose image bad game o 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.619
 half did not work the attack did not receive 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.420
 ball and Sao Paulo gave ridiculous no 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.780
 kick to goal 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.600
 to spam no goal kick at 30 minutes 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.820
 the first time in a kick 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.170
 was not towards the goal was the only 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.299
 opportunity of sao paulo in the first 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.539
 time and in the second half in chute without 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.280
 also baby direction but cadu was the 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.469
 only chance of são paulo in the second 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.350
 time but no ball that effectively 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.630
 had gone on goal just the case 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.640
 because one had a ball hits the rebate 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.500
 ball went up and he jumped and fell to 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.470
 gain time otherwise could put 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.690
 a bucket a cone a chair in the goal that 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.239
 Muricy sitting stroll watching the game 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.970
 sitting watching the game in a calm 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.900
 while the tite giving a class of 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.250
 soccer 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.360
 the Corinthians fans shouted with 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.060
 reason or is the tite shouted and gesticulated 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.130
 pointed out so it is difficult but in the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.160
 My opinion do not understand who thinks the 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.700
 Otherwise the muricy gave what had to 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.310
 to give 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.160
 It's difficult and it's been a long time since we 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.840
 does not win a title on behalf of muricy 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.690
 the last title we won was 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.480
 despite the municipality and not on his behalf 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.390
 so I'm pretty tired of 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.010
 sao paulo was massacred did nothing 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.810
 had no attitude or bleachers and 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.370
 put your way that I'm part of the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.110
 grandstand but Ricardo made a 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.170
 wonderful video that alan kardec 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.360
 he retorted and they return because what the alan 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.420
 kardec has posted to facebook 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.650
 and so I think she did not attend the 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.950
 because the video talking about 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.260
 motivation and motivation of são paulo was 0 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.900
 the players entered a tactic the 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.560
 players came in reluctantly and what 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.019
 he saw it was under him lu with 35 36 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.940
 years with the defense of the 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.100
 paulo while luis fabiano eller vez 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.079
 that he played the ball in the two or three 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.940
 few times he played had three 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.370
 danilo corinthians scorers gave 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.549
 left handed letter pass 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.910
 she raised ball in the area kicked in goal 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:41.549
 it was a ridiculous business one more time 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.130
 so discouraged because the team is 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.500
 Paulo does not have such a bad cast for 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.030
 losing the first leg and lost to the 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.350
 São Paulo has a cast to lose from the 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.540
 corinthians 2 to 0 away. 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.350
 Of course a classic is a result 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.329
 possible 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.060
 São Paulo does not have a good cast to lose 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.370
 ridiculous how he lost without giving a 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.840
 kick to the goal without any danger 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.450
 for the opponent 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.040
 that's what I say the owner is not lose 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.799
 It's tough to have to play 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.200
 the ipb without a player to hit the 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.419
 Chest the hard is just to hear the fans scream 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.340
 pushes a lot of heroes that have been 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.560
 watch a game of this to make more 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.739
 once a lot of zinho player apa 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.919
 It tires but it tires even then I know. 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.630
 which is a new administration there that came 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.580
 to take care of Sao Paulo and such 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.740
 There's a lot to change from 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.139
 physical preparation are paulo that is a 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.720
 São Paulo cancer can not 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:37.560
 to mark 35 year old license 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.250
 from ultra ultra ultra mid field 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.200
 slow 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.120
 You know who will take care of the little step aside 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.120
 and then wanting to cheer 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.310
 In the interview he gives names to whom he 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.900
 found the keeper of the rabbit 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.389
 the corinthians goal was the fault of all 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.229
 world the first the second occhi had a 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.389
 arbitration error 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.510
 we play against Corinthians and not 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:01.590
 wait for arbitration errors to innocence 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.840
 the then so tired tired again 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.240
 people leave begins with a defeat and the 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.490
 worse the team left the field as if nothing 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.350
 had happened the crowd knows how to 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.460
 I'm a hothead now is the 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.389
 people do not sleep 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.070
 and we have to work on 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.020
 next I live on the canal at 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.040
 want to get into the game today because 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.660
 I had to cover the carnival 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.710
 had to work and wanted to go 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.030
 I wish I had gone 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.950
 That's because I thought I could play. 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.410
 because I thought 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.630
 The field has not entered so try 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.280
 imagine if it was a forest kills 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.720
 If it was a knockout Sao Paulo 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.310
 lost 2 to 0 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.870
 we are talking about a technician who 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.760
 taking a dance 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.650
 the opposing team from the hill the guy does not 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.240
 change the team the guy expects to take the 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.280
 second goal to move the team 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.930
 the tite made three tactical changes in 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.970
 his team and Corinthians were 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.550
 winning the game by 2 to 0 then there you 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.260
 see the difference the corinthians played and the 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.510
 São Paulo does not seem to be back from work 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.250
 aggravated to remember this while the team 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.300
 got into training, can only be absent because 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.850
 I was well 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.380
 Then I'll say it again when I 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.960
 I said that and was greatly criticized in 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.389
 twitter why put evandro against the 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.340
 saints we are not testing by testing that 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.050
 we already prepare a type to 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.970
 liberators the muricy is to put the saints 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.669
 on the liberators neither the stick nor the bank 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.760
 was so yes this lack of consistency 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:17.280
 of the technician crossed any limit 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.500
 São Paulo once again has no basis 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.460
 has game pattern has no holder 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.610
 There 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.289
 by the second half of August the plan 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.819
 second half of september 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:28.139
 The team starts playing because I think 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:29.759
 He just told me look, let's expect nothing. 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.740
 Of this technician let's play 2015 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:33.120
 I 'm tired of setting up a team to 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.710
 play midseason 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.319
 if I play same season muricy 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.940
 several united states rolling doctor up 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:41.160
 the orlando magic is no excuse in Mexico 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.830
 basketball orlando if you will not play there 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.199
 had kaka that there the season begins 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.960
 the girl hit an easy ball and setup 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:51.240
 bread lost because I already saw I'm tired 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.039
 of losing São Paulo because of lack of 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.690
 planning by invincibility of 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:56.430
 Planning is tired of losing 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.229
 liberators for the same reason then 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.940
 so I do not know what to do, I do not know 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:02.070
 What to do for this team Improve 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.690
 but I'll continue to cheer this up. 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.789
 news is not good and we will 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.139
 spend a hellish week of those for 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:09.240
 and it's no use winning the 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:11.460
 Paulista that will not get anything so 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.210
 Personal Brazil everyone and that is to 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.210
 next week
