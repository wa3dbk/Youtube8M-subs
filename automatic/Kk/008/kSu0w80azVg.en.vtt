00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.090
 good when I was a girl 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:23.619
 they operated on my stomachs had like 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.619
 seven years and everything was very difficult 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:37.130
 and at that time in the year 87 my country did not 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:40.880
 there was a lot of development at the medical level and 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.650
 I did not know what was happening to me I never 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.170
 they did an x-ray 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.270
 and they discovered that there was something very big 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.380
 inside the stomach almost as big as 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.970
 milton then they told my parents 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.630
 that he possibly had a tumor 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.630
 carcinogenic 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.040
 they had to operate was the only 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.440
 solution then well they made me a 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.710
 lots of exams almost six months ago 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.710
 doing exams 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.460
 Quite smoking because to get that 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.300
 radiography they gave me a yogurt I want 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.260
 whatever 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.570
 as maybe it was horrible horrible I 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.620
 they went around everywhere 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.590
 I get good blood all that 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.659
 it implies 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.979
 started 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.979
 to discover what there is not 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:45.820
 Until then, it was the only case in 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.970
 the world of a person who was born with 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.550
 all the stomach and came up to a 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.410
 certain age with the stomach because 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.980
 Children with double stomach die 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.530
 six months a month what I 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.590
 they explained was that there was not a nest of 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.740
 the stomachs generate us, I would have 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.740
 dead 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.140
 what I remember when I 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.930
 they operated I could not eat for a year I 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.090
 I think that the whole operation more 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.540
 have been deprived of food during 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.340
 a year was I think the best thing because 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.860
 I had to keep doing my life 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.150
 normal but no longer normal then 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.820
 for example he had to go to the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.860
 birthday and they let me participate in 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.040
 the floods that I was very good then 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.690
 to almost all the candy and had to 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.450
 make a row with the children we record 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.970
 and distribute the child 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.830
 I could not digital 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.860
 that's the saddest thing I think I go to the 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.010
 birthday leave me super charged with 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.750
 mom after years the ladies me 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.060
 they asked nothing and why can not you 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.880
 eat and they started to cry next I did not 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.880
 I understood why the bikes had me 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.790
 It sounds very happy girl but some time 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.400
 very bitter 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.420
 and then for me 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.390
 it's fundamental so for example when I 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.030
 I was hospitalized for two weeks 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.239
 I would have loved his life and a clown 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.760
 hospital makes a root that is terrible 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.890
 It's terrible because there are obviously hours 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.650
 visit and there were many hours in the 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.640
 that I was alone alone looking at the ceiling 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.640
 that was all 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.049
 we have 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.049
 gonzÃ¡lez 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:55.300
 I look for his voice what I do to the king who does not 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:02.220
 writes 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:06.900
 in a water droplet itself sought and 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:12.350
 I do not want her to talk, I'll do 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:19.200
 she a ring that will take my silence 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:24.670
 pse lope the people do not want to 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:30.640
 I will talk to her about a ring 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:36.130
 the brusque antivalores put on a suit 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:40.870
 I do not want her to talk to me 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:46.750
 I will make with her a ring that will take my 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:53.430
 silence in your fingers, not the little 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.430
 I want to talk to no one with her 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:01.750
 they look for her and she will choose 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.770
 if you put a fragile 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.770
 Yes Yes 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.600
 in which 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.140
 xx 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.140
 yes
