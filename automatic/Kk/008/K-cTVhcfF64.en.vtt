00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.560 
I moisturize with the trio machine first
I'm<00:01:09.130> using<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.430> private<00:01:09.670> line<00:01:09.970> somewhat<00:01:10.360> to<00:01:10.450> see

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
I'm using a private line somewhat to see

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.560 
I'm using a private line somewhat to see
what<00:01:10.750> I<00:01:10.780> prefer

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.510 

so<00:01:16.570> using<00:01:16.810> that<00:01:17.640> enough<00:01:18.960> I'm<00:01:19.960> saying

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
so using that enough I'm saying

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.639 
so using that enough I'm saying
hopefully<00:01:21.570> it'll<00:01:22.570> do<00:01:22.930> what<00:01:23.110> it<00:01:23.229> says<00:01:23.409> it's

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
hopefully it'll do what it says it's

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.560 
hopefully it'll do what it says it's
supposed<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:23.950> do<00:01:24.130> because<00:01:24.369> I<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:25.060> started<00:01:25.300> so

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
supposed to do because I I started so

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.600 
supposed to do because I I started so
sure<00:01:25.810> in<00:01:26.080> my<00:01:26.470> life<00:01:26.649> so<00:01:26.800> she<00:01:26.860> told<00:01:27.159> me<00:01:27.310> that<00:01:27.460> I'm

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
so you know they're not thinking as a

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.080 
so you know they're not thinking as a
mic<00:01:32.800> coming<00:01:33.009> out<00:01:33.250> they're<00:01:33.460> just<00:01:33.490> like<00:01:33.820> grow

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
strong so I have to combine a lot of

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.410 
strong so I have to combine a lot of

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.660 
actually turned out to be a good size
like<00:01:39.429> my<00:01:39.640> mind<00:01:39.910> Oh
