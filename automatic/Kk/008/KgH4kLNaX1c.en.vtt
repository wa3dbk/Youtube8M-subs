00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
yeah you know I think the only exactly

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.830 
yeah you know I think the only exactly
the<00:00:56.920> only<00:00:57.160> thing<00:00:57.430> is<00:00:57.610> you<00:00:57.910> go<00:00:58.360> obviously<00:00:58.510> got

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
the only thing is you go obviously got

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.350

which<00:01:54.060> I'm<00:01:54.240> way<00:01:54.450> down<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.229> 10<00:01:55.530> 10<00:01:56.369> I

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
which I'm way down but it's a 10 10 I

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.660 
which I'm way down but it's a 10 10 I
mean<00:01:56.850> I'm<00:01:56.970> fine<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.420> second<00:01:57.900> half<00:01:58.080> but<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
mean I'm fine the second half but the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.350 
mean I'm fine the second half but the
staircase<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.909> among<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:02.400> back<00:02:02.610> section<00:02:02.940> just

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
staircase is among the back section just

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.260 
staircase is among the back section just
obviously<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.740> need<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> little<00:02:05.190> more<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:06.210> I

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
obviously just need a little more but I

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.830 
obviously just need a little more but I
see<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.720> is<00:02:06.900> faster<00:02:07.759> if<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.970> check<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.300> last

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
see it is faster if you check the last

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.710 
see it is faster if you check the last
point<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.530> could<00:02:10.739> see<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:11.310> think<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.030> faster

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
point you could see I think it is faster

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.559 
point you could see I think it is faster
