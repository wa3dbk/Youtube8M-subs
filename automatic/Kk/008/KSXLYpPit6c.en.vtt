smaller<00:02:47.170> guys<00:02:47.520> looking<00:02:48.520> right<00:02:49.030> about<00:02:49.270> five

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
smaller guys looking right about five

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.650 
smaller guys looking right about five
and<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.230> half<00:02:50.260> inches<00:02:51.000> with<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.030> two<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.510> half

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
and a half inches with a two and a half

and a half inches with a two and a half
inch<00:02:52.870> blade<00:02:53.260> I'm<00:02:53.830> gonna<00:02:53.950> pop<00:02:54.190> out<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.400> couple

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
inch blade I'm gonna pop out a couple

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.250 
inch blade I'm gonna pop out a couple
larger<00:02:55.240> ones<00:02:55.450> we'll<00:02:55.780> take<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:55.990> look<00:02:56.200> at<00:02:56.290> those

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.150 

so<00:03:02.260> here<00:03:02.440> we<00:03:02.530> go<00:03:02.709> this<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:04.410> another<00:03:05.410> Damascus

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
so here we go this is a another Damascus

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:18.870 
so here we go this is a another Damascus
blade<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:09.580> steel<00:03:09.880> is<00:03:10.060> very<00:03:10.090> nice

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.850 

so<00:03:19.880> let's<00:03:20.120> see<00:03:20.390> what<00:03:20.960> that<00:03:20.990> measures<00:03:21.590> in

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
so let's see what that measures in

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.540 
so let's see what that measures in
comparison<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:24.680> there<00:03:24.860> you're<00:03:25.040> looking<00:03:25.160> at<00:03:25.520> a

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
comparison so there you're looking at a

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.710 
comparison so there you're looking at a
six<00:03:26.270> point<00:03:26.570> seven<00:03:27.220> five<00:03:28.220> inch<00:03:28.520> overall<00:03:28.970> with<00:03:29.270> a

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
with a three inch blade and last step

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.300 
with a three inch blade and last step
that<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:36.920> brought<00:03:37.130> out<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:37.430> is<00:03:37.640> black<00:03:38.150> leather
