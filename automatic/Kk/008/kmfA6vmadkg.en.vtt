00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello everyone here rank well today we are 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.240
 willing to discover the greatest mystery 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.080
 of pokemon the secret garden of bill 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.230
 you'll see that behind the house 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.779
 of bill looks like a grand opening that 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.670
 there is back well in all our 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.830
 childhood it has been speculated that what there is 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.439
 there is actually the secret garden 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.510
 weak in which depending on certain 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.330
 conditions that must be met will come out 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.550
 several exceptionally strong pokemon 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.770
 of more than level 100 rare pokemon like 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.630
 mine or the famous blue pike that nobody 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.239
 I knew what the hell it would be and that all 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.910
 we wanted however throughout the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.530
 time have become so many 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.690
 theories about how you get up to 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.520
 there who would like to discover what is 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.460
 the correct all of them supposedly 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.579
 are tricks or glitches so 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.050
 let's check the first good since 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.449
 we are starting I think I would have 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.760
 sense start by the most logical 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.920
 have we all know that bill is a 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.489
 complete fanatic 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.689
 the illusions the pokemon list 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.009
 favorites has there I saw and talked and such 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.680
 and what the truth is that it was cool 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.380
 because that's how they registered you could 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.350
 have one in order then what is the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.049
 of course there you can see the entrance 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.670
 to the forest of which is the supposed 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.009
 method to get to the secret garden that 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.009
 Let's try now, it's like having a 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.460
 steam in georgetown and beef lion all at 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.600
 level 10 and go teach them skillful 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.600
 supposedly he will be so surprised 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.399
 and we can do it, I do not think that 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.899
 you just had to change should you 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.100
 have brought some other pokemon is that 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.810
 there is a version of this where you have 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 than to exchange it and another version in 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.900
 that you have to carry only this in the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.030
 team let's see if it says something 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.980
 look friend 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:57.550
 look at the weird ones because you monkey my pc 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.100
 He has not told me anything to exchange but 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.510
 that only have those on the computer so 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.450
 I will take it for granted that I simply do not 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.350
 you can exchange with him to this 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.380
 group so 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.729
 next try well the second mode 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.800
 of getting us to pass the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.989
 secret garden is to teach you that we have 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.470
 completed the pokédex as you see me 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.520
 I have completed here so 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.520
 I 'm missing widder 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.379
 I'm missing the float to the pokédex 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:34.069
 the whole damn pokédex and I'm missing 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.069
 widder 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.800
 It takes more time than I thought 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.480
 it's worth now that we finally have water 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.470
 we can test this second 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.600
 trick 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.760
 let's see if taking the 150 pokemon by 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.840
 end teaches us his secret garden nothing 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.810
 wrong 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.810
 friends the rare pokemon of I started 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.030
 come the third and you know that the last 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.490
 there are too many variants in all of these 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.680
 rolls of or you have to pass the league 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.810
 pokemon 150 times which is stupid 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.060
 because the pokemon the pokemon the game 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.030
 just record it seems to me that they are 50 already 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.950
 from there they stop working and 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.050
 rolls of these from where you have to catch 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.460
 to x pokemon and put it second in the 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.990
 team and after first and I do not know that 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.420
 we would never end so we go to the 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.550
 another one that maybe could have some 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.520
 sense that is to carry on our team 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.680
 to vale that has been a fail said to take 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.810
 to our team to perform venus ur and 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.250
 blas all complement level 100 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.100
 because if it's not level 100 it's not a 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.560
 said of the first generation and if 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.880
 you have my site of my generation 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.950
 you will understand will work 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.220
 look friend the rare pokemon of my 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.220
 computer 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.569
 well none has worked which does not 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.030
 I can say that I'm surprised because 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.040
 some did not even make sense but 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.380
 Yes I think this will work this 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.060
 It is a personal and personal idea that 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.690
 occurs while making another video of this 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.580
 series and that I honestly have many 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.440
 want to try I think you already know what 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.630
 that I mean seeing that sprite well 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.580
 made glitch to walk through the 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.720
 walls and things and people and 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.669
 of all that, so let's go 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.550
 directly there if you want to know 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.720
 how this glitch is made and such I will leave a 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.120
 This little sign of clicking and that 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.880
 you can watch the video 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.409
 well let's go there 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.120
 preparations 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:35.889
 asks you 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.520
 no no 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:45.210
 planet is serious no no no is not serious 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.210
 there is nothing between death, there is nothing
