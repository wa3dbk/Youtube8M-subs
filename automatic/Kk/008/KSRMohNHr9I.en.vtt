00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
wrong side that makes a true ring now

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
wrong side that makes a true ring now
we're<00:02:15.060> gonna<00:02:15.240> uh<00:02:15.630> thread<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.860> needle<00:02:16.920> again

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
we're gonna uh thread that needle again

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.990 
we're gonna uh thread that needle again
and<00:02:19.080> make<00:02:19.350> sure<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.740> put<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.040> second<00:02:20.730> thread

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
and make sure you put that second thread

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.240 
and make sure you put that second thread
off<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.600> side<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:23.730> correct<00:02:24.180> side<00:02:25.250> start

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
off to the side the correct side start

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.720 
off to the side the correct side start
right<00:02:26.490> back<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.150> same<00:02:27.420> place<00:02:28.220> now<00:02:29.220> my

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
right back in the same place now my

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.000 
right back in the same place now my
needle<00:02:30.120> threads<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.570> little<00:02:30.840> short<00:02:31.140> normally<00:02:31.980> I

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
needle threads a little short normally I

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.100 
needle threads a little short normally I
would<00:02:32.280> have<00:02:32.310> rethreaded<00:02:32.910> before<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.690> point

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
would have rethreaded before that point

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.290 
would have rethreaded before that point
but<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:34.440> practiced<00:02:35.160> with<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.580> shorter<00:02:36.000> piece

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
but I practiced with the shorter piece

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.460 
but I practiced with the shorter piece
and<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.830> little<00:02:38.040> short<00:02:38.959> so<00:02:39.959> there's<00:02:40.200> my

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
and it's a little short so there's my

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.720 
and it's a little short so there's my
last<00:02:40.800> four<00:02:41.989> now<00:02:42.989> I'm<00:02:43.709> going<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.010> rethread<00:02:44.430> my

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
last four now I'm going to rethread my

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.699 
last four now I'm going to rethread my
needle<00:02:45.090> because<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.630> didn't<00:02:45.959> earlier<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.410> was

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
needle because I didn't earlier I was

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.330 
needle because I didn't earlier I was
afraid<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.250> wouldn't<00:02:47.459> be<00:02:47.810> right<00:02:48.810> but<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:50.160> can

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
afraid it wouldn't be right but you can

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.190 
afraid it wouldn't be right but you can
thread<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:50.850> before<00:02:51.360> or<00:02:51.510> after<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.989> do<00:02:52.170> that

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
thread it before or after you do that

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.410 
thread it before or after you do that
