00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
separate pack so that that's about a

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.600 
separate pack so that that's about a
stop<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.300> stop<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.780> half<00:03:27.930> under<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:29.250> the
