how to make these ninja stars and they
can<00:00:08.970> also<00:00:09.120> transform<00:00:09.870> into<00:00:10.080> like<00:00:10.440> this

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
can also transform into like this

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.240 
can also transform into like this
circular<00:00:11.490> shape<00:00:12.150> like<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:12.990> then<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:14.040> push

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
circular shape like that then you push

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.550 
circular shape like that then you push
the<00:00:14.280> corners<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:15.379> and<00:00:17.660> it<00:00:18.660> pulls<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.289> spikes

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the corners in and it pulls the spikes

you need is seven flash cards and then I

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.999 
you need is seven flash cards and then I
just<00:00:29.760> cut<00:00:29.970> these<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.480> they're<00:00:30.720> square<00:00:31.140> so

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
just cut these so that they're square so

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.740 
just cut these so that they're square so
what<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.669> want<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.850> do<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.239> take<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.510> like<00:00:33.719> this

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
what you want to do is take it like this

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.250 
what you want to do is take it like this
and<00:00:34.140> fold<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.800> half<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:38.180> like<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.450> then

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
and fold it in half just like that then

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.930 
and fold it in half just like that then
you're<00:00:40.680> going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.860> undo<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.489> use<00:00:41.730> that

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
you're going to undo it and use that

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.250 
you're going to undo it and use that
line<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.780> crease<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.140> you've

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
line that you the crease that you've

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.000 
line that you the crease that you've
just<00:00:43.379> made<00:00:43.530> as<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> as<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.820> guideline<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.230> you're

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
just made as a as a guideline so you're

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.119 
just made as a as a guideline so you're
going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.270> fold<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.480> one<00:00:49.289> flop<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> side

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
going to fold this one flop of the side

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.560 
going to fold this one flop of the side
over<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.850> cross<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.750> line<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:53.210> do<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> same

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
over and cross that line and do the same

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.110 
over and cross that line and do the same
with<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.840> other<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:59.010> you've<00:00:59.190> made<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.850> shape

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
with the other so you've made this shape

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.609 
with the other so you've made this shape
and<00:01:01.370> then<00:01:02.370> what<00:01:02.579> you're<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.619> make

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
and then what you're going to do is make

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.440 
and then what you're going to do is make
the<00:01:04.739> crease<00:01:05.750> right<00:01:06.750> here<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.790> crease<00:01:09.299> right

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the crease right here and crease right

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.380 
the crease right here and crease right
here

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
here

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.370 
here
so<00:01:12.390> you've<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.570> made<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.900> crease<00:01:13.170> right<00:01:13.320> there

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
so you've just made a crease right there

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.149 
so you've just made a crease right there
and<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.890> crease<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.189> there<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:16.439> you

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
and a crease right there and then you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.830 
and a crease right there and then you
take<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.610> part<00:01:18.090> right<00:01:18.180> here<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.600> push

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
take this part right here and you push

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.560 
take this part right here and you push
it<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.790> this<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.770> you've<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:22.799> created

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
it in like this and you've just created

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.060 
it in like this and you've just created
one<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.600> these<00:01:24.780> now<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.770> might<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.009> been

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
one of these now that might have been

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.190 
one of these now that might have been
kind<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.340> hard<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.840> I'm<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
kind of hard to do so I'm just going to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.499 
kind of hard to do so I'm just going to
go<00:01:28.320> over<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.650> these<00:01:29.250> sides<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.820> you

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
go over to in these sides like this you

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.020 
go over to in these sides like this you
want<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.720> crease<00:01:30.990> right<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.369> right<00:01:33.000> here

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
want to crease right here and right here

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.780 
want to crease right here and right here
and<00:01:33.420> then<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.290> side<00:01:34.950> will<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.189> able<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.640> be

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
and then this side will be able to be

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.450 
and then this side will be able to be
pushed<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:38.220> here's<00:01:38.400> a

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
pushed in just like this so here's a

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.770 
pushed in just like this so here's a
paper<00:01:39.979> like<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.430> then<00:01:42.420> there's<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
paper like that and then there's the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.880 
paper like that and then there's the
finished<00:01:43.049> project<00:01:43.259> you're<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> make

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.740 
this this is the side that you want up
like<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:30.120> take<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.270> one<00:02:33.239> let's<00:02:34.239> see<00:02:34.450> and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
like that take this one let's see and

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.430 
like that take this one let's see and
then<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.800> push<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.040> in<00:02:36.310> like<00:02:36.520> this

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
then you push it in like this

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.600 
then you push it in like this
so<00:02:38.440> they're<00:02:38.590> both<00:02:38.739> sat<00:02:38.980> facing<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.459> same

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
so they're both sat facing the same

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.070 
so they're both sat facing the same
direction<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:40.300> push<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.660> in<00:02:40.750> like<00:02:40.780> that

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
direction and you push it in like that

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.280 
direction and you push it in like that
and<00:02:41.910> then<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.030> tuck<00:02:43.239> these<00:02:43.420> flaps<00:02:43.840> in<00:02:44.110> like

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
and then you tuck these flaps in like

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.670 
and then you tuck these flaps in like
that<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.690> that's<00:02:46.870> what<00:02:47.020> I've<00:02:47.140> just<00:02:47.290> made<00:02:47.440> so

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
that so that's what I've just made so

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.930 
that so that's what I've just made so
far<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.130> then<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.150> turn<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.480> this<00:02:49.600> way<00:02:50.940> repeat

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
far and then you turn it this way repeat

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.030 
far and then you turn it this way repeat
that<00:02:52.060> process<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:56.500> push

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
that process just push

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.460 
that process just push
push<00:02:57.520> it<00:02:57.700> in<00:02:57.790> like<00:02:57.850> this<00:02:58.180> and<00:03:01.320> tuck<00:03:02.320> the

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
push it in like this and tuck the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.970 
push it in like this and tuck the
flopson<00:03:03.000> now<00:03:04.000> if<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.360> can't<00:03:04.570> see<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:05.049> it's

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
flopson now if you can't see this it's

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.380 
flopson now if you can't see this it's
kind<00:03:06.250> of<00:03:06.310> hard<00:03:06.519> to<00:03:06.610> explain

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
kind of hard to explain

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.410 
kind of hard to explain
um<00:03:08.130> what<00:03:09.130> I<00:03:09.160> best<00:03:09.519> recommend<00:03:09.940> is<00:03:10.060> just<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.299> kind

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
um what I best recommend is just to kind

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.910 
um what I best recommend is just to kind
of<00:03:10.540> play<00:03:10.690> around<00:03:10.930> with<00:03:11.080> it<00:03:11.230> until<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.590> get<00:03:11.769> it

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
of play around with it until you get it

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:25.230 
of play around with it until you get it
and<00:03:12.100> then<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:12.850> just<00:03:13.030> keep<00:03:13.540> on<00:03:13.750> doing<00:03:14.019> it

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.990 

so<00:03:26.240> I<00:03:26.270> keep<00:03:27.170> going<00:03:29.710> and<00:03:30.710> then<00:03:31.520> this<00:03:31.700> is<00:03:31.880> the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
so I keep going and then this is the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.690 
so I keep going and then this is the
tricky<00:03:32.390> one<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:33.620> want<00:03:33.800> to<00:03:33.860> start<00:03:34.130> by<00:03:34.280> keeping

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
tricky one you want to start by keeping

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.880 
tricky one you want to start by keeping
on<00:03:35.030> by<00:03:35.540> putting<00:03:35.960> this<00:03:36.080> one<00:03:36.290> in<00:03:36.320> between<00:03:36.680> the

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
on by putting this one in between the

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.030 
on by putting this one in between the
edges<00:03:37.250> like<00:03:38.060> this<00:03:38.410> because<00:03:39.410> this<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.710> the<00:03:39.800> last

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
edges like this because this is the last

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.130 
edges like this because this is the last
one<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.460> then<00:03:41.390> you<00:03:41.510> just<00:03:41.690> make<00:03:41.810> sure<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:42.050> goes

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
one and then you just make sure it goes

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.400 
one and then you just make sure it goes
down<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.440> middle<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.860> then<00:03:43.670> you<00:03:44.510> tuck<00:03:44.840> these

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
down the middle and then you tuck these

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.840 
down the middle and then you tuck these
in<00:03:45.610> and<00:03:46.610> then<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:48.440> just<00:03:48.620> put<00:03:48.860> and<00:03:48.980> do<00:03:49.130> tuck<00:03:49.700> it

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
in and then you just put and do tuck it

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.990 
in and then you just put and do tuck it
on<00:03:49.910> this<00:03:50.150> one<00:03:50.300> too<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:51.010> I'm<00:03:52.010> really<00:03:52.550> sorry<00:03:52.760> if

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
on this one too and I'm really sorry if

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.340 
on this one too and I'm really sorry if
you<00:03:53.150> can't<00:03:53.330> see<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.540> very<00:03:53.900> well

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
you can't see that very well

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.780 
you can't see that very well
but<00:03:54.860> I<00:03:55.120> just<00:03:56.120> try<00:03:56.780> my<00:03:56.810> best<00:03:57.140> but<00:03:57.610> then<00:03:58.610> you've

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
but I just try my best but then you've

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.200 
but I just try my best but then you've
made<00:03:59.060> it<00:04:01.690> you're<00:04:02.690> more<00:04:02.930> than<00:04:03.080> likely<00:04:03.140> going<00:04:03.740> to

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
made it you're more than likely going to

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.520 
made it you're more than likely going to
have<00:04:05.210> a<00:04:05.240> few<00:04:05.510> of<00:04:05.600> them<00:04:05.690> pop<00:04:05.900> out<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.320> first

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
have a few of them pop out the first

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.530 
have a few of them pop out the first
time<00:04:06.710> you<00:04:06.890> push<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.370> in<00:04:07.490> but<00:04:08.120> that's<00:04:08.240> just

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
time you push it in but that's just

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.340 
time you push it in but that's just
that's<00:04:08.840> normal<00:04:09.350> it's<00:04:09.470> just<00:04:09.620> breaking<00:04:09.920> in<00:04:10.630> so

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.330 

just<00:04:15.350> move<00:04:16.340> it<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.580> the<00:04:16.670> middle<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:18.190> make<00:04:19.190> it

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
just move it to the middle and make it

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.800 
just move it to the middle and make it
then<00:04:19.520> kind<00:04:19.730> of<00:04:19.790> flatten<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.239> out<00:04:20.360> by<00:04:20.570> pushing

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
then kind of flatten it out by pushing

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.990 
then kind of flatten it out by pushing
down<00:04:21.049> on<00:04:21.080> it<00:04:21.230> like<00:04:21.350> this<00:04:21.650> and<00:04:22.010> then<00:04:22.760> you've

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
down on it like this and then you've

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.850 
down on it like this and then you've
just<00:04:23.030> made<00:04:23.390> it<00:04:23.540> and<00:04:23.750> it<00:04:24.020> can<00:04:24.170> move<00:04:24.290> out<00:04:24.500> now<00:04:24.650> and

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
just made it and it can move out now and

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.590 
just made it and it can move out now and
it<00:04:24.980> more<00:04:25.370> than<00:04:25.490> likely<00:04:25.550> won't<00:04:26.150> pop<00:04:26.390> out<00:04:26.570> of

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
it more than likely won't pop out of

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.710 
it more than likely won't pop out of
place<00:04:26.860> but<00:04:27.860> once<00:04:28.550> you<00:04:28.700> have<00:04:28.880> everything<00:04:29.030> fixed

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
place but once you have everything fixed

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.120 
place but once you have everything fixed
it<00:04:29.960> it'll<00:04:30.740> stay<00:04:30.980> pretty<00:04:31.160> strong<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:32.860> I<00:04:33.860> guess

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
it it'll stay pretty strong and I guess

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:40.210 
it it'll stay pretty strong and I guess
they<00:04:34.400> do<00:04:34.870> fly<00:04:35.870> for<00:04:36.200> you<00:04:36.260> all<00:04:36.410> I<00:04:39.220> they're

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
they do fly for you all I they're

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.150 
they do fly for you all I they're
actually<00:04:40.670> pretty<00:04:41.000> sharp<00:04:41.360> too<00:04:41.630> so<00:04:42.170> anyways

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
actually pretty sharp too so anyways

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.620 
actually pretty sharp too so anyways
that's<00:04:43.990> how<00:04:44.990> to<00:04:45.050> make<00:04:45.200> a<00:04:45.230> ninja<00:04:45.560> star
