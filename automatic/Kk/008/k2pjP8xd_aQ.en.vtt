00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.880
 you jump but the dominant is not that 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.590
 it's good to work on your supports 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.370
 on his technical gesture from the point 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.710
 and on his move for that nice 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.449
 but problem habit I do not know when 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.909
 we make you a passage you have to 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.620
 know about where he brings hockey 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.949
 on the release but it takes you 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.620
 here you know that the door had there and 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.579
 not elsewhere 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:01:00.470
 get in the habit right away 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:01:03.350
 to observe observe looking lost 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.210
 so many posts to us is to win 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.470
 time 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.150
 no it's true that this morning we did 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.340
 a good session we worked we will 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.540
 to say a little the technique of the guardian of 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.570
 purpose it was especially what was 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.369
 moving late but you of English 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.020
 clearance point so for a recovery 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.880
 it was pretty good 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.259
 after we integrated the group with a little 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.140
 game goalies 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.020
 the advantage of working rather on 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.390
 short efforts so automatically the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.520
 athletic part she is present 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.290
 so that's an advantage for us 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.570
 allows us to speed up preparation 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.580
 yeah that's for sure ben me I have no 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.330
 week since I was with the 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.700
 selection of mali 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.860
 so we were for two weeks in 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.800
 mallie recovery we had a match 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.230
 for the 2015 can 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.300
 17 when we won so I did 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.020
 a break week so we're going 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.020
 still look fresh
