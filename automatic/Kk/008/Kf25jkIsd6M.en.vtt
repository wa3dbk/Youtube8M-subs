00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.499 
went to you know change the thingy 400
those<00:01:28.200> two<00:01:28.950> something<00:01:29.310> over<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:30.299> change

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
those two something over you just change

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.469 
those two something over you just change
it<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.750> about<00:01:30.930> half<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.729> now<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.299> you

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
it to about half of that and now if you

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.950 
it to about half of that and now if you
just<00:01:33.659> go<00:01:34.530> over<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.670> should<00:01:36.570> see

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
just go over it like this you should see

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.899 
just go over it like this you should see
there<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.500> covers<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:37.979> half<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.700> I'm<00:01:38.790> going

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
there it covers like half so I'm going

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.580 
there it covers like half so I'm going
to<00:01:38.939> move<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> middle<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.290> gives<00:01:40.470> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
to move it in the middle so it gives a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.280 
to move it in the middle so it gives a
better<00:01:40.740> effect<00:01:41.750> so<00:01:42.750> now<00:01:42.930> I'm<00:01:43.020> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.200> move

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
better effect so now I'm going to move

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.830 
better effect so now I'm going to move
down<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.640> first<00:01:44.909> one<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.509> Wanda

about 7 10

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.330 
about 7 10
whatever<00:02:00.020> can<00:02:01.020> not<00:02:01.380> how<00:02:01.590> think<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.920> want<00:02:02.190> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
whatever can not how think you want the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.750 
whatever can not how think you want the
thing<00:02:02.720> so<00:02:03.720> we'll<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:03.990> don't<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.620> there<00:02:05.460> and

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
thing so we'll just don't you there and

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.160 
thing so we'll just don't you there and
just<00:02:06.510> do<00:02:06.690> it<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.870> black<00:02:07.170> office<00:02:07.560> give<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.429> red

just do it the black office give the red

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.690 
just do it the black office give the red
so<00:02:10.170> personally<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.679> think<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.310> looks<00:02:11.490> a<00:02:11.580> lot

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
so personally I think that looks a lot

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.560 
so personally I think that looks a lot
better<00:02:12.500> than<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.950> normal<00:02:14.160> text<00:02:14.640> anyway<00:02:15.510> so

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
better than just a normal text anyway so

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.090 
better than just a normal text anyway so
we're<00:02:15.870> just<00:02:15.900> going<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.200> we're<00:02:16.560> just<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:17.070> to

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
to turn the camera that way state a bit

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.060 
to turn the camera that way state a bit
more<00:04:41.340> effect<00:04:41.669> and<00:04:42.260> now<00:04:43.260> I<00:04:43.290> just<00:04:43.410> want<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:43.830> zoom

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
more effect and now I just want to zoom

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.140 
more effect and now I just want to zoom
out<00:04:44.250> so<00:04:44.310> bad<00:04:45.300> never<00:04:45.690> you<00:04:46.260> know<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:47.220> know<00:04:48.030> will

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
out so bad never you know I know will

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.020 
out so bad never you know I know will
just<00:04:48.180> check<00:04:48.360> it<00:04:48.600> up<00:04:48.660> to<00:04:48.840> 70<00:04:49.490> lets<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.640> zoom<00:04:50.669> out

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
just check it up to 70 lets you zoom out

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.560 
just check it up to 70 lets you zoom out
so<00:04:51.090> we<00:04:51.390> can<00:04:51.540> see<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.900> whole<00:04:52.080> of<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.410> text<00:04:54.080> so

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
so we can see the whole of the text so

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.620 
so we can see the whole of the text so
there<00:04:57.570> that<00:04:58.020> would<00:04:58.140> go<00:04:58.880> drop<00:04:59.880> a<00:04:59.910> key<00:05:00.120> frame<00:05:00.360> and

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
there that would go drop a key frame and

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.570 
there that would go drop a key frame and
then<00:05:00.750> I<00:05:01.020> just<00:05:01.080> want<00:05:01.410> to<00:05:01.560> zoom<00:05:01.740> in<00:05:01.950> real<00:05:02.310> real

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
then I just want to zoom in real real

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.680 
then I just want to zoom in real real
fast<00:05:02.790> like<00:05:02.970> in<00:05:03.210> 10<00:05:04.080> key<00:05:04.380> frames<00:05:05.300> so<00:05:06.300> then<00:05:06.600> we

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
fast like in 10 key frames so then we

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.800 
fast like in 10 key frames so then we
resume<00:05:07.160> right<00:05:08.160> in<00:05:08.370> right<00:05:09.000> into<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.540> sleeve

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
resume right in right into the sleeve

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.980 
resume right in right into the sleeve
and<00:05:10.669> then<00:05:11.669> we<00:05:11.850> dropped<00:05:12.090> final<00:05:12.450> key<00:05:12.600> frame<00:05:12.840> and

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
and then we dropped final key frame and

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.750 
and then we dropped final key frame and
then<00:05:13.050> if<00:05:13.200> we<00:05:13.350> take<00:05:13.500> it<00:05:13.680> back<00:05:13.860> we<00:05:14.100> can<00:05:14.280> watch<00:05:14.520> it

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
then if we take it back we can watch it

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.010 
then if we take it back we can watch it
over<00:05:14.820> so<00:05:15.330> let's<00:05:15.540> watch<00:05:15.750> it

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.150 

so<00:05:20.530> I<00:05:20.680> think<00:05:20.919> that<00:05:21.250> looks<00:05:21.430> pretty<00:05:21.789> cool<00:05:21.970> basic

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
so I think that looks pretty cool basic

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.260 
so I think that looks pretty cool basic
now<00:05:24.160> you<00:05:24.220> can<00:05:24.430> do<00:05:24.520> it<00:05:24.639> well<00:05:24.789> for<00:05:24.940> this<00:05:25.030> you<00:05:25.150> can

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
now you can do it well for this you can

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.059 
now you can do it well for this you can
customize<00:05:25.750> it<00:05:25.930> whatever<00:05:26.319> your<00:05:26.470> way<00:05:26.650> want<00:05:26.949> you

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
customize it whatever your way want you

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:28.700 
customize it whatever your way want you

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
can do whatever Cameron goes you want

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.050 
can do whatever Cameron goes you want
