here in my right hand and I'm just going

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.600 
here in my right hand and I'm just going
to<00:00:32.700> wind<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.899> waste<00:00:34.500> yarn<00:00:34.770> around<00:00:35.070> my<00:00:35.370> small

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
to wind the waste yarn around my small

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.000 
to wind the waste yarn around my small
finger<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.329> hold<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> working<00:00:37.590> yarn<00:00:37.620> down

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
finger and hold the working yarn down

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.049 
finger and hold the working yarn down
here<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.610> similar<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.629> long<00:00:39.870> tail<00:00:40.140> cast<00:00:40.379> on

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
here so similar to a long tail cast on

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.030 
here so similar to a long tail cast on
now<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.420> hold<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.739> first

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
now it hold it like this and the first

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.310 
now it hold it like this and the first
stitch<00:00:44.309> will<00:00:44.789> do<00:00:45.030> we'll<00:00:45.629> take<00:00:45.899> our<00:00:45.930> needle

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
stitch will do we'll take our needle

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.560 
stitch will do we'll take our needle
between<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.489> two<00:00:48.120> yarns<00:00:48.750> dip<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.680> down<00:00:50.010> and

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
between the two yarns dip it down and

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.220 
between the two yarns dip it down and
wrap<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.410> working<00:00:52.559> yarn<00:00:52.890> around<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:54.840> next

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
wrap the working yarn around it the next

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.880 
wrap the working yarn around it the next
stitch<00:00:55.410> we're<00:00:55.739> going<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.280> will<00:00:56.760> lift<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
stitch we're going to do will lift the

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.540 
stitch we're going to do will lift the
needle<00:00:58.890> up<00:00:59.149> over<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.510> waste<00:01:00.719> yarn<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.550> around

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
needle up over the waste yarn and around

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.990 
needle up over the waste yarn and around
and<00:01:03.439> under<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.739> grab<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.250> working<00:01:05.640> yarn<00:01:05.670> from

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and under to grab the working yarn from

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.480 
and under to grab the working yarn from
underneath<00:01:06.439> so<00:01:07.439> now<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.950> see<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.400> have

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
underneath so now you can see we have

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.789 
underneath so now you can see we have
got<00:01:08.520> two<00:01:08.909> stitches<00:01:09.240> from<00:01:10.110> those<00:01:10.350> two<00:01:10.380> motions

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
got two stitches from those two motions

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.609 
got two stitches from those two motions
on<00:01:11.310> our<00:01:11.760> needle<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:13.020> will<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.380> two

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
on our needle and we will have two

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.140 
on our needle and we will have two
stitches<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.310> waste<00:01:14.700> yarn<00:01:14.970> underneath

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
stitches on the waste yarn underneath

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.300 
stitches on the waste yarn underneath
it's<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> little<00:01:16.140> hard<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.560> see<00:01:16.740> at<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> moment

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it's a little hard to see at the moment

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.130 
it's a little hard to see at the moment
but<00:01:17.460> i'll<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> few<00:01:18.420> more<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.840> it'll<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
but i'll do a few more and it'll be a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.660 
but i'll do a few more and it'll be a
bit<00:01:19.350> clearer<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.979> first<00:01:20.729> one<00:01:21.090> between<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
bit clearer so first one between and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.130 
bit clearer so first one between and
under<00:01:24.110> over<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.350> under<00:01:27.229> between<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.619> under

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
under over and under between and under

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.399 
under over and under between and under
over<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.380> under<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:33.000> here<00:01:33.390> you'll<00:01:34.049> start

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
over and under and so here you'll start

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.600 
over and under and so here you'll start
seeing<00:01:34.470> you've<00:01:34.860> got<00:01:35.040> your<00:01:35.220> stitches

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
seeing you've got your stitches

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.080 
seeing you've got your stitches
appearing<00:01:36.090> here<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.600> you've<00:01:37.439> got<00:01:37.820> loops<00:01:38.820> of

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
appearing here and you've got loops of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.910 
appearing here and you've got loops of
yarn<00:01:39.420> underneath<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:40.290> your<00:01:40.439> waste<00:01:40.680> yarn

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
yarn underneath with your waste yarn

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.249 
yarn underneath with your waste yarn
when<00:01:41.790> you've<00:01:41.970> finished<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.689> actually

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
when you've finished and you actually

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.859 
when you've finished and you actually
want<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.619> start<00:01:43.890> missing<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:44.790> when<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.600> turn

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
want to start missing here when you turn

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.170 
want to start missing here when you turn
around<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.680> need<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.070> careful<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.640> hold<00:01:48.000> on

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
around you need to be careful to hold on

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.330 
around you need to be careful to hold on
to<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.450> waste<00:01:48.659> yarn<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:50.070> first

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
to the waste yarn because this first

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.730 
to the waste yarn because this first
stitch<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:51.090> really<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> loop<00:01:51.659> over<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.229> so

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
stitch is just really a loop over it so

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.859 
stitch is just really a loop over it so
hold<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.189> two<00:01:53.369> together<00:01:53.579> carefully<00:01:54.210> here

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
hold the two together carefully here

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.289 
hold the two together carefully here
until<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.710> get<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:56.040> first<00:01:56.310> stitch<00:01:56.700> knitted

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
until you get your first stitch knitted

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.709 
until you get your first stitch knitted
and<00:01:57.509> when<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.500> come<00:01:58.710> back<00:01:58.860> afterwards

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
and when you come back afterwards

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.030 
and when you come back afterwards
everywhere<00:02:00.719> there<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.140> loop<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.530> yarn<00:02:01.829> on

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
everywhere there is a loop of yarn on

your waste yarn underneath you just put
those<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.340> your<00:02:05.490> working<00:02:05.969> needle<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.570> knit

those on to your working needle and knit
away<00:02:07.619> with<00:02:07.829> them<00:02:08.009> but<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.209> need<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.390> be

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
away with them but you do need to be

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.020 
away with them but you do need to be
careful<00:02:10.080> because<00:02:10.259> every<00:02:10.920> second<00:02:11.370> stitch<00:02:11.640> will

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
careful because every second stitch will

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.030 
careful because every second stitch will
actually<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.660> man

backwards<00:02:13.909> you<00:02:14.629> don't<00:02:14.810> worry<00:02:15.019> about<00:02:15.110> thinking
