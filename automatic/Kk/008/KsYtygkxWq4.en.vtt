I'm<00:02:00.819> in<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.000> competition<00:02:01.479> I<00:02:01.780> put<00:02:01.990> everything

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
I'm in a competition I put everything

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.529 
I'm in a competition I put everything
into<00:02:02.619> it<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:03.039> I<00:02:03.130> focus<00:02:03.580> my<00:02:03.729> mind<00:02:03.970> on<00:02:04.179> it<00:02:04.330> so

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
into it and I focus my mind on it so

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.589 
into it and I focus my mind on it so
much<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:04.929> and<00:02:05.670> when<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.940> time<00:02:07.179> comes<00:02:07.479> that

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
much that and when the time comes that

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.139 
much that and when the time comes that
perhaps<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.319> do<00:02:08.380> succeed<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.190> I'm<00:02:09.490> happy<00:02:10.000> but

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149
