00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
that's really nice about our boats is

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.300 
that's really nice about our boats is
where<00:00:27.119> we<00:00:27.269> mount<00:00:27.539> our<00:00:27.660> switch<00:00:28.050> right<00:00:28.800> here<00:00:29.160> is

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
where we mount our switch right here is

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.859 
where we mount our switch right here is
your<00:00:29.429> jack<00:00:29.640> plate<00:00:29.880> switch<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> helmet<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
your jack plate switch on the helmet and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.810 
your jack plate switch on the helmet and
right<00:00:31.170> now<00:00:31.320> I'm<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.590> tower<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
right now I'm in a tower but it's the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.170 
right now I'm in a tower but it's the
same<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.300> lower<00:00:33.450> station<00:00:33.930> replicated<00:00:34.649> and

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
same on the lower station replicated and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.049 
same on the lower station replicated and
the<00:00:36.180> position<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.350> switch<00:00:37.710> allows<00:00:38.550> us<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the position of this switch allows us to

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.340 
the position of this switch allows us to
maneuver<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> boat<00:00:39.930> while<00:00:40.140> we're

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
maneuver the boat while we're

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.619 
maneuver the boat while we're
maneuvering<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> jack<00:00:41.309> plate<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.420> turn

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
maneuvering the jack plate so I can turn

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.139 
maneuvering the jack plate so I can turn
my<00:00:42.899> wheel<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.520> maneuver<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> jack<00:00:44.820> plate<00:00:45.030> all

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
my wheel and maneuver the jack plate all

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.360 
my wheel and maneuver the jack plate all
at<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.270> same<00:00:45.450> time<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.410> throttle<00:00:46.649> when

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
at the same time and the throttle when

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.400 
at the same time and the throttle when
you're<00:00:47.489> jumping<00:00:47.850> up<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> flats<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:49.079> very

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
you're jumping up on the flats it's very

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.959 
you're jumping up on the flats it's very
important<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.100> able<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.340> control<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
important to be able to control the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.770 
important to be able to control the
wheel<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:52.829> jack<00:00:53.100> plate<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.360> throttle

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
wheel the jack plate and the throttle

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.360 
wheel the jack plate and the throttle
because<00:00:54.930> what<00:00:55.199> we'll<00:00:55.379> do<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.829> we'll<00:00:55.980> set<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
because what we'll do is we'll set the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.880 
because what we'll do is we'll set the
boat<00:00:56.579> straight<00:00:57.210> well<00:00:58.020> get<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.320> moving<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
boat straight well get it moving on the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.459 
boat straight well get it moving on the
flats<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.940> little<00:01:00.300> bit<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.199> that

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
flats just a little bit just like that

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.170 
flats just a little bit just like that
so<00:01:01.739> now<00:01:01.890> we're<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.280> forward<00:01:02.670> moving

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
so now we're in a forward moving

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.750 
so now we're in a forward moving
position<00:01:03.690> we'll<00:01:04.589> pull<00:01:04.860> down<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> jack

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
position we'll pull down on the jack

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.850 
position we'll pull down on the jack
plate<00:01:06.000> which<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.180> towards<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.049> up<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
plate which is towards you and up on the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.280 
plate which is towards you and up on the
throttle<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.549> at<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> same<00:01:08.939> time<00:01:09.290> that's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
throttle all at the same time that's

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.469 
throttle all at the same time that's
going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> allow<00:01:10.830> us<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.340> come<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.640> because<00:01:12.270> our

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
going to allow us to come up because our

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.289 
going to allow us to come up because our
boats<00:01:12.689> plane<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:13.290> fast<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.220> lower<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
boats plane really fast and lower the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.910 
boats plane really fast and lower the
plate<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> same<00:01:15.840> time<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.409> you're<00:01:16.590> right

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
plate at the same time so you're right

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.980 
plate at the same time so you're right
now<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.210> way<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.479> position<00:01:18.869> your

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
now in the all the way up position your

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.840 
now in the all the way up position your
sched<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.470> above<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.979> bottom<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.430> boat<00:01:20.610> so

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
sched is above the bottom of the boat so

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.630 
sched is above the bottom of the boat so
as<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.299> pulled<00:01:21.720> down<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.409> throttle<00:01:23.280> up<00:01:23.400> I'm

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
as I pulled down and throttle up I'm

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.880 
as I pulled down and throttle up I'm
lowering<00:01:24.150> my<00:01:24.330> plate<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.170> boats<00:01:25.409> jumping

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
lowering my plate as the boats jumping

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.130 
lowering my plate as the boats jumping
on<00:01:26.009> plane<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.549> I'll<00:01:26.970> stop<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.630> right<00:01:27.869> about

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
on plane and I'll stop it right about

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.200 
on plane and I'll stop it right about
even<00:01:28.530> where<00:01:28.710> you'd<00:01:28.860> normally<00:01:29.040> run<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.640> you'll

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
even where you'd normally run it you'll

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.670 
even where you'd normally run it you'll
blow<00:01:30.420> up<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.659> little<00:01:30.840> bit<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.140> mud<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.560> your
