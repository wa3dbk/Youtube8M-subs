00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
campaign you've already got a couple of

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.999 
campaign you've already got a couple of
medals<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:28.020> how<00:01:28.140> does<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.409> squad<00:01:28.650> compared

to past campaigns I think as a squad in
the<00:01:31.979> 28<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:32.759> much<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.360> much<00:01:33.570> more<00:01:33.780> depth<00:01:34.049> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the 28 it's much as much more depth and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.109 
the 28 it's much as much more depth and
much<00:01:34.409> more<00:01:34.650> competitiveness<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.820> training

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
much more competitiveness at training

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.200 
much more competitiveness at training
that's<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.570> sure<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.729> it's<00:01:38.729> been<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> little

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
that's for sure and it's been a little

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.370 
that's for sure and it's been a little
bit<00:01:39.390> different<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:39.840> over<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.290> last

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
bit different because over the last

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.780 
bit different because over the last
three<00:01:40.770> years<00:01:40.920> we've<00:01:41.040> had<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> lot<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.579> numbers

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
three years we've had a lot of numbers

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.999 
three years we've had a lot of numbers
play<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> Australian<00:01:42.840> team<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.229> 2009<00:01:43.890> we

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
play for the Australian team in 2009 we

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.950 
play for the Australian team in 2009 we
had<00:01:44.100> 44<00:01:45.320> players<00:01:46.320> played<00:01:46.799> 2010<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.820> think<00:01:48.180> 38<00:01:48.780> or

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
had 44 players played 2010 I think 38 or

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.319 
had 44 players played 2010 I think 38 or
something<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.890> year<00:01:50.159> not<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:50.759> 28

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
something in this year not just 28

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.850 
something in this year not just 28
there's<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.720> couple<00:01:51.899> outside<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.500> squad<00:01:52.710> as

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
there's a couple outside the squad as

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.990 
there's a couple outside the squad as
well<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.759> um<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:55.200> definitely<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:56.000> squad

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
well so it's um it's definitely a squad

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.969 
well so it's um it's definitely a squad
that's<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.570> know<00:01:57.719> has<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> lot<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.500> depth<00:01:58.740> like

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that's you know has a lot of depth like

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.530 
that's you know has a lot of depth like
I<00:01:59.130> said<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.610> everyone<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.060> very<00:02:00.180> competitive

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
I said and everyone is very competitive

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.499 
I said and everyone is very competitive
or<00:02:00.810> training<00:02:01.460> coming<00:02:02.460> up<00:02:02.670> here<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.390> a

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
or training coming up here it is a

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.749 
or training coming up here it is a
little<00:02:03.750> bit<00:02:03.899> different<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.380> came<00:02:04.560> up<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:04.920> 2004

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
little bit different we came up in 2004

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.089 
little bit different we came up in 2004
with<00:02:05.969> just<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.360> 16<00:02:06.780> players<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.920> was<00:02:08.069> a

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
with just the 16 players and that was a

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.370 
with just the 16 players and that was a
real<00:02:08.369> team<00:02:08.700> building

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
real team building

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.880 
real team building
of<00:02:10.440> trip<00:02:11.390> 2008<00:02:12.390> very<00:02:12.630> similar<00:02:13.050> 16<00:02:13.560> players

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
of trip 2008 very similar 16 players

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.470 
of trip 2008 very similar 16 players
plus<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.340> two<00:02:14.520> extras<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:14.970> come<00:02:15.090> over<00:02:15.240> to

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
plus the two extras that come over to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.720 
plus the two extras that come over to
Beijing<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.260> was<00:02:16.350> like<00:02:16.890> 10<00:02:17.100> billion<00:02:17.340> this

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
Beijing and it was like 10 billion this

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.400 
Beijing and it was like 10 billion this
this<00:02:18.210> one's<00:02:18.510> been<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.780> little<00:02:18.930> bit<00:02:19.080> different

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
this one's been a little bit different

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.100 
this one's been a little bit different
because<00:02:19.500> we<00:02:19.620> left<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.100> lot<00:02:20.130> later<00:02:20.670> too<00:02:21.510> we've

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
because we left a lot later too we've

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.630 
because we left a lot later too we've
named<00:02:22.350> team<00:02:22.740> but<00:02:23.010> there's<00:02:23.190> still<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.490> whole

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
named team but there's still the whole

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.030 
named team but there's still the whole
squad<00:02:23.940> training<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.540> playing<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.920> think

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
squad training and playing so I think

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.800 
squad training and playing so I think
once<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:26.520> get<00:02:26.670> back<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.000> Perth<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.510> once<00:02:27.660> the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
once we get back to Perth and once the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.690 
once we get back to Perth and once the
team<00:02:28.020> is<00:02:28.320> actually<00:02:28.800> just<00:02:28.980> together<00:02:29.130> we<00:02:29.550> have<00:02:29.670> a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
team is actually just together we have a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.520 
team is actually just together we have a
few<00:02:29.940> team<00:02:30.180> meetings<00:02:30.570> we<00:02:30.690> talked<00:02:30.900> about<00:02:31.050> London

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
few team meetings we talked about London

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.280 
few team meetings we talked about London
Olympics<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.640> think<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:33.240> going<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.570> get<00:02:34.170> that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
Olympics I think it's going to get that

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.470 
Olympics I think it's going to get that
team<00:02:34.680> building<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.310> then<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:35.910> really<00:02:36.210> judge

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
team building and then can really judge

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.840 
team building and then can really judge
from<00:02:36.720> there<00:02:36.930> but<00:02:37.200> as<00:02:37.560> an<00:02:37.800> individual<00:02:38.370> side<00:02:38.640> of

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
from there but as an individual side of

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.240 
from there but as an individual side of
things<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.360> think<00:02:39.420> these<00:02:40.320> guys<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:40.620> just<00:02:40.950> as

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
things I think these guys have just as

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.580 
things I think these guys have just as
much<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.790> know<00:02:41.820> talent<00:02:42.450> or<00:02:42.600> individual

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
much you know talent or individual

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.890 
much you know talent or individual
brilliance<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:44.250> what<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.550> 2004<00:02:45.420> team<00:02:45.690> did

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
brilliance is what the 2004 team did

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.230 
brilliance is what the 2004 team did
that<00:02:46.050> one<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.440> Athens<00:02:46.800> or<00:02:46.950> even<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:47.790> Beijing

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
that one and Athens or even in Beijing

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.880 
that one and Athens or even in Beijing
we<00:02:48.420> had<00:02:48.540> some<00:02:48.720> really<00:02:48.870> good<00:02:49.050> players<00:02:49.200> there<00:02:49.620> we

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
we had some really good players there we

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.890 
we had some really good players there we
lost<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.580> semi-final<00:02:51.240> but<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.540> bring<00:02:51.690> home<00:02:51.870> a

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
lost the semi-final but to bring home a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.290 
lost the semi-final but to bring home a
bronze<00:02:52.680> medal<00:02:52.830> was<00:02:53.130> obstacle<00:02:53.640> so<00:02:53.820> good<00:02:54.060> but

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
bronze medal was obstacle so good but

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.960 
bronze medal was obstacle so good but
yeah<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:55.080> would<00:02:55.200> be<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.320> shame<00:02:55.410> if<00:02:56.220> we<00:02:56.520> don't<00:02:56.820> go

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
yeah it would be a shame if we don't go

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.820 
yeah it would be a shame if we don't go
to<00:02:57.030> London<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.050> play<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.290> our<00:02:58.410> potential

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
to London and play to our potential

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.280 
to London and play to our potential
because<00:02:59.310> if<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.790> if<00:03:00.120> we<00:03:00.630> do<00:03:00.900> play<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.200> our

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
because if I if we do play to our

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.900 
because if I if we do play to our
potential<00:03:01.710> we're<00:03:02.010> going<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.400> be<00:03:02.460> a<00:03:02.490> very<00:03:02.550> tough

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
potential we're going to be a very tough

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.550 
potential we're going to be a very tough
team<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.210> beat<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.750> we've<00:03:04.230> got<00:03:04.350> some

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
team to beat and we've got some

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.290 
team to beat and we've got some
brilliant<00:03:04.950> individual<00:03:05.400> players<00:03:05.700> out<00:03:06.270> there

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
brilliant individual players out there

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.320 
brilliant individual players out there
that<00:03:06.690> can<00:03:06.810> really<00:03:07.290> change<00:03:07.740> game<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.940> we'll

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
that can really change game and so we'll

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.760 
that can really change game and so we'll
see<00:03:09.480> what<00:03:09.600> happens<00:03:09.750> but<00:03:10.050> it's<00:03:10.290> hard<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.560> judge

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
see what happens but it's hard to judge
