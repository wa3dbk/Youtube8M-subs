the necessary equipment but we're still
making<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.400> by<00:01:29.610> hand<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.509> were<00:01:31.070> making

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
making this by hand so we were making

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.850 
making this by hand so we were making
forming<00:01:33.210> paper<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.659> way<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.049> was<00:01:34.259> made<00:01:34.560> in

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.789 
Europe in the seventh in the 1600s
basically<00:01:39.150> paper<00:01:39.450> make<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.079> ancient

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
basically paper make is a ancient

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.630 
basically paper make is a ancient
process<00:01:41.009> admitted<00:01:41.880> as<00:01:42.570> far<00:01:42.810> as<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.049> know<00:01:43.640> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
process admitted as far as we know the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.719 
process admitted as far as we know the
first<00:01:44.909> written<00:01:46.009> information<00:01:47.009> about<00:01:47.430> was<00:01:47.610> in

China right

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.380 
China right
0ad<00:01:50.760> and<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:53.070> basically<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.730> process<00:01:54.000> of

0ad and it basically the process of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.200 
0ad and it basically the process of
creating<00:01:54.870> a<00:01:55.250> pulp<00:01:56.250> out<00:01:56.550> of<00:01:56.580> them<00:01:57.000> for

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
creating a pulp out of them for

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.840 
creating a pulp out of them for
centuries<00:01:57.720> it<00:01:58.140> was<00:01:58.170> only<00:01:58.650> from<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.460> fibers

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
centuries it was only from the fibers

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.800 
centuries it was only from the fibers
that<00:01:59.880> make<00:02:00.150> rope<00:02:00.510> and<00:02:00.840> cloth<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.710> cotton

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
that make rope and cloth like cotton

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.140 
that make rope and cloth like cotton
flaxen<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.960> wood<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.380> very<00:02:04.620> recent<00:02:05.160> the

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
flaxen that wood is very recent the

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.440 
flaxen that wood is very recent the
process<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.020> make<00:02:07.229> pulp<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.880> then<00:02:08.880> this

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
process is you make pulp and then this

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.449 
process is you make pulp and then this
device<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.470> key<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.950> whole<00:02:11.070> thing<00:02:11.340> is

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
device is the key to the whole thing is

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.150 
device is the key to the whole thing is
called<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.850> paper<00:02:12.240> making<00:02:12.510> mold<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.770> edge<00:02:13.920> is

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
called a paper making mold the edge is

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.480 
called a paper making mold the edge is
formed<00:02:14.430> by<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.580> deckle<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.240> it's<00:02:15.840> permeable

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
formed by the deckle and it's permeable

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.180 
formed by the deckle and it's permeable
and<00:02:18.110> as<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.950> dip<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.550> vat<00:02:22.190> water

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
and as you dip it in the vat water

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.770 
and as you dip it in the vat water
drains<00:02:23.489> through<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.940> pup<00:02:24.120> remains<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
drains through the pup remains on the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.680 
drains through the pup remains on the
surface<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.920> now<00:02:26.130> it's<00:02:26.370> ready<00:02:26.880> complicated

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
surface and now it's ready complicated

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.620 
surface and now it's ready complicated
series<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:28.040> other<00:02:29.040> events<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:30.030> find<00:02:30.390> up<00:02:30.540> with

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
series of other events you find up with

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.720 
series of other events you find up with
the<00:02:30.690> sheet<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:30.959> paper<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.680> whole<00:02:31.830> trick<00:02:32.100> is<00:02:32.130> is

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
even sheet and and then there's actually

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.840 
even sheet and and then there's actually
there's<00:02:42.330> two<00:02:42.390> tricks<00:02:42.810> one<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.230> making<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.590> pulp

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
second is dipping it and

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.560 
second is dipping it and

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
and then you can see here that on this

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.600 
and then you can see here that on this
mold<00:02:49.840> there's<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.200> watermark<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.070> the

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
mold there's a watermark and the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.500 
mold there's a watermark and the
watermark<00:02:52.240> is<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.870> wire<00:02:53.260> that's<00:02:54.130> hand<00:02:54.640> bent<00:02:55.150> and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
watermark is a wire that's hand bent and

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.100 
watermark is a wire that's hand bent and
then<00:02:55.720> sewn<00:02:56.110> on<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.440> surface<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.630> mold

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110

in<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.570> paper<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.650> pulp<00:03:17.920> forms<00:03:18.370> around

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
in the paper so the pulp forms around

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.120 
in the paper so the pulp forms around
that<00:03:19.150> wire<00:03:19.390> and<00:03:19.750> when<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.380> hold<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.830> finished
