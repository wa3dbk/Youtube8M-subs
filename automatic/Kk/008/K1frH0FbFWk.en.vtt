00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.730 
and body you can see the bezel around it
still<00:02:05.270> slightly<00:02:06.270> thick<00:02:06.630> now<00:02:07.200> some<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
still slightly thick now some of the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.869 
still slightly thick now some of the
things<00:02:07.920> you're<00:02:08.129> probably<00:02:08.280> concerned<00:02:08.640> about

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
things you're probably concerned about

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.850 
things you're probably concerned about
is<00:02:09.060> gaming<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:09.750> how<00:02:09.869> does<00:02:09.929> gaming<00:02:10.470> actually

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
is gaming so how does gaming actually

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.650 
is gaming so how does gaming actually
look<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.610> device<00:02:11.879> if<00:02:12.120> we<00:02:12.180> took<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.360> look<00:02:12.510> at

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
look on this device if we took a look at

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.309 
look on this device if we took a look at
two<00:02:12.780> games

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
two games

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.259 
two games
to<00:02:13.560> show<00:02:13.739> you<00:02:13.769> so<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.609> can<00:02:14.730> definitely<00:02:15.090> check

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
to show you so you can definitely check

00:02:15.269 --> 00:03:25.790 
to show you so you can definitely check
that<00:02:15.329> out

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.370 

so<00:03:26.610> we<00:03:26.700> took<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.850> look<00:03:27.000> at<00:03:27.210> gaming<00:03:27.600> on<00:03:27.960> the<00:03:28.080> iPad

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
so we took a look at gaming on the iPad

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.800 
so we took a look at gaming on the iPad
Mini<00:03:28.620> 3<00:03:28.710> and<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.280> handles<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.670> very<00:03:29.730> well<00:03:30.090> the

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
Mini 3 and it handles it very well the

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.450 
Mini 3 and it handles it very well the
aid<00:03:30.960> processor<00:03:31.560> does<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.740> very<00:03:31.830> good<00:03:32.100> job<00:03:32.220> at

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
aid processor does a very good job at

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.000 
aid processor does a very good job at
that<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:33.090> again<00:03:33.630> display<00:03:34.050> looks<00:03:34.320> vibrance

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
that and again display looks vibrance

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.670 
that and again display looks vibrance
where<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.820> can<00:03:36.030> literally<00:03:36.390> handle<00:03:36.990> games

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
where you can literally handle games

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.800 
where you can literally handle games
well<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.250> looks<00:03:38.460> pretty<00:03:38.790> good<00:03:39.030> battery<00:03:39.750> life

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
well it looks pretty good battery life

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.280 
well it looks pretty good battery life
on<00:03:40.050> this<00:03:40.200> is<00:03:40.320> also<00:03:40.530> very<00:03:40.890> good<00:03:41.040> with<00:03:41.250> its

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
on this is also very good with its

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.260 
on this is also very good with its
roughly<00:03:43.290> 6,000<00:03:44.040> milliamp<00:03:44.340> battery<00:03:44.400> does<00:03:45.240> a

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
roughly 6,000 milliamp battery does a

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.510 
roughly 6,000 milliamp battery does a
very<00:03:45.390> good<00:03:45.660> job<00:03:45.810> should<00:03:46.380> last<00:03:46.740> you<00:03:47.130> quite<00:03:47.400> a

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
very good job should last you quite a

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.230

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
while with this I've had this for I've

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.900 
while with this I've had this for I've
been<00:03:51.270> using<00:03:51.570> it<00:03:51.780> on<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.230> off<00:03:52.290> at<00:03:52.980> least<00:03:53.250> for<00:03:53.610> a

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
been using it on and off at least for a

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.460 
been using it on and off at least for a
couple<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.450> days<00:03:54.600> I'll<00:03:54.840> sleep<00:03:54.960> maybe<00:03:55.140> three

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
couple of days I'll sleep maybe three

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.770

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
days on off with this wild game and it

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.290 
days on off with this wild game and it
still<00:03:57.990> lasted<00:03:58.380> me<00:03:58.500> quite<00:03:58.770> a<00:03:58.800> while<00:03:58.860> so<00:03:59.310> i<00:03:59.520> would

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
still lasted me quite a while so i would

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.060 
still lasted me quite a while so i would
say<00:04:00.420> battery<00:04:00.690> life<00:04:00.870> on<00:04:00.990> this<00:04:01.110> is<00:04:01.290> very<00:04:01.710> good

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
say battery life on this is very good

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.090 
say battery life on this is very good

older sibling here and you can see this

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.220 
older sibling here and you can see this
is<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.500> ipad<00:04:22.920> mini<00:04:22.980> to<00:04:23.400> this<00:04:23.700> ipad<00:04:24.030> 93<00:04:24.540> they

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
is the ipad mini to this ipad 93 they

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.610 
is the ipad mini to this ipad 93 they
look<00:04:25.440> exactly<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:26.400> same<00:04:26.870> very<00:04:27.870> identical<00:04:28.380> and

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
look exactly the same very identical and

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.610 
look exactly the same very identical and
look<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.040> feel<00:04:29.510> you<00:04:30.510> can<00:04:30.660> see<00:04:30.870> just<00:04:31.080> sighs<00:04:31.350> in

look and feel you can see just sighs in
there<00:04:31.800> it's<00:04:32.340> also<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.730> same<00:04:32.910> thing<00:04:33.270> if<00:04:34.110> i

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
there it's also the same thing if i

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.810 
there it's also the same thing if i
actually<00:04:34.500> stack<00:04:34.950> them<00:04:35.160> next<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.580> each<00:04:35.640> other

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
actually stack them next to each other

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.770 
actually stack them next to each other
my<00:04:36.450> actual<00:04:36.750> know<00:04:37.590> which<00:04:38.070> is<00:04:38.220> which<00:04:38.630> except<00:04:39.630> of

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
my actual know which is which except of

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.570 
my actual know which is which except of
course<00:04:39.810> one<00:04:40.169> is<00:04:40.200> dark<00:04:40.680> gray<00:04:40.980> one<00:04:41.600> silver<00:04:42.600> and

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
course one is dark gray one silver and

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.300 
course one is dark gray one silver and
that's<00:04:44.580> that<00:04:45.050> so<00:04:46.050> they<00:04:46.230> do<00:04:46.290> look<00:04:46.650> similar<00:04:46.919> that

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
that's that so they do look similar that

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.730 
that's that so they do look similar that
basically<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.150> hardware<00:04:48.810> is<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.200> same<00:04:49.470> all

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
basically the hardware is the same all

basically the hardware is the same all
around<00:04:49.770> you<00:04:50.700> do<00:04:50.880> have<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.210> ring<00:04:51.480> around<00:04:52.460> the

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
around you do have the ring around the

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.900 
around you do have the ring around the
the<00:04:54.600> camera<00:04:54.960> there<00:04:55.169> on<00:04:55.350> the<00:04:55.560> ipad<00:04:55.860> mini<00:04:56.070> 2<00:04:56.160> but

it literally is the ipad mini 2 with
touch<00:05:28.320> ID<00:05:28.590> and<00:05:29.040> even<00:05:29.610> when<00:05:29.730> touch<00:05:29.910> ID<00:05:30.150> you<00:05:30.480> have

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
touch ID and even when touch ID you have

cheaper

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.390
