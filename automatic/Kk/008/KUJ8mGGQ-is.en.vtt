obviously<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.420> can't<00:01:36.630> give<00:01:36.780> attention<00:01:37.080> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
obviously you can't give attention and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.020 
obviously you can't give attention and
not<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.920> goalkeeper<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.580> there<00:01:38.760> is<00:01:38.820> either

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
not have a goalkeeper in there is either

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.630 
not have a goalkeeper in there is either
on<00:01:39.330> and<00:01:39.990> stays<00:01:40.260> on<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.710> he's<00:01:40.830> off<00:01:41.010> I<00:01:41.250> think

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
on and stays on or he's off I think

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.860 
on and stays on or he's off I think
what's<00:01:41.760> happening<00:01:41.970> here<00:01:42.090> my<00:01:42.270> Riley<00:01:42.510> probably

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
what's happening here my Riley probably

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.180 
what's happening here my Riley probably
wants<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.170> get<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.620> he<00:01:43.680> wants<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.980> get<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
wants to get going he wants to get the

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.190 
wants to get going he wants to get the
game<00:01:44.370> underway<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.630> think<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:45.870> Chelsea

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
game underway and I think the Chelsea

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.780 
game underway and I think the Chelsea
players<00:01:46.410> can<00:01:46.650> hold<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:46.980> a<00:01:47.010> min<00:01:47.220> look<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.610> want

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
players can hold on a min look we want

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.160 
players can hold on a min look we want
to<00:01:47.850> give<00:01:47.970> him<00:01:48.030> as<00:01:48.180> much<00:01:48.390> time<00:01:48.690> as<00:01:48.870> we<00:01:48.900> possibly

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
to give him as much time as we possibly

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.780 
to give him as much time as we possibly
can<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.740> don't<00:01:49.920> want<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> make<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> change<00:01:50.340> it

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
can we don't want to make a change it

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.490 
can we don't want to make a change it
the<00:01:51.240> goalkeeper<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:51.840> goodness<00:01:52.140> sake<00:01:52.320> so

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the goalkeeper for goodness sake so

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.800 
the goalkeeper for goodness sake so
allow<00:01:52.680> us<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> little<00:01:53.250> bit<00:01:53.490> more<00:01:53.700> time<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.690> to

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
allow us a little bit more time just to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.180 
allow us a little bit more time just to
double-check<00:01:55.170> you've<00:01:55.500> got<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> banging<00:01:56.100> the

off a micro Baraka of course who

off a micro Baraka of course who
suspended<00:02:10.050> for<00:02:10.440> his<00:02:10.590> third<00:02:10.980> match<00:02:11.220> today<00:02:11.550> but

suspended for his third match today but

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.850 
suspended for his third match today but
the<00:02:11.820> phablet<00:02:12.150> Sissoko<00:02:12.900> wasn't<00:02:13.230> sent<00:02:13.470> off<00:02:13.650> in

the phablet Sissoko wasn't sent off in
that<00:02:14.370> match<00:02:14.580> as<00:02:14.790> well<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.120> they<00:02:15.180> probably

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
that match as well and they probably

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.300 
that match as well and they probably
want<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.690> see<00:02:15.810> Riley<00:02:16.080> uses<00:02:16.530> common<00:02:16.830> sense<00:02:17.070> here

want to see Riley uses common sense here
allow<00:02:17.880> better<00:02:18.090> check<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> chance<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.960> come

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
allow better check the chance to come

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.660 
allow better check the chance to come
round<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.470> see<00:02:19.530> if<00:02:19.710> he's<00:02:19.800> okay<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.160> carry<00:02:20.460> on

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
round and see if he's okay to carry on

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.070 
round and see if he's okay to carry on
and<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:20.910> think<00:02:21.150> with<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.420> game<00:02:21.600> hardly

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
and I think with the game hardly

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.350 
and I think with the game hardly
underway<00:02:22.500> as<00:02:22.770> well<00:02:23.070> Richard<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:23.550> think<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.970> I

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
underway as well Richard I think it I

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.790 
underway as well Richard I think it I
think<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.750> Chelsea<00:02:25.080> players<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> point

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
think the Chelsea players have a point

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.310 
think the Chelsea players have a point
here<00:02:25.860> let's<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:26.940> give<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.240> goalkeeper<00:02:27.900> as

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
here let's just give this goalkeeper as

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.960 
here let's just give this goalkeeper as
much<00:02:28.500> time<00:02:28.710> as<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:28.890> possibly<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.640> it's<00:02:29.880> not

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
much time as we possibly can it's not

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.550 
much time as we possibly can it's not

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
like we're 20 minutes into the game we

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.440 
like we're 20 minutes into the game we
don't<00:02:31.740> want<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.950> stop<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.400> delay<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.270> game

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
elsewhere such a good goalkeeper is but

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.970 
elsewhere such a good goalkeeper is but
surely<00:03:30.629> this<00:03:30.719> is<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.989> end<00:03:31.109> our<00:03:31.319> check<00:03:31.680> well<00:03:31.889> it

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
surely this is the end our check well it

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.289 
surely this is the end our check well it
looks<00:03:32.159> like<00:03:32.249> you<00:03:32.609> I<00:03:32.670> mean<00:03:32.819> they're<00:03:32.939> not<00:03:33.060> he's

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
looks like you I mean they're not he's
