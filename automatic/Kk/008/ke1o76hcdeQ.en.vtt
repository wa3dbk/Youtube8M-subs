00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello to all caciotti all this put 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:09.179
 episode of su of today 's tech bang 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.160
 how could I read from the title 95 o 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.340
 here for you the white version that is 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.090
 this however I also have the model 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.240
 previous that lm 90 the black version 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.590
 then either black version and white version 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.900
 here they are 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.199
 naturally we will talk mainly 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.050
 in the 95 touches the last model 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:37.890
 differences between the least boasts rm 95 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:40.680
 mainly the only one we really say 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.840
 defect that 90 cm was the fact that i 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.430
 rates were too difficult to be prime minister 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.890
 during a gaming session it is 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.640
 so hard to press that a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.440
 times where you put pressure on yourself 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.239
 pushed to move the mouse 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.030
 this is something that has been improved 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.579
 in the m95 that this model is that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:07.140
 so it really allows us to click 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:10.320
 easy a thing in my opinion a little one 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.810
 m95 defect instead with regard to i 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.400
 buttons is that some buttons are too 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.250
 easy to press and do not give you a 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.740
 sufficient feedback to understand it 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.009
 pressed or not pressed with the button 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.479
 I refer to the upper buttons we give 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:30.960
 an overview of the mouse 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.009
 we have the base which is aluminum and is 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.329
 very resistant we have on the side like 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.880
 we have already said 9 buttons 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.740
 programmable for a total in the mouse 15 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.479
 buttons that can be programmed 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.890
 individually 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:51.090
 these are usually dedicated to macros 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.880
 we have a tactical design for the thumb 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.950
 as you can see when they position 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.280
 inch I can access the major 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.690
 part of the rates moving precisely 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.760
 in a circular way 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.729
 my thumb will do again 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:12.720
 appearance of the side where we usually 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.710
 we rest the light and the little finger has one 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.290
 texture that makes it rough thing that 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.220
 instead the back of the is missing on the back 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.350
 mouse and smooth smooth in my opinion 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.560
 too smooth and that is why I am there 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.000
 I recommend the black version always n95 but 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.260
 the black version that has the 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.300
 texture also on the back is not 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.980
 really a disadvantage or a defect 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:45.030
 real on a thing that to me 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:49.650
 we say in the touch does not give me the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.130
 feedback I want so anyway it's a 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.190
 excellent but I also use the white version 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.690
 a defect instead of always being 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.070
 a defect can be a defect for me 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.290
 how can it be an advantage for someone 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:05.880
 other is the weight of the mouse 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.160
 this mouse weighs a little what it can 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.150
 be a positive and negative thing and if 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.739
 I have thought so for MMO games 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.830
 mass multiplayer type world of 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.250
 warcraft for story whoever has more of it 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.630
 put 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.980
 it is a good thing because of its precision 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.380
 weight combo or sorry and piÃ  and low 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.760
 really allows for precision 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:35.930
 crazy at a structural level it is 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.150
 however, the materials are very good 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.560
 very good very robust one thing me 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.220
 would have liked to see a little bit of foot 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.380
 thicker below but not a thing 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:51.120
 necessary is right because I want to 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:53.519
 we criticize on the back in addition to two 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.060
 buttons and the wheel another button 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.680
 extra that has no basic function and we will have to 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.860
 go and set it up via the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.100
 software and two bugs quilin buttons with 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:12.150
 the darts to change the dpi then 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:15.690
 to play her dpi we have a sensor e 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.370
 via ego 1200 dpi even if as I say 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:23.690
 I never go personally 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.690
 over 1000 and 1500 to dns where 1800 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.570
 in conclusion I also tell you the 2 sebino 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.500
 I show it to you because indeed a 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:37.890
 old model is the usual blue usb 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:43.530
 of the cruise the cable is naturally in 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:45.919
 fabric to avoid to car from minds and 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.700
 things like that 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.100
 but one thing I was almost there 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.210
 forgetting to close buttons have 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.740
 of the small networks that you naturally 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.590
 you will not see with the webcam why the 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.580
 war sucks then there are little ones 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.640
 and there are six sea led this which is off 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.849
 we can better show no 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.650
 perfect, in short, 6 LEDs that indicate the 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.140
 profile in fact we also have one 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.440
 internal bread storage of 48 kilobytes 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:17.310
 which allows us to save profiles 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:23.419
 right on the mouse 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:30.510
 ultimately it is a robust mouse that 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:39.720
 advice to those who do intense 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:46.530
 mmo game sessions understand this is 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:49.289
 the year of the creation of the 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.820
 changes we have seen with you razer ha 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.729
 practically it is the death adder 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:58.169
 that nagai in 2014 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:06:00.960
 no half of 2013 corsair listening 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.789
 user feedback also has 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.919
 modified its products 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:11.099
 what about this overview of 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:13.830
 product is everything I still remember you 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:16.110
 once there is a download the link 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.100
 to the facebook page in the description 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.720
 of the race was where you can go through 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.610
 let a like participate in 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.490
 future giveaways that will allow you 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.260
 will bring home free products that it is 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.840
 a beautiful thing 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.790
 therefore for this need all the

 unboxing bada overview by the way does not 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:47.669
 he showed me this box in the pits 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:51.120
 equal to that of the 90 m I think it is 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:54.240
 similar I don't have many 3m memories 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.949
 90 have not been on the silk for quite a while 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.550
 other useful information with respect to 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:03.020
 what I had said yes and this is 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.020
 all and I greet you all bye
