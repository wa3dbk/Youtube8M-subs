00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:21.310
 hello the most destructive machine with 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:25.880
 potential to destroy Brazil 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:30.080
 was set up in our country at age 50 and 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.470
 has been operating incessantly and 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.710
 acts ideologically in the system of 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.320
 Brazilian education 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:45.110
 the destruction capacity of this 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:48.770
 device is simply indescribable 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.570
 Throughout these minutes, I'll say something. 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:56.690
 about it but I'll just be scratching 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:03.079
 the profound and damaging consequences of 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:07.250
 that the process of indoctrination happens 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:11.770
 ideological approach to teaching 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.060
 basic high school higher education 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:19.069
 and I think with myself 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.550
 will there be any students entering the 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:24.140
 with some explanation 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:29.119
 for the facts of life and the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.009
 history comes out of elementary school 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.759
 with ideas like this was inside the room 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.069
 class that they started to see some student who 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.819
 enters high school with a vision 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:45.259
 Marxist history of economics as 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:50.149
 policy if he leaves school with these 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:52.399
 ideas was in the school that passed the 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.280
 in the elementary school that received them 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:59.050
 nobody is born understanding the world with 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:03.500
 this view is not natural 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.509
 and this happens in Brazil in all 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.420
 classrooms in the public education network 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.599
 and private a country where it has two million 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.450
 and a half of teachers who do not have 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.450
 between its function among its missions 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.150
 between their tasks and obligations to 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.620
 make the head of your students to your 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.310
 image and likeness 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.860
 imagine an abuse a marmanjo enters the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.989
 classroom closes door goes up on 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:36.830
 mastery imposes its authority on 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:40.190
 children to raise young people to sell 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.590
 its ideology its way of thinking its 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.670
 understanding of reality that does not 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.670
 is it the worst possible 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:54.290
 the students before the authority of the 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.109
 teacher of the century 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.989
 the fact that the teacher gives up note 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.859
 submit to this teaching 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.959
 uncritically because they are not 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:06.620
 prepared for criticism because they never 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.290
 have heard the opposite side because 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:14.030
 that they give is unilateral factious 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.209
 pernicious and these students know that the 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.940
 giving teacher 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.310
 and this bag and poisons textbooks 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.170
 public procurement as many as 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.660
 public tenders 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.079
 the respondents when responding to the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.299
 questions have to answer before 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.450
 itself what the ideological response is 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:38.870
 that this question will accept as correct 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.319
 because they are also infiltrated there 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.230
 these makers of these 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:49.720
 abusers who, when acting in the network of 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:54.319
 teaching I call political pedophiles 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.220
 rapists of children's minds as 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.739
 make the country or convey ideas 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.199
 paralyzers involving the initiative 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:08.150
 creativity and understanding 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:11.000
 the originality the desire to do things 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.090
 as the saliva of a 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.430
 wrong and wrong wrong ideology 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.780
 which involves these people as a web of 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.539
 spider and is mobilized for life 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.630
 and there is the result 63 percent of the 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:32.090
 teaching work of these teachers 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:35.200
 functional illiterates that 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:39.160
 they will occupy positions that pay low 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.990
 and that they will be unhappy for this and I will 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.030
 find an explanation for your 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.800
 unhappiness what the teacher 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.890
 taught these students 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.770
 these young people are ready to embrace 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:54.000
 any party that reproduces in life 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.440
 that which 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.010
 pedagogically they were taught in 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:04.810
 Pedophile classroom of pedagogy 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.960
 abusers and children's minds than in 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.110
 party Brazil and both do so poorly 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.940
 our development 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.460
 fortunately the schools move on 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.380
 after ten years of struggle he succeeded 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.470
 to bring the proposal to the national congress 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.560
 of a law to stop it because 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:29.470
 this in public education is a form of 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:31.380
 prevarication and in private 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.700
 sell along with the merchandise 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.700
 educational system sold a balance that 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:42.430
 nobody wants to buy and goes in 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:44.710
 together insidiously including much 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:48.450
 including members in schools 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.590
 Catholic confessional 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.440
 this is abuse 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:57.130
 this is intolerable and it is necessary that a 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.100
 law that prohibits and punishes those who act this 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:06.000
 way is to take place this 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:09.420
 fortunately for this idea 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.420
 thank you very much
