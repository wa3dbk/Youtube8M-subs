00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
match for your skin and the more you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.859 
match for your skin and the more you
enter<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:39.000> closer<00:01:39.299> they're<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> be

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
enter in the closer they're going to be

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.870

able<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.079> get<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.890> really<00:01:41.250> good<00:01:41.369> match<00:01:41.610> for

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
some of them and then I would type in

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.270
