00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
pet in stealth so finally we have this

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.279 
pet in stealth so finally we have this
and<00:00:20.240> let's<00:00:21.240> get<00:00:21.510> straight<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.990> fight

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
and let's get straight to the fight

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.859 
and let's get straight to the fight
because<00:00:23.100> there's<00:00:24.000> not<00:00:24.210> much<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.630> tell

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
because there's not much I can tell

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.099 
because there's not much I can tell
about<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:26.269> strangely<00:00:27.269> enough<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.720> hardest

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
about it strangely enough the hardest

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.870 
about it strangely enough the hardest
part<00:00:28.260> about<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.710> fight<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.310> trash<00:00:29.609> bags

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
part about the fight is the trash bags

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.669 
part about the fight is the trash bags
because<00:00:30.179> although<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.840> could<00:00:30.990> avoid<00:00:31.260> them

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
because although I could avoid them

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.680 
because although I could avoid them
while<00:00:31.980> turning<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.460> instance<00:00:32.910> because<00:00:33.390> of

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
while turning the instance because of

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.370 
while turning the instance because of
stealth<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:35.239> pulled<00:00:36.239> them<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.480> lot<00:00:36.690> during<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
stealth I pulled them a lot during the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.830 
stealth I pulled them a lot during the
fight<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.040> all<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.610> do<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:38.940> drag<00:00:39.239> elementals

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
fight so all I can do is drag elementals

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.569 
fight so all I can do is drag elementals
and<00:00:39.960> watch<00:00:40.320> out<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.829> work<00:00:40.980> hard<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.430> avoid

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
disengage in this video pretty nicely

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.110 
disengage in this video pretty nicely
because<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:48.010> use<00:01:48.160> it<00:01:48.280> a<00:01:48.370> lot<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.930> does<00:01:50.770> increase

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
because I use it a lot it does increase

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
disengage jump range a lot you're

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.320 
disengage jump range a lot you're
traveling<00:01:53.860> miles<00:01:54.100> in<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:54.460> air<00:01:54.490> when<00:01:54.910> you<00:01:55.060> use

traveling miles in the air when you use
this<00:01:55.510> engage<00:01:55.870> so<00:01:56.830> it's<00:01:57.190> a<00:01:57.400> huge<00:01:57.430> boost<00:01:58.060> for

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
this engage so it's a huge boost for

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.300 
this engage so it's a huge boost for
cutting<00:01:58.720> again<00:01:58.960> as<00:01:59.650> you<00:01:59.800> will<00:01:59.980> see<00:02:00.130> for

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
cutting again as you will see for

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.620 
cutting again as you will see for
survival<00:02:00.880> as<00:02:00.970> well<00:02:02.430> disengage<00:02:03.430> became<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.030> very

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
survival as well disengage became a very

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.609 
survival as well disengage became a very
important<00:02:05.260> ability<00:02:05.620> among<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.400> hunter<00:02:06.790> stove

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
important ability among the hunter stove

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.180
