00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.180
 Ronald Graafland a very nice gesture 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.280
 thing i like that from the trainer ronald koeman 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.650
 you still minutes and what let's make 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.910
 you have experienced that at the start 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.120
 yes last week I happened to have it 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.250
 I dry when they are 35 so I 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.240
 say train you can but the oldest think 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.680
 make that side 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.940
 I just heard that your cross was 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.260
 but I am the oldest of the 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.420
 youth education 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.949
 so the to have a little on too 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.949
 toasted to jobs of a second title 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.760
 from to second place he is they promise 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.230
 fulfilled 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.430
 then you may be the player in feyenoord 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.870
 eighth win in a row 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.610
 and then you leave it one 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.130
 ball through will building 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.610
 yes I maybe better my best 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.040
 must do 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.780
 no that is now a shadow he is 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.070
 collation fantastic in I him 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.320
 heard one and 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.200
 short audiences cheer and can do that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.850
 tenable you were sick of it I notice 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.129
 of course in fifteen minutes then yes 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.420
 then you still want to keep the new one 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.700
 if you get a goal then 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.620
 but more so one than one 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.530
 silly ball but no skipper 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.879
 fantastic this is also your farewell because 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.309
 you're an uncertain future sentences 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.380
 because if lamprou could be rented out then 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.680
 you can almost certainly stay 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.000
 if that doesn't happen then 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.720
 yes but maybe not a place for you 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.430
 more no is correct it will be in the 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.340
 waiting room and it is the wait 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.740
 what he what he wants and what he does 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.670
 and other than yes it was and did him 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.110
 farewell match 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.750
 yes you speak lamprou no doubt 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.920
 think that will come around with him 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.840
 I really don't know he knows 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.630
 not even themselves there is none yet 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.570
 no concrete interest is yes 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.180
 maybe more difficult to get to 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.460
 come as in his case 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.810
 costs remain wonder how do you have how are you 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.220
 in at the moment the feyenoord doesn't 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.540
 will you stop it with football or go 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.820
 you might be somewhere else and then 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.590
 bloom football and search in the cool down 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.780
 no no I have said that before 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.540
 of course but yes i think i am beautiful 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.060
 spent three years at a fantastic level 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.470
 played and trained and yes, preferably 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.450
 I want to go see if or deep stones 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.729
 or the platform box is still yes then go 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.680
 I just have to think about each other 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.350
 who were there further this season and were 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.130
 second still the maximum attainable 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.929
 yes we wanted the start of the season 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.510
 Of course for this the price is going 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.480
 even surrounded with 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.560
 yes fear the playoffs 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.989
 boy who would miss out to 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.390
 in the end you are cpo but he wants you 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.220
 second so yes I can 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.220
 be satisfied if we are as a team
