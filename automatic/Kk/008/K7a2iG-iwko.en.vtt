a<00:01:44.070> punch<00:01:44.399> we'll<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.390> getting<00:01:45.630> something<00:01:45.840> more

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
a punch we'll be getting something more

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
realistic now using this for example

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.370 
realistic now using this for example
it's<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.210> most<00:01:48.360> realistic<00:01:48.780> thing<00:01:49.170> but

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
it's not the most realistic thing but

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.440 
it's not the most realistic thing but
it's<00:01:49.500> more<00:01:49.680> realistic<00:01:50.040> than<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:51.000> popping

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
it's more realistic than just it popping

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.999 
it's more realistic than just it popping
up<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:51.720> from<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> game<00:01:52.470> mode<00:01:52.649> EXO<00:01:52.979> zombies

really magic it is actually created by 9
35<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.100> weapon<00:02:32.760> upgrade<00:02:33.239> thing<00:02:33.450> but

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
35 and it is a weapon upgrade thing but

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.600 
35 and it is a weapon upgrade thing but
that<00:02:33.690> was<00:02:34.019> also<00:02:34.319> in<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.680> story<00:02:35.069> that's<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.430> man

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
that was also in the story that's a man

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.309 
that was also in the story that's a man
made<00:02:35.850> up<00:02:36.060> we<00:02:36.630> won't<00:02:36.780> be<00:02:36.900> getting<00:02:37.019> something

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
made up we won't be getting something

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.830 
made up we won't be getting something
exactly<00:02:38.069> like<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.550> but<00:02:39.000> probably<00:02:39.180> something

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
exactly like that but probably something

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.320 
exactly like that but probably something
similar<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.440> that's<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:41.160> if<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.910> theory

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
similar and that's just if this theory

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.809 
similar and that's just if this theory
is<00:02:42.480> correct<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.739> conclusion<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.519> video

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
is correct so conclusion of this video

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.180 
is correct so conclusion of this video
we're<00:02:45.480> still<00:02:45.690> going<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.870> get<00:02:45.930> an<00:02:46.049> upgrade<00:02:46.260> pack

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
we're still going to get an upgrade pack

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.410 
we're still going to get an upgrade pack
a<00:02:47.220> punch<00:02:47.489> kind<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.819> thing<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.000> just<00:02:48.180> going<00:02:48.360> to

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
a punch kind of thing is just going to

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.880 
a punch kind of thing is just going to
look<00:02:48.630> different<00:02:48.660> it's<00:02:49.470> just<00:02:49.590> going<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.769> have<00:02:49.860> a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
look different it's just going to have a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.410 
look different it's just going to have a
different<00:02:50.040> backstory<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:51.030> as<00:02:51.150> well<00:02:51.180> as

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
different backstory to it as well as

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.900 
different backstory to it as well as
perks<00:02:51.799> we've<00:02:52.799> been<00:02:53.280> hinted<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.640> there's

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
perks we've been hinted that there's

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.509 
perks we've been hinted that there's
this<00:02:54.030> company<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.200> using<00:02:55.950> element<00:02:56.280> 115

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
this company that is using element 115

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.030 
this company that is using element 115
again<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.630> exploit<00:02:58.019> in<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.350> new<00:02:58.500> storyline

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
again to exploit in this new storyline

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.130 
again to exploit in this new storyline
so<00:02:59.640> they<00:02:59.760> might<00:02:59.880> be<00:03:00.060> making<00:03:00.209> this<00:03:00.810> kind<00:03:00.870> of

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
so they might be making this kind of

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.890 
so they might be making this kind of
stuff<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.549> will<00:03:02.790> get<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.330> same<00:03:03.510> amount<00:03:03.569> of

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
stuff and so will get the same amount of

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.500 
stuff and so will get the same amount of
perks<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.470> same<00:03:04.680> amount<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.209> abilities<00:03:06.209> for

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
perks the same amount of abilities for

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.150 
perks the same amount of abilities for
this<00:03:06.630> perk<00:03:06.840> same<00:03:07.080> amount<00:03:07.319> of<00:03:07.410> points<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.860> spend

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
this perk same amount of points to spend

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.070 
this perk same amount of points to spend
just<00:03:08.910> with<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.180> different<00:03:09.299> backstory
