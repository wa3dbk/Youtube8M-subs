me<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> best<00:01:33.240> way<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.450> describe<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.900> is

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
me the best way to describe it is

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.410 
me the best way to describe it is
I<00:01:35.490> was<00:01:36.090> telling<00:01:36.300> somebody<00:01:36.570> earlier<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:38.420> it's

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
weird to say this because the guys in

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.770 
weird to say this because the guys in
the<00:01:40.860> locker<00:01:41.010> room<00:01:41.250> Yellin<00:01:41.580> at<00:01:41.730> us<00:01:41.760> but<00:01:42.210> they

in the roster do you feel like there's a
little<00:04:41.110> more<00:04:41.230> pressure<00:04:41.320> being<00:04:42.040> kind<00:04:42.940> of<00:04:43.030> one

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
little more pressure being kind of one

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.520 
little more pressure being kind of one
of<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.300> first<00:04:43.450> teams<00:04:43.720> to<00:04:43.930> come<00:04:44.110> back<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:44.470> the

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
of the first teams to come back to the

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.080 
of the first teams to come back to the
whole<00:04:44.680> world<00:04:44.800> series<00:04:45.130> they<00:04:45.250> keep<00:04:45.820> a<00:04:45.910> team

intact<00:04:46.390> oh<00:04:47.070> yeah<00:04:48.070> you<00:04:48.400> know<00:04:48.490> what<00:04:48.520> that's<00:04:48.760> a

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
intact oh yeah you know what that's a

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.700 
intact oh yeah you know what that's a
that's<00:04:49.720> a<00:04:49.870> good<00:04:49.990> question<00:04:50.050> because<00:04:50.560> that's

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
that's a good question because that's

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.070 
that's a good question because that's
something<00:04:50.950> I<00:04:51.430> think<00:04:51.760> that<00:04:51.940> from<00:04:52.270> 2010

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
something I think that from 2010

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.170 
something I think that from 2010
hopefully<00:04:53.590> I<00:04:53.650> can<00:04:53.830> for<00:04:54.430> myself<00:04:54.550> I<00:04:54.850> can<00:04:55.030> learn

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
hopefully I can for myself I can learn

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.520 
hopefully I can for myself I can learn
on<00:04:55.360> because<00:04:55.720> there<00:04:55.900> is<00:04:55.990> a<00:04:56.020> lot<00:04:56.230> of<00:04:56.320> pressure

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
on because there is a lot of pressure

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.150 
on because there is a lot of pressure
being<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.890> defending<00:04:57.370> champs<00:04:58.890> you<00:04:59.890> have<00:05:00.070> to

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
being the defending champs you have to

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.530 
being the defending champs you have to
realize<00:05:00.460> this<00:05:00.640> the<00:05:00.820> same<00:05:01.030> game<00:05:01.240> you're<00:05:01.420> in<00:05:01.480> the

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
realize this the same game you're in the

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.260 
realize this the same game you're in the
same<00:05:01.690> situation<00:05:02.290> that<00:05:02.320> you<00:05:02.590> were<00:05:03.150> when<00:05:04.150> you

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
same situation that you were when you

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.660 
same situation that you were when you
weren't<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.600> defending<00:05:05.020> champ<00:05:05.290> so<00:05:05.680> what's

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
weren't the defending champ so what's

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.080 
weren't the defending champ so what's
important<00:05:07.060> is<00:05:07.180> to<00:05:07.300> keep<00:05:07.330> that<00:05:07.690> in<00:05:07.810> perspective

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
important is to keep that in perspective

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.420 
important is to keep that in perspective
let's<00:05:09.660> go<00:05:09.870> just<00:05:10.620> go<00:05:10.830> play<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.100> game<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.400> right
