00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:10.730
 rimador and good we are in collaboration 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.950
 with the viti ximo and I'll show you a 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.710
 bathroom that we are finishing good I'm going 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.450
 to explain how we plan the pottery 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.730
 well first how can you see the 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.369
 ceramic is therefore has movement and is 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.939
 because it is a mesh because after making 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.590
 movement 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.210
 what allows us is to do the form 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.210
 of the shower if I did not have that movement 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.240
 it should be straight we could not do the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.040
 way of being then at the time of 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.160
 do the shower so that we look good 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.350
 let's first rethink dry 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.930
 place it more or less we would start from 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.230
 here that we see the straight cut with 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.690
 what is english pavement 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.590
 and then to see how we 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.000
 how they come 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.000
 we will place it dry 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.760
 then what we would do is cut has 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.480
 a silicone behind 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.630
 has a silicone we will cut it 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.590
 they are five pieces 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.590
 necklines 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.010
 and we cut the piece 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.280
 we have the piece 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.600
 and we present it dry 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.750
 and then so 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.040
 we must square and masters what is the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.260
 shower 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.190
 and from here to do the same in 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.790
 this address 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.330
 place them 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.330
 from here 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.380
 after here 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.670
 then go presenting a dry 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.970
 and all 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.190
 well then when we get to the sink 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.280
 because practically the same in look 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.270
 let's see how they match 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.350
 entire 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.350
 then we will cut 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.550
 and in this other 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.180
 as you can see it and average are two 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.860
 stated here we would have to already use a 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.320
 disk machine or a fashion 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.560
 with a specific disk to cut 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.709
 ceramics 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.590
 and then nothing would be placed the piece 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.099
 cut we would join and we would continue well 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.720
 with the video so there's no 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.730
 step none seemed like no one could 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:42.920
 stumble is locked with a foot on 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.920
 that is well well finished and well 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.590
 and well overlapped 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.450
 Well, thank you very much for listening to me 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.850
 I am an animator sergio and as I say 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.819

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.340
 for rapist we are looking for a collimator and 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.780
 you can see there as photos can see 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.420
 opinions of our clients 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.160
 I hope it has been a great help 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.600
 at the time of doing 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.600
