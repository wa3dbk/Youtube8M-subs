00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 on one feature here is this frame 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.660
 Hand I drowned him last time 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.880
 thought that he was not needed because 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.280
 that she is always cold to -15 18 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.740
 raise the dresser button and great 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.869
 on the plant with us but somehow 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.900
 hatched here in weeks 30 degrees 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.350
 frost and I tried to start it 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.359
 no shit did not want to have 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.130
 turn out the candles and a little bit there 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.740
 cut gasoline without problems trans 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.899
 wind up so these carburetors he 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.309
 what have you done 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:39.690
 over there at the very exit of the diffuser 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.739
 Now I will try to come from that side 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.190
 show had to drill two 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.469
 small holes cut into threads and 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.230
 twist there pereternichki here and 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.360
 here this one there manual check these 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.370
 Shlomi and he does not fit there therefore 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.280
 of course I do not advise you to choose yes 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.710
 Of course, very rarely need any tundra 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.909
 live 30 degrees below zero nasa 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.220
 disasters read but useful in any 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.500
 the case has already been demonstrated 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.479
 start without a dresser 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.240
 right little shook started yet 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.500
 of course u and everything is warmed up normally 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.439
 zashib this is the principle of such a technique 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.310
 what to say i am very pleased durito then 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.189
 it instead beats the bat and most importantly 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.990
 that we have a temperature of 2 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.150
 forty-fifty probably no more is she 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.320
 raises not received from her narita hour 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.420
 on the street I was glad to be 5 probably frost 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.659
 I drove a half day drove to 2 vault on 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.000
 maximum revs tried their feelings 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.790
 raise the temperature of nichrome all 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.979
 ok so in this respect you can 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.799
 don't be afraid of these two radiators which 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.560
 we stand there in the back one across 2 under 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.890
 tracks and more than enough well and 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.579
 the third one over there we stand before 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.950
 exhaust 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.960
 This is a prospect of course necessary 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.360
 sixes if you put the electric starter 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.399
 more battery from six 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.550
 put the fan to warm it 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.370
 the air was a face through these windows you i 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.860
 I think it was good for porridge but 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.140
 that big frost uncomfortable glass we 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.010
 soft she bends 80 kilometers she already 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.540
 practically does not protect passengers 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.330
 abdullah is already going completely everything you have in 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.790
 face on you that is such here with us 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.790
 turned out the site machine for 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:48.120
 and the cold and hot i think 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:51.120
 that she will serve us so 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.940
 showed you how she runs if of course 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.040
 still have time and did not have in the past year 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.740
 belt he of course was her then 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.180
 try it on purpose q but such 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.910
 running garbage can be healed and 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:12.030
 will have to faker still wider to put a 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:15.630
 so of course everything is pretty good a little bit 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.440
 I certainly replaced it at Mosfilm 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.650
 stickers 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.860
 She did not match there stripped branded 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.470
 glued some don't understand that okay 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.210
 bullshit it's covered by that money 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.670
 which they paid me 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.890
 only there we need everything that we have clearly that 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.800
 what was the same before what is now 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.680
 did not fly up to 1 green dug puff with 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.730
 the sticker of the eye catches well 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.900
 principle probably on this i am with you 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.730
 I say goodbye I will do one more such odd 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.420
 I do not want to stop the experience and 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.460
 recruited a little while there still we 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.660
 blocked oxygen with postal 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.570
 shipments to 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.730
 more than 150 euros should be used 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.530
 moment 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.800
 I recommend everyone goodbye to new 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.800
 meeting
