00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 good friends and welcome today to a 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.400
 new video over alex games 29 in this 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.030
 video we are in a review of sÃ¡dr and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.509
 well sometimes it's the know you go up 10.1 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.560
 to see if I'm going to teach it goes up 10.1 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:23.939
 standard the other review I did was from 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.340
 the preview 1 if you remember is in my 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.320
 channel 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.970
 and also teaches how to install it and such 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.190
 that's why I'm not going to I'm not going to teach it here 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.230
 I'll leave you one in the description of when 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.570
 I did this but hey this 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.160
 update is already quite 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.110
 well I did not get to install it 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.489
 problems and such and such well yes I have 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.530
 tried again and succeeded and 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.030
 well then in the previous video by 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.270
 example were not these clouds that 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.860
 because it seems they are in real life 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.989
 there were many things that is not so 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.030
 good and the map in general I have 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.640
 changed a little bit so you can see 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.739
 different things 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.400
 this is what we would see in caves by 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.040
 example when we are dominating 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.410
 the only thing I see that they improve it only to 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.450
 shadows but for example the water looks 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.080
 amazing is how amazing it looks 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.510
 Water 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.240
 and I'm going to teach because it's amazing the 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.740
 movement that makes the waves and all the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.720
 things obviously is not going to do here a 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.190
 tsunami but but let's see what this 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.430
 it's my car 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.500
 so nothing that I'm going to teach you 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.560
 as it rains because it also rains from a 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.869
 way 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.290
 to see if I can write it on the 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.290
 down 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.130
 OK 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.130
 and peace 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.790
 and is that is that you are going to flip with 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.460
 this is 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.750
 It is amazing bbva poquillo more than face 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.760
 but good 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.270
 while not pulling that is what 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.270
 I care 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.840
 well maybe it's a bit weird but 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.990
 you see this and I decided eye 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.769
 and this is not it I'm not putting with a 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.269
 textures pack of the good ones indeed 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.099
 now now I'm going now I'm going to look for a 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.290
 priest a so that a package of 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.430
 textures of these good vale 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.430
 and I 'm going to teach it 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.640
 it's amazing how it looks to me tell me 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.190
 that if there were no trees in fact 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.270
 I saw the sea 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.710
 they teach me this 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.710
 and I say it's real life 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.020
 maybe it exaggerates a little bit, not because I have 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.280
 in my mind Castilian mine but to see 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.170
 if what I do not think come out 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.980
 trees because obviously there's going to be 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.090
 cubic trees in minecraft but web what 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.270
 what I'm going to do now is going to be 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.760
 download me in a it turns out that and I 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.080
 I'll teach you to see how this looks to 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.360
 of guys so far 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.190
 and well guys, this is the knowledge 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.870
 so that the south for good I leave it 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.790
 also in the description if you want it 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.200
 in our review of this on my channel and 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.830
 I do not think I do the truth anymore 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.450
 you have here and well then you did not notice either 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.569
 much difference in fact is that it's going 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.019
 better with it turns out that without it 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:17.620
 that you do not ask is something very strange 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:20.159
 because that supposedly is the sun 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.159
 this supposedly 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.290
 if there is no more 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.530
 this is very nice, it's that I'm going to 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.460
 submit 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:36.230
 the leader is worth 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:39.610
 make a capture of this because it's that 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.520
 I break my ass your ay what a good 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.810
 you are the result but there is a 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.760
 thing that caught my attention 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.040
 sadr is that he looks attentive you do not see 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.710
 nothing true now suddenly I saw salty 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.480
 but what was this the dynamic likes not 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.220
 I understand I do not understand this the truth 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.980
 I did not know that this could be done 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.200
 simply with some 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.280
 with you know the textures package to 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.440
 Internet are the ones to know, but let's go 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.910
 I did not know this the one that realizes 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.709
 this is dark and now suddenly I come 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.900
 here beginnings here I have not put it and it 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.209
 see more little light but it looks clearer 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.780
 it's very funny let's go to the leader vale 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:17.680
 and well, this is the never 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.680
 illuminates the light 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.420
 and close tombini with the torch because 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.520
 you see a lot better 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.410
 around here this is that this does not have 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.980
 torch I'm going to put the torch for 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.980
 because if 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:38.380
 and the truth is that mania seems that there 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.380
 they are Luis lose with you 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.220
 he's very cool he's firm around here but 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.950
 to the base of course very rare things 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.010
 it flashes and does strange things about these 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.969
 things of the apart I will take away the 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.429
 because I 'm not urban, this is not 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:57.289
 because I'm not doing a review of new 

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:58.550
 texture packs and not doing 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.900
 review does not know 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.900
 good where you know 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.639
 here we have algae in my case gas 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.479
 it's the same voucher I've lost and I'm leaving 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.120
 to have to kill seriously to go to my 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.889
 home and good guys, this is all 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.759
 better torch because I love that 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:30.440
 Could this be this new cargo world 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.389
 so nothing guys I hope that I have 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.400
 I really liked this review 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.490
 he does it, I've done him 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:41.830
 but things have changed like the theme 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.830
 from ceiling to ceiling you know in fact 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.890
 of the sky of the clouds and such that is 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.560
 much more beautiful the water and all 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.690
 these things change them so nothing 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.000
 guys I do not recommend much to play with 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.820
 this in minecraft if you do not have a one 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.340
 quite powerful pc I would play with this 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.230
 but it would make me dizzy I would not play 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.580
 a lot of course so nothing guys 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.250
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.250
 see you next until then 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.250
 goodbye
