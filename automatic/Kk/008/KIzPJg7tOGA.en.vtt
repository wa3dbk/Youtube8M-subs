it's<00:02:33.020> designed<00:02:33.440> for<00:02:33.590> today's<00:02:33.980> uses<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:34.730> we

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
it's designed for today's uses and we

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.130 
it's designed for today's uses and we
made<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:35.750> reversible<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:36.740> it<00:02:36.860> fits<00:02:37.130> either<00:02:37.370> way

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140
