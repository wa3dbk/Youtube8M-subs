the robot mode is better than the
original<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:49.260> some<00:01:49.530> ways<00:01:49.790> worse<00:01:50.790> than<00:01:51.030> others

the<00:01:52.950> proportions<00:01:53.610> are<00:01:53.790> mostly<00:01:54.150> improved<00:01:54.659> but

the arms look a bit too long to me you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.030 
the arms look a bit too long to me you
also<00:02:00.240> have<00:02:00.600> these<00:02:00.720> gaps<00:02:01.080> inside<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.770> legs

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
also have these gaps inside the legs

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.550

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
is better than the previous mold but his

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.759 
is better than the previous mold but his
small<00:02:24.090> feet<00:02:24.390> make<00:02:24.690> him<00:02:24.870> difficult<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.500> stand

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769

at times all in all I'd say he's a

I<00:05:15.370> guess<00:05:17.430> overall<00:05:18.570> I'd<00:05:19.570> say<00:05:19.600> he's<00:05:20.080> my<00:05:20.230> favorite

of the first wave finally Megatron he is
a<00:05:27.610> Cybertronian<00:05:28.450> tank<00:05:28.660> this<00:05:28.960> time<00:05:29.230> and<00:05:29.680> this

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
a Cybertronian tank this time and this

a Cybertronian tank this time and this
actually<00:05:31.120> looks<00:05:31.420> like<00:05:31.540> a<00:05:31.690> plausible<00:05:31.990> vehicle

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.150 
actually looks like a plausible vehicle
mode<00:05:33.420> okay<00:05:34.420> you<00:05:34.720> can<00:05:34.900> see<00:05:35.200> his<00:05:35.680> head<00:05:35.920> at<00:05:36.070> the

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.450 
mode okay you can see his head at the
back<00:05:36.360> but<00:05:37.360> at<00:05:38.140> least<00:05:38.320> it's<00:05:38.560> not<00:05:38.650> just<00:05:39.040> a<00:05:39.160> pile

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460

color<00:05:45.820> scheme<00:05:46.000> really<00:05:46.630> works<00:05:47.110> on<00:05:47.380> this<00:05:47.530> figure

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
color scheme really works on this figure

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.670

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:06.290

it<00:06:09.810> can't<00:06:10.169> turn<00:06:12.379> over<00:06:13.379> although<00:06:13.729> this<00:06:14.729> is<00:06:14.970> one

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
it can't turn over although this is one

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.839 
it can't turn over although this is one
badass<00:06:15.810> tank<00:06:16.440> mode<00:06:18.919> just<00:06:19.919> like<00:06:20.069> sideswipes

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
badass tank mode just like sideswipes

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:26.260 
badass tank mode just like sideswipes
legs<00:06:21.270> can<00:06:21.599> pop<00:06:21.810> off<00:06:21.990> during<00:06:22.349> transformation

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:36.290

one could be better quite frankly I mean

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.620 
one could be better quite frankly I mean
I<00:06:43.830> know<00:06:44.040> he's<00:06:44.550> meant<00:06:44.790> to<00:06:44.910> have<00:06:45.060> monstrous

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.390 
I know he's meant to have monstrous
proportions<00:06:45.950> but<00:06:46.950> this<00:06:47.310> is<00:06:47.610> ridiculous
