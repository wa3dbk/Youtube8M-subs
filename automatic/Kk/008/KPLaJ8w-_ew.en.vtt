well<00:00:35.510> what<00:00:36.140> we're<00:00:36.290> doing<00:00:36.500> is<00:00:36.620> we're<00:00:36.800> basically

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
well what we're doing is we're basically

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.830 
well what we're doing is we're basically
just<00:00:37.490> leveraging<00:00:37.910> of<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.120> fact<00:00:38.360> that<00:00:38.510> our

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
just leveraging of the fact that our

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.780 
just leveraging of the fact that our
boom<00:00:39.050> is<00:00:39.290> situated<00:00:40.220> on<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.370> front<00:00:40.670> of<00:00:40.700> the

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
boom is situated on the front of the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.060 
boom is situated on the front of the
machine<00:00:41.170> having<00:00:42.170> it<00:00:42.290> on<00:00:42.380> the<00:00:42.440> front<00:00:42.830> what

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
machine having it on the front what

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.620 
machine having it on the front what
we've<00:00:43.250> been<00:00:43.340> able<00:00:43.490> to<00:00:43.640> do<00:00:43.850> is<00:00:44.060> has<00:00:44.270> come<00:00:44.510> up

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
we've been able to do is has come up

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.750 
we've been able to do is has come up
with<00:00:44.750> a<00:00:44.780> quick<00:00:45.020> attach<00:00:45.320> system<00:00:45.860> it's<00:00:46.010> fairly

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
with a quick attach system it's fairly

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.490 
with a quick attach system it's fairly
unique<00:00:47.000> to<00:00:47.180> Miller<00:00:47.360> well<00:00:48.079> we<00:00:48.170> can<00:00:48.350> actually

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
unique to Miller well we can actually

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.400 
unique to Miller well we can actually
remove<00:00:48.890> our<00:00:49.220> spray<00:00:49.550> bo<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.030> then<00:00:50.840> install<00:00:51.380> a

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
remove our spray bo and then install a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.190 
remove our spray bo and then install a
certain<00:00:51.860> number<00:00:52.130> of<00:00:52.160> front<00:00:52.790> mounted

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
certain number of front mounted

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.319 
certain number of front mounted
attachments<00:00:54.200> one<00:00:54.950> is<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.550> tool<00:00:55.760> bar<00:00:55.970> which<00:00:56.150> we

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
attachments one is the tool bar which we

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.860 
attachments one is the tool bar which we
have<00:00:56.450> right<00:00:56.630> here<00:00:56.660> now<00:00:57.440> what<00:00:57.950> this<00:00:58.130> enables<00:00:58.370> a

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
have right here now what this enables a

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.660 
have right here now what this enables a
producer<00:00:59.870> to<00:00:59.989> do<00:01:00.110> is<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.590> time<00:01:01.460> the

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
producer to do is to time the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.359 
producer to do is to time the
application<00:01:01.790> of<00:01:02.420> their<00:01:02.570> nitrogen<00:01:03.339> so<00:01:04.339> that

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
application of their nitrogen so that

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.609 
application of their nitrogen so that
they<00:01:04.759> can<00:01:04.909> actually<00:01:05.089> fuel<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.960> critical

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
they can actually fuel the critical

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.130 
they can actually fuel the critical
growth<00:01:06.860> straight<00:01:07.189> stage<00:01:07.610> in<00:01:07.820> their<00:01:07.970> crop<00:01:08.210> so

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
growth straight stage in their crop so

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.539 
growth straight stage in their crop so
instead<00:01:09.380> of<00:01:09.439> putting<00:01:10.100> all<00:01:10.249> the<00:01:10.369> fertilizer

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
instead of putting all the fertilizer

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.899 
instead of putting all the fertilizer
down<00:01:10.999> at<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:11.389> time<00:01:11.539> of<00:01:11.689> planting<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.909> what

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
down at the time of planting and what

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.099 
down at the time of planting and what
they<00:01:14.030> can<00:01:14.210> do<00:01:14.329> is<00:01:14.509> then<00:01:14.689> they<00:01:14.840> can<00:01:14.990> actually

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
they can do is then they can actually

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.039 
they can do is then they can actually
split<00:01:15.560> their<00:01:15.859> their<00:01:16.189> application<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.030> go<00:01:17.659> in

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
split their their application and go in

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.410 
split their their application and go in
between<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.409> rows<00:01:18.710> with<00:01:19.609> a<00:01:19.639> set<00:01:19.880> of<00:01:19.909> Coulter's

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
between the rows with a set of Coulter's

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.209 
between the rows with a set of Coulter's
deliver<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.049> fertilizer<00:01:21.439> right<00:01:21.740> down<00:01:21.950> into

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
deliver the fertilizer right down into

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.750 
deliver the fertilizer right down into
the<00:01:22.340> root<00:01:22.490> zone<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:23.479> a

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
the root zone in a

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.240 
the root zone in a
timing<00:01:25.690> sensitive<00:01:26.320> manner<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:27.070> in<00:01:27.160> other

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
timing sensitive manner so in other

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.450 
timing sensitive manner so in other
words<00:01:27.490> at<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.120> critical<00:01:28.690> growth<00:01:29.200> stage<00:01:29.590> of<00:01:29.950> the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
words at a critical growth stage of the

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.130 
words at a critical growth stage of the
crop<00:01:30.850> if<00:01:31.450> you've<00:01:31.660> got<00:01:31.870> the<00:01:31.990> right

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
crop if you've got the right

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.320 
crop if you've got the right
environmental<00:01:32.620> conditions<00:01:33.270> essentially<00:01:34.270> you

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
environmental conditions essentially you

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.180 
environmental conditions essentially you
can<00:01:34.420> pour<00:01:34.660> the<00:01:34.780> fertilizer<00:01:35.110> to<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:35.650> you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
can pour the fertilizer to it and you

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.890 
can pour the fertilizer to it and you
can<00:01:36.370> actually<00:01:36.760> feed<00:01:37.000> it<00:01:37.150> right<00:01:37.390> at<00:01:37.510> that<00:01:37.630> at

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
can actually feed it right at that at

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.080 
can actually feed it right at that at
that<00:01:38.340> critical<00:01:39.340> time<00:01:39.370> where<00:01:39.850> it's<00:01:39.940> actually

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
that critical time where it's actually

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.560 
that critical time where it's actually
going<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.480> grow<00:01:41.910> faster<00:01:42.910> you're<00:01:43.030> gonna<00:01:43.090> fill

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
going to grow faster you're gonna fill

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.850 
going to grow faster you're gonna fill
your<00:01:43.690> ear<00:01:43.900> you're<00:01:44.140> gonna<00:01:44.230> maximize<00:01:44.740> your

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
your ear you're gonna maximize your

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.110 
your ear you're gonna maximize your
potential<00:01:46.710> well<00:01:47.710> that's<00:01:48.220> exactly<00:01:48.400> it<00:01:48.730> we

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
potential well that's exactly it we

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.820 
potential well that's exactly it we
actually<00:01:49.510> take<00:01:49.750> some<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.170> gamble<00:01:50.560> out<00:01:50.710> of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
actually take some of the gamble out of

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.170 
actually take some of the gamble out of
them<00:01:50.920> because<00:01:51.040> if<00:01:51.400> what<00:01:51.550> you<00:01:51.640> do<00:01:51.760> is<00:01:51.850> put<00:01:52.060> on

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
them because if what you do is put on

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.580 
them because if what you do is put on
all<00:01:52.450> your<00:01:52.690> fertilizer<00:01:53.080> right<00:01:53.380> at<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.560> very

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
all your fertilizer right at the very

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.860 
all your fertilizer right at the very
beginning<00:01:53.860> of<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.310> year<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:55.270> then<00:01:55.480> you<00:01:55.630> don't

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
beginning of the year and then you don't

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.540 
beginning of the year and then you don't
have<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.290> right<00:01:56.560> environmental<00:01:57.130> conditions

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
have the right environmental conditions

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.270 
have the right environmental conditions
to<00:01:57.729> actually<00:01:58.060> take<00:01:58.690> advantage<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:59.410> that<00:01:59.710> which

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
to actually take advantage of that which

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.160 
to actually take advantage of that which
we<00:02:00.550> happen<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.880> have<00:02:01.060> happened<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.900> us<00:02:01.990> this

that input cost and you're doing it with

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.510 
that input cost and you're doing it with
an<00:02:34.720> injection<00:02:35.050> toolbar<00:02:35.620> that's<00:02:36.160> going<00:02:36.459> to
