00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
riding straight in front I think I do

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.460 
riding straight in front I think I do
yeah<00:06:47.760> and<00:06:48.760> I<00:06:49.360> just<00:06:49.630> fly<00:06:49.900> right<00:06:49.960> down<00:06:50.350> the

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
yeah and I just fly right down the

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.920 
yeah and I just fly right down the
middle<00:06:50.500> here<00:06:50.800> I<00:06:51.340> just<00:06:52.210> keep<00:06:52.540> making<00:06:52.690> these

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
middle here I just keep making these

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:59.970 
middle here I just keep making these
ties<00:06:57.300> right<00:06:58.300> and<00:06:58.540> if<00:06:58.930> Danny<00:06:59.230> is<00:06:59.500> gonna<00:06:59.770> want

00:06:59.970 --> 00:06:59.980 
ties right and if Danny is gonna want

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.380 
ties right and if Danny is gonna want
this<00:07:00.130> shorter<00:07:00.550> so<00:07:00.730> we're<00:07:00.850> gonna<00:07:00.940> cut<00:07:01.180> it<00:07:01.210> off

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:01.390 
this shorter so we're gonna cut it off

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.690 
this shorter so we're gonna cut it off
in<00:07:01.600> a<00:07:01.660> few<00:07:01.690> minutes<00:07:02.169> but<00:07:02.410> it's<00:07:02.890> a<00:07:02.980> good<00:07:03.100> idea<00:07:03.190> to

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700 
in a few minutes but it's a good idea to

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.550 
in a few minutes but it's a good idea to
start<00:07:04.360> making<00:07:04.570> the<00:07:04.750> ties<00:07:07.110> we<00:07:08.110> can<00:07:08.260> make<00:07:08.380> your

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 
start making the ties we can make your

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.090 
start making the ties we can make your
shorter<00:07:10.320> it's<00:07:11.320> a<00:07:11.350> good<00:07:11.470> idea<00:07:11.560> to<00:07:11.710> make<00:07:11.980> the

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.100 
shorter it's a good idea to make the

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.740 
shorter it's a good idea to make the
ties<00:07:12.310> person<00:07:12.850> decide<00:07:13.090> how<00:07:13.210> long<00:07:13.240> you<00:07:13.419> want<00:07:13.540> it

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
ties person decide how long you want it

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.659 
ties person decide how long you want it
so<00:07:13.930> Danny<00:07:14.110> is<00:07:14.350> that<00:07:14.590> about<00:07:15.040> where<00:07:15.280> you<00:07:15.400> want<00:07:15.580> or

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:15.669 
so Danny is that about where you want or

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:16.770 
so Danny is that about where you want or
do<00:07:15.760> you<00:07:15.850> think<00:07:16.000> you<00:07:16.060> might<00:07:16.210> want<00:07:16.390> one<00:07:16.419> more

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:16.780
