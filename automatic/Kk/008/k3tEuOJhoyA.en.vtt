00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 I want 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.440
 well this is a pretty process 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.010
 extensive very serious with a methodology 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.689
 defined internationally where 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.369
 really the customers to sell 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:20.860
 require the creators of the tests 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.340
 there are pleasures that do not have that 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.220
 really defined model a test 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.039
 It can be spent between one year and two years 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.529
 in its realization from a definition 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.750
 conceptual that you want to evaluate some 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.730
 pilot applications to normative groups 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.280
 a statistical assessment of those 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.829
 results and as such then a 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.739
 product that has been tested and validated 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.360
 with many people of different type 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.900
 population to be able to make inferences 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.910
 as such that is a process that demands 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.510
 a series of different professionals 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.780
 from statistical experts psychologists 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.520
 in the uncertain professional content 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.610
 of the medium that have a lot of experience 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.520
 to value them with the concepts and 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.740
 also a valuation exercise 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.920
 later is to say that good people 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.170
 performance really have a difference 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.600
 in the test in our model of 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.090
 work in which we differ is that 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.680
 we evaluate the people of greater 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.000
 performance be the one with the talent 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.040
 natural to do 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.380
 a role and that generates a level of 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.840
 quite important discrimination for 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.940
 the final result is increasingly more 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.860
 evaluate competencies and talents that is 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:38.320
 as what comes in terms of management 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.720
 human and human talent as how 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.640
 work model 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.640
 and those characteristics are very 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.720
 focused on cognitive ability in 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.230
 the mental capacity 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.720
 and the ability to produce results 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.700
 our country is very well really to 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.380
 level of Latin America in fact us 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.680
 We are market leaders in 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.090
 Latin America and we have presence in 12 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.920
 countries as such and that condition we 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.619
 positions and gives us there is a 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.810
 right to say that our way of 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.880
 doing things has an impact on 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.740
 other type of territories and it's very well 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.990
 valued good the most used that 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.150
 we have are the buy that is 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.420
 a test to assess competencies in 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.100
 its plus version that allows us 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.780
 customize each company sel 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.360
 according to your needs according 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.100
 with his role with his powers 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.490
 companies with their skills of 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.080
 charge with their leadership competencies 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.140
 that is one of the most used we have

 and also the service evaluations 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.930
 the customer 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.890
 the evaluations oriented towards 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.750
 commercial area towards sales too 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.060
 they are very used in our case 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.640
 punctually eros mouth 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.330
 dix that are the most recognized and most 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.330
 used in the country
