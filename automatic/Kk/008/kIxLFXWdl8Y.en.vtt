 in the area bringing you more 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.170
 a free for all gameplay but no 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.930
 I came in to make three and you 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.059
 remember that update of that pet 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.120
 with the balancing of weapons that 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.660
 been done it is good to launch a 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.579
 improvement in six weapons since it is 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.950
 I'm bringing you business here. 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.950
 had promised not to bring a 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.770
 gameplay of each class speaking is not the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.350
 the best you had in this gameplay today 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.690
 I'm bringing you here. 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:05.090
 at pm it's 9 pm she's an arminha poxa mine 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.500
 Mom to play, people are serious about this. 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.380
 weird line 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.260
 I do not know why she loved it very strange 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.220
 even after balancing I say 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.920
 for you huh 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.240
 She was a little chatty. 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.990
 a means that she is trip a little friend 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.320
 hampers it but has suspects of 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.780
 talking to her knows why she has 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.640
 the best fire clip of all sub 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.310
 marches of all assault rifles 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.280
 rifai galera like that skill 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.590
 you shoot without the aim of course 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.680
 if you have I'm using this 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.399
 It will improve a lot for you to have 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.909
 precision but the best riff fire is the 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.990
 on this one I'm playing there at 9 pm 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.500
 my mother 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.960
 he played and gave a song right there though 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.509
 This rick I'll do when you take off 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.759
 I will not remember if the blood and I 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.179
 I do this but it's very good. 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.370
 excellent is kind was equals with mp 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.010
 it is also certain that mp 7 plus a 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.140
 very good friend of her and her long week 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.500
 short distance rip fly 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.489
 mp7 is also almost perfect then 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.680
 that is mine is also very good to be 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.510
 move is not worth your try 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.350
 I told you I will not tell you to stay 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.799
 using it got a good one because it knows 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.650
 on the roller I 've never seen those 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.850
 things are not playing well and do not 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.840
 have guns 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.510
 because it has weapons 2 the only advantage of it 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.630
 is playing fair with rifai because 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.330
 she has a fire yields a rate of 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.549
 very high shots to is almost the same type 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.280
 to failure the battery very fast 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.519
 and there you have some advantage it is as if 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:05.489
 you had put 11 rapid fire in the 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:07.530
 87 they already have that interest is to have 9 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.440
 She's already like a rap the fire. 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.049
 along with her that the rate of her shots 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.329
 It's very very very high and it's not too 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.910
 do not go to the name of the nominee in europe 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.220
 with her because guys come from all that 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.870
 It's on the side you have to stay because it's a 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.720
 good way not to miss the shot because 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.799
 If you missed it already, you did not have it. 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.630
 chance 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.959
 now the next I do not know if it will give 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.280
 time to speak what I wanted to talk more 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.959
 It's the following to play the free for all. 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.880
 are some tips that I can give a 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.859
 Basic tip so I'll just give you a tip 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.700
 today that the video is not a very 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.340
 long 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.130
 you can not talk too much tire and also the 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.170
 he has his funeral al joufra a 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.930
 without technique and without strategy 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.079
 no really he has no strategy 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.900
 or free for all, but football has 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.660
 a lot of technique is different technique of 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.430
 strategy understood strategy are 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.110
 skills that you involve more than 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.600
 player kicking example 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.670
 when you play poorly at a type of game 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.680
 timing is then yes you have to have 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.080
 strategy that depends on their teams 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.760
 your customers' players in one 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.739
 bar when you play individually 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.750
 the team has to prevail 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.269
 technique your personal ability 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.040
 an example is his worldwide knowledge 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.860
 the Spanish of the map 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.610
 decorate one or two respawns when you 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.800
 die 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.250
 Where are you born from, you 're going to give 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.800
 support and try to decorate from 80 see more 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.440
 less where is that answer you give and 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.169
 is located on the map and is always 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.820
 covering the responsibilities you can see 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.390
 if you want to watch the video of 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.960
 new 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.240
 Watch and watch where I'm staying. 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.919
 moving me on the map I do not 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.280
 entire map was running a cigarette holder 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.110
 I fixed it on the spot understood and stay in it 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.750
 defending this place I said that a 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.880
 Only escape I only had an escape that the dino 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.680
 bad practice of a lap because it was 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.380
 taking very same enemy in the same 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.690
 location is there and is not connected is that it has 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.840
 some guy got out of the car he will have under 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.810
 so take a new route is going to take 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.979
 water in the bathroom also what does not work 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.040
 but you have to take a turtleneck on the other hand 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.080
 just to give a disguise myself and back 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.360
 same place and goes time marking 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.150
 territory you do not have as if it were 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.600
 mark their territory and defend their 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.940
 territory is the technique I use 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.770
 No, I particularly spoke if you 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.780
 you want to play in another way you do not have 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.660
 No problem at all is that it is 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.060
 We are exchanging experience here but I 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.860
 I'm doing this and kept running that 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.050
 territory and I do not become world champion 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.450
 For God's sake, people 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.330
 pieces and champion he already gave what 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.560
 Talk on the galley already gave the opinion these 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.020
 things that operate and I do not think 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.580
 No cooperation in this video I do not know 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.750
 speak the champion for this video 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.660
 My love, I do not know what I have to 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.570
 doing is good but it stayed cool 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.270
 And that's not what I'm going to bring to you in 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.169
 other more complete videos more tips 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.200
 of the professional 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:10.440
 The basic tip is this try to mark 12 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.539
 sticks next to each other in sinaes and 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.000
 try to give a circled around cover 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.630
 in those respawn leave and I am sure that 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.330
 you go 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.550
 It is a better performance you will at 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.530
 less will die - why are you going? 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.330
 take care of your location and not 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.250
 worrying about the whole map because 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.030
 It's not like you give the map. 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.870
 all in 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:33.950
 but overall the mp is ending already 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:36.410
 I wanted to thank you guys or the 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:39.120
 participation in you are watching 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.740
 the video wanted to ask you 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.120
 video do not let their 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.560
 comments you found suggestions 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.780
 Anything Any Hint Any 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.970
 thing you want to talk about is the 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.670
 willingness and appreciation of the 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.350
 helps to publicize the channel and there 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.750
 bit by bit that I do not do 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.210
 30/0 it comes the last wire 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:03.000
 I do not know what I did or was trying to turn me 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.640
 end up dying but anyway what's good is there 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.610
 bring you the information of pm 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.420
 nine and it's also this basic tip I said 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.400
 for you 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.590

 by your disposition, stick to the 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:22.440
 want to leave a comment to the 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:27.500
 variation and I'll see you until the next 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.500
