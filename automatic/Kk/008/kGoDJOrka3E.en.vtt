got all these holes skeletonizing holds

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.440 
got all these holes skeletonizing holds
even<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:21.180> one<00:01:21.240> I

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
even up in here and then this one I

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.200 
even up in here and then this one I
guess<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.960> technically<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.530> lanyard<00:01:22.830> hole<00:01:23.210> but

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
guess is technically a lanyard hole but

guess is technically a lanyard hole but
they<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.630> serve<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.930> same<00:01:25.110> purpose<00:01:25.740> of

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
they all serve the same purpose of

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.050 
they all serve the same purpose of
cutting<00:01:26.820> down<00:01:27.000> wait<00:01:27.350> it's<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:28.729> slim<00:01:29.729> nice

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
cutting down wait it's a very slim nice

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.780 
cutting down wait it's a very slim nice
and<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:31.470> these<00:01:31.650> holes<00:01:31.860> drilled<00:01:32.340> through<00:01:32.549> it

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
and with these holes drilled through it

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.179 
and with these holes drilled through it
it<00:01:33.119> weighs<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.170> at<00:01:34.320> about<00:01:34.700> 2.3<00:01:35.700> 4<00:01:35.729> ounces<00:01:37.189> you
