00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.379
 Head of my dear colleagues 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.080
 Colleagues welcome to the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.820
 second name experience days this 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.439
 This year it will be in the future 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.500
 many more will come 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.990
 the motto followed was experience days 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.720
 cover and experience and in which 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.120
 they want the whole thing together 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.380
 bring closer to the world 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.380
 I guess that distinguishes hamann 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.730
 is that it is a company year 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.500
 it is very versatile 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.780
 areas on the way I think that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.450
 Here you can take advantage of that 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.950
 just a lot of areas have their own 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.739
 But then they make experiences 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.739
 in turn led each other 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.760
 next to us poor for what we stand for 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.450
 we for performance and for products 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.520
 to offer 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.650
 because you are when you work somewhere 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.930
 also a relation to the products of the 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.780
 Building a company is one thing the other 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.310
 live to inform about the 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.170
 Entry possibilities us about the job 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.540
 possibilities here in straubing but 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.760
 my ulm in munich and also entered 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.830
 that is times we have the products in the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.070
 area of lifestyle that means im 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.170
 audio entertainment products the fun 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.880
 make use of the home can you 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.340
 can use this on the road in the car 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.450
 find the more information before 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.190
 but the thing above all things 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.650
 give entertainment and here we are 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.160
 Of course in absolute terms a premium 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.110
 Area 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.430
 What I noticed is what 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.070
 I liked and me too 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.380
 Surprised that was the matter with the 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.000
 you have a lot of active sound management 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.920
 So there are noises from the vehicle 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.670
 Today brings out engines 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.990
 sound different 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.190
 and I loved that and I knew 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.020
 not that hamann in this area 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.520
 make is this look into the future 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.100
 and then you realize that the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.380
 future own reality is everything 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:11.420
 possible is mobile service in the car and 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:13.069
 So I'm really excited, I think 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.470
 very important point is already quality 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.319
 because otherwise the big German would 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.630
 Premium manufacturers are not all unanimous 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.760
 quasi just cooperate with one of our 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.050
 customers in the infotainment area and in 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.240
 Burns audio counting range 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.690
 for example, the top carmakers 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.390
 like daimler bmw audi porsche ferrari 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.069
 hyundai have many more 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.930
 that is definitely in 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.520
 unique feature for us too for 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.160
 every purse 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.010
 It is very important for that 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.720
 today's cars but also for that something 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.320
 more affordable than it is for everyone 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.020
 something 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.880
 the success of our company in 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.530
 sum comes across all divisions 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.600
 but from our co-workers we have 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.820
 very motivated employees 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.160
 experienced staff very much 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.380
 bring expertise to our products 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.240
 accordingly, we owe the success 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.390
 sustainable the competence of ours 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.390
 Employee 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.710
 I think you were just on one 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.600
 very very high quality level great 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.000
 products in an extremely short time 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.950
 we can realize always say here 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.320
 The product ultimately emerges 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.200
 inspire the customer what he has 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.420
 company noted they have a great deal 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.890
 experience with sound because i have with 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.390
 the people behind of the 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.700
 professional mixer technique 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.530
 spoken and there he says it is everything 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.660
 digital you can all wonderful west 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.790
 and adjusts but you always need 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.800
 not even here without a ticket and that 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.450
 is that one the company already out there so 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.620
 they have really great experience the 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.180
 you notice the products 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.700
 Of course we are very motivated 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.440
 fundamentally innovative ahead of others 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.590
 to always be ahead of our competitors 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.150
 better and innovative state of the art 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.370
 offer solutions to our customers 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.270
 You can stand for a company for me 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.950
 the a transfer of high tech and 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.320
 premium products to the masses and 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.600
 volume market creates and technological 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.420
 I think absolutely 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:12.190
 that's it, so we'll have it 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:14.170
 actually primarily navia hamann 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.810
 and otherwise I knew that many 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.060
 produce very modern products 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.920
 but only now really aware that 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.130
 the really world market leader in many 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.780
 areas and that actually 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.780
 not essential modern technology
