with the smell because it doesn't smell
as<00:00:36.630> good<00:00:36.899> as<00:00:37.250> some<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.579> old<00:00:40.730> herb<00:00:41.730> lessons

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
as good as some of the old herb lessons

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.100 
as good as some of the old herb lessons
products<00:00:43.640> however<00:00:44.640> I'm<00:00:45.059> really<00:00:45.120> pleased<00:00:45.899> with

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
products however I'm really pleased with

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.229 
products however I'm really pleased with
the<00:00:46.260> results<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.800> give<00:00:46.980> gave<00:00:47.370> me<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.789> my<00:00:47.969> hair

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the results it give gave me on my hair

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.729 
the results it give gave me on my hair
it<00:00:48.899> made<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.340> smooth<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.239> shiny<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.170> really

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
it made it so smooth so shiny I really

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.590 
it made it so smooth so shiny I really
like<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.190> new<00:00:53.340> formula<00:00:54.050> it's<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.500> soft<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
like the new formula it's so soft and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.670 
like the new formula it's so soft and
the<00:00:57.710> only<00:00:58.850> bad<00:00:59.850> thing<00:01:00.359> about<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.109> formula<00:01:01.530> is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the only bad thing about the formula is

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.310 
the only bad thing about the formula is
that<00:01:01.920> when<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.129> dry<00:01:02.430> my<00:01:02.640> hair<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.390> always<00:01:03.899> blow

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
that when I dry my hair I always blow

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.370 
that when I dry my hair I always blow
dry<00:01:04.500> my<00:01:04.559> hair<00:01:05.150> because<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.299> wash<00:01:06.900> my<00:01:07.080> hair<00:01:07.260> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
dry my hair because I wash my hair and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.500 
dry my hair because I wash my hair and
then<00:01:07.500> at<00:01:07.770> nighttime<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.610> can't<00:01:09.090> go<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.330> bed

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
then at nighttime and I can't go to bed

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.590 
then at nighttime and I can't go to bed
with<00:01:09.900> wet<00:01:10.350> or<00:01:10.650> damp<00:01:10.860> hair<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.850> makes<00:01:12.090> my<00:01:12.330> hair

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
with wet or damp hair it makes my hair

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.310 
with wet or damp hair it makes my hair
go<00:01:12.810> very<00:01:13.229> poufy<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.850> get<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> lot<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:16.049> volume

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
go very poufy so I get a lot of volume

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.999 
go very poufy so I get a lot of volume
and<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.009> mean<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.520> lot<00:01:17.880> not<00:01:18.840> even<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.470> nice

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
and I mean a lot not even like the nice

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.210 
and I mean a lot not even like the nice
amount<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.520> volume<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.960> can't<00:01:22.650> get<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:23.009> house

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
amount of volume but I can't get a house

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
amount of volume but I can't get a house
kind<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.729> volume<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.420> even<00:01:24.600> after<00:01:25.049> sleeping

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
kind of volume and even after sleeping

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.050 
kind of volume and even after sleeping
on<00:01:25.530> my<00:01:25.680> hair<00:01:25.920> once<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:27.380> still<00:01:28.380> had<00:01:28.820> quite<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> lot

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
on my hair once I still had quite a lot

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.289 
on my hair once I still had quite a lot
of<00:01:30.090> volume<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.130> I<00:01:32.130> guess<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:32.640> okay<00:01:35.299> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
of volume so I guess that's okay the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.999 
of volume so I guess that's okay the
shampoos<00:01:36.720> formula<00:01:37.170> has<00:01:37.320> changed<00:01:37.799> because

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
shampoos formula has changed because

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.539 
shampoos formula has changed because
it's<00:01:38.430> now<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> very<00:01:39.390> creamy<00:01:39.810> consistency<00:01:40.770> now

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
it's now a very creamy consistency now

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.210 
it's now a very creamy consistency now
if<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.030> don't<00:01:42.150> believe<00:01:42.299> me<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:43.500> bottle<00:01:44.009> is

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
if you don't believe me this bottle is

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.039 
if you don't believe me this bottle is
actually<00:01:44.570> clear<00:01:45.920> they<00:01:46.920> look<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.430> same<00:01:47.640> right

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
actually clear they look the same right

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.100 
actually clear they look the same right
they<00:01:49.049> don't<00:01:49.200> look<00:01:49.530> like<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> cream

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
they don't look like this is the cream

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.209 
they don't look like this is the cream
and<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.290> not<00:01:52.619> both<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.670> these<00:01:53.820> are<00:01:54.240> pink

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
and this is not both of these are pink

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.550 
and this is not both of these are pink
formulas<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.689> I<00:01:57.689> think<00:01:57.990> that's<00:01:58.170> really<00:01:58.409> nice

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
formulas and I think that's really nice

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.319 
formulas and I think that's really nice
cuz<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.950> matches<00:01:59.310> with<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.520> little<00:01:59.759> pink<00:01:59.909> bottle

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
cuz it matches with a little pink bottle

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.200 
cuz it matches with a little pink bottle
but<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.719> doesn't<00:02:01.079> really<00:02:01.259> matter<00:02:01.530> because

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
but it doesn't really matter because

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.389 
but it doesn't really matter because
they're<00:02:03.210> both<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.780> pink<00:02:04.290> bottles<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.280> it

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
they're both in pink bottles so it

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.770 
they're both in pink bottles so it
doesn't<00:02:05.700> matter<00:02:05.820> what<00:02:06.000> color<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.450> product

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
doesn't matter what color the product

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.300 
doesn't matter what color the product
comes<00:02:06.960> out<00:02:07.110> as<00:02:07.350> long<00:02:07.530> as<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.799> works<00:02:07.950> that's

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
comes out as long as it works that's

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.250 
comes out as long as it works that's
what<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.580> think<00:02:09.289> but<00:02:10.289> it's<00:02:10.440> just<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.709> little

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
what I think but it's just a little

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.690 
what I think but it's just a little
should<00:02:11.439> get<00:02:11.620> Mik<00:02:11.799> they<00:02:12.099> could<00:02:12.250> probably<00:02:12.370> take

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
should get Mik they could probably take

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.970 
should get Mik they could probably take
that<00:02:12.819> out<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.299> would<00:02:13.420> work<00:02:13.629> fine<00:02:14.170> the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
that out and it would work fine the

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.220 
that out and it would work fine the
other<00:02:15.159> thing<00:02:15.489> is<00:02:15.700> if<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.120> want<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.019> use<00:02:17.200> a

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
other thing is if you want to use a

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.660 
other thing is if you want to use a

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
different conditioner to a different

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.020 
different conditioner to a different

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
shampoo they will still fit and fit

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.380 
shampoo they will still fit and fit
together<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:23.200> everything<00:02:23.680> on<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.670> back<00:02:24.939> you

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
together and everything on the back you

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.220 
together and everything on the back you
have<00:02:25.599> these<00:02:25.870> little<00:02:27.239> they<00:02:28.239> say<00:02:28.450> herbal<00:02:29.019> head

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
have these little they say herbal head

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.210 
have these little they say herbal head
game<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:30.370> asks<00:02:30.849> you<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.060> question<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:32.220> both

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
game it asks you a question on both

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.220 
game it asks you a question on both
bottles<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.970> then<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.299> answers<00:02:34.840> are<00:02:35.200> on

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
bottles and then the answers are on

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.740 
bottles and then the answers are on
opposite<00:02:35.860> bottles<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.090> either<00:02:37.390> have<00:02:37.540> to

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
opposite bottles so you either have to

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.899 
opposite bottles so you either have to
buy<00:02:38.200> or<00:02:38.560> even<00:02:38.859> look<00:02:39.159> at<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.819> opposite<00:02:40.799> bottle

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
buy or even look at the opposite bottle

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.670 
buy or even look at the opposite bottle
to<00:02:42.909> fight<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.480> get<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.900> answer<00:02:44.290> if<00:02:44.409> you<00:02:44.530> buy

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
to fight to get the answer if you buy

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.949 
to fight to get the answer if you buy
two<00:02:44.739> different<00:02:45.310> range<00:02:45.549> of<00:02:45.760> products<00:02:46.209> then<00:02:46.629> you

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
two different range of products then you

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.530 
two different range of products then you
won't<00:02:47.590> get<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.220> answers<00:02:48.670> if<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.239> makes

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
won't get the answers if that makes

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.479 
won't get the answers if that makes
sense<00:02:49.659> but<00:02:50.260> that's<00:02:50.470> only<00:02:50.769> a<00:02:50.889> little<00:02:51.129> gimmick

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
sense but that's only a little gimmick

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.020 
sense but that's only a little gimmick
so<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.849> doesn't<00:02:52.150> really<00:02:52.269> matter<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:54.030> like

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
so it doesn't really matter so I like

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.940 
so it doesn't really matter so I like
the<00:02:55.329> shape<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.629> these<00:02:55.840> bottles<00:02:56.319> they're

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
the shape of these bottles they're

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.780 
the shape of these bottles they're
really<00:02:57.250> nice

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
really nice

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.069 
really nice
I<00:02:57.819> think<00:02:58.569> these<00:02:58.900> lids<00:02:59.379> are<00:03:00.340> these<00:03:00.840> ones<00:03:01.840> with

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
I think these lids are these ones with

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.190 
I think these lids are these ones with
the<00:03:02.109> little<00:03:02.319> holes<00:03:02.620> at<00:03:02.859> the<00:03:02.920> front<00:03:03.159> there<00:03:04.200> okay

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
the little holes at the front there okay

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.589 
the little holes at the front there okay
I<00:03:06.359> think<00:03:07.359> I<00:03:07.659> liked<00:03:08.109> the<00:03:08.379> caps<00:03:08.680> before<00:03:09.069> and<00:03:09.790> this

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
I think I liked the caps before and this

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.800 
I think I liked the caps before and this
is<00:03:10.720> probably<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:11.079> little<00:03:11.109> plastic<00:03:11.620> waster<00:03:12.810> but

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
is probably a little plastic waster but

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.689 
is probably a little plastic waster but
that's<00:03:14.799> okay<00:03:15.579> I<00:03:16.199> don't<00:03:17.199> like<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:18.220> shampoo

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:18.699 
that's okay I don't like the shampoo

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.839 
that's okay I don't like the shampoo
bottle<00:03:18.879> stored<00:03:19.629> up<00:03:20.109> right<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.680> prefer<00:03:21.489> its<00:03:21.669> do

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
bottle stored up right I prefer its do

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.629 
bottle stored up right I prefer its do
it<00:03:21.940> upside<00:03:22.299> down<00:03:22.329> like<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:23.109> conditioner<00:03:23.709> so

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
it upside down like the conditioner so

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.210 
it upside down like the conditioner so
that<00:03:24.849> kind<00:03:25.209> of<00:03:25.329> sucks<00:03:25.660> because<00:03:25.959> if<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:27.040> have

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
that kind of sucks because if you have

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.069 
that kind of sucks because if you have
upside<00:03:27.639> down<00:03:27.849> then<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:28.299> can<00:03:28.329> squeeze<00:03:28.750> out<00:03:28.900> the

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
upside down then you can squeeze out the

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.110 
upside down then you can squeeze out the
shampoo<00:03:29.470> easier<00:03:29.949> then<00:03:30.699> if<00:03:30.819> you<00:03:30.940> have<00:03:31.090> it

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
shampoo easier then if you have it

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.080 
shampoo easier then if you have it
upright<00:03:31.569> then<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:31.930> have<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.139> tip<00:03:32.349> upside<00:03:32.769> down

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
upright then you have to tip upside down

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.979 
upright then you have to tip upside down
etc<00:03:34.090> etc<00:03:34.239> so<00:03:35.430> yeah<00:03:36.430> that's<00:03:37.150> not<00:03:37.389> so<00:03:37.449> great<00:03:37.870> with

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
etc etc so yeah that's not so great with

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.000 
etc etc so yeah that's not so great with
that<00:03:39.180> but<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.510> don't<00:03:41.230> care<00:03:41.470> because<00:03:41.500> the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
that but I don't care because the
