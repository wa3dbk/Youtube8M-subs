part of the plant name is capitalized

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.870 
part of the plant name is capitalized
and<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.810> tells<00:01:28.050> us<00:01:28.260> the<00:01:28.440> kind<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.890> plant<00:01:29.160> or<00:01:29.400> the

something<00:01:34.230> about<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.680> plant<00:01:35.160> maybe<00:01:35.940> where<00:01:36.300> it

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
something about the plant maybe where it

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.660 
something about the plant maybe where it
comes<00:01:36.630> from<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:37.260> who<00:01:37.470> discovered<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.160> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
comes from or who discovered it the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.660 
comes from or who discovered it the
color<00:01:38.910> and<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.800> red<00:01:40.800> valerian<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
color and so on red valerian is a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.870

nickname it's in the same family as true
valerian<00:01:45.390> sort<00:01:45.900> of<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.140> chihuahuas<00:01:46.710> poodles

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
valerian sort of like chihuahuas poodles

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
animals though now true valerian is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.750 
animals though now true valerian is
actually<00:01:54.150> named<00:01:54.450> valerian<00:01:55.140> its<00:01:56.130> first<00:01:56.460> name

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
actually named valerian its first name

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.990 
actually named valerian its first name
latin<00:01:57.300> name<00:01:57.480> is<00:01:57.690> valerian<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:59.430> has

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.490 
officinalis as the second part of its
name<00:02:02.610> now<00:02:02.850> do<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.540> remember<00:02:03.690> that<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.170> second

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
name now do you remember that the second

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.290 
name now do you remember that the second
word<00:02:04.620> tells<00:02:04.950> us<00:02:05.130> something<00:02:05.370> about<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.060> plant

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
word tells us something about the plant

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.509 
word tells us something about the plant
well<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.320> tells<00:02:07.530> us<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.800> this<00:02:08.160> plant

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
well here it tells us that this plant

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.570 
well here it tells us that this plant
was<00:02:08.729> used<00:02:09.119> officially<00:02:09.899> as<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.710> medicinal<00:02:11.100> herb

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
was used officially as a medicinal herb

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.520 
was used officially as a medicinal herb
or<00:02:11.820> an<00:02:12.000> apothecary<00:02:12.690> plant

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
or an apothecary plant

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.260 
or an apothecary plant
now<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:15.590> can<00:02:15.800> see<00:02:16.010> how<00:02:16.160> some<00:02:16.490> plants<00:02:16.880> might<00:02:17.090> be

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
now you can see how some plants might be

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.420 
now you can see how some plants might be
confused<00:02:17.690> with<00:02:17.810> others<00:02:18.140> leaves<00:02:18.890> may<00:02:19.220> look

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
confused with others leaves may look

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.070 
confused with others leaves may look
similar<00:02:19.700> but<00:02:20.090> if<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.300> know<00:02:20.420> those<00:02:20.600> few<00:02:20.870> things

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
similar but if you know those few things

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.020 
similar but if you know those few things
to<00:02:21.350> watch<00:02:21.470> for<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:22.220> can<00:02:22.400> learn<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.670> tell<00:02:22.850> them

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
to watch for you can learn to tell them

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.690 
to watch for you can learn to tell them
apart<00:02:23.120> pretty<00:02:23.540> easily<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:24.350> can<00:02:25.280> look<00:02:25.460> at<00:02:25.580> your

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
apart pretty easily you can look at your

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.060 
apart pretty easily you can look at your
leaves<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.210> see<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.660> margins<00:02:27.140> or<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.650> edges

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
leaves and see the margins or the edges

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.010 
leaves and see the margins or the edges
of<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.340> leaves<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:29.390> can<00:02:29.570> see<00:02:29.780> if<00:02:29.870> they

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
of the leaves and you can see if they

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.980 
of the leaves and you can see if they
have<00:02:30.170> teeth<00:02:30.470> if<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:31.340> edges<00:02:31.670> are<00:02:31.700> rounded<00:02:32.030> wavy

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
have teeth if the edges are rounded wavy

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.220 
have teeth if the edges are rounded wavy
or<00:02:33.110> smooth<00:02:33.650> those<00:02:34.070> are<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:35.300> margins<00:02:35.570> remember

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
or smooth those are the margins remember

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.170 
or smooth those are the margins remember
you<00:02:36.800> can<00:02:36.950> also<00:02:37.100> look<00:02:37.370> at<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.610> textures<00:02:38.030> of<00:02:38.060> the

them and find out except stinging nettle

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.210 
them and find out except stinging nettle
that<00:02:46.820> one<00:02:46.970> really<00:02:47.180> hurts<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:48.500> take<00:02:48.860> a<00:02:48.890> look<00:02:49.100> at

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
that one really hurts and take a look at

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.710 
that one really hurts and take a look at
the<00:02:49.310> way<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.580> veins<00:02:49.850> run<00:02:50.210> through<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.540> leaves

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
the way the veins run through the leaves

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.250 
the way the veins run through the leaves
you<00:02:51.020> might<00:02:51.470> find<00:02:51.709> that<00:02:52.070> some<00:02:52.970> veins<00:02:53.510> start<00:02:54.020> at

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
you might find that some veins start at

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.410 
you might find that some veins start at
the<00:02:54.410> stem<00:02:54.740> or<00:02:54.980> petiole<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.700> they<00:02:56.030> run<00:02:56.270> the

the stem or petiole and they run the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.920 
the stem or petiole and they run the
entire<00:02:56.780> length<00:02:57.050> of<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.320> leaf<00:02:57.680> while<00:02:58.520> other

entire length of the leaf while other

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.510 
entire length of the leaf while other
plants<00:02:59.930> have<00:03:00.080> veins<00:03:00.380> that<00:03:00.590> branch<00:03:00.920> out<00:03:01.130> across
