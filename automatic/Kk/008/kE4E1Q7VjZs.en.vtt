00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
as higher coaster because I can before I

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.460 
as higher coaster because I can before I
leap<00:05:37.200> before<00:05:37.470> leaving<00:05:37.860> because<00:05:38.220> I<00:05:39.180> was<00:05:39.720> really

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
leap before leaving because I was really

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.560 
leap before leaving because I was really
running<00:05:40.680> out<00:05:40.889> of<00:05:40.949> time<00:05:41.250> and<00:05:41.310> when<00:05:41.669> I<00:05:41.699> started

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
running out of time and when I started

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.230 
running out of time and when I started
this<00:05:42.720> game<00:05:42.930> but<00:05:43.710> it's<00:05:44.130> not<00:05:44.280> like<00:05:44.460> my<00:05:44.940> team<00:05:45.120> were

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
this game but it's not like my team were

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.560 
this game but it's not like my team were
losing<00:05:45.570> we're<00:05:45.780> winning<00:05:46.080> by<00:05:47.030> nine<00:05:48.030> points<00:05:48.330> so

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
losing we're winning by nine points so

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.670 
losing we're winning by nine points so
not<00:05:48.720> that<00:05:48.750> many<00:05:48.960> I<00:05:49.050> think<00:05:49.289> we<00:05:49.350> were<00:05:49.470> getting

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
not that many I think we were getting

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.310 
not that many I think we were getting
