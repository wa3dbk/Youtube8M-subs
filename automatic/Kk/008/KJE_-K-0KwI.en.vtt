00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
bit more about this tweak so we're

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.840 
bit more about this tweak so we're
starting<00:00:34.690> to<00:00:35.050> rotate<00:00:35.440> our<00:00:35.649> device<00:00:36.010> around<00:00:36.489> and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
starting to rotate our device around and

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.819 
starting to rotate our device around and
it's<00:00:36.969> going<00:00:37.120> north<00:00:37.629> south<00:00:38.079> east<00:00:38.350> and<00:00:38.739> west

all this or does it just points you in
the<00:00:44.679> right<00:00:44.829> direction<00:00:44.909> to<00:00:45.909> where<00:00:45.999> you<00:00:46.149> need<00:00:46.269> to

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
the right direction to where you need to

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.200

go for north south east and west which

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.910 
go for north south east and west which
is<00:00:49.359> kind<00:00:49.569> of<00:00:49.600> handy<00:00:49.870> a<00:00:49.899> beast<00:00:50.199> going<00:00:50.530> into<00:00:50.769> the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
is kind of handy a beast going into the

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.459 
is kind of handy a beast going into the
actual<00:00:51.190> compass<00:00:51.579> application<00:00:51.789> and<00:00:52.539> checking

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
actual compass application and checking

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.590 
actual compass application and checking
that<00:00:53.649> out<00:00:53.679> now<00:00:54.309> it<00:00:54.459> does<00:00:54.639> take<00:00:54.909> a<00:00:55.059> few<00:00:55.329> minutes

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
that out now it does take a few minutes

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.509 
that out now it does take a few minutes
to<00:00:55.870> actually<00:00:56.139> catch<00:00:56.379> up<00:00:56.649> whenever<00:00:57.010> you<00:00:57.190> simply

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
to actually catch up whenever you simply

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.639 
to actually catch up whenever you simply
slide<00:00:57.729> to<00:00:57.999> unlock<00:00:58.030> your<00:00:58.269> device<00:00:58.539> so<00:00:59.350> keep<00:00:59.619> that

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
slide to unlock your device so keep that

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.219 
slide to unlock your device so keep that
in<00:00:59.859> mind<00:01:00.219> as<00:01:00.459> well<00:01:00.789> that<00:01:00.819> if<00:01:01.629> sometimes<00:01:02.049> it

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
in mind as well that if sometimes it

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.170 
in mind as well that if sometimes it
doesn't<00:01:02.499> refresh<00:01:02.799> right<00:01:03.219> then<00:01:03.429> there<00:01:03.670> maybe

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
doesn't refresh right then there maybe

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.360 
doesn't refresh right then there maybe
you<00:01:04.360> need<00:01:04.510> to<00:01:04.540> do<00:01:04.750> a<00:01:04.780> write<00:01:05.110> spring<00:01:05.440> so<00:01:06.040> that<00:01:06.250> is

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
you need to do a write spring so that is

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.950 
you need to do a write spring so that is
one<00:01:06.610> of<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:06.790> other<00:01:06.940> problems<00:01:07.600> with<00:01:07.780> this

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
one of the other problems with this

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.960 
one of the other problems with this
tweak<00:01:08.290> it's<00:01:08.470> not<00:01:08.560> really<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:08.800> problem<00:01:09.040> but<00:01:09.760> just

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
tweak it's not really a problem but just

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.910 
tweak it's not really a problem but just
make<00:01:10.120> sure<00:01:10.150> you<00:01:10.450> be<00:01:10.600> aware<00:01:10.810> that<00:01:10.870> does<00:01:11.500> take<00:01:11.680> a

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
make sure you be aware that does take a

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.250 
make sure you be aware that does take a
few<00:01:12.220> minutes<00:01:12.460> actually<00:01:12.790> catch<00:01:13.180> up<00:01:13.390> with<00:01:14.080> your

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
few minutes actually catch up with your

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.470 
few minutes actually catch up with your
iOS<00:01:14.590> devices<00:01:14.950> compass<00:01:15.520> so<00:01:16.060> you're<00:01:16.210> doing<00:01:16.330> a

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
iOS devices compass so you're doing a

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.540 
iOS devices compass so you're doing a
few<00:01:16.630> options<00:01:16.840> within<00:01:17.380> settings<00:01:17.860> so<00:01:18.400> let's

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
few options within settings so let's

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.480 
few options within settings so let's
check<00:01:18.820> that<00:01:18.850> out<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:20.140> inside<00:01:20.560> erection<00:01:21.040> bar

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
check that out so inside erection bar

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.820 
check that out so inside erection bar
you<00:01:21.670> see<00:01:21.910> we<00:01:22.150> actually<00:01:22.450> have<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.690> icons<00:01:23.200> then

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
you see we actually have the icons then

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.770 
you see we actually have the icons then
we<00:01:23.920> got<00:01:24.100> more<00:01:24.310> composed<00:01:24.730> icons<00:01:25.270> where<00:01:25.540> we<00:01:25.660> can

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
we got more composed icons where we can

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.900 
we got more composed icons where we can
actually<00:01:25.810> atom<00:01:26.380> within<00:01:26.560> cydia<00:01:26.980> then<00:01:27.670> we<00:01:27.760> have

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
actually atom within cydia then we have

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.460 
actually atom within cydia then we have
respring<00:01:28.480> now<00:01:28.660> so<00:01:28.720> you<00:01:28.990> actually<00:01:29.170> have<00:01:29.320> to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
respring now so you actually have to

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.320 
respring now so you actually have to
respring<00:01:29.890> your<00:01:30.040> device<00:01:30.280> each<00:01:30.730> time<00:01:31.150> you<00:01:31.210> make

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
respring your device each time you make

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.810 
respring your device each time you make
a<00:01:31.600> change<00:01:31.630> within<00:01:32.590> Direction<00:01:33.400> bar<00:01:33.610> you<00:01:33.700> could

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
a change within Direction bar you could

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.560 
a change within Direction bar you could
follow<00:01:34.080> rudolph<00:01:35.130> 77<00:01:36.130> on<00:01:36.310> twitter<00:01:36.700> then<00:01:37.240> down

follow rudolph 77 on twitter then down

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.760 
follow rudolph 77 on twitter then down
here<00:01:37.600> we<00:01:37.840> actually<00:01:38.260> have<00:01:38.350> all<00:01:38.560> their

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770

different little themes that are added
within<00:01:40.660> Direction<00:01:41.650> bar<00:01:41.890> so<00:01:42.130> let's<00:01:42.280> go<00:01:42.460> ahead

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
within Direction bar so let's go ahead

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.730 
within Direction bar so let's go ahead
and<00:01:42.700> change<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.630> theme<00:01:43.990> here<00:01:44.020> so<00:01:44.380> we'll<00:01:44.440> just<00:01:44.650> do
