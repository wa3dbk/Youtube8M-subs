yeah so um yeah but I am holding and dry
and<00:00:23.789> let's<00:00:24.090> get<00:00:24.300> centered<00:00:27.680> so<00:00:28.680> first<00:00:29.340> we'll

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
and let's get centered so first we'll

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.720 
and let's get centered so first we'll
start<00:00:29.640> off<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.420> sponge<00:00:30.929> like<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:32.009> got

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
start off of a sponge like this I got

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.580 
start off of a sponge like this I got
this<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.030> dry<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:36.120> bacon<00:00:36.780> from<00:00:36.960> not

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
this on dry so and so the bacon from not

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.069 
this on dry so and so the bacon from not
okay<00:00:37.950> ah<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.059> not<00:00:39.210> find<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.809> middle

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
okay ah so this is not find the middle

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.430 
okay ah so this is not find the middle
of<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.829> sponge<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.820> then<00:00:42.420> just<00:00:42.719> going<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
of the sponge and then just going to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.930 
of the sponge and then just going to
slice<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:45.020> like<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.320> what<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.670> this

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
slice it like that what is like this

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.319 
slice it like that what is like this
with<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.660> Flex<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.440> get<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.610> slice<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
with the Flex to get in and I slice the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.979 
with the Flex to get in and I slice the
sponge<00:00:51.719> inside<00:00:52.140> -<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.770> don't<00:00:53.100> worry<00:00:54.090> if<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
sponge inside - I don't worry if the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.250 
sponge inside - I don't worry if the
round<00:00:55.920> part<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.690> blocking<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.989> across

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
round part is like blocking you across

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.790 
round part is like blocking you across
the<00:00:58.410> spongy<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.129> stretch<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.940> oh<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:01.680> one

real problem you can also like push this

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.950 
real problem you can also like push this
bunch<00:01:03.870> up<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.339> gonna<00:01:05.519> also<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> slicing

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
bunch up so it's gonna also be a slicing

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.640 
bunch up so it's gonna also be a slicing
motion<00:01:07.549> thanks<00:01:08.549> yeah<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:10.020> sliced<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
motion thanks yeah and it sliced a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.820 
motion thanks yeah and it sliced a
sponge<00:01:10.950> inside<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.530> once<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.400> um<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.560> that

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
sponge inside so once you um and if that

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.530 
sponge inside so once you um and if that
will<00:01:17.070> look<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.790> really<00:01:18.060> neat<00:01:18.119> line

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
will look like this I really neat line

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.310 
will look like this I really neat line
so<00:01:19.500> yeah<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:21.090> putting<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.810> sides<00:01:22.080> gonna

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
so yeah so putting on the sides gonna

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you can see that you crack it the front

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.010 
you can see that you crack it the front
part<00:01:31.860> will<00:01:32.009> open<00:01:32.430> any<00:01:32.909> one<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.509> open<00:01:33.960> up

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
part will open any one that you open up

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.190 
part will open any one that you open up
the<00:01:34.229> sponge<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.920> repair<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:37.170> just

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the sponge and repair it so you just

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.320 
the sponge and repair it so you just
take<00:01:37.740> some<00:01:38.070> tape

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
take some tape

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.710 
take some tape
what<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.170> i<00:01:40.230> rotate<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.640> let's<00:01:41.910> keep<00:01:42.270> up

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
what do i rotate and as let's keep up

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.270 
what do i rotate and as let's keep up
the<00:01:42.960> front<00:01:43.170> part<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.800> prevent<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.250> from

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the front part to prevent it from

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.210 
the front part to prevent it from
opening<00:01:44.900> everywhere<00:01:45.900> this<00:01:46.230> tape<00:01:46.620> is<00:01:46.860> strong

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
opening everywhere this tape is strong

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.940 
opening everywhere this tape is strong
enough<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.820> um<00:01:49.340> yeah<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.760> uh<00:01:51.660> yeah<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.770> does

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
enough so um yeah and uh yeah it does

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.450 
enough so um yeah and uh yeah it does
work

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
work

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.320 
work
see<00:01:54.680> so<00:01:55.680> once<00:01:55.950> I'm<00:01:56.130> done<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.340> both<00:01:56.970> of<00:01:57.120> them

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
see so once I'm done with both of them

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.260 
see so once I'm done with both of them
um<00:01:57.830> you<00:01:59.000> can<00:02:00.000> stop<00:02:00.780> trying<00:02:01.230> to<00:02:01.440> put<00:02:01.620> a<00:02:01.800> clip<00:02:02.130> in

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
um you can stop trying to put a clip in

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.680 
um you can stop trying to put a clip in
like<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.080> um<00:02:04.670> just<00:02:05.670> put<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.300> in<00:02:06.420> and

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
like that so um just put it in and

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.930 
like that so um just put it in and
inside<00:02:07.020> put<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.920> cut<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.580> neatly

inside put it in if you cut it neatly

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.420 
inside put it in if you cut it neatly
all<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.960> one<00:02:10.200> straight<00:02:10.470> line<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:11.010> will<00:02:11.130> go<00:02:11.160> in

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
all in one straight line it will go in
