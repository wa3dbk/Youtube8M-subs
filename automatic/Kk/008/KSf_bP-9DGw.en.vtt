stand I have a potato sack behind where
the<00:04:57.860> ropes<00:04:58.069> are<00:04:58.509> to<00:04:59.509> make<00:04:59.660> sure<00:04:59.870> that<00:05:00.139> it

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
the ropes are to make sure that it

now there is a real tall corn right over

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.189 
now there is a real tall corn right over
there<00:06:15.729> all<00:06:16.729> the<00:06:16.789> way<00:06:16.939> up<00:06:17.060> there<00:06:17.270> before<00:06:17.870> today

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 
there all the way up there before today

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:20.800 
there all the way up there before today
I<00:06:18.289> looked<00:06:18.919> up<00:06:19.069> the<00:06:19.250> upstairs<00:06:20.090> window<00:06:20.419> before

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
I looked up the upstairs window before

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.309 
I looked up the upstairs window before
and<00:06:21.940> the<00:06:22.940> tassel<00:06:23.419> at<00:06:23.539> least<00:06:23.719> half<00:06:23.960> of<00:06:24.139> its

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 
and the tassel at least half of its

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.369 
and the tassel at least half of its
broken<00:06:24.650> off<00:06:25.009> it's<00:06:25.520> probably<00:06:25.819> split<00:06:26.000> in<00:06:26.180> half

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:26.379 
broken off it's probably split in half

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:29.800 
broken off it's probably split in half
so<00:06:27.379> I<00:06:27.849> don't<00:06:28.849> know<00:06:28.940> what<00:06:29.180> that's<00:06:29.360> gonna<00:06:29.509> end<00:06:29.719> up

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
so I don't know what that's gonna end up

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.040 
so I don't know what that's gonna end up
doing<00:06:29.990> not<00:06:30.620> good<00:06:30.860> though<00:06:31.039> and<00:06:31.629> then<00:06:32.629> luckily

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:12.279 
foot don't move at all up by 29 looks
taller<00:07:11.270> than<00:07:11.389> it<00:07:11.539> is<00:07:11.810> because<00:07:11.990> it's<00:07:12.110> hanging

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:12.289 
taller than it is because it's hanging

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:15.150 
taller than it is because it's hanging
away<00:07:12.529> from<00:07:12.710> the<00:07:12.800> house

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.560 

the<00:07:16.160> Hakeem<00:07:16.550> is<00:07:16.640> right<00:07:16.850> up<00:07:17.000> against<00:07:17.270> the<00:07:17.420> house

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:17.570 
the Hakeem is right up against the house

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.220 
the Hakeem is right up against the house
so<00:07:18.610> gutters<00:07:19.610> about<00:07:19.850> 20<00:07:20.180> foot<00:07:20.390> so<00:07:21.020> it's

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:21.230 
so gutters about 20 foot so it's

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.850 
so gutters about 20 foot so it's
definitely<00:07:22.220> about<00:07:22.700> three<00:07:22.940> foot<00:07:23.180> over<00:07:23.650> as<00:07:24.650> well

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:24.860
