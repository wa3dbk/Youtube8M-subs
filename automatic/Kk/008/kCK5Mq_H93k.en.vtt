00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
off the reason I took it off was that it

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.910 
off the reason I took it off was that it
was<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.060> little<00:03:09.300> bit<00:03:09.480> uncomfortable<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.770> was

out evenly I applied one coat I let it

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.060 
out evenly I applied one coat I let it
dry<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.690> then<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.840> applied<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.200> second<00:03:52.650> coat<00:03:52.800> and
