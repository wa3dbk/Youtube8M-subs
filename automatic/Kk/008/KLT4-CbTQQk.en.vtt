00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.730
 hello everybody welcome to our program 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.380
 of housing is coming and it is always good 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.360
 to value who is on our side in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.160
 happy days and sad days and 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.869
 cooking is an extremely good act 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.700
 I like the final very good, we see that 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.890
 Someone spent hours in the kitchen to 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.989
 to provide a delicious meal 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.690
 We think our suggestion for this 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.180
 date is a red ravioli stuffed with 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.590
 cheese 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.690
 if you've already met your perfect father 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.610
 easy to split if you have not found 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.200
 do friends are single and not 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.550
 You are always alone to our intelligence 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.550
 and we already talk 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.110
 Good people to travel and stay with 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.720
 incredible color we will put a 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.120
 small beet in bulk 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.130
 If you do not like this vegetables you can 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.650
 rest quiet is so soft that it is 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.990
 almost imperceptible but really love 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.940
 can not comment or beet can 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.979
 remove the pasta will go white 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.310
 yellowed with the common noodles will stay 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.110
 colorful but will also be nice to 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.430
 to start you should highlight cut 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.540
 wrap beets with foil 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.000
 place in a roasting tin in the oven 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.290
 medium for about 20 minutes until 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.220
 celebrate afterwards remove the paper and 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.220
 put in the blender 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.829
 Jorge also an egg half a cup of coffee 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:48.670
 of water and a tablespoon of olive oil 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.670
 beat well and reserve 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.650
 in a bowl, combine two cups 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.590
 wheat flour tea with a spoon 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.390
 of salt coffee and place on a 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.160
 surface and opened a hole in the center 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.030
 making the shape of a volcano with the 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.800
 salt meal in the sense that there is a 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.780
 of the beet mixture and with 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.780
 care begins to mix with gaza 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.450
 so it looks like liquid body goes 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.069
 a little more and when the 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.819
 mass becomes thick begins to mix 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.819
 With the hands 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.640
 you do not need to save just mixed 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.390
 in the elements 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.310
 taking advantage of the fact that this process is a 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.620
 It takes a little time, I want to ask a favor 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.659
 Do you like the video you do not like? 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.849
 I liked this little hand underneath the player 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.950
 help us publicize our work 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.659
 Forget about commenting on youtube and 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.049
 asked for suggestions of dishes as soon as 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.940
 possible and not all recadinho the mass 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.739
 should be firm and if necessary 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.329
 add a little more flour to 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.040
 that is harder in the sequence 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.049
 the dough into a plastic bag and 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.230
 must have at least 30 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.230
 minutes 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.040
 make a roll with the dough to rest and 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.040
 life in five parts 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.190
 take one at a time to open the 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.410
 guard over a plastic bag 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.790
 who does not receive 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.200
 good people and finally the time has come 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.700
 open but if you will see that this 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.470
 process is a little painful but 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.760
 after you taste taste of a brand 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.260
 100% homemade 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.780
 You'll see why all this is worth it. 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.520
 the most traditional method used 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.360
 a roll of pasta a surface 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.950
 floured 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.260
 It's just you picking up small pieces of 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.890
 and making children's circles with a 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.330
 more or less 2 millimeters more 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.310
 You have conditions and you save 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.560
 you can also use a 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.360
 pasta machine with this here is just 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.320
 passes the pieces batter several times 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.180
 by vests 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.370
 first place on the thicker roller 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.220
 of number 1 in the sequence is decreasing 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.660
 the thickness of the mat on the roller 23 and 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.470
 get more or less in the bulletin 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.470
 number 4 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.459
 the mass should look more or less like this 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.020
 with the help of a heart cutter from 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.910
 average size you should start by 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.620
 cause of oil 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.420
 if you had not won you could 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.069
 use the mouth of an American cup and 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.890
 make rap round eyes look good 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.359
 also in the sequence put a 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.220
 spoon of coffee from your 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.220
 preferably in the middle of a heart 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.320
 over the filling place another part of 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.030
 fingers in the water and press 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.600
 edges of the hearts to close the 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.600
 ravioli 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.880
 repeat the process with the full mass 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.940
 while you finish take a pan with 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.920
 Fire high water and boil after 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.780
 boil put the aircraft to 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.090
 cook for about three minutes and 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.650
 remove with a slotted spoon while the 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.150

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.580
 delicious 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.740
 you must first put a 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.690
 skillet over medium heat to heat 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.460
 put in the skillet kept the broth 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.020

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.510
