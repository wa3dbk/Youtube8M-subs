00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
finish good for breaking trail it's much

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.470 
finish good for breaking trail it's much
much<00:00:55.379> lighter<00:00:55.649> actually<00:00:56.460> because<00:00:57.090> there's<00:00:57.329> no

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
much lighter actually because there's no

most systems and the lamination process

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.979 
most systems and the lamination process
just<00:01:02.550> lends<00:01:02.730> itself<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.210> very<00:01:03.239> slick<00:01:03.750> very

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989

compact design the glue on this product
is<00:01:07.380> particularly<00:01:08.280> good<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.880> fully

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
is particularly good it's fully

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
functional at minus 30 Celsius it still

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.100 
functional at minus 30 Celsius it still
will<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.760> some<00:01:12.090> adhesion<00:01:12.720> at<00:01:12.990> that

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
will have some adhesion at that

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.170 
will have some adhesion at that
temperature<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:14.010> about<00:01:14.310> 5<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:15.000> 10

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.730 
temperature and that's about 5 to 10
degrees<00:01:15.270> better<00:01:15.689> than<00:01:15.930> any<00:01:16.080> other<00:01:16.140> climbing
