 greater rigor on the first key of the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.000
 second rope 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.190

 this is the stage 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.610
 why he could not make cheat 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.099
 and still problems can make it easy 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.500
 moving the first finger on the first key 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.790
