the diagonal then you open it up whip it
around<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.430> fold<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.390> half<00:01:21.420> once

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
around and fold it in half once

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.830 
around and fold it in half once
horizontally<00:01:26.030> when<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.150> open<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.570> all<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
way back up now with the folds that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.039 
way back up now with the folds that
you've<00:01:30.150> done<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.600> two<00:01:30.750> different

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
you've done in the two different

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.039 
you've done in the two different
directions<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.100> start<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:33.150> go<00:01:33.360> in

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
directions it's going to start to go in

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.460 
directions it's going to start to go in
on<00:01:34.619> itself<00:01:35.369> fold<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.000> itself<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.110> will

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
on itself fold in on itself so you will

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.700 
on itself fold in on itself so you will
encourage<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.520> go<00:01:38.820> all<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.270> way<00:01:39.680> so<00:01:40.680> that

you fold it down into a small triangle

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.190 
you fold it down into a small triangle
like<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.329> this<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.689> water<00:01:45.930> bomb<00:01:46.170> base

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
like this this is the water bomb base

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.560 
like this this is the water bomb base
and

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570

pinch<00:02:32.330> right<00:02:32.600> there<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.020> don't<00:02:33.170> want<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.380> take

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
pinch right there you don't want to take

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.830 
pinch right there you don't want to take
it<00:02:33.739> all<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:33.950> way<00:02:34.220> out<00:02:34.370> just<00:02:35.239> right<00:02:35.420> at<00:02:35.660> that

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
it all the way out just right at that

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.350 
it all the way out just right at that
intersection<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.830> then<00:02:37.340> open<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:37.880> right<00:02:38.120> back

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
intersection and then open it right back

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.660 
intersection and then open it right back
up<00:02:38.660> so<00:02:38.959> that<00:02:39.110> now<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.350> have<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.769> cross<00:02:40.130> point

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
up so that now you have a cross point

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.479 
up so that now you have a cross point
there<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:41.930> want<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:42.230> do<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.739> same<00:02:43.040> thing

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
there and you want to do the same thing

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.320 
there and you want to do the same thing
on<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:44.360> other<00:02:44.390> top<00:02:45.200> corner<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:46.280> bring<00:02:46.730> your

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
on the other top corner so bring your

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.000 
on the other top corner so bring your
point<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.500> center<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.280> then<00:02:50.680> just<00:02:51.680> make<00:02:51.980> a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
point to the center and then just make a

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.060 
point to the center and then just make a
little<00:02:52.370> bit<00:02:52.850> of<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.150> crease<00:02:53.480> right<00:02:53.840> where<00:02:54.200> the

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
little bit of a crease right where the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.590 
little bit of a crease right where the
fold<00:02:55.760> intersects<00:02:56.750> with<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.320> line<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.600> open

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
fold intersects with the line and open

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.810 
fold intersects with the line and open
it<00:02:59.720> back<00:02:59.750> up<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.440> now<00:03:00.920> as<00:03:01.100> you<00:03:01.220> can<00:03:01.340> see<00:03:01.400> we've

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
it back up and now as you can see we've

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.569 
it back up and now as you can see we've
created<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.540> new<00:03:02.570> little<00:03:03.260> intersection<00:03:04.220> point

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
created a new little intersection point

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.550 
created a new little intersection point
um<00:03:06.790> halfway<00:03:07.790> through<00:03:08.079> halfway<00:03:09.079> along<00:03:09.380> the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
um halfway through halfway along the

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.930 
um halfway through halfway along the
line<00:03:09.799> there<00:03:11.230> now<00:03:12.230> flip<00:03:12.890> your<00:03:13.070> paper<00:03:13.340> back

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
line there now flip your paper back

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.500 
line there now flip your paper back
around<00:03:14.570> um<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.250> white<00:03:16.459> side<00:03:16.700> facing<00:03:17.390> up

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
around um to the white side facing up

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.600 
around um to the white side facing up
and<00:03:17.930> fold<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.310> in<00:03:19.519> half<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:21.220> now<00:03:22.220> this<00:03:22.430> is

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
and fold it in half and now this is

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.509 
and fold it in half and now this is
where<00:03:22.760> those<00:03:23.030> little<00:03:24.040> marks<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.160> we<00:03:25.310> just

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
where those little marks that we just

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.530 
where those little marks that we just
made<00:03:25.790> are<00:03:26.060> going<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.420> come<00:03:26.630> into<00:03:26.900> play<00:03:28.540> you're

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
made are going to come into play you're

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.390 
made are going to come into play you're
going<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.290> UM<00:03:31.420> fold<00:03:32.440> see<00:03:33.440> how<00:03:33.620> this<00:03:34.010> is<00:03:34.220> where

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
going to UM fold see how this is where

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.810 
going to UM fold see how this is where
the<00:03:34.549> intersection<00:03:35.269> is<00:03:35.420> right<00:03:35.750> here<00:03:36.230> right

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
the intersection is right here right

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.420 
the intersection is right here right
along<00:03:37.820> here<00:03:38.360> and<00:03:38.570> you're<00:03:39.380> going<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.680> fold<00:03:39.769> this

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
along here and you're going to fold this

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.680 
along here and you're going to fold this
point<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:42.079> that<00:03:42.650> center<00:03:43.549> of<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:44.299> little

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
point to that center of that little

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.920 
point to that center of that little
intersection<00:03:45.440> mark<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:46.130> we<00:03:46.310> made<00:03:46.549> on<00:03:46.930> both

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
intersection mark that we made on both

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.860 
intersection mark that we made on both
corners<00:03:48.739> so<00:03:49.130> here<00:03:49.400> you<00:03:49.519> can<00:03:49.549> see<00:03:50.000> where<00:03:50.840> that

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
corners so here you can see where that

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.580 
corners so here you can see where that
intersection<00:03:51.620> is<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.510> I'm<00:03:53.510> going<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:53.750> fold<00:03:54.170> my

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
intersection is and I'm going to fold my

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.910 
intersection is and I'm going to fold my
point<00:03:55.220> down<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:57.650> center

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
point down to the center

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.020 
point down to the center
they're<00:04:00.440> create<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.500> good<00:04:01.740> crease<00:04:02.099> on<00:04:02.430> both<00:04:02.790> of

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
they're create a good crease on both of

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.130 
they're create a good crease on both of
these<00:04:03.810> edges<00:04:04.319> then<00:04:05.099> open<00:04:05.550> them<00:04:05.700> up<00:04:05.760> and

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
these edges then open them up and

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.210 
these edges then open them up and
reverse<00:04:07.140> these<00:04:08.000> little<00:04:09.000> corner<00:04:09.420> bits<00:04:09.660> now

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
reverse these little corner bits now

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.960 
reverse these little corner bits now
inside<00:04:11.270> so<00:04:12.270> open<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:12.750> up<00:04:13.370> push<00:04:14.370> down<00:04:14.640> and<00:04:14.880> it

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
inside so open it up push down and it

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.629 
inside so open it up push down and it
will<00:04:15.120> go<00:04:15.300> now<00:04:15.630> because<00:04:16.049> you've<00:04:16.579> made<00:04:17.579> a

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
will go now because you've made a

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.699 
will go now because you've made a
weakness<00:04:18.090> in<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.419> paper<00:04:18.660> by<00:04:19.019> making<00:04:19.500> that

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
weakness in the paper by making that

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.770 
weakness in the paper by making that
that<00:04:20.250> fold<00:04:20.579> and<00:04:20.989> fold<00:04:21.989> it<00:04:22.320> inside<00:04:22.470> so<00:04:23.510> you<00:04:24.510> end

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
that fold and fold it inside so you end

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.780 
that fold and fold it inside so you end
up<00:04:24.990> with<00:04:25.050> a<00:04:25.590> piece<00:04:26.010> that<00:04:26.639> looks<00:04:26.850> like<00:04:27.210> this

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
up with a piece that looks like this

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:36.080

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.360 
that up so that it's three-dimensional
see<00:05:17.280> how<00:05:17.430> now<00:05:17.669> you<00:05:18.260> kind<00:05:19.260> of<00:05:19.320> opened<00:05:19.830> that<00:05:20.130> up

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
see how now you kind of opened that up

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.230 
see how now you kind of opened that up
like<00:05:20.880> that<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:21.479> then<00:05:22.410> flip<00:05:23.160> it<00:05:23.250> around<00:05:23.400> and<00:05:24.000> do

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
like that and then flip it around and do

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.240 
like that and then flip it around and do
the<00:05:24.360> same<00:05:24.890> the<00:05:25.890> same<00:05:25.919> thing<00:05:26.610> on<00:05:26.910> this<00:05:27.750> side

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
the same the same thing on this side

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:37.130 
the same the same thing on this side
pull<00:05:30.650> pull<00:05:31.650> your<00:05:31.860> piece<00:05:32.130> over<00:05:36.110> pull<00:05:37.110> your

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
pull pull your piece over pull your

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.329 
pull pull your piece over pull your
piece<00:05:37.440> over<00:05:38.690> like<00:05:39.690> that

00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:42.339 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:46.869 

so<00:05:43.339> you<00:05:43.430> kind<00:05:44.389> of<00:05:44.889> reverse<00:05:45.889> it<00:05:46.189> you're<00:05:46.699> like

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:46.879 
so you kind of reverse it you're like

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:50.969 
so you kind of reverse it you're like
this<00:05:47.499> folded<00:05:48.499> down<00:05:48.740> and<00:05:49.629> you're<00:05:50.629> going<00:05:50.809> to

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
this folded down and you're going to

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.689 
this folded down and you're going to
open<00:05:51.979> up<00:05:52.189> the<00:05:52.909> ends<00:05:53.360> on<00:05:53.479> the<00:05:53.509> opposite<00:05:54.110> side

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
open up the ends on the opposite side

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:09.239 
open up the ends on the opposite side
pushing<00:05:55.699> in<00:05:56.149> here<00:06:05.139> so<00:06:06.139> that<00:06:06.289> now<00:06:06.499> you've<00:06:06.800> got<00:06:07.069> a

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:09.249 
pushing in here so that now you've got a

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:15.330 
pushing in here so that now you've got a
three-dimensional<00:06:10.249> effect

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.560 

one<00:06:16.000> last<00:06:16.210> time<00:06:16.449> it's<00:06:17.350> closed<00:06:17.650> off<00:06:17.919> and<00:06:18.570> pull

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
one last time it's closed off and pull

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:25.939 
one last time it's closed off and pull
it<00:06:19.720> over<00:06:20.280> do<00:06:21.280> the<00:06:21.340> same<00:06:21.669> thing<00:06:21.970> on<00:06:22.150> this<00:06:22.330> side

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.860 

pull<00:06:26.949> it<00:06:27.040> over<00:06:28.770> so<00:06:29.770> that<00:06:29.800> you<00:06:30.130> have<00:06:30.370> a

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
pull it over so that you have a

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.230 
pull it over so that you have a
three-dimensional<00:06:31.870> effect<00:06:32.070> now<00:06:33.070> make<00:06:33.310> three

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
three-dimensional effect now make three

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.060 
three-dimensional effect now make three
of<00:06:34.360> these<00:06:35.250> meet<00:06:36.250> me<00:06:36.370> back<00:06:36.520> on<00:06:36.760> Wednesday<00:06:37.360> and
