one<00:01:17.860> here<00:01:18.250> is<00:01:18.460> water<00:01:19.390> erasable<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:22.150> mark<00:01:22.420> is

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
one here is water erasable the mark is

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.410 
one here is water erasable the mark is
permanent<00:01:23.470> until<00:01:23.680> you<00:01:23.950> get<00:01:24.130> it<00:01:24.220> wet<00:01:24.430> and<00:01:24.850> get

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
permanent until you get it wet and get

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.850 
permanent until you get it wet and get
it<00:01:25.510> wet<00:01:25.720> it<00:01:25.990> disappears<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:27.729> one<00:01:28.620> hits<00:01:29.620> and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
it wet it disappears this one hits and

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.650 
it wet it disappears this one hits and
air<00:01:30.670> erasable<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:32.470> think<00:01:33.340> within<00:01:33.610> 48<00:01:34.090> hours<00:01:34.450> it

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
air erasable I think within 48 hours it

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.749 
air erasable I think within 48 hours it
just<00:01:34.869> disappears<00:01:35.410> completely<00:01:35.590> so<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.490> would

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
just disappears completely so you would

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.550 
just disappears completely so you would
only<00:01:36.910> use<00:01:37.030> this<00:01:37.360> right<00:01:37.630> before<00:01:37.990> you're<00:01:38.170> here

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
only use this right before you're here

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.210 
only use this right before you're here
wanting<00:01:39.280> to<00:01:39.310> do<00:01:39.550> your<00:01:39.700> surgery<00:01:41.220> obviously

so you start with your fabric and I've

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.880 
so you start with your fabric and I've
already<00:02:11.870> drawn<00:02:12.870> my<00:02:13.080> little<00:02:13.290> heart<00:02:13.470> on<00:02:13.680> there

and well obviously the most important
thing<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.490> you'll<00:02:17.790> need<00:02:24.170> one<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.200> these<00:02:25.700> just

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
thing that you'll need one of these just

I<00:02:31.940> don't<00:02:32.940> even<00:02:33.030> know<00:02:33.239> who<00:02:33.360> makes<00:02:33.540> mine<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.810> think

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
I don't even know who makes mine I think

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.510 
I don't even know who makes mine I think
it's<00:02:34.260> shark<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:34.830> think<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.100> got<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.400> at

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520

that so you don't need a fancy sewing

machine but online they're all along the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.910 
machine but online they're all along the
top<00:03:23.670> so<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.590> thread<00:03:26.160> tension

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.690 

I'm<00:03:29.160> going<00:03:29.460> to<00:03:29.520> step<00:03:29.730> out<00:03:29.910> at<00:03:30.030> zero

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.979 

and<00:03:35.599> this<00:03:36.500> is<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.680> stitch<00:03:37.040> width<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:37.810> I'm<00:03:38.810> also

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
and this is a stitch width and I'm also

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.240 
and this is a stitch width and I'm also
going<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.349> set<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:39.739> at<00:03:39.920> zero<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.980> stitch

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
going to set that at zero and the stitch

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
going to set that at zero and the stitch
length<00:03:43.489> as<00:03:43.760> well<00:03:43.970> will<00:03:44.690> be<00:03:44.840> set<00:03:45.080> at<00:03:45.200> zero<00:03:46.270> and

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
length as well will be set at zero and

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.670 
length as well will be set at zero and
what<00:03:47.450> this<00:03:47.599> allows<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.110> to<00:03:48.170> do<00:03:49.630> is<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:51.380> stitch

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
what this allows you to do is to stitch

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.780 
what this allows you to do is to stitch
in<00:03:52.220> place<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.030> needle<00:03:53.830> is<00:03:54.830> going<00:03:55.520> to

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
in place so the needle is going to

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.850 
in place so the needle is going to
continue<00:03:56.300> to<00:03:56.630> move<00:03:56.810> up<00:03:57.020> and<00:03:57.200> down<00:03:57.290> in<00:03:57.739> the

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.480 
touching the fabric but as you stitch it
it<00:05:14.610> will<00:05:14.789> actually<00:05:15.090> go<00:05:15.900> up<00:05:16.169> and<00:05:16.379> down<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:16.919> grab

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
it will actually go up and down and grab

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.540 
it will actually go up and down and grab
the<00:05:17.699> fabric<00:05:17.940> to<00:05:18.479> hold<00:05:18.659> it<00:05:18.810> in<00:05:18.990> place<00:05:19.520> what<00:05:20.520> I

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
the fabric to hold it in place what I

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.390 
the fabric to hold it in place what I
like<00:05:20.789> to<00:05:20.970> do<00:05:21.150> is<00:05:21.449> stitch<00:05:22.080> from<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.530> outside<00:05:23.069> in

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
like to do is stitch from the outside in

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.350 
like to do is stitch from the outside in
if<00:05:23.729> I'm<00:05:23.879> doing<00:05:24.030> a<00:05:24.270> filled<00:05:24.569> shape<00:05:25.879> and<00:05:26.879> that

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
if I'm doing a filled shape and that

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.420 
if I'm doing a filled shape and that
allows<00:05:27.659> me<00:05:27.870> to<00:05:27.990> get<00:05:28.080> a<00:05:28.139> nice<00:05:28.409> even<00:05:28.979> texture

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
allows me to get a nice even texture

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.149 
allows me to get a nice even texture
with<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:29.970> stitching<00:05:33.650> so<00:05:34.650> you<00:05:34.740> grab<00:05:35.009> the

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
with the stitching so you grab the

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.980 
with the stitching so you grab the
fabric<00:05:35.370> at<00:05:35.639> either<00:05:35.789> side<00:05:36.800> and<00:05:38.690> this<00:05:39.690> allows

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
fabric at either side and this allows

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.680 
fabric at either side and this allows
you<00:05:40.199> to<00:05:40.500> have<00:05:41.099> better<00:05:41.430> control<00:05:41.729> on<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.240> fabric

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
you to have better control on the fabric

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.600 
you to have better control on the fabric
you<00:05:43.319> might<00:05:43.469> want<00:05:43.650> to<00:05:43.710> apply<00:05:44.009> a<00:05:44.039> little<00:05:44.370> tension

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
you might want to apply a little tension

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.260 
you might want to apply a little tension
as<00:05:44.849> well

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
as well

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.140 
as well
another<00:05:46.110> idea<00:05:46.530> might<00:05:46.919> be<00:05:46.949> if<00:05:47.789> your<00:05:47.969> fabric

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
another idea might be if your fabric

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.570 
another idea might be if your fabric
isn't<00:05:48.629> as<00:05:48.900> stable<00:05:49.139> as<00:05:49.379> you'd<00:05:49.560> like<00:05:49.740> you<00:05:50.340> can

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
isn't as stable as you'd like you can

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.170 
isn't as stable as you'd like you can
add<00:05:50.669> stabilizer<00:05:51.270> you<00:05:51.419> can<00:05:51.719> add<00:05:53.180> feasible

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
add stabilizer you can add feasible

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.450 
add stabilizer you can add feasible
interfacing<00:05:54.810> to<00:05:54.960> the<00:05:55.050> back<00:05:55.229> of<00:05:55.440> it<00:05:55.560> and<00:05:56.310> that

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
interfacing to the back of it and that

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.700 
interfacing to the back of it and that
might<00:05:56.639> actually<00:05:57.080> give<00:05:58.080> you<00:05:58.199> a<00:05:58.229> more<00:05:58.469> even

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
might actually give you a more even

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.430 
might actually give you a more even
stitch<00:05:58.979> as<00:05:59.159> well<00:05:59.370> as<00:06:00.020> stabilizing<00:06:01.020> the<00:06:01.080> fabric

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
stitch as well as stabilizing the fabric

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:16.390 
stitch as well as stabilizing the fabric
for<00:06:01.680> you

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.640 

now<00:06:17.400> once<00:06:17.639> you<00:06:17.790> have<00:06:17.940> a<00:06:17.970> sheet<00:06:18.300> filled<00:06:18.660> a<00:06:18.990> lot

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
now once you have a sheet filled a lot

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.590 
now once you have a sheet filled a lot
of<00:06:19.800> times<00:06:20.010> what<00:06:20.190> I<00:06:20.280> like<00:06:20.430> to<00:06:20.610> do<00:06:20.760> is<00:06:21.060> outline

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
of times what I like to do is outline

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.370 
of times what I like to do is outline
the<00:06:22.050> design<00:06:22.800> in<00:06:23.190> a<00:06:23.280> darker<00:06:23.669> color<00:06:24.080> so<00:06:25.080> I'm<00:06:25.230> just

going<00:06:25.560> to<00:06:25.650> switch<00:06:25.800> threads<00:06:26.220> now<00:06:26.460> and<00:06:26.790> stitch

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
going to switch threads now and stitch

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.390 
going to switch threads now and stitch
all<00:06:27.870> around<00:06:28.080> the<00:06:28.350> edge<00:06:28.500> and<00:06:28.860> I'm<00:06:29.010> going<00:06:29.190> to<00:06:29.250> go

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
all around the edge and I'm going to go

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.250 
all around the edge and I'm going to go
around<00:06:29.550> twice

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
around twice

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.420
