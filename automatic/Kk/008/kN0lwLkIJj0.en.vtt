like just obsession to try to get my

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.970 
like just obsession to try to get my
design<00:02:49.970> experience<00:02:50.569> and<00:02:50.840> just<00:02:51.739> kind<00:02:51.950> of

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
design experience and just kind of

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.250 
design experience and just kind of
design<00:02:52.250> style<00:02:52.640> like<00:02:53.120> whiteout<00:02:53.390> work<00:02:53.690> started

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
design style like whiteout work started

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.949 
design style like whiteout work started
like<00:02:54.440> kind<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:54.739> around<00:02:55.310> like<00:02:55.459> October<00:02:56.269> okay

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
like kind of around like October okay

like kind of around like October okay
when<00:02:57.319> I<00:02:57.940> just<00:02:58.940> it<00:02:59.120> seemed<00:02:59.420> like<00:02:59.630> this<00:02:59.959> was<00:03:00.019> kind

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
when I just it seemed like this was kind

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.039 
when I just it seemed like this was kind
of<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.530> next<00:03:00.799> step<00:03:01.099> and<00:03:01.400> i<00:03:02.060> started<00:03:02.630> i<00:03:02.750> first

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
of the next step and i started i first

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.710 
of the next step and i started i first
started<00:03:03.260> playing<00:03:03.440> just<00:03:03.799> like<00:03:03.920> quite

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
started playing just like quite

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.569 
started playing just like quite
outputting<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.810> giclee<00:03:06.260> prints<00:03:06.620> from<00:03:06.769> us<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.430> I

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
outputting a giclee prints from us and I

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.910 
outputting a giclee prints from us and I
was<00:03:07.790> when<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.060> sprinter<00:03:08.450> in<00:03:08.569> my<00:03:08.660> studio<00:03:08.959> okay<00:03:09.620> so

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
was when I sprinter in my studio okay so

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.410 
was when I sprinter in my studio okay so
that<00:03:10.069> was<00:03:10.190> kind<00:03:10.400> of<00:03:10.459> like<00:03:10.579> a<00:03:10.640> first<00:03:10.970> step<00:03:11.209> of

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
that was kind of like a first step of

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.750 
that was kind of like a first step of
integrating<00:03:12.319> like<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:12.860> these<00:03:12.980> animals<00:03:13.459> and

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
integrating like so these animals and

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.270 
integrating like so these animals and
summit<00:03:14.030> textures<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.660> you<00:03:14.900> know<00:03:14.989> Elvis<00:03:15.280> that

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
summit textures and you know Elvis that

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.009 
summit textures and you know Elvis that
I<00:03:16.310> do<00:03:16.459> might<00:03:16.639> want<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:16.970> work<00:03:17.090> into<00:03:17.660> these<00:03:17.780> like

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
I do might want to work into these like

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.110 
I do might want to work into these like
design<00:03:18.410> backgrounds<00:03:19.100> program<00:03:19.700> becomes<00:03:19.940> two

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
design backgrounds program becomes two

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.629 
design backgrounds program becomes two
animals<00:03:20.480> everything<00:03:20.930> yeah<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:22.130> start<00:03:22.400> doing

kind of varnish or you know mixed media

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.990 
kind of varnish or you know mixed media
 transparency<00:03:48.799> techniques<00:03:49.849> but<00:03:50.849> the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
 transparency techniques but the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.490 
 transparency techniques but the
dissociated<00:03:51.420> things<00:03:51.689> just<00:03:51.900> like<00:03:52.019> yeah<00:03:52.260> when

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
dissociated things just like yeah when

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500 
dissociated things just like yeah when
you<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.950> just<00:03:53.159> pop<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.549> in<00:03:53.579> or<00:03:53.760> like<00:03:53.909> why<00:03:54.329> did<00:03:54.480> I

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
you you just pop it in or like why did I

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.319 
you you just pop it in or like why did I
do<00:03:54.659> this<00:03:54.689> earlier<00:03:55.139> yeah<00:03:55.859> yeah<00:03:56.219> it<00:03:56.639> was<00:03:56.790> like<00:03:57.120> so

that<00:04:09.480> has<00:04:09.689> a<00:04:09.720> crisp<00:04:10.319> clean<00:04:10.680> edge<00:04:10.889> that's<00:04:11.700> you

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
that has a crisp clean edge that's you

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.409 
that has a crisp clean edge that's you
know<00:04:12.209> at<00:04:12.450> right<00:04:12.810> angles<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.500> it's

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.419 
know at right angles and it's

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.150 
know at right angles and it's
symmetrical<00:04:15.419> or<00:04:15.540> mathematically<00:04:16.380> known<00:04:16.530> that

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
symmetrical or mathematically known that

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.570 
symmetrical or mathematically known that
it<00:04:17.489> works<00:04:18.419> great
