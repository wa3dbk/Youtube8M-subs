00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
almost sort of offering criticism just

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.770 
almost sort of offering criticism just
for<00:02:38.730> something<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.270> say<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:41.180> don't<00:02:42.180> know

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
for something to say I don't know

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.290 
for something to say I don't know
possibly<00:02:43.620> whether<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.940> background

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
possibly whether the the background

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.449 
possibly whether the the background
might<00:02:45.959> have<00:02:46.140> been<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.290> little<00:02:46.650> bit<00:02:46.920> stronger

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
might have been a little bit stronger

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.660 
might have been a little bit stronger
here<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.720> was<00:02:49.230> going<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.500> say<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.739> define<00:02:50.370> it's<00:02:50.580> a

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
here I was going to say to define it's a

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.410 
here I was going to say to define it's a
bit<00:02:50.850> better<00:02:51.090> from<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.540> white<00:02:51.720> fur<00:02:52.110> but

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
bit better from the white fur but

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.979 
bit better from the white fur but
looking<00:02:54.420> at<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.720> again<00:02:56.150> obviously<00:02:57.150> we've<00:02:57.780> got

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
looking at it again obviously we've got

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.550 
looking at it again obviously we've got
a<00:02:58.020> vignette<00:02:58.560> EDH<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.270> cat's<00:03:00.540> head<00:03:00.900> and

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
a vignette EDH of the cat's head and

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.270 
a vignette EDH of the cat's head and
chest<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.820> in<00:03:03.330> in<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.320> full<00:03:04.530> picture<00:03:04.800> of<00:03:04.950> course

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
chest and in in a full picture of course

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.490 
chest and in in a full picture of course
the<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:06.000> shoulders<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.080> top<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.410> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
the the shoulders and the top of the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.800 
the the shoulders and the top of the
legs<00:03:07.709> would<00:03:08.250> have<00:03:08.400> been<00:03:08.520> in<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:08.820> position<00:03:09.030> so

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
legs would have been in this position so

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.760 
legs would have been in this position so
I<00:03:10.080> think<00:03:10.470> perhaps<00:03:11.660> cap<00:03:12.660> Gables<00:03:13.200> recognize

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
I think perhaps cap Gables recognize

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.070 
I think perhaps cap Gables recognize
this<00:03:14.100> not<00:03:14.489> done<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.940> too<00:03:15.180> dark<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.780> let<00:03:15.959> it

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
this not done this too dark and let it

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.009 
this not done this too dark and let it
fade<00:03:16.440> away<00:03:16.470> with<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:18.180> white<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.690> fur

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
fade away with the the white of the fur

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.460 
fade away with the the white of the fur
because<00:03:20.180> perhaps<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.930> do<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.200> slightly

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
because perhaps to to to do it slightly

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.070 
because perhaps to to to do it slightly
darker<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.730> end<00:03:23.910> up<00:03:24.150> with<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:24.570> looking

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
darker you end up with this looking

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.660 
darker you end up with this looking
almost<00:03:25.910> as<00:03:27.019> a<00:03:28.019> cat's<00:03:28.680> head<00:03:29.040> almost<00:03:29.280> like<00:03:29.640> a

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
almost as a cat's head almost like a

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.320 
almost as a cat's head almost like a
trophy

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
trophy

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.870 
trophy
that's<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.110> cat's<00:03:31.380> head<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.920> shoulders

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
that's a cat's head and shoulders

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.940 
that's a cat's head and shoulders
hanging<00:03:33.630> on<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.900> wall<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:34.560> think<00:03:34.799> that's

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
hanging on the wall and I think that's

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.920 
hanging on the wall and I think that's
the<00:03:35.130> last<00:03:35.310> thing<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.299> artist<00:03:36.720> would

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
the last thing that the artist would

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.100 
the last thing that the artist would
have<00:03:37.080> wanted

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
have wanted

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.170 
have wanted
I've<00:03:40.110> looked<00:03:40.950> here<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.580> weather

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
I've looked here a weather

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.500 
I've looked here a weather
possibly<00:03:43.170> any<00:03:43.320> modelling<00:03:43.980> could<00:03:44.310> have<00:03:44.510> been

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
possibly any modelling could have been

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.780 
possibly any modelling could have been
added<00:03:45.720> if<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:46.890> have<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.070> look<00:03:47.220> at<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.519> nose

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
added if you have a look at the nose

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.780 
added if you have a look at the nose
here<00:03:48.239> if<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:48.810> just<00:03:49.019> let<00:03:49.350> me<00:03:49.440> just<00:03:49.470> have<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.250> a

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
here if you just let me just have this a

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.449 
here if you just let me just have this a
little<00:03:51.450> bit<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.750> work<00:03:52.079> in<00:03:52.290> there<00:03:52.650> this<00:03:53.220> is

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
little bit of work in there this is

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.620 
little bit of work in there this is
obviously<00:03:53.790> only<00:03:53.910> red<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.329> rafi

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
obviously only red and rafi

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.120 
obviously only red and rafi
rough-and-ready<00:03:55.470> with<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.040> airbrush<00:03:56.760> I

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
rough-and-ready with the airbrush I

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.770 
rough-and-ready with the airbrush I
don't<00:03:59.130> know<00:03:59.400> whether<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.880> adds<00:04:00.120> any

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
don't know whether it adds any

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.759 
don't know whether it adds any
enhancement<00:04:01.709> at<00:04:01.860> all<00:04:02.100> to<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.150> picture<00:04:03.769> let's

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
enhancement at all to the picture let's

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.140 
enhancement at all to the picture let's
take<00:04:05.040> it<00:04:05.190> out<00:04:06.049> let's<00:04:07.049> put<00:04:07.260> it<00:04:07.380> back<00:04:07.560> in<00:04:07.769> again

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
take it out let's put it back in again

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.150 
take it out let's put it back in again
and<00:04:11.299> take<00:04:12.299> it<00:04:12.480> out<00:04:12.600> again<00:04:12.900> what<00:04:13.500> do<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:13.829> think

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
and take it out again what do you think

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.940 
and take it out again what do you think
more<00:04:14.610> importantly<00:04:15.239> what<00:04:15.870> does<00:04:16.079> cat<00:04:16.350> Gabriel

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
more importantly what does cat Gabriel

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.909 
more importantly what does cat Gabriel
think<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.400> really<00:04:18.269> don't<00:04:18.540> know<00:04:18.870> it's<00:04:19.350> just<00:04:19.470> a

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
think I really don't know it's just a

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.640 
think I really don't know it's just a
suggestion<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:21.780> might<00:04:22.049> be<00:04:22.260> something

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
suggestion that it might be something

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.860 
suggestion that it might be something
that<00:04:22.680> she<00:04:23.039> can<00:04:23.220> look<00:04:23.430> at<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:24.270> of<00:04:24.419> course<00:04:24.630> one

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
that she can look at and of course one

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.410 
that she can look at and of course one
of<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.110> beauties<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.729> image

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420

if you're not sure whether you want to

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.580 
if you're not sure whether you want to

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
add anything whether you want to go that

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.940 
add anything whether you want to go that
next<00:04:38.130> vital<00:04:38.970> step<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:39.990> might<00:04:40.230> just<00:04:40.650> be<00:04:40.800> a

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
next vital step that might just be a

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.910 
next vital step that might just be a
step<00:04:41.400> too<00:04:41.700> far<00:04:42.090> that<00:04:42.420> you<00:04:42.810> can't<00:04:42.960> readily<00:04:43.590> on

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
step too far that you can't readily on

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.390 
step too far that you can't readily on
do<00:04:44.250> then<00:04:45.000> it's<00:04:45.630> always<00:04:45.990> worthwhile<00:04:46.400> taking

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
do then it's always worthwhile taking

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.540 
do then it's always worthwhile taking
the<00:04:47.670> picture<00:04:48.150> at<00:04:48.360> that<00:04:48.720> stage<00:04:49.160> scanning<00:04:50.160> it<00:04:50.310> in

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
the picture at that stage scanning it in

manipulation<00:04:55.680> software<00:04:56.390> adding<00:04:57.390> a<00:04:57.510> little

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
manipulation software adding a little

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.420 
manipulation software adding a little
bit<00:04:57.780> of<00:04:57.900> shadow<00:04:58.260> here<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:58.860> there<00:04:59.040> maybe<00:04:59.280> a

bit of shadow here and there maybe a

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.380 
bit of shadow here and there maybe a
different<00:04:59.910> color<00:05:00.150> here<00:05:00.420> and<00:05:00.660> there<00:05:00.900> and

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
seeing whether it works you can do that

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.670 
seeing whether it works you can do that

endangering the picture by putting color

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.670 
endangering the picture by putting color
on<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:11.070> going<00:05:11.790> just<00:05:12.420> a<00:05:12.630> little<00:05:12.660> bit<00:05:13.080> too<00:05:13.320> far

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
on and going just a little bit too far

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.990 
on and going just a little bit too far
and<00:05:14.670> making<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.720> change<00:05:16.260> that<00:05:16.590> becomes

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
and making a change that becomes

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.420 
and making a change that becomes
irretrievable<00:05:18.470> so<00:05:19.520> there<00:05:20.520> we<00:05:20.670> are<00:05:21.860> cats<00:05:22.860> work

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
irretrievable so there we are cats work

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.970 
irretrievable so there we are cats work
