00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello personal brand used with you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.950
 again here on youtube 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.510
 we will solve this today and just continue 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.690
 here's the 3/12 as what we do 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.670
 first catch three tries to divide by 12 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.599
 cv that does not give because it is smaller than 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.850
 12 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.100
 so that it is greater than the 12th 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.310
 people put a fuss over here 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.470
 there are 30 now and divide by 12 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.830
 because now it is greater than 12 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.260
 so since you put 10 here it is 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.360
 Required to put 0.15 in response 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.260
 It's okay here to drop this. 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.960
 0.15 puts greater response in which 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.829
 now let's put a number here that x 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.800
 12 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.789
 not more than 30 can not exceed 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.730
 30 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.700
 Let's try 13 then 12 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:57.559
 Let's try it out 12 times 3com 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:01.260
 is 12 times 33 times 2 is 63 times a 3 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.420
 36 can not give because it's bigger than 30 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.650
 then it can not be number 3 because 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:11.030
 three times 12 is 36 greater than 30 then 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:18.240
 let's try the 2 that is less than 1 3 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:25.009
 let's do it here 30 do not try not 12 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:29.250
 times 12 now 12 times 2 twice 24 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:32.729
 twice 2 the standard 24 twice 12 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.930
 24 smaller than 30 then two can we 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.360
 puts that to 2 twice 1224 places 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.119
 below the 30 that makes a little point 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.850
 of - 30-24 30-24 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.240
 Let's go 0 - 4 does not work because zero 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.040
 that 4 then I put one here 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.590
 with that we form number 1010 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.880
 number 10 that is larger than the room and gives 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.140
 to make 10 -4 is equal to 6 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.880
 because six plus four good goddess 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.560
 now come here since we put 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.179
 a line to get bigger than this 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.160
 number we have to increase this 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.480
 number 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.130
 now it will be worth 3 then 3 - 3 is 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.620
 equal to zero 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:24.950
 so there are 06 here 30 - 24 06 or six 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.060
 All right, let's continue. Let's go, shall we? 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.670
 as the answer 0.26 gives to divide by 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.770
 12 not because it is less than 12 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.720
 so what we do that puts 10 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.070
 again to be greater than 12 a 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.750
 people can divide 60/12 while 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.970
 Who is the number that puts what? 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.680
 multiplied by 12 get the closest 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.250
 of 60 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.060
 I know three times 12 to 36 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:57.620
 and let's try to rain, let's try 155 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.360
 times 10 out of 55 times 12 but over 50 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.640
 cool and let's try 15 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.720
 Let's multiply the 12 by five to see 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.760
 what happens 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:11.510
 we put that 12 times 55 times 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.410
 two 10 places 10 here and under one of the 10 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.290
 huh 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.760
 five times two 10 places 10 going up 1 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.970
 5 times 15 with 16 60 right 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.560
 then five times 12 to 60 then we 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.810
 can put here will work had 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:32.600
 then at 55 times 1260 the yard will end 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.330
 with had in then multiplies five 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.950
 times 12 puts here that gives 60 and makes 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:42.440
 account 60 thousand 60 0 - 0 0 and 6 years 60 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.910
 When it gets here, that means 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:50.750
 that contained it is ready 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:53.959
 then the result of 3/12 is 0.25 0.25 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.320
 the 3/12 response to take the test 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.390
 you multiply 0.25 times 12 you have to 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.070
 give three okay 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.140
