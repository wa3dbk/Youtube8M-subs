00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.190
 look that 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.500
 whenever we start somewhere 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.350
 there is a protocol to follow, right? 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.720
 and I will not take this protocol that the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.630
 That's the protocol we're selling our 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.750
 Fish as we speak until then who am I? 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 No, my name is Élson, I'm a nurse. 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.100
 specialist in intensive care for 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.070
 ten years I was in the hospital 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.379
 president dutra university 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.300
 in São Luís do Maranhão I'm Maranhão 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.700
 we worked there with the post 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.250
 cardiac surgery and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.680
 patients from hemodynamics 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.840
 we are also responsible for the hurry 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.300
 is nursing home theory 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.699
 in cardiology as well as in 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.039
 residency in nursing is medicine 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.800
 athlete is an excuse and has a clinic 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.110
 as a coursework teacher at 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.780
 people have been in the area for six years. 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.970
 people worked in the cus- 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.810
 today I'm another retreat from the plateau 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.640
 central 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.040
 I've been here with you guys for five 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.080
 months in Brasilia today we work the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.920
 University of Brasília at the secretary's office 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.720
 health is the opa of Ceilândia and we 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.280
 was invited by the great courses will do 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.110
 part of this project 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.259
 We are here with you. I was in 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.820
 taguatinga we are more in 5 courses 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.820
 here in Brasilia 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.770
 So our way of giving the class is 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.430
 make you feel at ease 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.650
 by chance our first meeting is 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.560
 that discipline that you love if 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.799
 in love and by chance we still went 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.610
 marked weekend administration 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.829
 nursing 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.149
 We can not make a mistake in the 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.759
 Our proof, guys. 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.570
 What is the error that is not going to be a 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.729
 you 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.570
 many of the students when they take this 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.610
 topic 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.409
 the first thing they do I'm 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.950
 speaking this because there are not only students 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.350
 There are not only students here in Brasilia here. 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.390
 There are over a thousand students in São Luis 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:15.360
 We get this topic here. 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.880
 leaps the learner because he thinks that he 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.650
 You will not learn this one at least 63 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.110
 test questions 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.300
 the nursing administration before 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.020
 I say to you they have nothing to decorate. 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.320
 So, when we're talking about 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.240
 administration nurse tried and tested 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.010
 Although I told you, we can not. 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.830
 skip this topic 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.750
 are on average three questions and will do 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.480
 a very big difference that much 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.700
 student will not study this because 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.290
 they will spend the academic life 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.000
 When you arrive on time you do not know if only 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.580
 He goes to the mall. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.400
 he will walk around because they contain many 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.160
 think that he thought her 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.930
 Our idea here is to bring you 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.430
 only what will fall to the test and nobody 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.530
 will leave here with the idea that will be 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.230
 an administrator in three meetings not 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.020
 has as the lieutenant that we pass 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.220
 five years in college he still leaves with 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.140
 difficulty 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.390
 would be too arrogant in three 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.519
 meetings try to teach everything to you 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.220
 the word to administer people comes from 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.190
 manage and plan it is obvious that this 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.950
 will fall on your test but you know why 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.709
 In fact you do not like it when I say it. 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.230
 Are you a student in the fight? 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.300
 nursing administration because we 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.220
 we were indoctrinated to like 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.290
 medium piu diagnosis 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.390
 It would be really cool, we work with 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.580
 This part, too, I'll get to you. 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.130
 here's a lecture on lighthouse on 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.890
 extracorporeal circulation is about 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.260
 because the student likes it and 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.840
 mean real diagnosis because that is what 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.020
 we are dominated by college when 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.340
 People go to us, there are countless 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.340
 the city is too tall 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:10.130
 hi has improved and improved the best 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.930
 So we people to administer to 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.120
 people and we first have to meet 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.650
 the people in the structure where we go 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:21.440
 to manage this here is very interesting 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.650
 this topic here he tells you what 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:30.230
 would be the characteristic of an individual 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:33.830
 visual auditory synestesis because it is 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:37.270
 important of knowledge that how 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.260
 will administer a shift one unit 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.170
 it's difficult, right? 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.430
 If you do not have notions of what the 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:48.800
 people that are there with you 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.480
 the individual with visual and 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:58.370
 many of you will identify with 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:05:01.130
 This game is giving to listen to the individual. 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.460
 with visual characteristics is that 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.190
 guy he gets to you and he 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.350
 Look, in my eyes, he talks to you. 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.570
 looking in your eyes 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.980
 only for the individual to talk to you 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.710
 looking in the eyes 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:19.940
 he needs a detail he needs 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.610
 a visual field he needs one is 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.010
 space 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.200
 the auditory individual is the one who speaks 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.280
 with you using the hearing is when it arrives 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.260
 to someone like that 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.550
 Good morning, Mr. So-and-so. I can. 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.080
 talk to you he does so to you fan 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.330
 Are you starting to realize that this? 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.070
 can generate conflicts because who is 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.470
 visual likes to talk looking in the eyes 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.390
 and he wants the person to talk to him 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.820
 looking in the eyes 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.020
 the auditory on the contrary it speaks with you 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.330
 beside 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.220
 What is the first idea that you have a 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.770
 this situation 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.440
 the visual of the auditory intendant there 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:01.160
 we're talking about what he said was worth the 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.190
 nothing and the synestesis or synestesis that 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.080
 We call it annoying practice. 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.230
 sticky is that guy for him 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.940
 to talk to you 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:13.620
 has a mandatory need 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.090
 exclusive to get you 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.380
 is the one that speaks with the document the name 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:22.800
 baby, say good night and have a good day 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.240
 now imagine if jani is visual has 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.190
 visual feature 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.770
 when the synaesthetic face comes to 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.420
 talk to jane, good morning, get on the jana 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.820
 and Diana will do 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.840
 She'll step away so I can talk to him. 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.640
 thegood day 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.140
 are these situations that bring the 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.330
 day-to-day conflicts within the 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.650
 hospital is sometimes you are with a 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.450
 colleague his work he has 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.490
 more auditory characteristics than 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.990
 visual or more in the aesthetic than 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.780
 visual auditory 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:51.210
 then it is very important that you 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.520
 profile of people who work with you 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.530
 not only the profile of the structure 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.300
 material and all that in the 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.850
 nursing administration 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.290
 Let's break the item by item. 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.150
 will see that when we start to 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.500
 talk you will start to identify 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.050
 with each of them 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.060
 in certain situations and this is 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.530
 normal you have all three characteristics 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.480
 in you 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.850
 only there is one that goes without exacerbating 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.820
 more see that this has not returned because 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.200
 has improved ball 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.790
 I have class today tomorrow and then on 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.100
 Paraguayan side throat 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.240
 so let's go to parts to understand this 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.730
 first topic 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.260
 If someone a test asks you 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:31.110
 what is the characteristic of the individual 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.940
 visual he will not ask you type is 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.140
 who needs to maintain a space for 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.790
 talk to you 

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.310
 but this will already understand what it can 

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.440
 ask in the test and beforehand people 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.560
 is preparing you profanity banca 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.240
 then the class profile that will be 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.050
 given to you here is for the bank and 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.540
 aids 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:51.740
 They love pranks only you do not. 

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.740
 Are you going to fall for this trick?
