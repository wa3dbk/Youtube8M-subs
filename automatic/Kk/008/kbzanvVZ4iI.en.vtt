00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
mill you know it's just it's just how it

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.759 
mill you know it's just it's just how it
goes<00:03:03.280> um<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.750> if<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:04.989> do<00:03:05.140> that<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.650> know

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
goes um and and if you do that you know

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.340 
goes um and and if you do that you know
you're<00:03:05.920> gonna<00:03:06.010> basically<00:03:06.819> it's<00:03:07.660> it's<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.110> stop

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
you're gonna basically it's it's to stop

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.620 
you're gonna basically it's it's to stop
yourself<00:03:08.500> from<00:03:09.130> ever<00:03:09.610> actually<00:03:10.000> losing<00:03:10.600> money

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
yourself from ever actually losing money

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.350 
yourself from ever actually losing money
so<00:03:11.080> if<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:11.800> stake<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.280> mill<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.700> you<00:03:12.790> lose<00:03:13.000> you

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
so if you stake to mill and you lose you

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.020 
so if you stake to mill and you lose you
stay<00:03:13.570> four<00:03:13.959> mil<00:03:14.200> if<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.160> lose<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.549> four<00:03:15.820> mil

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
stay four mil if you lose the four mil

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.910 
stay four mil if you lose the four mil
you<00:03:16.209> stick<00:03:16.450> eight<00:03:16.660> million<00:03:16.959> eight<00:03:17.530> mil<00:03:17.769> you
