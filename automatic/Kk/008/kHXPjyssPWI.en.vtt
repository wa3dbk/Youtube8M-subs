00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.950
 Nine people and welcome to 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.570
 next episode here at f1 2013 and we 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.530
 go on with the already three 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.470
 tenth grand prix in this season we 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.630
 are the meanwhile at red bull 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.460
 and yes the next race is in 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.189
 singapore and that's that 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.410
 to split and I'm always there like that 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.480
 So remember, it really is not 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.029
 my favorite track but we will 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.980
 of course somehow try that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.040
 best to get out and I would say 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.390
 We also start loud out loud 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.020
 the weather data it should run where 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.020
 we are here now 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.350
 why does that open up now ? 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.430
 Eighth I should now someone oh so 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.720
 I still had a rival 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.970
 Anyway yes it looked like that 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.030
 as if now at the training today 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.430
 a bit of rain is not now 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.130
 further bad when it comes to training 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.390
 so stay with the qualifying and tomorrow 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.670
 that does not have to be the case when racing 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.590
 be sure but we will of course 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:21.840
 try to get the best out again 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.840
 and let's see if we can do it 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.039
 yes marina bay street is right here 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.200
 in the harbor and that's the first one 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.819
 to split into formula 1 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.509
 bahrain was there now 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:50.250
 not one to 51 currently 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.119
 percent rain probability i 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.259
 guess we can just go here 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.939
 I do not want to mature now either 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.490
 somehow great waste 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.030
 That's why we just take it completely 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.429
 short the finished mix and five rounds 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.959
 is thick and then we'll open 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.469
 The track is going to look at us like that 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.469
 little bit 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:15.470
 and then we really want to be here too 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.230
 leave it in a short session 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.180
 there is nothing to do so no 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.450
 challenge us somehow 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.450
 have to do it 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.140
 then it starts 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.879
 the track is very winding so the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.569
 always has me on a bit 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.799
 valencia reminds us because we are there 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.140
 just like me in valencia 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.140
 clearly better than here 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.740
 but we will manage it already 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.740
 here is the first drs zone 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.049
 It pulls out pretty well here 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.490
 yes that was not quite optimal but it 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.080
 is still working 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.450
 Also here in the hairpin super wide 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.240
 come out but that too is only 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.240
 go nuances that lost us here because 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.850
 We were clearly too fast now 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.850
 I underestimated the curve 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.470
 we just do not do that 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.610
 round broken but take the time 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.810
 flashback otherwise we have to go here 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.810
 start all over again 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.509
 we are now pretty much in the slip 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.860
 come there are bad over the curbs 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:30.590
 get as this is also a very 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.039
 dangerous curve the first of these 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.039
 both here 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.350
 and there was a little bit of it, too 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:47.720
 chaos and then it goes on here again 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:51.080
 the city a lot 147 5 that sounds a lot 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.910
 a lot of the slow but we have to 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.389
 let's wait and see what the time is worth us 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.460
 be back one after another 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.940
 let's just see if it is 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.940
 getting better 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.919
 yes, we were a bit far in there 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.669
 I was slower than I thought 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.000
 otherwise we would not have abbreviated 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.879
 there was a bit of a dollar brake 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.930
 brake well as I have now totally 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:36.650
 somehow lulls you into braking like this 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.650
 hammer still 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:53.480
 so that was pretty good far 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.620
 came out easily against the gang 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.620
 even think twice 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.449
 or break from it 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.160
 So the round has now destroyed 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:20.540
 I do not know like that now 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:23.260
 but before that was also the case 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.260
 was not very good 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.600
 14 seconds you can say only then 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.210
 We were not the same for the first time 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.470
 really fast but will improve 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.760
 we are not here anymore we go 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.720
 back to the box and then we look 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:43.750
 simply times how fast we were one 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:46.280
 has to say we were 30 anyway 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.990
 one second slower because of the tires 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.080
 Just have to look what the 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:53.750
 competition said and she says so 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:58.180
 quite a lot of advantage for 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.180
 us what is going on here 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.580
 So then we really have one 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:04.490
 Good round gets as it 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.139
 looks consistently in every sector 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.660
 we really better in the third sector 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.100
 even a second better so that can 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.630
 I almost do not believe that we two 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.530
 Seconds faster than the field is me 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:17.240
 think that is raining or raining yet 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.440
 not so I think so now 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.840
 I would not be admirable now 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.910
 Thought I'm curious if that 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.099
 because tomorrow will be like this at qualifying 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.780
 But I will not think so 

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:28.039
 in qualifying, the boys are then 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.780
 usually very good 

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:31.780
 well, I'm a bit surprised 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:35.000
 but good 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.919
 Let's take it with us and hopefully 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.479
 is it then in the next race also 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:40.039
 I will be happy again 

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:42.910
 if you will be there again 

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:46.430
 and yes, we'll meet again 

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:49.930
 It's good tomorrow at 12 in qualifying 

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.930
 people until then 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.550
 there
