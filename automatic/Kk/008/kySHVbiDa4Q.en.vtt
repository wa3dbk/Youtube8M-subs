00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.130
 i 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.650
 Y 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.099
 Y 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.300
 Y 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Y 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.629
 Y 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.370
 well the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.859
 put two tablespoons of butter 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.989
 melt in a pan after I go to 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.820
 add the onion and I'll leave to fry 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.969
 for a few minutes until you have a 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.579
 golden color immediately I will add 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.670
 the 2 garlic cloves finely chopped 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.510
 I'll let fry for about 2 or 3 minutes 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.519
 plus 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.830
 after this we are going to remove from 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.640
 fire and let's reserve 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.159
 here 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.080
 in another saucepan I'm going to melt 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.510
 the half cup of butter that I 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.070
 I'm still going to wait until it 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.580
 melt completely 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.580
 Y 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.880
 since the butter is completely 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.010
 melted I'm going to add the half cup of 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.790
 flour and with a balloon whisk I will 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.790
 start mixing 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.560
 Y 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.820
 Y 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.159
 well let's continue mixing and little to 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.789
 little let's go adding the hoffenheim 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.789
 or milk 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.740
 Y 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.960
 right away I'm going to add the chicken broth 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.090
 little by little it is important to be 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.649
 mixing all the time this is for 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.739
 prevent lumps from forming 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.739
 Y 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.380
 after adding chicken broth us 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.080
 is going to be a kind of cream which 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.290
 we will let simmer for 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.540
 about 20 minutes 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.000
 well after 20 minutes I'm going to 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.939
 add the broccoli the carrot and 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.189
 onion that we have reserved we are going to 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:38.640
 mix everything very well then I'm going to 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:41.400
 cover and I'll let cook for about 20 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.630
 25 minutes more or until the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.030
 vegetables are already soft 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.650
 since the vegetables are soft I'm going 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.710
 to season with a little pepper 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.440
 after this I'm going to add 4 ounces of 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.390
 grated cheddar cheese to the soup I'll go 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.310
 to mix continuously until the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.310
 cheese is completely melted 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.430
 well finally I'll add the nut 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.019
 moscada I will mix everything completely 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.019
 and I'm going to try salt 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.549
 Y 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.720
 Y 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.319
 good is so easy to make this soup 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.410
 last they can accompany it with a little 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.090
 of cheese on top so I hope that they 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.280
 Like any question, leave your 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.489
 comments and then we'll see each other for the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.489
 next 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.489
