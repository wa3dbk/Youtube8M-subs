but<00:01:31.160> this<00:01:31.310> time<00:01:31.520> we'll<00:01:31.730> choose<00:01:31.760> some<00:01:32.180> discreet

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
but this time we'll choose some discreet

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:40.050 
but this time we'll choose some discreet
tags<00:01:32.890> if<00:01:33.890> take<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.280> look<00:01:34.490> at<00:01:34.580> our<00:01:34.670> pump<00:01:34.940> statuses

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.240 

we'll<00:01:41.060> choose<00:01:41.330> those<00:01:41.600> five<00:01:41.870> pumps<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:43.160> we

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
we'll choose those five pumps and we

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.170 
we'll choose those five pumps and we
want<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.460> see<00:01:43.610> how<00:01:43.760> they've<00:01:43.910> been<00:01:44.030> operating

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
want to see how they've been operating

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.420 
want to see how they've been operating
again<00:01:44.870> in<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.110> last<00:01:45.260> hour<00:01:45.590> in<00:01:45.980> this<00:01:46.190> case

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
again in the last hour in this case

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.190 
again in the last hour in this case
instead<00:01:46.760> of<00:01:46.940> finding<00:01:47.270> min<00:01:47.420> Max<00:01:47.660> or<00:01:47.840> average

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
instead of finding min Max or average

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.750 
instead of finding min Max or average
I'll<00:01:48.440> look<00:01:48.620> at<00:01:48.770> how<00:01:48.860> many<00:01:49.040> times<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.490> pumps

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
I'll look at how many times the pumps

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.030 
I'll look at how many times the pumps
have<00:01:49.880> turned<00:01:50.120> on<00:01:50.300> and<00:01:50.450> off<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:51.440> running<00:01:51.680> time

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
have turned on and off the running time

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.890 
have turned on and off the running time
the<00:01:52.250> downtime<00:01:52.730> and<00:01:52.970> even<00:01:53.120> what<00:01:53.240> percentage<00:01:53.780> of

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
the downtime and even what percentage of

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.450 
the downtime and even what percentage of
the<00:01:54.020> last<00:01:54.200> hour<00:01:54.500> each<00:01:54.710> of<00:01:54.860> these<00:01:54.950> pumps<00:01:55.340> was

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
the last hour each of these pumps was

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.670 
the last hour each of these pumps was
running<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:55.970> could<00:01:56.720> do<00:01:56.840> additional<00:01:57.260> formatting

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
running I could do additional formatting

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.050 
running I could do additional formatting
we'll<00:01:57.980> leave<00:01:58.370> it<00:01:58.490> just<00:01:58.520> as<00:01:58.850> is<00:01:59.060> for<00:01:59.300> now<00:02:01.060> we'll

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
we'll leave it just as is for now we'll

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:13.290 
we'll leave it just as is for now we'll
give<00:02:02.210> it<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.360> title<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:09.649> we're<00:02:10.310> done<00:02:10.490> okay

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.390 

let's<00:02:14.300> add<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.570> chart<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.080> our<00:02:15.140> report<00:02:15.530> showing

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
let's add a chart to our report showing

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.280 
let's add a chart to our report showing
our<00:02:16.520> flow<00:02:16.760> rates<00:02:19.570> place<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.750> chart<00:02:20.990> over<00:02:21.140> here

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
our flow rates place the chart over here

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.720 
our flow rates place the chart over here
and<00:02:22.150> it's<00:02:23.150> take<00:02:23.420> off<00:02:23.690> again<00:02:24.200> for<00:02:24.440> our<00:02:24.530> last<00:02:24.800> 1

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
and it's take off again for our last 1

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.150 
and it's take off again for our last 1
hour<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.300> it's<00:02:27.080> not<00:02:27.290> sure<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.680> raw<00:02:27.770> values

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
hour and it's not sure the raw values

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.070 
hour and it's not sure the raw values
but<00:02:28.340> we'll<00:02:28.489> show<00:02:28.520> moving<00:02:29.000> averages<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.780> let's

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
but we'll show moving averages and let's

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.800 
but we'll show moving averages and let's
just<00:02:30.290> say<00:02:30.650> flow<00:02:31.010> one<00:02:31.250> add<00:02:31.520> that<00:02:31.970> line<00:02:33.280> two<00:02:36.670> and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
just say flow one add that line two and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.270 
just say flow one add that line two and
flow<00:02:38.810> three

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.740 

we'll<00:02:45.280> have<00:02:45.489> them<00:02:45.610> all<00:02:45.730> share<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.209> same<00:02:46.390> scale

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
we'll have them all share the same scale

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.740 
we'll have them all share the same scale
since<00:02:47.170> they're<00:02:47.349> all<00:02:47.470> flows<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:48.510> display<00:02:49.510> a

we're<00:03:35.590> going<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.830> do<00:03:35.950> is<00:03:36.099> do<00:03:36.250> it<00:03:36.310> just<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.580> little

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
we're going to do is do it just a little

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.600 
we're going to do is do it just a little
formatting<00:03:37.360> of<00:03:37.629> the<00:03:37.720> column<00:03:38.050> widths<00:03:38.349> and

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
formatting of the column widths and

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.320 
formatting of the column widths and
apply<00:03:39.610> a<00:03:40.230> layout<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.379> our<00:03:41.650> report<00:03:42.069> and<00:03:42.580> so

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
apply a layout to our report and so

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:55.259 
apply a layout to our report and so
let's<00:03:43.510> just<00:03:43.690> apply<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:44.019> page<00:03:44.319> template<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:54.310> at

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
let's just apply a page template and at

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.170 
let's just apply a page template and at
this<00:03:55.510> point<00:03:55.810> we're<00:03:56.620> ready<00:03:56.829> to<00:03:57.400> generate<00:03:57.730> our
