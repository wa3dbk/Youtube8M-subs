your kill streaks maybe another ability
is<00:01:05.869> more<00:01:06.170> suited<00:01:06.470> for<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:07.490> crafting<00:01:07.880> a

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
is more suited for you so the crafting a

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.890 
is more suited for you so the crafting a
bodyguard<00:01:08.390> is<00:01:08.450> actually<00:01:08.689> very

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
bodyguard is actually very

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.230 
bodyguard is actually very
straightforward<00:01:09.259> cool-down<00:01:10.100> is<00:01:10.369> obvious<00:01:11.090> I

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
straightforward cool-down is obvious I

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.719 
straightforward cool-down is obvious I
don't<00:01:11.570> find<00:01:11.810> it<00:01:11.990> to<00:01:12.020> be<00:01:12.229> very<00:01:12.259> worthwhile<00:01:13.159> for

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
don't find it to be very worthwhile for

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.160 
don't find it to be very worthwhile for
bodyguard<00:01:14.179> cuz<00:01:14.299> it's<00:01:14.479> only<00:01:14.600> 5<00:01:14.840> second

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
bodyguard cuz it's only 5 second

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.719 
bodyguard cuz it's only 5 second
increments<00:01:15.649> and<00:01:15.799> it<00:01:15.920> only<00:01:16.070> can<00:01:16.399> get<00:01:16.520> you<00:01:16.609> down

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
increments and it only can get you down

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.950 
increments and it only can get you down
to<00:01:16.759> 60<00:01:17.179> seconds<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:17.780> 6070<00:01:18.710> seconds<00:01:19.159> I<00:01:19.960> suggest

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
to 60 seconds so 6070 seconds I suggest

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.679 
to 60 seconds so 6070 seconds I suggest
overall<00:01:21.619> cooldowns<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.369> perk<00:01:22.640> as<00:01:22.880> opposed<00:01:23.600> to

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
overall cooldowns the perk as opposed to

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.109 
overall cooldowns the perk as opposed to
the<00:01:24.170> crafting<00:01:24.590> disability<00:01:25.280> now<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:25.819> ones

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
the crafting disability now the ones

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.300 
the crafting disability now the ones
that<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.299> think<00:01:26.780> is<00:01:27.109> a<00:01:27.170> perfect<00:01:27.649> blend<00:01:27.770> is<00:01:28.100> you

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
that I think is a perfect blend is you

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.489 
that I think is a perfect blend is you
craft<00:01:28.609> duration<00:01:29.149> up<00:01:29.299> one<00:01:29.509> and<00:01:29.749> range<00:01:30.020> up<00:01:30.289> one

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:30.499 
craft duration up one and range up one

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:33.880 
craft duration up one and range up one
duration<00:01:31.280> is<00:01:31.399> very<00:01:31.609> helpful<00:01:32.030> because<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:33.590> lets

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
duration is very helpful because it lets

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.099 
duration is very helpful because it lets
your<00:01:34.039> bodyguard<00:01:34.759> stay<00:01:34.999> on<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.479> field<00:01:35.689> of<00:01:35.840> play

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
your bodyguard stay on the field of play

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:37.660 
your bodyguard stay on the field of play
I<00:01:36.350> guess<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:36.740> could<00:01:36.859> say<00:01:36.889> long<00:01:37.310> enough<00:01:37.549> to

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
I guess you could say long enough to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.940 
I guess you could say long enough to
search<00:01:37.909> out<00:01:38.060> your<00:01:38.090> pursuer<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:38.840> saving<00:01:39.829> that

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
search out your pursuer and saving that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.410 
search out your pursuer and saving that
is<00:01:40.189> if<00:01:40.369> you<00:01:40.460> increase<00:01:40.819> the<00:01:40.999> range<00:01:41.210> a<00:01:41.299> little

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
is if you increase the range a little

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.690 
is if you increase the range a little
bit<00:01:41.659> it'll<00:01:41.869> go<00:01:42.139> farther<00:01:42.590> out<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.219> it'll<00:01:43.609> have

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
bit it'll go farther out so it'll have

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.910 
bit it'll go farther out so it'll have
more<00:01:43.999> time<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.539> go<00:01:44.630> even<00:01:44.869> farther<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.590> think

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
more time to go even farther I think

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.929 
more time to go even farther I think
that<00:01:46.009> there's<00:01:46.159> a<00:01:46.219> perfect<00:01:46.579> blend<00:01:46.759> between

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
that there's a perfect blend between

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.789 
that there's a perfect blend between
that<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.450> don't<00:01:47.840> think<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:48.109> need<00:01:48.229> duration<00:01:48.679> up

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
that I don't think you need duration up

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.469 
that I don't think you need duration up
all<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.100> way<00:01:49.219> because<00:01:49.549> if<00:01:49.729> you<00:01:49.819> just<00:01:50.030> wait<00:01:50.299> you

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
all the way because if you just wait you

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.910 
all the way because if you just wait you
know<00:01:50.569> you<00:01:50.630> guys<00:01:50.899> can<00:01:51.139> wait<00:01:51.289> actually<00:01:51.499> two<00:01:51.799> or

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
know you guys can wait actually two or

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.230 
know you guys can wait actually two or
three<00:01:52.100> seconds<00:01:52.429> for<00:01:52.579> your<00:01:52.639> pursuers<00:01:52.999> to<00:01:53.119> get

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
three seconds for your pursuers to get

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.389 
three seconds for your pursuers to get
by<00:01:53.420> you<00:01:53.479> if<00:01:53.749> you<00:01:53.869> have<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.020> good<00:01:54.200> feel<00:01:54.409> for<00:01:54.439> it<00:01:54.740> so

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
by you if you have a good feel for it so

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:56.980 
by you if you have a good feel for it so
you<00:01:55.759> know<00:01:55.850> that<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:56.299> can<00:01:56.420> just<00:01:56.600> do<00:01:56.689> with<00:01:56.869> your

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
you know that you can just do with your

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.489 
you know that you can just do with your
own<00:01:57.079> timing

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:57.499 
own timing

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:59.109 
own timing
honestly<00:01:57.859> duration<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.490> could<00:01:58.670> not<00:01:58.880> have

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
honestly duration you could not have

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.819 
honestly duration you could not have
range<00:01:59.509> might<00:01:59.810> be<00:01:59.959> the<00:02:00.049> most<00:02:00.229> important<00:02:00.679> I

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
range might be the most important I

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.099 
range might be the most important I
don't<00:02:01.219> think<00:02:01.639> it's<00:02:01.880> gonna<00:02:01.999> get<00:02:02.209> 10<00:02:02.479> meters<00:02:02.810> in

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
don't think it's gonna get 10 meters in

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.279 
don't think it's gonna get 10 meters in
a<00:02:03.619> you<00:02:04.009> know<00:02:04.130> 5<00:02:04.789> seconds<00:02:05.329> so<00:02:05.359> I<00:02:05.689> think<00:02:05.810> that's<00:02:06.139> a

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
a you know 5 seconds so I think that's a

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.410 
a you know 5 seconds so I think that's a
perfect<00:02:06.649> blend<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.039> that's<00:02:07.159> what<00:02:07.399> Samee<00:02:08.149> so

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
perfect blend and that's what Samee so

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.699 
perfect blend and that's what Samee so
you<00:02:08.479> know<00:02:08.600> take<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:08.990> from<00:02:09.200> somebody<00:02:09.440> with

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
you know take it from somebody with

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.470 
you know take it from somebody with
experience<00:02:10.670> I've<00:02:10.819> been<00:02:10.940> using<00:02:11.090> it<00:02:11.300> for<00:02:11.420> a

missing a beat I get the stun and then I

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.710 
missing a beat I get the stun and then I

kill obviously bodyguard as a defensive

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.000 
kill obviously bodyguard as a defensive
ability<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:30.720> would<00:03:30.930> not<00:03:31.170> be<00:03:31.440> using<00:03:31.769> it<00:03:31.890> if

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
ability so I would not be using it if

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.620 
ability so I would not be using it if
you<00:03:32.100> want<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.340> use<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.580> offensively<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:33.300> would

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
you want to use it offensively I would

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.449 
you want to use it offensively I would
honestly<00:03:33.870> say<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.650> should<00:03:34.950> probably<00:03:35.160> be

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
honestly say you should probably be

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.490 
honestly say you should probably be
using<00:03:35.610> decoy<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.239> can't<00:03:36.570> get<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.780> lure<00:03:37.110> every

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
using decoy you can't get a lure every

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.070 
using decoy you can't get a lure every
now<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.800> then<00:03:37.890> which<00:03:38.100> is<00:03:38.280> lucky<00:03:38.459> but<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.690> don't

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
now and then which is lucky but I don't

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.229 
now and then which is lucky but I don't
really<00:03:40.260> find<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.860> be<00:03:41.010> helpful<00:03:41.310> one<00:03:42.150> of

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
really find that to be helpful one of

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.000 
really find that to be helpful one of
the<00:03:42.300> downsides<00:03:42.480> is<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.350> have<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.739> have<00:03:43.890> your

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
the downsides is you have to have your

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.490 
the downsides is you have to have your
bodyguard<00:03:44.550> between<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.300> and<00:03:45.630> your<00:03:46.170> pursuer

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
bodyguard between you and your pursuer

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.900 
bodyguard between you and your pursuer
and<00:03:46.739> they<00:03:46.799> won't<00:03:46.980> like<00:03:47.130> reach<00:03:47.430> around<00:03:47.760> you

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
and they won't like reach around you

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.370 
and they won't like reach around you
they're<00:03:48.060> not<00:03:48.150> magic<00:03:48.450> or<00:03:48.750> anything<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:49.230> it's

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
they're not magic or anything so it's

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.500 
they're not magic or anything so it's
not<00:03:49.470> always<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:49.890> hundred<00:03:50.250> percent<00:03:50.580> guaranteed

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
not always a hundred percent guaranteed

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.030 
not always a hundred percent guaranteed
that<00:03:51.720> you're<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.140> get<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.410> stun<00:03:52.769> and

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
that you're going to get that stun and

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.430 
that you're going to get that stun and
of<00:03:53.670> course<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.209> does<00:03:54.480> not<00:03:54.600> add<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.840> your<00:03:55.200> kill

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
of course it does not add to your kill

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.289 
of course it does not add to your kill
streak<00:03:55.799> so<00:03:55.950> that's<00:03:56.130> also<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.519> downer<00:03:56.790> so<00:03:57.120> I

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
streak so that's also a downer so I

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.970 
streak so that's also a downer so I
think<00:03:57.570> it's<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.720> very<00:03:57.870> situational<00:03:58.590> perk<00:03:58.830> if

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
think it's a very situational perk if

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.440 
think it's a very situational perk if
you<00:03:59.130> know<00:03:59.280> how<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.489> use<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.910> that's<00:04:00.030> very<00:04:00.120> good

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
you know how to use it that's very good

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.600 
you know how to use it that's very good
not<00:04:01.019> for<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.290> aggressive<00:04:01.830> play<00:04:02.100> style

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
not for the aggressive play style

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.130 
not for the aggressive play style
I<00:04:02.700> wouldn't<00:04:02.970> say<00:04:03.120> if<00:04:03.330> you're<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.630> stealthier

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
I wouldn't say if you're a stealthier

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.570 
I wouldn't say if you're a stealthier
player<00:04:04.470> if<00:04:04.680> you'd<00:04:04.830> like<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:05.040> take<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.220> slower

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
player if you'd like to take a slower

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.670 
player if you'd like to take a slower
approach<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.269> Assassin's<00:04:06.780> Creed<00:04:07.049> online

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
approach to the Assassin's Creed online

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.070 
approach to the Assassin's Creed online
game<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.700> sphere<00:04:09.269> or<00:04:09.480> whatever<00:04:09.810> you<00:04:09.930> may<00:04:10.049> call

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
game a sphere or whatever you may call

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.600 
game a sphere or whatever you may call
it<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.470> think<00:04:10.500> bodyguards<00:04:11.070> gonna<00:04:11.220> really<00:04:11.430> work

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.060 
it I think bodyguards gonna really work
out<00:04:11.760> for<00:04:11.820> you<00:04:12.090> more<00:04:13.080> often<00:04:13.380> than<00:04:13.560> not<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.769> would

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
use it in solo matches like wanted or

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.140 
use it in solo matches like wanted or
deathmatch<00:04:18.440> I<00:04:19.440> don't<00:04:20.190> really<00:04:20.340> find<00:04:20.609> assasin<00:04:21.060> I

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.370 
abilities such as smoke bomb and/or
firecrackers<00:04:28.140> that<00:04:28.320> would<00:04:28.410> be<00:04:28.530> more<00:04:28.740> effect

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
firecrackers that would be more effect

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.810 
firecrackers that would be more effect
