baby<00:02:54.510> like<00:02:54.870> its<00:02:55.080> face<00:02:55.440> wrapped<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.610> towels<00:02:56.910> or

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
baby like its face wrapped in towels or

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.600 
baby like its face wrapped in towels or
on<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:59.630> like<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.660> rug<00:03:00.990> or<00:03:01.260> whatever<00:03:01.560> we<00:03:02.490> will

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
on a like a rug or whatever we will

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.990 
on a like a rug or whatever we will
angle<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.450> softbox<00:03:04.050> almost<00:03:04.860> directly<00:03:05.250> down

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
angle the softbox almost directly down

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.140 
angle the softbox almost directly down
so<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.540> lighting<00:03:06.750> comes<00:03:07.230> down<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.830> nice<00:03:08.700> soft

highly recommend just playing with your
lights<00:03:14.070> moving<00:03:14.790> them<00:03:15.180> around<00:03:15.300> seeing<00:03:15.960> what

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
lights moving them around seeing what

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.160
