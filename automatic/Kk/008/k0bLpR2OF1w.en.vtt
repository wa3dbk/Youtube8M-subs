a technician boost but a sucker punch

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.200 
a technician boost but a sucker punch
would<00:04:54.289> still<00:04:54.620> probably<00:04:54.889> be<00:04:55.279> a<00:04:55.310> better<00:04:56.060> option

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
would still probably be a better option

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.510 
would still probably be a better option
but<00:04:56.750> oh<00:04:56.779> well<00:04:57.110> in<00:04:57.469> this<00:04:57.740> case<00:04:57.949> it<00:04:58.219> didn't

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
but oh well in this case it didn't

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.309 
but oh well in this case it didn't
really<00:04:58.729> make<00:04:59.000> too<00:04:59.270> big<00:04:59.300> of<00:04:59.569> a<00:04:59.659> difference<00:04:59.840> and
