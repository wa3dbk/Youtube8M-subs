00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.410
 welcome to legends and video games the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.690
 show that as the majority is not 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.570
 funded by the US government ni 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.610
 by no other 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.680
 the legend of polybius is one of the most 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.619
 infamous of the world of video games a 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.150
 arcade machine allegedly thrown in 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.800
 1981 in the portland recreational areas that 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.140
 according to the story, he was capable of 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.970
 provoke nightmares hallucinations dizziness 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.640
 memory loss and even the 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.960
 suicide of the players yes yes I do not know the 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.490
 subject is very seen and all that 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.019
 know the history you will know that the lack 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.070
 of evidence makes it quite evident that 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.870
 it's about an urban legend 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.350
 apparently based on the video game you 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.500
 roth enters 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.730
 supposed creator of Libyan poems in turn 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.620
 a mayor machine used by the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.690
 US government as a tool for 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.159
 wash the mind of the younger ones should 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.170
 of being a conspiracy theory 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.030
 like any other truth the government 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.469
 American is 100% honest with his 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.320
 inhabitants and I would not be able to do 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.870
 something like that, not if you think that's the same 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.329
 you should go back to your world of illusion 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.920
 I am a magical man from the happy country of 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.729
 the jelly house on Calle de la 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.259
 lollipop last week we talked about 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.610
 that scientists value the possibility 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.830
 that our entire universe is one 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.300
 simulation having this present is not 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.069
 so crazy to think that a group of 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.200
 scientists have experienced through 

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:15.090
 of the use of video games let's start seeing 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.100
 the history of polybius 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.810
 any day of the year 81 in the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.609
 portland recreational 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.710
 arcades the arcades with the 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:24.179
 Paul's name and views supposedly in 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.710
 the game the player controls a ship 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:27.569
 space in a strange combination of 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.979
 Pretty puzzle style phases 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.149
 innovative for the time so much of 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.149
 gameplay as visually 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.490
 the game became very popular creating 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.569
 addiction in many players and doing 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.369
 Earn enough money to the owners 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.229
 of the recreational ones because each day 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.790
 they created very long lines just to play 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.770
 to politicians 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.540
 those who played talked about lights 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.860
 stroboscopic and combined graphics 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.600
 with a pretty strong music that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.940
 caused neurological conditions like 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.220
 hallucinations epilepsy terrors 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.350
 nightly etcetera as well as messages 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.560
 subliminals urging players to 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.700
 commit suicide or do not question the authority 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.960
 after the suicide of a young man 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.400
 gentlemen dressed in black who had 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.750
 been seen collecting data from the 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.070
 machine they made disappear all the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.750
 copies of polybius so as not to return 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.729
 see them again 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.110
 the machine would supposedly be a 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.060
 experiment carried out by the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.920
 US government is in the world 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.180
 where all the superheroes live and 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.340
 where disasters occur all 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.200
 natural but it is also a republic 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.270
 federal constitutional this does not have 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.320
 nothing to see but wanted to say it where 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.880
 it is known that they have been made 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.070
 horrible experiments on animals and 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.420
 human is obvious that all countries 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.070
 of the world occurs in investigations 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.959
 experiments and discoveries that do not 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.850
 they come to light but they are only those 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.200
 that filter those that make us give us 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.930
 account of the perversion of the mind 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.310
 humane from us we get jewelry like 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.989
 files that prove that was introduced 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.000
 soldiers in mustard gas chambers to 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.489
 check its effects or even spray 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.260
 whole cities with chemical agents or 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.300
 directly drug civilians with lsd 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.500
 without your consent one of the 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.940
 most known experiments and 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.650
 directly related to the control 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.870
 of the mind would be the mk-ultra project 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.070
 where the CIA was looking for methods to 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.130
 control the mind with signals 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.230
 electrical and drugs 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.060
 certainly under the apparent reality 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.530
 that we live there is a huge world of 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.480
 confidential information that we are 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.940
 hides from the population experiments with 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.200
 human mind control maybe by Libyans 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.420
 it was simply an urban legend 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.860
 but all the video games we play 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.680
 have a greater or lesser effect of 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.840
 us make us feel good make us 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.510
 feel made angry we 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.040
 thrill for all those who we 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.600
 they like video games these are 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.360
 they become part of our lives 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.640
 but that makes you think that none of 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.080
 they contain subliminal messages if 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.790
 let's read between the lines we would see that 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.650
 tetris rewards us for putting order in the 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.990
 chaos or that super mario has many 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.210
 similarities with communism but all 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.740
 that's other stories and for now that 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.210
 it has been all for today we see the 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.890
 next friday with a new episode of 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.280
 Legends and videogames until the week 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.280
 coming
