00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820
 this is Mariano problems 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.730
 doublets is the sensuality in the voice of the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.040
 name as much as a 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.380
 man to conquer the final public 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.380
 same from a poblete mariano scenario 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.590
 is 21 years old is what he and since 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.150
 very young had a somewhat nomadic life and 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.490
 old they separated when I had 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.070
 four years the two were very hippie like that 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.199
 that we always had a little in gala with 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.809
 the arrival of adolescence to mariah 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.980
 he was not presented with an opportunity that 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.870
 he wanted to waste 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.570
 I always wanted to live with 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.559
 my friends so when I turned twelve 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.559
 years my daughter told me 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.329
 that made me become independent 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.039
 emotionally 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.930
 that experience gave him a great 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:02.559
 security that showed in the different 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.559
 stages of the voice as well as you stop 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.229
 there is a potential of rockstar sex-symbol 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.539
 I 'm seeing , however, behind 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.789
 that image of apparent indifference is 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.670
 hides a sensitive guy that makes you 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:19.610
 honor to his affections Mariano has two 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.560
 weaknesses his grandmother maria elvira and his 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.240
 great-grandmother daisy from small 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.700
 I always spent a lot of time with my 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.069
 Grandmothers are the best 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.770
 they are your refuge when you need them 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.770
 and the first to applaud their triumphs 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.680

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.960
