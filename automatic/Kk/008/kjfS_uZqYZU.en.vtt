00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.520
 and the scale 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.990
 They are the Maderense who is here in Peru 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:47.390
 is similar to the one that is marketed in 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:50.360
 europe now you have 265 horses and 360 a 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.800
 newton meters from here we both have 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.150
 called a single version the version 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.130
 craft that is the highest version of 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.770
 mégane in Europe there are two versions 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.780
 the band that is the same as here and another 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.520
 Once I call sport what I can 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.690
 to say is that those vehicles 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.150
 they have to manage to feel and 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.270
 understand everything behind it that does not 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.480
 they are just a powerful engine but there 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.990
 brakes suspension some direction all 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.990
 is made so that the car is the most 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.820
 sure possible walking like any 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.630
 person 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.630
 sky pool 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.000
 in the line 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.079
 if the same model is the new renault 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.119
 mégane rs in the motorshow we did the 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.189
 official presentation but today 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.409
 We are here in the Chutana making the 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.539
 dynamic test of the vehicle everything 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.670
 we tell you in the motorshow about the 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.909
 truck power the performance the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.619
 grab all those qualities that 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.630
 have the vehicle today we are 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.310
 here in the chutana so they can 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.500
 check that everything we have is 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.149
 a reality the megane rs is found 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.310
 in one version the full version 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.509
 equipped chassis cap which is the one 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.789
 we are testing today and 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.350
 we show in the motorshow the price the 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.530
 single price the transaction price of 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.519
 this product is 39 thousand 990 dollars 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.569
 dear friends of all cars we 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.670
 we look forward to all of our 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.310
 national reindeer dealers 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.140
 so they can try the renault range and 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.420
 specifically in our premises 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.099
 the San Miguel mill and furrow for 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.250
 that they know and try the new mégane 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.250
 rs 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.610
 m 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.840
 megan rs probably one of the 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.140
 best production cars for the 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.610
 circuit 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.580
 to his 265 horses in this version 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.370
 they are firm effective I consider that 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.430
 this is a pureblood 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.210
 in every sense of the word 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.600
 the car has powers 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.520
 the turbo engine is awesome how 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.850
 it works like working on the relationship 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.319
 balance we have a combination with ones 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.590
 brakes we think of four pistons 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.170
 these brake brakes could be said 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.150
 that are installed in thousands of ways but 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.549
 grab a balance of the form that in 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.680
 renault has done it sport is 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.129
 impressive another peculiarity of 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.600
 car is your suspension your suspension 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.400
 has a system 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.890
 to which probably many are 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.990
 familiar is the super street the 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.730
 on these are two arms but the 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.280
 particularity of this is that it pivots in 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.230
 the upper zone and that is to say that the 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.330
 time you turn you do not break 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.010
 never lose the alignment of the change 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.930
 which is very important 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.120
 in the moments that you are pulling the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.500
 car you are applying power from the 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.330
 best cars I had driven in my 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.330
 life are this car between 2 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.349
 if I like balance of the car 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:18.359
 he says go and go when he wants 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.359
 brand new one folds doubles 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.280
 the ones you can not have 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.280
 that we decided 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.070
 Y 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.090
 rivas 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.449
 this is how 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.449
 live
