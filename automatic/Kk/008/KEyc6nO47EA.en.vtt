00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.310

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.120
 forming the team of giffords 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.550
 and that entails notice agreements in a 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.329
 group of friends we met we already know 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.740
 all of you will have done it 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.740
 We enjoyed playing as a team or 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.820
 we laughed but above all we went 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.439
 enjoying more the game the way 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.380
 competitive 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.630
 we were participating a lot in clan match 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.640
 we were not asked for challenges we liked 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.970
 much the environment that was done and 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.670
 you know you do not care in the game 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.140
 I do not know the nerves but personally it is 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.010
 a game that is enjoyed very much with 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.780
 friends and what better than also to weigh 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.819
 to be a game that although they can be 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.430
 apply and demonstrate a good level and 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:25.400
 have a better time with yourself and with 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.220

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.780

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.470

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.210
 we try to share everything that 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.150
 what we know and what we can 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.780
