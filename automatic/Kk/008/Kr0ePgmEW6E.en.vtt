in<00:00:15.410> this<00:00:16.410> tutorial<00:00:16.619> we'll<00:00:17.010> be<00:00:17.039> using<00:00:17.160> layers

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
in this tutorial we'll be using layers

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.570 
in this tutorial we'll be using layers
to<00:00:18.119> highlight<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.050> fingers<00:00:19.560> hands<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.189> lower

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
to highlight the fingers hands and lower

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.849 
to highlight the fingers hands and lower
arm<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.270> miniature<00:00:21.660> as<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.500> can<00:00:22.680> see

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
arm of this miniature as you can see

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.140 
arm of this miniature as you can see
we've<00:00:23.039> already<00:00:23.189> started<00:00:23.519> with<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.880> first

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
we've already started with the first

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.269 
we've already started with the first
layer<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.900> first<00:00:25.170> layer<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.410> made<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.000 
coloured Gori red the paint needs to be
thin<00:00:33.420> enough<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.719> not<00:00:34.079> leave<00:00:34.350> brushstrokes

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.020 
now that I have the hands of fingers
done<00:02:12.010> I'm<00:02:12.160> going<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.370> start<00:02:12.580> working<00:02:12.820> on<00:02:12.940> the

lower arm this miniature using the exact

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.000 
lower arm this miniature using the exact
same<00:02:15.250> process<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:15.820> we<00:02:16.030> used<00:02:16.270> before<00:02:17.010> now

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
same process that we used before now

same process that we used before now
this<00:02:18.250> area<00:02:18.520> is<00:02:18.640> big<00:02:19.000> enough<00:02:19.210> they're<00:02:19.390> acting

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
this area is big enough they're acting

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.620 
this area is big enough they're acting
technically<00:02:20.470> use<00:02:20.710> glazing<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.550> order<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.940> get

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
technically use glazing in order to get

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.810 
technically use glazing in order to get
the<00:02:22.750> same<00:02:22.900> effect<00:02:23.080> but<00:02:23.770> on<00:02:24.040> these<00:02:24.250> chaos

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
the same effect but on these chaos

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.200 
the same effect but on these chaos
chosen<00:02:25.270> models<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.840> detail<00:02:26.320> is<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:26.620> closely

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
chosen models the detail is so closely

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.790 
chosen models the detail is so closely
impacted<00:02:28.210> that<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.870> didn't<00:02:29.350> think<00:02:29.410> I'd<00:02:29.590> get<00:02:29.710> a

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
impacted that I didn't think I'd get a

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.590 
impacted that I didn't think I'd get a
very<00:02:30.040> good<00:02:30.100> effect<00:02:30.520> so<00:02:30.820> I<00:02:30.850> decided<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.450> use

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
very good effect so I decided to use

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.900 
very good effect so I decided to use
layering<00:02:32.020> plus<00:02:32.620> on<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.190> smaller<00:02:33.520> areas

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
layering plus on the smaller areas

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.180 
layering plus on the smaller areas
layering<00:02:34.270> really<00:02:34.540> is<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.690> lot<00:02:34.900> faster<00:02:38.040> now<00:02:39.040> when

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
layering really is a lot faster now when

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.790 
layering really is a lot faster now when
you<00:02:39.280> do<00:02:39.460> start<00:02:39.760> using<00:02:40.110> layering<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.230> larger

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
you do start using layering the larger

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.290 
you do start using layering the larger
areas<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.490> definitely<00:02:42.940> want<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.120> start

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
areas you definitely want to start

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.750 
areas you definitely want to start
adding<00:02:43.960> in<00:02:44.080> more<00:02:44.320> than<00:02:44.500> just<00:02:44.770> three<00:02:45.070> steps<00:02:45.490> or

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
adding in more than just three steps or

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.510 
adding in more than just three steps or
three<00:02:45.820> transitional<00:02:46.780> colors<00:02:47.520> you're

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
three transitional colors you're

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.930 
three transitional colors you're
painting<00:02:49.000> what<00:02:49.930> that<00:02:50.110> does<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:51.250> enhances

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
painting what that does is it enhances

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.110 
painting what that does is it enhances
the<00:02:52.560> gradient<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.770> it<00:02:54.190> makes<00:02:54.460> it<00:02:54.790> makes<00:02:54.970> the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
the gradient and it makes it makes the

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.390 
the gradient and it makes it makes the
illusion<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:56.080> smooth<00:02:56.380> gradient<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:56.980> lot<00:02:57.220> more

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
illusion of a smooth gradient a lot more

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.700 
illusion of a smooth gradient a lot more

a shoulder pad and ideally you'd use

want to get the paint job done now you

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.770 
want to get the paint job done now you
see<00:03:23.500> here<00:03:23.709> that<00:03:23.890> I<00:03:24.160> did<00:03:24.760> get<00:03:25.120> some<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.570> red

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
see here that I did get some of the red

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.240 
see here that I did get some of the red
on<00:03:25.989> that<00:03:26.260> back<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.680> bolt<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.100> that's

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
on that back of the bolt and that's

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.220 
on that back of the bolt and that's
really<00:03:27.459> easily<00:03:27.910> fixable<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:28.750> you<00:03:28.870> just<00:03:29.020> go

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
really easily fixable and you just go

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.260 
really easily fixable and you just go
over<00:03:29.350> with<00:03:29.560> black<00:03:29.739> again<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:30.459> you<00:03:30.970> know<00:03:31.060> if<00:03:31.180> you

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
over with black again so you know if you

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:54.550 
over with black again so you know if you
make<00:03:31.450> mistakes<00:03:31.810> like<00:03:31.959> that<00:03:32.020> not<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.770> huge<00:03:33.010> deal
