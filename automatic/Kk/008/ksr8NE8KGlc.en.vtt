00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
say drive the road that everything noted

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.260 
say drive the road that everything noted
as<00:00:38.620> it<00:00:38.739> should<00:00:38.920> be<00:00:39.070> so<00:00:39.309> we<00:00:39.430> can<00:00:39.579> then<00:00:39.940> attack

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
as it should be so we can then attack

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.780

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
basically a rally note system is broken

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.420 
basically a rally note system is broken
down<00:00:52.329> into<00:00:52.390> a<00:00:52.629> number<00:00:53.079> system<00:00:53.410> it's<00:00:53.890> just<00:00:54.039> more

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
down into a number system it's just more

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.340 
down into a number system it's just more
simple<00:00:54.789> than<00:00:54.820> then<00:00:55.510> using<00:00:55.809> words<00:00:55.989> to<00:00:56.140> try

everything<00:00:56.590> a<00:00:56.800> 6<00:00:57.219> this<00:00:57.340> pretty<00:00:57.550> much<00:00:57.700> means

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
everything a 6 this pretty much means

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.900 
everything a 6 this pretty much means
you<00:00:58.030> hold<00:00:58.180> it<00:00:58.270> wide<00:00:58.390> open<00:00:58.420> and<00:00:58.840> one<00:00:59.440> means<00:00:59.910> pull

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
you hold it wide open and one means pull

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.700 
you hold it wide open and one means pull
the<00:01:01.030> handbrake<00:01:01.239> do<00:01:01.750> a<00:01:01.780> 180<00:01:02.110> and<00:01:02.199> go<00:01:02.379> back<00:01:02.530> and

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
the handbrake do a 180 and go back and

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.200 
the handbrake do a 180 and go back and
pretty<00:01:02.860> much<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.070> same<00:01:03.190> direction<00:01:03.370> for<00:01:03.699> this

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
pretty much the same direction for this

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.150 
pretty much the same direction for this
particular<00:01:04.750> stage<00:01:04.930> we<00:01:05.680> have<00:01:05.770> to<00:01:05.890> make<00:01:06.009> our<00:01:06.039> own

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
particular stage we have to make our own

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.609 
particular stage we have to make our own
notes<00:01:06.460> which<00:01:06.700> basically<00:01:07.180> means<00:01:07.450> we<00:01:08.380> mark

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
notes which basically means we mark

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.710 
notes which basically means we mark
every<00:01:08.890> corner<00:01:09.160> if<00:01:09.759> it<00:01:09.910> increases<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.450> radius

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
every corner if it increases the radius

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.149 
every corner if it increases the radius
decreases<00:01:10.899> the<00:01:11.290> radius<00:01:11.590> how<00:01:11.770> far<00:01:12.040> it<00:01:12.100> is

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
decreases the radius how far it is

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.710 
decreases the radius how far it is
between<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.490> next<00:01:12.700> corner<00:01:12.880> every<00:01:13.510> blind

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
between the next corner every blind

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
crust if you can take it wide open if

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.950 
crust if you can take it wide open if
you<00:01:15.369> have<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.610> aim<00:01:15.939> left<00:01:16.299> or<00:01:16.479> right<00:01:16.630> off<00:01:16.780> of<00:01:16.810> a
