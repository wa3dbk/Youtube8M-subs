make sure that we're going to have a

make sure that we're going to have a
robust<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.409> usable<00:01:01.799> file<00:01:02.009> I'm<00:01:02.400> going<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
robust and usable file I'm going to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.310 
robust and usable file I'm going to
recommend<00:01:03.000> another<00:01:03.540> way<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.780> sharpening<00:01:04.259> your

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
recommend another way of sharpening your

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.679 
recommend another way of sharpening your
images<00:01:05.009> and<00:01:05.220> that's<00:01:05.670> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.119> using<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
images and that's going to be using the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.530 
images and that's going to be using the
high-pass<00:01:06.960> filter<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:09.090> let's<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.390> started

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
high-pass filter so let's get started

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.749 
high-pass filter so let's get started
the<00:01:10.530> first<00:01:10.770> thing<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.100> need<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.520> is

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
the first thing that you need to do is

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.999 
the first thing that you need to do is
make<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> copy<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.659> your<00:01:12.869> background<00:01:13.079> layer<00:01:13.470> I'm

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
make a copy of your background layer I'm

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.710 
make a copy of your background layer I'm
going<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.369> grab<00:01:14.520> my<00:01:14.790> background<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.450> I'm<00:01:15.540> just

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
going to grab my background and I'm just

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.120 
going to grab my background and I'm just
going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> drag<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.170> down<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> new<00:01:16.950> layer

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
going to drag it down to the new layer

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.310 
going to drag it down to the new layer
icon<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.729> as<00:01:18.329> you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.600> see<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.840> quickly<00:01:19.049> makes

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
icon and as you can see it quickly makes

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.790 
icon and as you can see it quickly makes
a<00:01:19.500> background<00:01:20.040> copy<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:21.630> next<00:01:21.960> we<00:01:22.560> need<00:01:22.590> to

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
a background copy the next we need to

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.430 
a background copy the next we need to
make<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.220> an<00:01:23.490> overlay<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.330> as<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.409> see

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
make this an overlay and as you can see

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.710 
make this an overlay and as you can see
that's<00:01:25.710> really<00:01:26.100> enhance<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> contrast<00:01:27.120> made

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that's really enhance the contrast made

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.840 
that's really enhance the contrast made
really<00:01:27.960> punchy<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.370> a<00:01:29.400> two-step

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
really punchy but this is a two-step

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.360 
really punchy but this is a two-step
process<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.630> when<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:31.320> employ<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.860> high-pass

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
process so when we employ the high-pass

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.219 
process so when we employ the high-pass
filter<00:01:32.820> you'll<00:01:33.030> see<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.330> contrast<00:01:33.900> just

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
filter you'll see this contrast just

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.430 
filter you'll see this contrast just
fade<00:01:34.409> away<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:36.210> we're<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.510> to<00:01:36.750> use<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
fade away so we're going to use the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.780 
fade away so we're going to use the
high-pass<00:01:37.710> filters<00:01:38.130> we're<00:01:38.310> going<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.490> go<00:01:38.640> up

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
high-pass filters we're going to go up

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.080 
high-pass filters we're going to go up
to<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.060> filter<00:01:39.590> other<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.909> right

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
to the filter other and it's just right

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.070 
to the filter other and it's just right
here<00:01:42.270> under<00:01:42.630> high<00:01:42.780> pass

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.960 

as<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.860> see<00:01:46.980> that<00:01:47.130> contrast<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.730> just

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
as you can see that contrast is just

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.120 
as you can see that contrast is just
sort<00:01:48.150> of<00:01:48.210> gated<00:01:49.200> away<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.920> high

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
sort of gated away because of the high

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.840 
sort of gated away because of the high
pass<00:01:50.340> filter<00:01:50.730> that<00:01:50.880> we're<00:01:51.060> now<00:01:51.180> employing

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
pass filter that we're now employing

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.429 
pass filter that we're now employing
now<00:01:53.180> any<00:01:53.420> time<00:01:53.510> you<00:01:53.689> are<00:01:53.810> doing<00:01:54.170> any

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
now any time you are doing any

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.780 
now any time you are doing any
sharpening<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.070> always<00:01:55.250> want<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.520> view<00:01:55.610> the

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
sharpening you always want to view the

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.850 
sharpening you always want to view the
image<00:01:56.119> at<00:01:56.600> a<00:01:56.659> hundred<00:01:57.080> percent<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:57.650> I'm<00:01:57.740> just

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
image at a hundred percent so I'm just

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.899 
image at a hundred percent so I'm just
going<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.040> zoom<00:01:58.340> in<00:01:58.460> on<00:01:58.580> one<00:01:58.670> hundred<00:01:58.880> percent

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
going to zoom in on one hundred percent

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.999 
going to zoom in on one hundred percent
and<00:01:59.479> I'm<00:01:59.750> just<00:01:59.900> going<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.080> find<00:02:00.350> an<00:02:00.560> area<00:02:00.860> that

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
and I'm just going to find an area that

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.760 
and I'm just going to find an area that
has<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.310> bit<00:02:01.549> of<00:02:01.580> detail<00:02:02.060> like<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:03.440> eyebrow

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
has a bit of detail like the the eyebrow

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.570 
has a bit of detail like the the eyebrow
here<00:02:04.190> in<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.670> eyelashes<00:02:05.270> on<00:02:05.479> on<00:02:05.810> our<00:02:05.869> model

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
here in the eyelashes on on our model

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.919 
here in the eyelashes on on our model
now<00:02:07.580> you<00:02:07.640> can<00:02:07.790> see<00:02:08.000> here<00:02:08.239> too<00:02:08.450> we<00:02:08.569> do<00:02:08.750> have<00:02:08.899> a

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
now you can see here too we do have a

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.199 
now you can see here too we do have a
preview<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.590> high<00:02:09.770> pass<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.429> just<00:02:11.060> going

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
preview of the high pass and just going

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.850 
preview of the high pass and just going
to<00:02:11.300> zoom<00:02:11.780> out<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:11.989> that<00:02:12.290> we<00:02:12.380> can<00:02:12.530> have<00:02:12.739> a<00:02:12.770> little

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
to zoom out so that we can have a little

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.410 
to zoom out so that we can have a little
bit<00:02:13.220> more<00:02:13.720> viewing

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
bit more viewing

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.720 
bit more viewing
and<00:02:16.510> as<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.290> can<00:02:17.440> see<00:02:17.470> this<00:02:17.740> is<00:02:17.950> how<00:02:18.190> the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
and as you can see this is how the

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.940 
and as you can see this is how the
high-pass<00:02:19.150> filter<00:02:19.569> views<00:02:19.900> it's<00:02:20.500> basically<00:02:20.860> a

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
high-pass filter views it's basically a

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.949 
high-pass filter views it's basically a
gray<00:02:21.700> layer<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.180> it's<00:02:22.330> basically<00:02:22.510> showing

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
gray layer and it's basically showing

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.140 
gray layer and it's basically showing
you<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.260> tonal<00:02:23.590> differences<00:02:24.130> between<00:02:24.340> areas

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
you the tonal differences between areas

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.610 
you the tonal differences between areas
of<00:02:25.860> sharp<00:02:26.860> contrast<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.599> as<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.319> can<00:02:29.410> see

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
of sharp contrast so as you can see

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.170 
of sharp contrast so as you can see
where<00:02:29.830> we<00:02:29.950> have<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.160> lot<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.430> contrast<00:02:30.970> areas

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
where we have a lot of contrast areas

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.809 
where we have a lot of contrast areas
here<00:02:31.630> in<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.840> eyebrow<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.500> in<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.250> eyelashes

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
here in the eyebrow and in the eyelashes

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.150 
here in the eyebrow and in the eyelashes
we're<00:02:33.970> getting<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.209> little<00:02:34.300> bit<00:02:34.480> more<00:02:34.600> detail

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
we're getting a little bit more detail

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.320 
we're getting a little bit more detail
now<00:02:36.160> there's<00:02:36.340> only<00:02:36.459> one<00:02:36.760> slider<00:02:37.090> in<00:02:37.239> the

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
now there's only one slider in the

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.030 
now there's only one slider in the
high-pass<00:02:37.690> filter<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.350> that's<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.650> radius

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
high-pass filter and that's the radius

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.790 
high-pass filter and that's the radius
as<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:40.239> see<00:02:40.420> as<00:02:40.810> we<00:02:41.080> increase<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.680> the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
as you see as we increase it to the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.420 
as you see as we increase it to the
right<00:02:41.980> we<00:02:42.519> are<00:02:42.670> getting<00:02:42.850> more<00:02:43.120> detail<00:02:43.630> in<00:02:44.430> both

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
right we are getting more detail in both

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.699 
right we are getting more detail in both
the<00:02:45.580> eyebrow<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.269> we're<00:02:47.110> also<00:02:47.230> picking<00:02:47.440> up<00:02:47.650> a

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
the eyebrow and we're also picking up a

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.110 
the eyebrow and we're also picking up a
little<00:02:47.890> bit<00:02:47.980> more<00:02:48.099> detail<00:02:48.489> in<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.730> skin<00:02:48.970> as

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
little bit more detail in the skin as

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.449 
little bit more detail in the skin as
well<00:02:49.440> now<00:02:50.440> when<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.739> aren't<00:02:50.920> employing<00:02:51.310> the

well now when you aren't employing the

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.720 
well now when you aren't employing the
high-pass<00:02:51.790> filter<00:02:52.269> it<00:02:52.510> is<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:52.690> balance<00:02:53.110> between

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
high-pass filter it is a balance between

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.920 
high-pass filter it is a balance between
sharpening<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.850> details<00:02:55.299> that<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.569> want<00:02:55.810> to

background here you can almost see that

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.880 
background here you can almost see that
we<00:03:04.600> are<00:03:04.780> getting<00:03:04.989> a<00:03:05.140> little<00:03:05.230> bit<00:03:05.440> more<00:03:05.590> pix

to<00:03:24.820> where<00:03:25.000> we<00:03:25.150> were<00:03:25.329> before<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.690> thought<00:03:26.109> that

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
to where we were before I thought that

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.949 
to where we were before I thought that
looked<00:03:26.350> fairly<00:03:26.680> good<00:03:26.980> maybe<00:03:27.700> around<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.060> 33

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
looked fairly good maybe around the 33

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.170 
looked fairly good maybe around the 33
point<00:03:29.230> as<00:03:29.410> you<00:03:29.920> can<00:03:30.070> see<00:03:30.280> we<00:03:30.519> we<00:03:30.820> don't<00:03:30.940> have<00:03:31.150> a

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
point as you can see we we don't have a

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.819 
point as you can see we we don't have a
lot<00:03:31.420> of<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.600> detail<00:03:32.019> that<00:03:32.049> we<00:03:32.320> were<00:03:32.440> seeing<00:03:32.709> in

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
lot of the detail that we were seeing in

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.009 
lot of the detail that we were seeing in
the<00:03:32.920> skin<00:03:33.160> before<00:03:33.340> but<00:03:34.180> we<00:03:34.299> do<00:03:34.450> still<00:03:34.510> have<00:03:34.810> a

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
the skin before but we do still have a

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.440
