hey everyone so today's tutorial is
going<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.360> be<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.540> bit<00:00:03.929> more<00:00:04.110> dramatic<00:00:04.259> than<00:00:04.799> my

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
going to be a bit more dramatic than my

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.889 
going to be a bit more dramatic than my
recent<00:00:05.430> looks<00:00:05.640> with<00:00:05.910> this<00:00:06.089> bright<00:00:06.390> bold<00:00:06.690> lip

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
recent looks with this bright bold lip

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.410 
recent looks with this bright bold lip
color<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.410> purple<00:00:08.099> winged<00:00:08.309> liner<00:00:08.670> but<00:00:09.389> I

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
color and purple winged liner but I

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.790 
color and purple winged liner but I
think<00:00:09.660> it's<00:00:09.780> perfect<00:00:10.200> for<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.469> colder

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
think it's perfect for the colder

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.890 
think it's perfect for the colder
weather<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.519> will<00:00:11.730> certainly<00:00:12.059> turn<00:00:12.599> heads

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
weather and it will certainly turn heads

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.200 
weather and it will certainly turn heads
now<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.009> bit<00:00:14.280> more<00:00:14.460> daring<00:00:14.790> than<00:00:14.940> what

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
now it is a bit more daring than what

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.330 
now it is a bit more daring than what
I'm<00:00:15.389> personally<00:00:16.020> used<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.500> but<00:00:16.740> if<00:00:16.890> you'd<00:00:17.130> like

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
I'm personally used to but if you'd like

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.370 
I'm personally used to but if you'd like
to<00:00:17.609> see<00:00:17.820> how<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.029> achieved<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.690> then<00:00:18.900> keep<00:00:19.140> on

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
to see how I achieved it then keep on

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.040 
to see how I achieved it then keep on
watching<00:00:19.910> so<00:00:20.910> I'm<00:00:21.029> starting<00:00:21.420> with<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.660> primer

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
watching so I'm starting with a primer

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.380 
watching so I'm starting with a primer
as<00:00:22.320> usual<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.340> prevent<00:00:23.699> my<00:00:23.789> shadows<00:00:24.150> from

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
as usual just to prevent my shadows from

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.509 
as usual just to prevent my shadows from
moving<00:00:24.779> around<00:00:24.990> throughout<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.350> day<00:00:25.470> I'm<00:00:26.279> not

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
moving around throughout the day I'm not

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.160 
moving around throughout the day I'm not
sure<00:00:26.730> how<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.880> feel<00:00:27.000> about<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.510> color<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.050> this

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
sure how I feel about the color of this

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.870 
sure how I feel about the color of this
one<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:28.920> not<00:00:29.130> noticeable<00:00:29.310> under

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
one but it's not noticeable under

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.700 
one but it's not noticeable under
shadows<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.599> works<00:00:30.869> pretty<00:00:31.080> well<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.410> I

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
shadows and it works pretty well so I

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.880 
shadows and it works pretty well so I
guess<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.189> okay

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.620 

then<00:00:36.890> I'm<00:00:37.040> going<00:00:37.309> in<00:00:37.430> with<00:00:37.670> a<00:00:37.700> shimmery<00:00:38.300> cream

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
then I'm going in with a shimmery cream

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.450 
then I'm going in with a shimmery cream
base<00:00:38.870> to<00:00:39.140> help<00:00:39.260> my<00:00:39.470> shadows<00:00:39.800> apply<00:00:40.250> more

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
base to help my shadows apply more

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.700 
base to help my shadows apply more
evenly<00:00:40.790> and<00:00:41.120> to<00:00:41.270> be<00:00:41.360> a<00:00:41.390> bit<00:00:41.660> more<00:00:41.870> vibrant<00:00:42.110> and

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
evenly and to be a bit more vibrant and

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.410 
evenly and to be a bit more vibrant and
I'm<00:00:43.190> applying<00:00:43.430> that<00:00:43.640> with<00:00:43.910> my<00:00:44.120> ring<00:00:44.390> finger

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
I'm applying that with my ring finger

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.049 
I'm applying that with my ring finger
all<00:00:44.960> over<00:00:45.170> my<00:00:45.350> lid<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:45.829> stopping<00:00:46.250> just<00:00:46.670> under

lightly work this into the crease so I'm

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.090

the<00:01:27.380> outer<00:01:27.619> V<00:01:28.039> and<00:01:28.369> working<00:01:29.119> any<00:01:29.270> extra

the outer V and working any extra

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.600 
the outer V and working any extra
product<00:01:30.140> back<00:01:30.530> through<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.100> crease<00:01:31.340> this

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
product back through the crease this

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.880 
product back through the crease this
just<00:01:32.390> creates<00:01:32.509> a<00:01:32.899> very<00:01:33.170> subtle<00:01:33.530> definition

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
just creates a very subtle definition

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.100 
just creates a very subtle definition
but<00:01:34.490> still<00:01:34.880> ties<00:01:35.149> into<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.570> Purple's<00:01:36.050> that

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
but still ties into the Purple's that

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.649 
but still ties into the Purple's that
I'm<00:01:36.470> going<00:01:36.830> to<00:01:36.860> be<00:01:37.039> using<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.340> later<00:01:37.550> and<00:01:38.000> then

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
I'm going to be using a later and then

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.230 
I'm going to be using a later and then
using<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.170> clean<00:01:39.200> fluffy<00:01:40.009> brush<00:01:40.250> blend<00:01:41.030> away

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
using a clean fluffy brush blend away

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.010 
using a clean fluffy brush blend away
any<00:01:41.540> harsh<00:01:41.960> edges<00:01:42.259> along<00:01:42.950> my<00:01:43.189> brow<00:01:43.250> bone<00:01:44.020> for

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
any harsh edges along my brow bone for

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.899 
any harsh edges along my brow bone for
the<00:01:45.049> liner<00:01:45.439> I<00:01:45.740> went<00:01:45.979> with<00:01:46.280> this<00:01:46.520> gorgeous

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
the liner I went with this gorgeous

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.660 
the liner I went with this gorgeous
eggplant<00:01:47.659> gel<00:01:47.960> liner<00:01:48.259> from<00:01:48.650> Maybelline<00:01:49.460> which

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
eggplant gel liner from Maybelline which

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.760 
eggplant gel liner from Maybelline which
is<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.909> nice<00:01:50.240> contrast<00:01:50.810> from<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.140> usual<00:01:51.439> black

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
is a nice contrast from the usual black

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.429 
is a nice contrast from the usual black
and<00:01:52.130> I<00:01:52.610> think<00:01:52.880> creates<00:01:53.180> more<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:53.540> a<00:01:53.630> subtle<00:01:53.990> but

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
and I think creates more of a subtle but

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.490 
and I think creates more of a subtle but
still<00:01:54.799> defined<00:01:55.430> look<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:56.869> I'm<00:01:56.990> applying<00:01:57.290> that

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
still defined look so I'm applying that

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.190 
still defined look so I'm applying that
with<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.799> small<00:01:58.490> liner<00:01:59.060> brush<00:01:59.450> just<00:01:59.750> using

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
with a small liner brush just using

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.499 
with a small liner brush just using
small<00:02:00.590> strokes<00:02:00.860> along<00:02:01.340> my<00:02:01.850> upper<00:02:02.030> lash<00:02:02.479> line

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
small strokes along my upper lash line

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.940 
small strokes along my upper lash line
and<00:02:03.110> then<00:02:03.680> slowly<00:02:04.460> creating<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.509> wing<00:02:05.950> then

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
and then slowly creating a wing then

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.160 
and then slowly creating a wing then
once<00:02:07.399> I<00:02:07.520> have<00:02:07.670> this<00:02:07.820> shape<00:02:08.090> I<00:02:08.329> like<00:02:08.660> I'm<00:02:08.929> going

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
once I have this shape I like I'm going

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.199 
once I have this shape I like I'm going
to<00:02:09.320> dip<00:02:09.500> my<00:02:09.560> brush<00:02:09.829> into<00:02:10.130> more<00:02:10.519> product<00:02:10.970> and

just go over it till I get the right
amount<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.910> color<00:02:14.470> also<00:02:15.470> don't<00:02:16.040> be<00:02:16.160> afraid<00:02:16.430> to

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
amount of color also don't be afraid to

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.250 
amount of color also don't be afraid to
take<00:02:16.700> your<00:02:16.850> time<00:02:17.180> with<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:17.959> something

that<00:02:18.470> takes<00:02:18.620> practice<00:02:19.310> I'm<00:02:19.880> still<00:02:20.510> not

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
that takes practice I'm still not

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.810 
that takes practice I'm still not
incredibly<00:02:21.350> good<00:02:21.560> with<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.280> take<00:02:22.610> a

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
incredibly good with it and I take a

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.630 
incredibly good with it and I take a
long<00:02:23.269> time<00:02:23.570> but<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:24.500> do<00:02:24.829> get<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.100> hang<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.519> it

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
long time but you do get the hang of it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.940 
long time but you do get the hang of it
and<00:02:25.850> we'll<00:02:26.030> learn<00:02:26.269> what<00:02:26.630> shape<00:02:26.959> looks<00:02:27.410> best<00:02:27.709> on

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950
