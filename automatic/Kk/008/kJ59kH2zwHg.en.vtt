00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500 
hi Gary Randy here Randy cycle service

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.540 
hi Gary Randy here Randy cycle service
wanted<00:00:11.830> to<00:00:12.010> run<00:00:12.400> through<00:00:12.580> the<00:00:12.670> purr

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:15.550 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.880 

out<00:00:15.670> here<00:00:15.940> probably<00:00:16.240> about<00:00:16.420> 65<00:00:17.290> degrees<00:00:17.320> this

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
out here probably about 65 degrees this

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.859 
out here probably about 65 degrees this
morning<00:00:17.950> so<00:00:18.670> it's<00:00:18.940> pretty<00:00:19.150> much<00:00:19.330> standard<00:00:19.570> I

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
morning so it's pretty much standard I

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.140 
morning so it's pretty much standard I
would<00:00:19.900> think<00:00:20.140> for<00:00:20.290> ride<00:00:20.500> time<00:00:21.030> basically<00:00:22.030> what

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
would think for ride time basically what

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.269 
would think for ride time basically what
we're<00:00:22.300> going<00:00:22.390> to<00:00:22.450> do<00:00:22.630> first<00:00:22.930> of<00:00:23.050> all<00:00:23.279> you'll

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
we're going to do first of all you'll

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.060 
we're going to do first of all you'll
tap<00:00:24.550> on<00:00:25.170> that's<00:00:26.170> going<00:00:26.380> to<00:00:26.439> let<00:00:26.590> the<00:00:26.680> fuel<00:00:26.860> fill

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
tap on that's going to let the fuel fill

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.339 
tap on that's going to let the fuel fill
up<00:00:27.189> to<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.369> carburetors<00:00:28.080> since<00:00:29.080> we<00:00:29.200> don't

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
up to the carburetors since we don't

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.929 
up to the carburetors since we don't
have<00:00:29.500> an<00:00:29.680> air<00:00:29.830> valve<00:00:30.040> or<00:00:30.340> choke<00:00:30.520> valve<00:00:30.760> on

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
have an air valve or choke valve on

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.330 
have an air valve or choke valve on
these<00:00:31.119> carburetors<00:00:31.570> that<00:00:32.410> we've<00:00:32.890> removed<00:00:33.040> a

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
these carburetors that we've removed a

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.370 
these carburetors that we've removed a
long<00:00:33.490> time<00:00:33.760> ago<00:00:34.090> apparently<00:00:34.510> by<00:00:34.930> a<00:00:34.960> previous

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
long time ago apparently by a previous

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.310 
long time ago apparently by a previous
owner<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:36.640> just<00:00:36.880> now<00:00:37.300> have<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:37.690> tickler<00:00:38.079> so

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
owner we just now have the tickler so

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.390 
owner we just now have the tickler so
what<00:00:38.440> we're<00:00:38.560> going<00:00:38.650> to<00:00:38.710> do<00:00:38.920> is<00:00:39.100> we're<00:00:39.250> going<00:00:39.280> to

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.740 
what we're going to do is we're going to
tickle<00:00:39.730> this<00:00:39.820> one<00:00:40.000> till<00:00:40.150> we<00:00:40.210> get<00:00:40.329> a<00:00:40.360> trickle<00:00:40.690> of

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
tickle this one till we get a trickle of

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.280 
tickle this one till we get a trickle of
gas<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:42.520> like<00:00:42.730> that<00:00:43.000> same<00:00:43.780> thing<00:00:44.050> on<00:00:44.170> the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
gas just like that same thing on the

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.959 
gas just like that same thing on the
other<00:00:44.320> side<00:00:45.750> till<00:00:46.750> we<00:00:46.840> get<00:00:46.989> a<00:00:47.020> trickle<00:00:47.350> of<00:00:47.440> gas

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
other side till we get a trickle of gas

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.380 
other side till we get a trickle of gas
now<00:00:48.969> we<00:00:49.120> got<00:00:49.300> that<00:00:50.489> turn<00:00:51.489> on<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:51.760> ignition<00:00:51.910> key

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
now we got that turn on the ignition key

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.660 
now we got that turn on the ignition key
and<00:00:53.379> we're<00:00:53.890> going<00:00:54.010> to<00:00:54.039> roll<00:00:54.219> the<00:00:54.370> engine

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
and we're going to roll the engine

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:03.770 
and we're going to roll the engine
through

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.000 

have<00:01:04.780> to<00:01:04.930> hold<00:01:05.050> the<00:01:05.200> throttle<00:01:05.410> up<00:01:05.680> just<00:01:05.920> a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
have to hold the throttle up just a

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.590 
have to hold the throttle up just a
little<00:01:06.040> bit<00:01:06.430> because<00:01:06.730> again<00:01:06.910> we<00:01:07.330> don't<00:01:07.360> have

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
little bit because again we don't have

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.330 
little bit because again we don't have
any<00:01:07.870> way<00:01:08.020> to<00:01:08.080> raise<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.560> idle<00:01:08.740> without<00:01:09.010> the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
any way to raise the idle without the

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.520 
any way to raise the idle without the
air<00:01:09.460> valve<00:01:09.760> choke<00:01:10.180> valve<00:01:10.480> so<00:01:11.290> with<00:01:11.440> this

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
air valve choke valve so with this

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.860 
air valve choke valve so with this
babysit<00:01:12.100> it<00:01:12.190> for<00:01:12.340> a<00:01:12.370> second<00:01:12.760> or<00:01:12.850> two<00:01:12.880> till<00:01:13.690> it's

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
babysit it for a second or two till it's

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.080 
babysit it for a second or two till it's
warm<00:01:14.170> enough<00:01:14.410> that<00:01:14.590> we<00:01:14.980> can<00:01:15.130> take<00:01:15.310> off<00:01:15.490> riding

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
warm enough that we can take off riding

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.630 
warm enough that we can take off riding
but<00:01:17.080> with<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.470> timing<00:01:17.860> set<00:01:18.040> correctly<00:01:18.340> with

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
but with the timing set correctly with

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.310 
but with the timing set correctly with
the<00:01:18.730> electronic<00:01:19.270> ignition<00:01:19.510> everything<00:01:20.140> like

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
the electronic ignition everything like

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.370 
the electronic ignition everything like
it<00:01:20.500> is<00:01:20.740> it<00:01:21.370> runs<00:01:21.640> rise<00:01:22.030> quite<00:01:22.390> well<00:01:22.660> cold<00:01:23.050> as

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
it is it runs rise quite well cold as

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.040 
it is it runs rise quite well cold as
well<00:01:23.560> as<00:01:23.740> warm<00:01:24.040> too<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:24.760> we're<00:01:25.720> going<00:01:25.810> to<00:01:25.870> go

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
well as warm too so we're going to go

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
well as warm too so we're going to go
ahead<00:01:26.140> get<00:01:26.770> ready<00:01:26.980> to<00:01:27.100> go<00:01:27.190> for<00:01:27.370> a<00:01:27.400> ride

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:58.100
