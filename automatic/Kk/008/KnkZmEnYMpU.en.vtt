00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.799
 in a video where he put the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.360
 makeup of some particular person 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.309
 you left me in the comments or 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.170
 I just do what I like about 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.660
 take a specific place 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.730
 this time in this makeup life and I've 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.650
 said really there are no rules of 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.680
 Makeup true use if you fancy 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.960
 a blog of some white color nothing of 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.960
 shadow or you can use a shadow of 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:44.290
 the shadows and against a palette 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.510
 have a lot of time with the gÃ¼ero 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.930
 and this was one of the letters that I 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.059
 I bought at the beginning I started to position 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.350
 for makeup and nothing is this palette 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.170
 that does not even have a name has been 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.650
 broken that has three very beautiful colors 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.989
 It has a pink light pink with glitter 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.900
 in a black with glitter and this is 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.700
 it has a purple gray with glitter and they are 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.940
 of wenchuÃ¡n are some super shadows 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.520
 beautiful made a great presentation 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.440
 so I always tell them there are a lot 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.479
 of looks that you can do simply 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.460
 of a palette with three colors with three 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.080
 shadows you're going to do a lot of light 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.970
 you do not really need to have eight thousand 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.369
 five hundred shadows to project in 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.080
 a nice cheese particle million 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.670
 three completely different things that 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.039
 I can do only with these three 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.470
 colors normally I say that enough of 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.910
 have 800 thousand colors with three colors 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.370
 that you choose that you like that has been heard 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.050
 clarito one medium and another dark then 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.390
 a lot of looks then I wanted 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.910
 teach 32 what you can do with three 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.560
 different works and you can do the same 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.690
 technique with any color you want 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.220
 It is the best in blue colors 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.770
 green beginners that is the same 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.080
 tone maybe a dark green 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.100
 is in color that you like medium and other 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.100
 back is you 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.869
 teaches us that I would do with these 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.240
 three shadows and if you want to see how I have 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.770
 made to continue seeing for the first what 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.270
 I will use the lighter color the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.119
 I'm going to put it on all the 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.979
 eyelid and in the tear after I go to 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.720
 take the medium color the color that in 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.580
 this case is a purple gray and I'm going 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.830
 to put in the eye socket and in the ub 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.480
 to give a little bit of shape to the eye and I'm going 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.310
 to take the third color that is black 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.080
 and I'm going to put it as a delineated 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.280
 of the eyes and I'm going to do a little 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.280
 of rabito in the outside 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.609
 and the bottom part of the tabs I'm going 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.140
 to catch the average color that used 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.370
 before to give the eye a bit of shape 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.349
 I 'm going to put it all along 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.540
 the tabs below and now we're going to 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.239
 start with the mascara and now 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.870
 we're finished it 's super fast and 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.870
 super easy 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.830
 for the next what I'm going to use 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.720
 likewise the three colors of clear 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.430
 dark from the lacrimal outward what 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.959
 first thing I still use is the color 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.060
 light pink on the inside of the 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.370
 Tear and in the lower part of the eye 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.900
 also the second eat I had use 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.819
 it's the scrum half I'm going to put in the part 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.819
 from the center of the eyelid and outwards 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.160
 now I'm going to take the darker color 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.690
 which in this case is black and I 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.460
 had putting on the outside of 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.110
 ub eye and will start 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.150
 to blur remember that to blur is 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.770
 super super important once you already 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.450
 is put in colors you will see your focus 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.970
 a lighter color gradient more 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.050
 dark from the lacrimal side towards 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.790
 outside 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.410
 and in the bottom part I'm going to do what 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.900
 same I will put the darker color 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.520
 on the outside of the tabs 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.320
 medium color in the center part of 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.610
 the tabs below and the color more 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.610
 clarito on the inside 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.620
 and now we're going with the crime and we've already 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.640
 finished super fast and super confident 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.640
 be the same as the first 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.610
 and for the third look I'm just going to 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.500
 use the two darker colors the 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.970
 medium and the darkest would say that with the 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.830
 darker color I will not put to 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.690
 embargo of the tabs below and not 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.640
 it has to be a very specific line 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.280
 just around the eyelid near 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.200
 those that are from below and try that 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.030
 be the color quite strong and that is 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.980
 well close to the eyelashes now I'm going to 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.360
 take the middle color the second color and 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.340
 I'm going to put it on top of the color that 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.919
 placed previously and in the basin of 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.720
 eye blurring this what is it that 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.510
 maximum a lot because I think that is 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.979
 very nice that goes from dark to clear 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.000
 bottom up from closest to 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.620
 the tabs up 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.330
 Now let's go with the mask 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.400
 eyelashes and soon I will take a pencil 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.750
 black and I'm going to finish the line of 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.980
 water below in the water line of 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.620
 up this is going to make the look in 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.520
 general be a little darker 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.520
 and we have finished 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.750
 good 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:55.259
 in 2003 I also particularly like the 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.479
 third I love that kind of their 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.840
 nuclear black eyes and after lesmo 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.810
 I think that up super one 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:07.380
