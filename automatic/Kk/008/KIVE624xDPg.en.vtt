time so hey I have to be like that

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.930 
time so hey I have to be like that
number<00:00:43.590> two<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> music<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.700> not

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
number two is that the music is not

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.790 
number two is that the music is not
offspring<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:45.809> probably<00:00:46.200> couldn't<00:00:46.530> get<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
offspring they probably couldn't get the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.110 
offspring they probably couldn't get the
rights<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.309> or<00:00:47.520> they<00:00:47.640> didn't<00:00:47.879> want<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.059> pay

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
rights to it or they didn't want to pay

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.819 
rights to it or they didn't want to pay
for<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.629> again<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.170> that's<00:00:49.379> totally

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
for it again and that's totally

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.740 
for it again and that's totally
understandable<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:51.000> threw<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.510> bunch

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
understandable so they threw in a bunch

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.389 
understandable so they threw in a bunch
of<00:00:51.899> new<00:00:52.079> tracks<00:00:52.440> which<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.890> cool<00:00:53.129> because

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
of new tracks which is cool because

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.549 
of new tracks which is cool because
unlike<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.239> previous<00:00:54.510> dreamcast<00:00:55.410> version

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
unlike the previous dreamcast version

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.799 
unlike the previous dreamcast version
which<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.190> only<00:00:56.399> had<00:00:56.610> three<00:00:57.000> songs<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.690> in

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
which that only had three songs and in

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.990 
which that only had three songs and in
this<00:00:58.020> version<00:00:58.350> has<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.800> ton<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.699> all<00:00:59.850> these

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
this version has a ton but all these

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.150 
this version has a ton but all these
songs<00:01:00.239> added<00:01:00.539> together<00:01:00.809> really<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.620> not<00:01:01.920> add

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
songs added together really do not add

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.030 
songs added together really do not add
to<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.579> original<00:01:03.210> soundtrack<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:04.199> was<00:01:04.530> so

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
to the original soundtrack that was so

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.060

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
fantastic because this music really was

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.700 
fantastic because this music really was
like<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.520> backbone<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.869> game<00:01:10.200> where<00:01:10.560> it

are good so that solves everything of
course<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.780> like<00:01:39.930> an<00:01:40.079> extra<00:01:40.470> step

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
course but it's just like an extra step

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.230 
course but it's just like an extra step
that<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.070> yourself<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.850> put<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
that you yourself have to put in the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.240 
that you yourself have to put in the
effort<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.689> achieve<00:01:42.960> now<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> third<00:01:43.979> thing<00:01:44.189> is

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
effort to achieve now the third thing is

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.160 
effort to achieve now the third thing is
that<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.700> related<00:01:45.210> specifically<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
that it's related specifically to the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.109 
that it's related specifically to the
power<00:01:46.470> boost<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> power<00:01:47.610> boost<00:01:47.909> is

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
power boost and the power boost is

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.210 
power boost and the power boost is
exactly<00:01:48.720> what<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.170> need<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.130> game

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
exactly what you need to do in this game

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.480 
exactly what you need to do in this game
in<00:01:50.610> order<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.060> achieve<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.630> s<00:01:51.840> license<00:01:52.649> but<00:01:53.250> in

case of a Playstation 3 is that it's

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.539 
case of a Playstation 3 is that it's
really<00:02:00.299> difficult<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.170> achieve<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:02.159> boost

really difficult to achieve this boost

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.459

just like done and maybe this is because
