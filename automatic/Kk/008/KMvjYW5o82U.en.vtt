00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.050 

I<00:00:01.599> bought<00:00:02.409> one<00:00:02.739> of<00:00:02.860> the<00:00:02.949> very<00:00:03.190> first<00:00:03.460> models

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:04.060 
I bought one of the very first models

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.280 
I bought one of the very first models
back<00:00:04.840> in<00:00:05.160> December<00:00:06.160> I<00:00:06.509> got<00:00:07.509> it<00:00:07.660> like<00:00:07.990> mid

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.290 
back in December I got it like mid

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.740 
back in December I got it like mid
december<00:00:08.740> i<00:00:08.799> believe<00:00:09.070> and<00:00:09.250> i<00:00:09.450> just<00:00:10.450> barely

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 
december i believe and i just barely

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.850 
december i believe and i just barely
purchased<00:00:11.320> a<00:00:11.469> new<00:00:11.769> one<00:00:12.240> nine<00:00:13.240> months<00:00:13.450> later<00:00:13.860> so

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
purchased a new one nine months later so

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.890 
purchased a new one nine months later so
let's<00:00:15.700> see<00:00:15.849> what<00:00:16.090> differences<00:00:16.540> do<00:00:16.660> we<00:00:16.750> have

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
let's see what differences do we have

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.870 
let's see what differences do we have
between<00:00:17.080> the<00:00:17.380> two<00:00:17.529> first<00:00:18.099> off<00:00:18.279> you<00:00:18.399> can<00:00:18.550> notice

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
between the two first off you can notice

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.540 
between the two first off you can notice
that<00:00:19.119> there's<00:00:19.329> the<00:00:20.230> anodization<00:00:20.829> is<00:00:21.250> a<00:00:21.279> little

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
that there's the anodization is a little

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.200 
that there's the anodization is a little
different<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:23.800> reflective<00:00:24.369> vs<00:00:24.700> matt<00:00:24.970> the

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
different it's reflective vs matt the

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.589 
different it's reflective vs matt the
new<00:00:25.329> one<00:00:25.450> is<00:00:25.480> matt<00:00:26.009> the<00:00:27.119> next<00:00:28.119> bride<00:00:28.239> text

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
new one is matt the next bride text

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.780 
new one is matt the next bride text
actually<00:00:28.809> is<00:00:29.430> less<00:00:31.290> raised<00:00:32.790> presumably

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
actually is less raised presumably

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.330 
actually is less raised presumably
because<00:00:34.000> it<00:00:34.300> with<00:00:35.170> matt<00:00:35.440> finish<00:00:35.680> as<00:00:35.920> well<00:00:36.070> but

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
because it with matt finish as well but

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.090 
because it with matt finish as well but
yeah<00:00:37.210> there's<00:00:37.750> also<00:00:37.930> a<00:00:38.080> difference<00:00:38.380> with<00:00:38.770> the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
yeah there's also a difference with the

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.630 
yeah there's also a difference with the
the<00:00:39.490> lens<00:00:39.900> if<00:00:40.900> we<00:00:41.080> take<00:00:41.560> a<00:00:41.620> look<00:00:41.890> we<00:00:42.130> can<00:00:42.310> raise

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
the lens if we take a look we can raise

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.150 
the lens if we take a look we can raise
this<00:00:43.000> up<00:00:43.180> and<00:00:43.540> we'll<00:00:43.750> see<00:00:43.990> observe<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.860> divot

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
this up and we'll see observe the divot

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.510 
this up and we'll see observe the divot
on<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.760> left<00:00:45.970> and<00:00:46.180> it's<00:00:47.070> basically<00:00:48.070> it's<00:00:48.460> a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
on the left and it's basically it's a

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.690 
on the left and it's basically it's a
lot<00:00:48.670> larger<00:00:48.880> than<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.360> one<00:00:49.480> on<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.690> right

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
lot larger than the one on the right

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.220 
lot larger than the one on the right
then<00:00:51.700> the<00:00:52.060> update<00:00:52.329> seems<00:00:52.630> to<00:00:52.750> have<00:00:52.840> a<00:00:52.870> smaller

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
then the update seems to have a smaller

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.810 
then the update seems to have a smaller
focus<00:00:54.160> point<00:00:54.460> so<00:00:55.180> that's<00:00:55.690> interesting<00:00:56.820> let's

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
focus point so that's interesting let's

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.180 
focus point so that's interesting let's
see<00:00:58.060> what<00:00:58.239> else<00:00:58.329> alright<00:00:58.900> so<00:00:59.560> here<00:00:59.980> are<00:01:00.160> the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
see what else alright so here are the

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.350 
see what else alright so here are the
electronics<00:01:01.060> of<00:01:01.470> the<00:01:02.470> gen<00:01:02.710> 1<00:01:02.950> the<00:01:03.910> first<00:01:04.119> one

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
electronics of the gen 1 the first one

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.140 
electronics of the gen 1 the first one
that<00:01:04.540> i<00:01:04.629> purchased<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:06.010> anodization<00:01:06.370> is<00:01:06.790> also

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
that i purchased the anodization is also

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.460 
that i purchased the anodization is also
different<00:01:07.330> i<00:01:07.570> actually<00:01:07.810> when<00:01:08.110> i<00:01:08.140> purchased

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
different i actually when i purchased

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.140 
different i actually when i purchased
another<00:01:08.950> black<00:01:09.280> I<00:01:09.460> thought<00:01:09.640> well<00:01:09.970> I<00:01:10.000> might

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
another black I thought well I might

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.330 
another black I thought well I might
have<00:01:10.479> to<00:01:10.510> do<00:01:11.350> something<00:01:11.620> with<00:01:12.130> some

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
have to do something with some

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.469 
have to do something with some
electrical<00:01:12.729> tape<00:01:12.790> or<00:01:13.090> something<00:01:13.180> to

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
electrical tape or something to

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.280 
electrical tape or something to
distinguish<00:01:13.990> them<00:01:14.140> it's<00:01:14.470> very<00:01:15.070> very<00:01:15.610> obvious

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
distinguish them it's very very obvious

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.649 
distinguish them it's very very obvious
so<00:01:17.290> here's<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.620> board<00:01:17.830> what<00:01:18.250> it<00:01:18.340> looks<00:01:18.460> like

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.180 

seems<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.750> be<00:01:22.840> fine<00:01:23.049> I<00:01:23.320> guess<00:01:23.830> I'm<00:01:23.979> just<00:01:24.100> used

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
seems to be fine I guess I'm just used

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.710 
seems to be fine I guess I'm just used
to<00:01:24.400> this<00:01:24.549> one<00:01:24.760> but<00:01:25.120> if<00:01:25.210> we<00:01:25.270> look<00:01:25.360> at<00:01:25.510> the<00:01:25.600> new

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
to this one but if we look at the new

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.980 
to this one but if we look at the new
one<00:01:26.520> right<00:01:27.520> here<00:01:27.760> we<00:01:27.880> we<00:01:28.210> immediately<00:01:28.600> notice

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
one right here we we immediately notice

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.899 
one right here we we immediately notice
that<00:01:29.350> there<00:01:29.620> is<00:01:29.650> this<00:01:29.950> entire<00:01:30.340> section<00:01:30.670> that

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
that there is this entire section that

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.649 
that there is this entire section that
has<00:01:31.000> been<00:01:31.180> closed<00:01:32.140> off<00:01:32.549> i'll<00:01:33.549> i'll<00:01:34.150> be<00:01:34.420> going

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
has been closed off i'll i'll be going

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.380 
has been closed off i'll i'll be going
into<00:01:34.780> well<00:01:35.590> i'll<00:01:36.159> take<00:01:36.700> off<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.970> board<00:01:37.180> and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
into well i'll take off the board and

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.850 
into well i'll take off the board and
take<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.170> closer<00:01:38.440> look<00:01:38.590> at<00:01:38.830> it<00:01:38.950> later<00:01:39.510> so<00:01:40.860> there

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
take a closer look at it later so there

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.680 
take a closer look at it later so there
have<00:01:41.950> definitely<00:01:42.010> been<00:01:42.369> some<00:01:42.430> some<00:01:43.270> updates

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
have definitely been some some updates

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.750 
have definitely been some some updates
to<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:43.960> carrier<00:01:44.260> though<00:01:44.619> they<00:01:45.250> seem<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.640> be

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
to the carrier though they seem to be

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.750 
to the carrier though they seem to be
perfectly<00:01:46.240> compatible<00:01:46.570> as<00:01:46.930> far<00:01:47.140> as<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:48.460> board

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
perfectly compatible as far as the board

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.880 
perfectly compatible as far as the board
if<00:01:48.970> you<00:01:49.090> have<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.420> replacement<00:01:49.689> board<00:01:50.049> oh<00:01:50.200> yeah

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
if you have a replacement board oh yeah

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.260 
if you have a replacement board oh yeah
when<00:01:51.040> you<00:01:51.130> open<00:01:51.520> them<00:01:51.580> close<00:01:51.850> this<00:01:52.000> there's<00:01:52.210> a

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
when you open them close this there's a

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.969 
when you open them close this there's a
bit<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.570> chirp<00:01:52.810> presumably<00:01:53.470> because<00:01:53.650> of<00:01:53.890> the

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
bit of a chirp presumably because of the

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.870 
bit of a chirp presumably because of the
anodization<00:01:55.740> let's<00:01:56.740> see<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.100> how<00:01:57.220> tight<00:01:57.759> is

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
anodization let's see it how tight is

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.289 
anodization let's see it how tight is
that<00:01:58.030> lets<00:01:58.210> plenty<00:01:58.540> um<00:01:58.780> now<00:02:00.000> let's<00:02:01.000> see<00:02:01.240> you

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
that lets plenty um now let's see you

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.090 
that lets plenty um now let's see you
pump<00:02:01.720> back<00:02:02.200> in<00:02:02.409> as<00:02:02.530> well<00:02:03.030> no<00:02:04.030> chirp<00:02:04.299> you<00:02:04.600> know

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
pump back in as well no chirp you know

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.590 
pump back in as well no chirp you know
you

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.000 

the<00:02:08.780> difference<00:02:09.050> in<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.200> lights<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:09.800> on<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
the difference in the lights so on the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.680 
the difference in the lights so on the
right-hand<00:02:10.160> side<00:02:10.400> we<00:02:10.520> still<00:02:10.940> have<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.210> we

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
right-hand side we still have the we

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.650 
right-hand side we still have the we
have<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:13.400> update<00:02:13.700> on<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.330> left-hand

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
have the the update on the left-hand

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.600 
have the the update on the left-hand
side<00:02:14.690> we<00:02:14.810> have<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.080> newer<00:02:15.410> actually<00:02:16.280> be<00:02:16.430> the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
side we have the newer actually be the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.810 
side we have the newer actually be the
original<00:02:17.290> if<00:02:18.290> we<00:02:18.380> come<00:02:18.560> in<00:02:18.710> close<00:02:18.980> there's<00:02:19.760> a

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
original if we come in close there's a

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.520 
original if we come in close there's a
bit<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.180> there<00:02:20.750> is<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.900> bit<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.260> clover

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
bit of a there is a bit of a clover

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.440 
bit of a there is a bit of a clover
pattern<00:02:21.800> on<00:02:21.920> both<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.160> them<00:02:22.430> actually<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:23.060> back

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
pattern on both of them actually to back

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.450 
pattern on both of them actually to back
up<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:24.590> fades<00:02:25.010> I'm<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:26.510> mean<00:02:26.840> around<00:02:27.290> six<00:02:28.220> inches

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
up it fades I'm I mean around six inches

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.890 
up it fades I'm I mean around six inches
you<00:02:28.580> don't<00:02:28.730> really<00:02:28.910> notice<00:02:29.180> much<00:02:30.190> come<00:02:31.190> in<00:02:31.400> and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
you don't really notice much come in and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.430 
you don't really notice much come in and
well<00:02:32.900> anyway<00:02:33.500> let's<00:02:34.430> see<00:02:34.640> Oh<00:02:35.440> other

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
well anyway let's see Oh other

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.920 
well anyway let's see Oh other
differences<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.910> right<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.420> newer<00:02:38.570> one

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
differences the the right the newer one

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.740 
differences the the right the newer one
actually<00:02:39.380> has<00:02:39.410> kind<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:39.980> an<00:02:40.100> a<00:02:40.450> square<00:02:41.450> shape

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
actually has kind of an a square shape

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.420 
actually has kind of an a square shape
as<00:02:42.020> opposed<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.560> left<00:02:42.740> which<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:42.950> much

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
as opposed to the left which is much

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.570 
as opposed to the left which is much
more<00:02:43.610> circular<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:45.050> right<00:02:45.410> one<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.650> also<00:02:45.950> the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
more circular the right one is also the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.170 
more circular the right one is also the
update<00:02:47.090> is<00:02:47.180> also<00:02:47.740> has<00:02:48.740> a<00:02:48.770> stronger<00:02:49.400> point<00:02:49.760> in

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
update is also has a stronger point in

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.290 
update is also has a stronger point in
the<00:02:50.540> center<00:02:50.720> food<00:02:50.990> back<00:02:51.140> up<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:52.760> may<00:02:52.940> notice

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
the center food back up you may notice

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.340 
the center food back up you may notice
I'm<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.410> same<00:02:54.590> distance<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:56.540> right<00:02:56.720> spot

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
I'm the same distance the the right spot

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.920 
I'm the same distance the the right spot
is<00:02:57.680> more<00:02:58.460> focused<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:59.000> also<00:02:59.780> interestingly

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
is more focused and also interestingly

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.930 
is more focused and also interestingly
you<00:03:00.410> have<00:03:00.560> this<00:03:00.680> bit<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:00.980> square<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.790> see

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
you have this bit of a square you see

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.810 
you have this bit of a square you see
that<00:03:03.550> which<00:03:04.550> is<00:03:04.760> interesting<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:06.380> think<00:03:06.820> let's

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
that which is interesting I think let's

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.040 
that which is interesting I think let's
see<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.120> here's<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.720> left<00:03:09.110> only<00:03:10.840> rotating<00:03:11.840> it

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
see it here's the left only rotating it

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.950 
see it here's the left only rotating it
I'm<00:03:12.260> rotating<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.010> it's<00:03:13.520> like<00:03:13.960> not

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
I'm rotating it and it's like not

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.580 
I'm rotating it and it's like not
changing<00:03:15.410> too<00:03:15.950> much<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:17.090> right<00:03:17.440> rotating<00:03:18.440> it

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
changing too much the right rotating it

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.010 
changing too much the right rotating it
and<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.430> see<00:03:19.610> that<00:03:19.760> square<00:03:20.120> as<00:03:20.300> it<00:03:20.480> goes

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
and you see that square as it goes

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.410 
and you see that square as it goes
around<00:03:21.140> I<00:03:21.440> think<00:03:22.280> both<00:03:22.460> of<00:03:22.490> these<00:03:22.760> could<00:03:23.090> still

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
around I think both of these could still

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.340 
around I think both of these could still
be<00:03:23.570> changed<00:03:24.170> or<00:03:24.320> fixed<00:03:24.920> by<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.870> lens<00:03:26.870> being<00:03:27.230> a

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
be changed or fixed by the lens being a

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.540 
be changed or fixed by the lens being a
little<00:03:27.590> closer<00:03:27.920> still<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:30.110> to<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.040> LED

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
little closer still to the to the LED

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.810 
little closer still to the to the LED
but<00:03:32.120> it's<00:03:32.510> okay<00:03:32.840> um<00:03:33.250> it's<00:03:34.250> just<00:03:34.460> a<00:03:34.550> difference

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
but it's okay um it's just a difference

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.220 
but it's okay um it's just a difference
that<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.240> interesting<00:03:37.990> anything<00:03:38.990> else<00:03:39.110> for

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
that is interesting anything else for

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.860 
that is interesting anything else for
this<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:40.880> colors<00:03:41.210> are<00:03:41.330> actually<00:03:41.690> a<00:03:41.720> little

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
this the colors are actually a little

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.900 
this the colors are actually a little
different<00:03:42.380> I<00:03:42.560> don't<00:03:42.830> think<00:03:43.010> we<00:03:43.160> can<00:03:43.310> tell<00:03:43.880> very

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
different I don't think we can tell very

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:51.040 
different I don't think we can tell very
well<00:03:44.510> I'll<00:03:45.130> let's<00:03:46.130> see<00:03:48.820> increase<00:03:49.820> them<00:03:50.060> that's

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
well I'll let's see increase them that's

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.970 
well I'll let's see increase them that's
kind<00:03:51.350> of

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.720 

so<00:03:58.980> there's<00:03:59.370> full<00:03:59.970> brightness<00:04:00.239> back<00:04:01.080> down<00:04:01.319> to

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
so there's full brightness back down to

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.660 
so there's full brightness back down to
minimum<00:04:02.730> brightness<00:04:07.010> it's<00:04:08.010> full<00:04:08.310> brightness

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
minimum brightness it's full brightness

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.990 
minimum brightness it's full brightness
right<00:04:09.090> there<00:04:09.360> um<00:04:10.459> yeah<00:04:11.459> there's<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.760> slight

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
right there um yeah there's a slight

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.360 
right there um yeah there's a slight
difference<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.390> color<00:04:12.659> um<00:04:12.959> it's<00:04:13.560> either<00:04:13.829> from

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
difference in color um it's either from

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.219 
difference in color um it's either from
well<00:04:14.909> it's<00:04:15.090> probably<00:04:15.480> not<00:04:15.690> from<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.989> binning

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
well it's probably not from the binning

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:22.009 
well it's probably not from the binning
it's<00:04:16.350> probably<00:04:17.449> from<00:04:18.449> the<00:04:20.120> well<00:04:21.120> I'd<00:04:21.690> guess

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
it's probably from the well I'd guess

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.270 
it's probably from the well I'd guess
that<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.350> right<00:04:22.500> one<00:04:22.680> is<00:04:22.800> driving<00:04:23.100> it<00:04:23.190> a

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
that the right one is driving it a

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.100 
that the right one is driving it a
slightly<00:04:23.610> different<00:04:23.880> voltage<00:04:24.389> the<00:04:24.690> update<00:04:24.960> as

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
slightly different voltage the update as

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.800 
slightly different voltage the update as
a<00:04:25.229> slightly<00:04:25.620> different<00:04:26.430> voltage<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:27.030> seems<00:04:27.630> to

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
a slightly different voltage it seems to

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.969 
a slightly different voltage it seems to
actually<00:04:27.960> be<00:04:28.199> a<00:04:28.290> little<00:04:28.440> bit<00:04:28.590> brighter<00:04:28.770> but

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
actually be a little bit brighter but

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.560 
actually be a little bit brighter but
I'm<00:04:29.070> not<00:04:29.220> sure<00:04:29.250> how<00:04:29.490> much<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:29.669> that<00:04:29.789> is<00:04:29.940> the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
I'm not sure how much of that is the

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.300 
I'm not sure how much of that is the
temperature<00:04:31.470> come<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:32.600> color<00:04:33.600> of<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.900> LED<00:04:34.310> so

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
temperature come the color of the LED so

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.080 
temperature come the color of the LED so
yeah

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.940 

so<00:04:40.090> here<00:04:40.360> they<00:04:40.540> are<00:04:40.570> disassembled<00:04:41.320> this<00:04:41.800> is

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
so here they are disassembled this is

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.530 
so here they are disassembled this is
the<00:04:42.130> older<00:04:42.730> version<00:04:44.010> now<00:04:45.030> there<00:04:46.030> there<00:04:46.300> are<00:04:46.480> a

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
the older version now there there are a

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.180 
the older version now there there are a
few<00:04:46.720> things<00:04:46.930> to<00:04:47.080> notice<00:04:47.350> over<00:04:47.680> here<00:04:47.710> before<00:04:47.980> we

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
few things to notice over here before we

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.920 
few things to notice over here before we
go<00:04:48.280> to<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.490> other<00:04:48.580> one<00:04:48.669> take<00:04:49.360> a<00:04:49.389> look<00:04:49.630> at<00:04:49.780> that

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
go to the other one take a look at that

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.370 
go to the other one take a look at that
that's<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.650> clock<00:04:50.860> right<00:04:51.070> there<00:04:52.380> it's

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
that's the clock right there it's

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.379 
that's the clock right there it's
definitely<00:04:53.919> been<00:04:54.040> updated<00:04:54.520> on<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:54.880> newer<00:04:55.090> one

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
definitely been updated on the newer one

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.070 
definitely been updated on the newer one
there<00:04:55.960> have<00:04:56.050> been<00:04:56.080> a<00:04:56.200> few<00:04:56.230> positional<00:04:56.950> changes

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
there have been a few positional changes

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.340 
there have been a few positional changes
like<00:04:59.080> observe<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.830> spacing<00:05:00.370> by<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.669> switch

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
like observe the spacing by the switch

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.960 
like observe the spacing by the switch
which<00:05:02.350> has<00:05:02.500> changed<00:05:02.950> but<00:05:03.520> other<00:05:03.700> than<00:05:03.820> that

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
which has changed but other than that

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.570 
which has changed but other than that
everything<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:04.930> mean<00:05:05.350> there<00:05:06.100> there<00:05:06.340> are<00:05:06.430> minor

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
everything I mean there there are minor

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.220 
everything I mean there there are minor
spacing<00:05:07.090> differences<00:05:07.570> but<00:05:07.720> it<00:05:07.870> seems<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:08.169> be

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
spacing differences but it seems to be

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.930 
spacing differences but it seems to be
the<00:05:08.350> same<00:05:08.530> throughout<00:05:08.740> over<00:05:09.460> here<00:05:09.610> if<00:05:09.669> we<00:05:09.760> look

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
the same throughout over here if we look

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.850 
the same throughout over here if we look
will<00:05:10.270> notice<00:05:10.570> that<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.410> clock<00:05:11.650> is

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
will notice that the the clock is

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.530 
will notice that the the clock is
actually<00:05:13.080> completely<00:05:14.080> different<00:05:15.540> I'll

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
actually completely different I'll

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.170 
actually completely different I'll
upload<00:05:16.780> some<00:05:17.229> photos<00:05:17.669> that<00:05:18.669> have<00:05:18.700> better

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
upload some photos that have better

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.719 
upload some photos that have better
resolution<00:05:19.330> and<00:05:20.310> spacing<00:05:21.310> is<00:05:21.430> different

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
resolution and spacing is different

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.020 
resolution and spacing is different
around<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:22.000> switch<00:05:22.270> I<00:05:23.260> mean<00:05:24.190> it's<00:05:24.610> just<00:05:24.729> like

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
around the switch I mean it's just like

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.770 
around the switch I mean it's just like
little<00:05:25.479> minor<00:05:25.720> updates<00:05:26.169> and<00:05:27.570> it's<00:05:28.570> just

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
little minor updates and it's just

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.610 
little minor updates and it's just
interesting<00:05:29.280> oh<00:05:30.570> one<00:05:31.570> important<00:05:32.169> thing<00:05:32.200> when

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
interesting oh one important thing when

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.879 
interesting oh one important thing when
I<00:05:32.650> was<00:05:32.860> taking<00:05:33.040> out<00:05:33.310> the<00:05:34.410> taking<00:05:35.410> his<00:05:35.530> apart

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
I was taking out the taking his apart

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.740 
I was taking out the taking his apart
the<00:05:36.160> the<00:05:36.490> battery<00:05:36.820> carrier<00:05:37.120> on<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.330> newer<00:05:37.479> one

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
the the battery carrier on the newer one

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.440 
the the battery carrier on the newer one
was<00:05:37.900> extremely<00:05:38.710> stiff<00:05:39.010> I<00:05:39.220> actually<00:05:39.760> scraped

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
was extremely stiff I actually scraped

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:46.080 
was extremely stiff I actually scraped
off<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:42.630> sum<00:05:43.630> of<00:05:43.750> plastic<00:05:44.280> as<00:05:45.280> I<00:05:45.460> was<00:05:45.610> hitting

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
off the sum of plastic as I was hitting

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.790 
off the sum of plastic as I was hitting
it<00:05:46.270> against<00:05:46.539> the<00:05:46.630> palm<00:05:46.810> of<00:05:46.840> my<00:05:47.050> hand<00:05:47.289> trying<00:05:47.680> to

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
it against the palm of my hand trying to

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.730 
it against the palm of my hand trying to
give<00:05:47.890> it<00:05:47.979> a<00:05:48.039> pop<00:05:48.190> out<00:05:48.479> um<00:05:49.919> so<00:05:51.419> yeah<00:05:52.419> I<00:05:53.229> I

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
give it a pop out um so yeah I I

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.140 
give it a pop out um so yeah I I
remember<00:05:54.400> that<00:05:54.490> I<00:05:54.550> had<00:05:54.700> a<00:05:54.729> difficult<00:05:55.120> time

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
remember that I had a difficult time

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.090 
remember that I had a difficult time
with<00:05:55.450> the<00:05:55.570> first<00:05:55.810> one<00:05:56.050> and<00:05:56.229> it's<00:05:56.770> gotten

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
with the first one and it's gotten

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.760 
with the first one and it's gotten
easier<00:05:57.340> over<00:05:57.820> time<00:05:57.850> but<00:05:58.810> I<00:05:58.870> did<00:05:59.140> not<00:05:59.260> damage<00:05:59.560> it

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
easier over time but I did not damage it

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.590 
easier over time but I did not damage it
at<00:05:59.890> all<00:06:00.039> well<00:06:00.460> I<00:06:00.490> mean<00:06:00.700> yeah<00:06:01.180> there<00:06:01.360> was<00:06:01.450> some

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
at all well I mean yeah there was some

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.279 
at all well I mean yeah there was some
very<00:06:01.840> minor<00:06:02.140> damage<00:06:02.620> when<00:06:02.919> I<00:06:03.010> did<00:06:03.190> it<00:06:03.220> but

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
very minor damage when I did it but

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.370 
very minor damage when I did it but
nothing<00:06:05.289> like<00:06:05.440> this<00:06:05.500> one<00:06:06.330> so<00:06:07.330> yeah<00:06:08.020> it's<00:06:08.169> a<00:06:08.229> bit

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
nothing like this one so yeah it's a bit

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.590 
nothing like this one so yeah it's a bit
tighter<00:06:08.620> I'm<00:06:08.800> not<00:06:08.950> sure<00:06:09.130> if<00:06:09.280> the<00:06:10.060> internal

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
tighter I'm not sure if the internal

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.980 
tighter I'm not sure if the internal
dimensions<00:06:10.810> have<00:06:11.080> changed<00:06:11.530> slightly<00:06:11.860> or

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
dimensions have changed slightly or

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.540 
dimensions have changed slightly or
maybe<00:06:13.990> the<00:06:14.139> shim<00:06:14.380> is<00:06:14.560> a<00:06:14.590> little<00:06:14.919> little

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
maybe the shim is a little little

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.190 
maybe the shim is a little little
different<00:06:15.940> I<00:06:16.060> haven't<00:06:16.330> really<00:06:16.750> checked<00:06:17.020> that

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
different I haven't really checked that

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.560 
different I haven't really checked that
out<00:06:17.260> but<00:06:17.560> it's<00:06:18.220> very<00:06:18.430> definitely<00:06:19.030> worth<00:06:19.180> noted

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
out but it's very definitely worth noted

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.409 
out but it's very definitely worth noted
noting

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.899 

so<00:06:24.419> here<00:06:24.719> are<00:06:24.779> the<00:06:24.839> tail<00:06:25.050> caps<00:06:25.319> once<00:06:26.249> again<00:06:26.399> the

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 
so here are the tail caps once again the

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.299 
so here are the tail caps once again the
newer<00:06:27.419> is<00:06:27.629> on<00:06:27.779> the<00:06:27.869> right<00:06:28.019> hand<00:06:28.199> side<00:06:28.319> it<00:06:29.249> is

00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:29.309 
newer is on the right hand side it is

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:34.429 
newer is on the right hand side it is
more<00:06:29.580> translucent<00:06:31.669> but<00:06:32.669> it's<00:06:32.909> I<00:06:33.209> mean<00:06:33.929> pretty

00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:34.439 
more translucent but it's I mean pretty

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:37.459 
more translucent but it's I mean pretty
much<00:06:34.619> the<00:06:34.800> same<00:06:35.809> there<00:06:36.809> are<00:06:36.929> there's<00:06:37.229> a<00:06:37.289> little

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:37.469 
much the same there are there's a little

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:39.109 
much the same there are there's a little
bit<00:06:37.619> of<00:06:37.679> junk<00:06:37.979> on<00:06:38.159> it<00:06:38.339> I<00:06:38.519> wonder<00:06:38.909> if<00:06:38.969> that's

00:06:39.109 --> 00:06:39.119 
bit of junk on it I wonder if that's

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:41.479 
bit of junk on it I wonder if that's
from<00:06:39.659> the<00:06:39.749> reduction<00:06:40.110> processor<00:06:40.589> or<00:06:40.919> how

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:41.489 
from the reduction processor or how

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:44.269 
from the reduction processor or how
that's<00:06:41.999> done<00:06:42.239> but<00:06:42.539> it<00:06:43.289> may<00:06:43.559> rub<00:06:43.800> off<00:06:43.949> it<00:06:44.129> may

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:44.279 
that's done but it may rub off it may

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.369 
that's done but it may rub off it may
not<00:06:44.429> I'm<00:06:44.610> not<00:06:44.639> sure<00:06:44.999> one<00:06:45.719> other<00:06:45.839> thing<00:06:45.959> is<00:06:46.349> I

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:46.379 
not I'm not sure one other thing is I

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:49.189 
not I'm not sure one other thing is I
actually<00:06:47.009> went<00:06:47.309> to<00:06:47.399> unscrew<00:06:47.819> it<00:06:47.849> and<00:06:48.199> the
