00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Hi there, you're on Steven channel and 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.529
 today i keep playing the mortal game 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.020
 kombat x 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.290
 and today I met the same 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.570
 that damn stuck in one battle mode 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.429
 the battle I met with the boss I already 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.859
 began to pass was I hope 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.189
 preserved until everything is preserved and how are you 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.859
 see after ermak as i understood as i 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.710
 understood except kenshi nobody can 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.510
 win and so in any case me 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.050
 will have to use this boss 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.050
 less 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.180
 I decided to do this 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.700
 so that I had both 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.149
 at least one more kenshi in the stock here 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.219
 for example extremely damage kenshi and yet 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.520
 one kenshi then silver which i 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.309
 just recently pumped it up 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.860
 I think to 15 and 16 level and I have it 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.500
 first you yes I spent all the coins 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.840
 moments that I had and which I 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.449
 saving up for swinging kenshi to 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.340
 I had another character reserve 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.010
 most defeat this boss since 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.750
 really, so I try not to beat him 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.210
 I didn't beat him 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.970
 besides kenshi well let's look at 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.369
 this is how you see kenshi here 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.710
 and farms therefore need to be blocked in 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.220
 this way and then immediately apply 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.549
 damage 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.799
 see how would ermak he especially yet 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.659
 answers yes he answers and even has 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.700
 exhaustion that's what annoys me a little 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.210
 I still had a full 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.640
 his own and became exhausted and let's say so 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.200
 see if I can win now because 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.000
 that last time all the times were 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.799
 failures so I prepared yet 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.360
 one 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.310
 hermag she 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.650
 not fair exactly the same for any 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.480
 case here is an ordinary character it is not 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.800
 earlier as you see how much damage i am 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.790
 understanding and our 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.820
 Well, it's useless, but just not one damage 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.400
 simply does not pass but Raiden's 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.340
 raider as if we beat again see damage 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.590
 in general, no has been applied now 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.250
 release this silence and see how much 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.590
 damage he does now and managed to win 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.920
 it will be of course very cool if not 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.660
 it will turn out to be a little offensive as you 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.410
 see on his life yet 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.239
 trash left and therefore I do not know 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.600
 managed to withstand 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.930
 Here is such a rush that a little more 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.270
 i'm not just not exhaustion fine 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.550
 managed so far as you see I have everything 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.640
 it turns out I thought that maybe not 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.880
 get to like everything goes pretty 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.560
 not bad I even win but in any 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.450
 moment as you see here thanks 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.830
 his return he can inflict on me 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.190
 damage and so on I can lose though 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.110
 although no though they won now 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.840
 maybe maybe maybe I won't 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.660
 deny that maybe it helped me 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.720
 tried to beat him several times 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.060
 somehow so it happened that only with 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.580
 this time is cool fatalities by the way 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.130
 very cool just from this time I have 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.140
 it turned out it is still possible 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.750
 need to thank that I had 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.640
 friendly character who walked and therefore 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.709
 when you are like this here 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.350
 take kenshi without him anyway 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.510
 here I do not know how to go yet 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.850
 this battle 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.310
 what do i have for you now 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.709
 show this character 10,000 coins but also 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.769
 received plus three souls which is not so 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.959
 bad and let me go in now 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.840
 next tower but now animation 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.910
 will go and show you the way we switched to 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.940
 the next location is not so bad 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.430
 and let's show the squad here it is 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.670
 this kenshi as you see this one here 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.390
 the character is silver pepper i think 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.960
 do you remember the acquired in 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.140
 series on the wars of the game faction pumped 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.450
 pumped up to what level 16 it turns out 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.080
 and bought him another elite thereby 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.970
 the character turns out quite good I 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.040
 I will not show this part already 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.770
 which was given only to this 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.600
 boss how does this character work in 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.270
 Iâ€™ll only see the next series 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.390
 the fact that the character is not bad so what can 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.730
 quietly finish off the usual three strokes 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.220
 just one character on it especially 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.790
 I donâ€™t do damage 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.310
 This is very cool by the way looks here 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.040
 such things and so here I went 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.470
 this boss here I did not show 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.120
 you previous battles usually these battles I 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.280
 I think nobody is interested interestingly 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.490
 the main boss battle and how I him 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.940
 passed and passed and here I am 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.520
 way you just saw it same 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.010
 and about the rest say bye 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.380
 i can't do anything special by the way 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.410
 I shook it now who else will say I shook 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.660
 its in the wars of the faction I do not know the soldiers 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.900
 stock is not bad quite good so here 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.760
 theme for pumping characters as anyone 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.490
 say so to me it's pretty 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.490
 liked it anyway if i 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.890
 I will upgrade the character of kenshi to 7 with a 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.380
 I will probably do it to the main Persians 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.210
 so as they say to me that here silver 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.970
 character, in principle, you can go all 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.860
 the game but we'll see what 's all about it 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.690
 another episode coming soon 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.760
 by mkx because it worked 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.140
