00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:13.730
 we use dear today would like to 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:17.360
 talk about such nozzles commoners 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:22.400
 sort of called perlovit heard exact 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:25.279
 The name is crazy found on rivers and 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.460
 the lakes of the middle lane then everything is often possible 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.830
 see she crawls constantly then 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.710
 spike in the sand 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:41.570
 leave such peculiar traces to the sand 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:44.030
 what good is this nozzle come to 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.120
 coming on let's give it is 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.699
 natural food 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:54.129
 fish are not so often though they come across 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.809
 does not contain protein 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.030
 compared to other snails when 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:05.000
 shot the video how to cut everything 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:07.400
 this is a pearl say let's clean 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.770
 much faster and easier to wear on 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.060
 hook and the most important plus with good 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:17.119
 cool she is much tougher than others and 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.670
 snail species that allows longer 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.289
 stick on a hook 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.649
 in order to properly and well 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.729
 the easiest is to just sideways with this 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:32.450
 sides and from this side incise with a knife 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:39.979
 Once on, we cut two muscles 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:42.590
 sides of this snail let's say it in her 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.570
 the shell will unfold now I will put on 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.710
 pause make two hands which is uncomfortable 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:56.409
 do and then continue so continue 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:59.810
 incising the muscles end up here it is something covers 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.869
 protection that we see inside this one here 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.289
 the main part with which she and 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.289
 creeps 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.440
 principle here on this l about m when bad 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.040
 this soft tissue is torn off 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.610
 which on both sides of the shell and 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.239
 wear too is a good nozzle 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:29.200
 for roll valish any faith in particular 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:35.330
 But yesterday's this solid piece caught 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.640
 a couple small podleschikov 600 grams 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.380
 700 of these 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.610
 well worth it if i don't 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.180
 I never caught a bite enough 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.829
 sure 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.390
 I would think that this is all the same 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.980
 natural fish nozzle 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.430
 so she would be more like that 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.220
 said 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:01.519
 more confident to take others we do there 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.030
 let's try everything again delivered 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.970
 pauses 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.370
 cut I 'll take the main part she just 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.730
 the knife podpapotka pulled out trimmed 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:16.989
 from the main shell and then 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.989
 continue here it turned out that we 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:24.829
 carefully turned out then a hundred percent 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.880
 leave us all she is more it is not 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:31.790
 you need can be disposed of here well then 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:38.269
 about what I said on the covers themselves 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:41.480
 there was a soft so very substance 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.580
 i would say so 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.860
 can also be found tendons for which 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.049
 can be hung on a hook cautious 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.980
 a fish with a bad bite will be good 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.819
 his brother and this is the main part in the 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.890
 which is like 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:00.430
 catching it now i'm catching this sucker 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.560
 You are the main part that goes and well 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.480
 moves through the water using 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.670
 account of this one here too 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.129
 rubber she is such a tendon 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.290
 just counter a couple of times through 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.780
 hook through it can even close 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:22.639
 you can hide it in the main 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:26.060
 she is much softer everything is basically possible 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.470
 Here and throw fish pecks here on 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.800
 such a healthy piece can be caught 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:37.840
 podleschika or guster absolutely small 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:43.210
 here I have in the course of single poklevochka 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.210
 here on this shell 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:48.059
 all thank you for your attention to here
