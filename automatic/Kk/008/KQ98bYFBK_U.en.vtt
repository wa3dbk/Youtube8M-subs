00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.520
 Trains continue to drive high demands on wheel quality 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.000
 Meet wheel size tolerances 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.200
 And surface quality requirements are critical 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.760
 This is about the safety of driving. 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.400
 And passenger comfort 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.760
 Processing finished wheels involves a whole manufacturing chain 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.200
 Including different molding processes 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.200
 Metal cutting and testing 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.680
 The billet is heated in a rotary kiln before forging 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.200
 After the center is stamped out, the roll is formed. 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.760
 The bending process gives the final shape of the wheel 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.640
 Then the rim is placed in water and quenched 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.840
 Thereby hardening it 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.680
 Finally, test the mechanical properties of the wheel 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.040
 Make sure the wheels are suitable for the next step 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.160
 In order to achieve the required size and surface quality 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.560
 The hub webs and rims on the wheels must be machined 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.840
 Round blade with upper and lower coolant 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.560
 For optimum performance and chip evacuation 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.880
 Non-destructive testing ensures that the wheel surface is satisfied 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.120
 Quality and tolerance requirements 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.840
 Then fix the wheel to the shaft and install it on the train 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.800
 Ready to use 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.560
 After the train has been on the rails for a while 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.800
 Wheels must be heavy 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.280
 The train entered the mechanic workshop 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.720
 All scratches, flange deformation 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.640
 And cracks are eliminated here 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.240
 The wheels must be restored to their original standards 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.680
 Can be put back into use
