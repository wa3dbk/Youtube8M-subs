I asked down to make me some cases and
this<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.070> an<00:00:29.279> example<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.970> case<00:00:30.210> he<00:00:30.359> made<00:00:30.510> for

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
this is an example of a case he made for

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.749 
this is an example of a case he made for
me<00:00:30.750> he<00:00:31.260> made<00:00:31.439> me<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> couple<00:00:31.949> DS<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.460> just

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
me he made me a couple DS this is just

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.240 
me he made me a couple DS this is just
one<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:32.940> haven't<00:00:33.180> used<00:00:33.420> yet<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.590> an<00:00:34.680> n64

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
one I haven't used yet this is an n64

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.180 
one I haven't used yet this is an n64
and<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.510> tell<00:00:36.719> uh<00:00:37.160> everything<00:00:38.160> is

and if you can tell uh everything is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.250 
and if you can tell uh everything is
nicely<00:00:38.520> cut<00:00:38.910> out<00:00:39.059> there's<00:00:39.420> no<00:00:39.600> imperfections

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
nicely cut out there's no imperfections

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.410 
nicely cut out there's no imperfections
in<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.379> case<00:00:40.620> that's<00:00:41.460> because<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.879> CNC

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
in the case that's because the CNC

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.510 
in the case that's because the CNC
machine<00:00:42.750> kind<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.230> cut<00:00:43.620> things<00:00:43.739> perfectly<00:00:44.190> and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
machine kind of cut things perfectly and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.330 
machine kind of cut things perfectly and
Downing's<00:00:45.390> really<00:00:45.629> good<00:00:45.809> at<00:00:46.129> designing<00:00:47.129> and

Downing's really good at designing and
cad<00:00:47.550> he<00:00:48.450> designed<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.140> whole<00:00:49.320> case<00:00:49.559> for<00:00:49.770> me

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
cad he designed this whole case for me

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.410 
cad he designed this whole case for me
with<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> few<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.059> sketches<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.510> made<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:53.190> uh

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
with a few of sketches I made so uh

with a few of sketches I made so uh
downing<00:00:54.420> made<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> cases<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.890> couple<00:00:56.550> n64

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
downing made the cases in a couple n64

cutting things next we have my GameCube
portable<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.970> design

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
portable as you can see it's design

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.810 
portable as you can see it's design
using<00:01:24.720> our<00:01:24.840> Wii<00:01:25.020> U<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.470> Wii<00:01:25.799> U<00:01:25.830> case<00:01:26.189> actually

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
using our Wii U a Wii U case actually

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.990 
using our Wii U a Wii U case actually
made<00:01:27.270> out<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.630> Wii<00:01:27.780> U<00:01:27.930> carrying<00:01:28.290> case<00:01:28.500> and

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
made out of a Wii U carrying case and

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.580 
made out of a Wii U carrying case and
it's<00:01:30.000> really<00:01:30.360> shiny<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.110> use<00:01:31.290> gloss

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
it's really shiny because I use gloss

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.380 
it's really shiny because I use gloss
paint<00:01:31.950> there's<00:01:32.700> kind<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.119> lot<00:01:33.299> of

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
paint there's kind of a lot of

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.280 
paint there's kind of a lot of
fingerprints<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:34.110> it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
fingerprints on it

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.230 
fingerprints on it
I<00:01:34.439> should<00:01:34.890> probably<00:01:34.979> clean<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.460> up<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:36.180> I

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
I should probably clean this up for I

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.420 
I should probably clean this up for I
ship<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.659> out<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> charger<00:01:38.400> because

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
ship it out it's on the charger because

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.910 
ship it out it's on the charger because
the<00:01:39.090> batteries<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.479> died<00:01:39.810> when<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.890> was

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the batteries just died when I was

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.889 
the batteries just died when I was
playing<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.460> earlier<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.560> yeah<00:01:44.329> so<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.689> course
