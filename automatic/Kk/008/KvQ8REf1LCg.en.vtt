00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
ready so that's kind of the reasoning

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.650 
ready so that's kind of the reasoning
behind<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.910> outfit<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.600> a

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
behind this outfit but it's just a

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
behind this outfit but it's just a
really<00:00:24.840> simple<00:00:24.990> outfit<00:00:25.350> i<00:00:25.439> thought<00:00:25.590> i<00:00:25.619> would

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
really simple outfit i thought i would

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.250 
really simple outfit i thought i would
share<00:00:25.949> anyway<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.460> i<00:00:26.760> ran<00:00:27.390> out<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.539> contact<00:00:27.960> so

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
share anyway and i ran out of contact so

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.269 
share anyway and i ran out of contact so
I'm<00:00:28.349> worried<00:00:28.560> I've<00:00:28.710> been<00:00:28.740> wearing<00:00:28.980> my<00:00:29.099> glasses

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.919 
I'm worried I've been wearing my glasses
because<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.789> used<00:00:30.000> my<00:00:30.119> last<00:00:30.269> pair<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.900> they

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
because I used my last pair and they

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.990 
because I used my last pair and they
split<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:32.040> me<00:00:32.160> when<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.369> was<00:00:32.399> taking<00:00:32.730> them<00:00:32.850> home
