okay<00:00:02.520> in<00:00:02.610> this<00:00:02.700> video<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.240> am<00:00:03.270> going<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.750> sharpen

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
okay in this video I am going to sharpen

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.320 
okay in this video I am going to sharpen
my<00:00:06.049> parting<00:00:07.049> beading<00:00:07.440> tools<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.040> also<00:00:08.700> the

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
my parting beading tools and also the

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.089 
my parting beading tools and also the
began<00:00:09.690> which<00:00:10.019> works<00:00:10.320> in<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.530> very<00:00:10.679> similar<00:00:10.950> way

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
began which works in a very similar way

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.730 
began which works in a very similar way
although<00:00:11.790> it's<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.240> slightly<00:00:12.809> different<00:00:13.019> cross

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
although it's a slightly different cross

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.049 
although it's a slightly different cross
sectional<00:00:14.160> shape<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.519> principle<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.000> exactly

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
sectional shape the principle is exactly

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.010 
sectional shape the principle is exactly
the<00:00:15.450> same<00:00:16.130> for<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.359> operation<00:00:18.359> first<00:00:18.869> thing

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
the same for this operation first thing

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.960 
the same for this operation first thing
I'm<00:00:19.109> going<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.260> do<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.949> coloring<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:22.970> existing

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
I'm going to do is coloring the existing

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.170 
I'm going to do is coloring the existing
bevel<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.600> tool<00:00:27.470> with<00:00:28.470> permanent<00:00:28.769> marker

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.959 

now<00:00:33.180> I'm<00:00:33.239> going<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.480> move<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.590> my<00:00:34.829> tool<00:00:35.790> rest

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
now I'm going to move in my tool rest

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.680 
now I'm going to move in my tool rest
bar<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:39.809> line<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.530> with<00:00:40.920> tool<00:00:41.450> resting<00:00:42.450> on

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
bar and line it up with tool resting on

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.910 
bar and line it up with tool resting on
the<00:00:42.809> wheel<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.320> I'm<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.770> pull<00:00:43.890> it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the wheel and I'm just going to pull it

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
the wheel and I'm just going to pull it
back<00:00:44.040> until<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:45.390> can't<00:00:45.899> see<00:00:46.230> daylight

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
back until I can't see daylight

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.330 
back until I can't see daylight
underneath<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:49.110> tool<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.800> should<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.160> about

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
underneath the tool it should be about

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.319 
underneath the tool it should be about
there<00:00:50.670> lock<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.510> off<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> rotate<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
there lock that off and the rotate the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.819 
there lock that off and the rotate the
wheel<00:00:54.480> by<00:00:54.660> hand<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.440> hopefully<00:00:57.829> see

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
wheel by hand and hopefully see

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.790 
wheel by hand and hopefully see
something<00:00:59.250> taking<00:00:59.550> off<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.940> metal<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
something taking off the metal on the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.039 
something taking off the metal on the
wheel<00:01:04.909> mostly<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.360> center<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
wheel mostly in the center but the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.719 
wheel mostly in the center but the
reason<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.350> doing<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> center<00:01:08.280> is

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
reason is doing it in the center is

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.940 
reason is doing it in the center is
because<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.180> yeah<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.750> tend<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.320> rock<00:01:10.770> it

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
because I yeah I tend to just rock it

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.920 
because I yeah I tend to just rock it
all<00:01:11.130> forward<00:01:11.610> slightly<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.210> where<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.659> stop<00:01:12.900> a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
all forward slightly to where to stop a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.649 
all forward slightly to where to stop a
concave<00:01:13.970> edge<00:01:14.990> bring<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.110> out<00:01:16.259> just<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.740> touch

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
concave edge bring it out just a touch

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.770 
concave edge bring it out just a touch
so<00:01:18.659> I'm<00:01:18.810> happy<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.290> its<00:01:19.530> placement<00:01:23.780> there

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
so I'm happy with its placement there

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.440 
so I'm happy with its placement there
you<00:01:24.869> go<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.320> now<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.830> starting<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.450> just

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you go you see now it's starting to just

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.670 
you go you see now it's starting to just
wear<00:01:27.689> off<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.430> off<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.490> edge<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.020> put

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
wear off the off the edge so I can put

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.420 
wear off the off the edge so I can put
my<00:01:31.740> goggles<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:33.500> get<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.560> grinder<00:01:34.950> up<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.220> full

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
my goggles on get the grinder up to full

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.800 
my goggles on get the grinder up to full
speed

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810

and then assuring that they it's all is

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.330 
and then assuring that they it's all is
Square<00:01:42.799> to<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.100> wheel<00:01:44.770> forgive<00:01:45.770> me<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:45.890> squared

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
Square to the wheel forgive me a squared

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
the you've got a bigger wheel that

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.380 
the you've got a bigger wheel that
doesn't<00:02:34.770> happen<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.250> much<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.150> try<00:02:36.360> and

because<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.609> needs<00:03:45.819> a<00:03:45.879> good<00:03:46.000> sharpen

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
because that needs a good sharpen

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.409 
because that needs a good sharpen
recently<00:03:47.470> changed<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:48.010> yang<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:48.939> the<00:03:49.060> bevel

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
recently changed the yang of the bevel

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:54.360 
recently changed the yang of the bevel
on<00:03:49.510> this<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.049> it's<00:03:50.799> actually<00:03:51.480> that's<00:03:53.370> the

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
on this so it's actually that's the

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.030 
on this so it's actually that's the
other<00:03:54.459> sort<00:03:54.939> it<00:03:55.180> was<00:03:55.359> quite<00:03:55.629> long<00:03:56.040> but

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
other sort it was quite long but

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.699 
other sort it was quite long but
isosceles<00:03:57.849> another<00:03:58.510> just<00:03:58.840> reduce<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.379> angle

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
isosceles another just reduce the angle

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.369 
isosceles another just reduce the angle
down<00:03:59.889> so<00:04:00.989> push<00:04:01.989> that<00:04:02.019> back<00:04:02.409> in<00:04:02.879> to<00:04:04.200> three<00:04:05.200> mil

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
down so push that back in to three mil

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:22.580 
down so push that back in to three mil
PT<00:04:05.909> like<00:04:06.909> the<00:04:07.060> wheel<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:07.389> stop<00:04:08.730> hopefully

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.140 

just<00:04:23.590> doing<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.980> edge<00:04:24.130> of<00:04:24.340> that<00:04:24.490> once<00:04:24.730> we<00:04:25.000> need

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
just doing the edge of that once we need

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.970 
just doing the edge of that once we need
to<00:04:25.300> come<00:04:25.510> in<00:04:27.389> touch<00:04:28.740> three-on-two<00:04:29.740> line<00:04:31.980> see

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
to come in touch three-on-two line see

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.100 
to come in touch three-on-two line see
the<00:04:33.070> changing<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.639> sounds<00:04:34.060> there<00:04:34.270> there<00:04:35.020> we

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
the changing the sounds there there we

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.440 
the changing the sounds there there we
go

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
go

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.230 
go
now<00:04:37.450> these<00:04:37.720> thing<00:04:38.050> partying<00:04:38.560> tools<00:04:39.000> it's<00:04:40.000> very

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
now these thing partying tools it's very

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.100 
now these thing partying tools it's very
important<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:40.900> get<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.430> blade<00:04:42.900> vertical<00:04:43.900> and

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
important to get the blade vertical and

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.600 
important to get the blade vertical and
square<00:04:44.530> if<00:04:44.770> you've<00:04:44.889> got<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:45.100> keep<00:04:45.250> between<00:04:45.430> the

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
square if you've got to keep between the

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.230 
square if you've got to keep between the
handle<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.770> and<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.950> tool<00:04:48.220> you<00:04:48.970> need<00:04:49.090> to

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
handle and the and the tool you need to

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.629 
handle and the and the tool you need to
ignore<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.900> line<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.260> handle<00:04:50.740> and<00:04:51.250> go<00:04:51.490> with

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
ignore the line and handle and go with

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:58.290 
ignore the line and handle and go with
the<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:52.600> tool<00:04:52.870> being<00:04:56.130> vertical<00:04:57.130> square<00:04:58.090> onto

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
the the tool being vertical square onto

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.650 
the the tool being vertical square onto
the<00:04:58.510> wheel<00:04:59.520> there<00:05:00.520> we<00:05:00.639> go<00:05:00.820> I<00:05:01.060> just<00:05:01.240> did<00:05:01.600> the

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
the wheel there we go I just did the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:46.129 
the wheel there we go I just did the
same<00:05:01.810> again<00:05:02.220> basically<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.430> run<00:05:03.550> up<00:05:03.729> to<00:05:03.820> speed

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:51.080 

Check<00:05:46.740> Into<00:05:46.919> there's<00:05:47.220> no<00:05:49.220> green<00:05:50.220> pen<00:05:50.580> left<00:05:50.849> on

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
Check Into there's no green pen left on

00:05:51.090 --> 00:06:02.570 
Check Into there's no green pen left on
me<00:05:55.460> like<00:05:56.460> that<00:05:58.250> super<00:06:00.590> this<00:06:01.590> like<00:06:01.889> it's<00:06:02.430> not

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
me like that super this like it's not

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.749 
me like that super this like it's not
even<00:06:02.789> really<00:06:02.939> that<00:06:03.030> warm<00:06:03.360> up<00:06:03.479> and<00:06:03.689> hold<00:06:03.840> up<00:06:04.759> no

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
even really that warm up and hold up no

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:13.429 
even really that warm up and hold up no
longer<00:06:10.729> okay<00:06:11.729> and<00:06:12.719> that's<00:06:12.900> the<00:06:12.990> thin<00:06:13.199> foil

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:13.439 
longer okay and that's the thin foil

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.939 
longer okay and that's the thin foil
until<00:06:14.870> exactly<00:06:15.870> the<00:06:16.110> same<00:06:16.289> way<00:06:16.530> there's<00:06:16.860> the

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949 
until exactly the same way there's the

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:22.730 
until exactly the same way there's the
roughing<00:06:17.280> gouge<00:06:21.319> and<00:06:22.319> then<00:06:22.469> the<00:06:22.530> same

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
roughing gouge and then the same

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.589 
roughing gouge and then the same
procedure<00:06:23.099> for<00:06:23.219> the<00:06:23.430> bit<00:06:23.550> down<00:06:23.699> what<00:06:24.539> I'm

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
procedure for the bit down what I'm

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:25.969 
procedure for the bit down what I'm
going<00:06:24.719> to<00:06:24.750> do<00:06:24.870> on<00:06:24.990> the<00:06:25.080> boudin<00:06:25.349> is<00:06:25.409> just<00:06:25.800> give

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
going to do on the boudin is just give

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.909 
going to do on the boudin is just give
it<00:06:26.069> a<00:06:26.159> slight<00:06:26.430> undercut<00:06:26.940> on<00:06:27.719> the<00:06:28.050> on<00:06:28.590> the<00:06:28.740> heel

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
it a slight undercut on the on the heel

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.350 
it a slight undercut on the on the heel
there<00:06:29.599> just<00:06:30.599> round<00:06:30.840> that<00:06:30.990> over<00:06:31.259> slightly<00:06:32.360> once

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
there just round that over slightly once

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.080 
there just round that over slightly once
this<00:06:33.509> is<00:06:33.690> stopped<00:06:33.960> one<00:06:34.770> way<00:06:34.979> for<00:06:35.190> that<00:06:35.219> just

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
this is stopped one way for that just

00:06:36.090 --> 00:07:00.189 
this is stopped one way for that just
cover<00:06:36.300> this<00:06:36.419> in

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:03.920
