take a look at the katadyn vario and

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.270 
take a look at the katadyn vario and
show<00:00:11.310> how<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.670> replace<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.480> carbon<00:00:13.280> inside

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280

the<00:00:14.520> filter<00:00:14.810> pretty<00:00:15.810> simple<00:00:16.139> process<00:00:16.350> just

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
the filter pretty simple process just

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.970 
the filter pretty simple process just
takes<00:00:17.039> about<00:00:17.189> a<00:00:17.310> minute<00:00:17.550> two<00:00:17.970> minutes<00:00:18.300> and

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
takes about a minute two minutes and

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.950 
takes about a minute two minutes and
relatively<00:00:19.980> inexpensive<00:00:20.100> as<00:00:20.789> well<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.840> can

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
relatively inexpensive as well you can

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.470 
relatively inexpensive as well you can
buy<00:00:22.110> a<00:00:22.140> 2<00:00:22.440> pack<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.980> carbon<00:00:23.430> for<00:00:23.670> about<00:00:23.850> $10

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.500 
buy a 2 pack of carbon for about $10
online<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.980> simply<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.580> grab<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> lower

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
online so simply I grab the lower

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.840 
online so simply I grab the lower
portion<00:00:28.020> of<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> filter<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.400> upper

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
portion of the filter and the upper

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.250 
portion of the filter and the upper
portion<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.570> twist<00:00:31.699> that<00:00:32.699> separates<00:00:33.449> the<00:00:34.020> top

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
portion and twist that separates the top

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.310 
portion and twist that separates the top
from<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.770> bottom<00:00:35.250> part<00:00:36.060> of<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> filter<00:00:36.630> go

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
from the bottom part of the filter go

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.160 
from the bottom part of the filter go
and<00:00:37.470> remove<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.920> ceramic<00:00:38.870> element<00:00:39.870> right

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
and remove this ceramic element right

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.670 
and remove this ceramic element right
there<00:00:40.670> put<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.850> down<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.750> right<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.290> this

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
there put that down and right here this

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.229 
there put that down and right here this
red<00:00:43.980> little<00:00:44.160> cap<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.640> where<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.970> have<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
red little cap is where you have the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.959 
red little cap is where you have the
chamber<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.840> carbon<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:47.250> not<00:00:47.460> threaded

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
chamber for the carbon it's not threaded

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.490 
chamber for the carbon it's not threaded
so<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.480> can<00:00:48.630> turn<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.930> any<00:00:49.050> direction<00:00:49.140> you

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
so you can turn in any direction you

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.220 
so you can turn in any direction you
want<00:00:49.610> just<00:00:50.610> kind<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.790> twist<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.270> pull<00:00:51.540> and<00:00:51.870> it

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
want just kind of twist and pull and it

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.830 
want just kind of twist and pull and it
comes<00:00:52.440> out<00:00:53.180> as<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.450> see<00:00:54.600> there's<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
comes out as you can see there's a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.600 
comes out as you can see there's a
little<00:00:54.930> green<00:00:55.260> kind<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.800> scotch<00:00:56.070> brite<00:00:56.370> type

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
little green kind of scotch brite type

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.760 
little green kind of scotch brite type
material<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:58.170> kind<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.469> holds<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
material there that kind of holds the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.310 
material there that kind of holds the
carbon<00:00:59.070> down<00:00:59.250> there<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.579> just<00:00:59.850> got<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.260> my

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
carbon down there I just got one of my

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.060 
carbon down there I just got one of my
son's<00:01:01.649> little<00:01:02.480> Forks<00:01:03.680> go<00:01:04.680> ahead<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.920> flip

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
son's little Forks go ahead and flip

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.530 
son's little Forks go ahead and flip
that<00:01:05.280> around<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.290> take<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.470> out<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.360> you<00:01:09.360> can

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
that around and take that out so you can

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.200 
that around and take that out so you can
see<00:01:09.720> there's<00:01:09.930> some<00:01:10.369> carbon<00:01:11.369> chunks<00:01:12.030> right

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
see there's some carbon chunks right

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.649 
see there's some carbon chunks right
there<00:01:12.770> from<00:01:13.770> here<00:01:13.950> what<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.790> go

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
there from here what you just do is go

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:24.090 
there from here what you just do is go
ahead<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:17.780> start<00:01:18.780> pulling<00:01:19.350> out<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.740> junk

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.810 

I<00:01:24.970> can<00:01:25.750> obviously<00:01:26.189> take<00:01:27.189> it<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.460> your<00:01:27.580> sink

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
I can obviously take it to your sink

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.550 
I can obviously take it to your sink
which<00:01:28.119> you're<00:01:28.600> not<00:01:28.689> going<00:01:28.930> to<00:01:29.020> see<00:01:29.170> because

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
which you're not going to see because

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.600 
which you're not going to see because
I'm<00:01:29.710> filming<00:01:30.310> with<00:01:30.340> my<00:01:30.750> smartphone<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
I'm filming with my smartphone the

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.180 
I'm filming with my smartphone the
remnants<00:01:34.030> in<00:01:34.680> there's<00:01:35.680> better<00:01:35.950> lighting

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
remnants in there's better lighting

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.499 
remnants in there's better lighting
you'd<00:01:36.460> be<00:01:36.580> able<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.759> see<00:01:36.940> that<00:01:37.090> that's<00:01:37.240> clean

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
you'd be able to see that that's clean

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.230 
you'd be able to see that that's clean
all<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.720> way<00:01:37.780> through<00:01:37.990> at<00:01:38.770> this<00:01:38.890> point<00:01:39.240> you

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
all the way through at this point you

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.980 
all the way through at this point you
would<00:01:40.330> open<00:01:40.479> up<00:01:40.720> your<00:01:40.810> pouch<00:01:41.310> pour<00:01:42.310> it<00:01:42.430> in

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
would open up your pouch pour it in

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.690 
would open up your pouch pour it in
stick<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.140> green<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:45.159> comes<00:01:45.369> with<00:01:45.460> the

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
stick the green and it comes with the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.190 
stick the green and it comes with the
new<00:01:45.940> green<00:01:46.149> ones<00:01:46.390> when<00:01:46.509> you<00:01:46.600> buy<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.780> pouches

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
new green ones when you buy the pouches

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.870 
new green ones when you buy the pouches
and<00:01:48.899> then<00:01:49.899> you're<00:01:50.080> good<00:01:50.259> to<00:01:50.289> go

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
and then you're good to go

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.270 
and then you're good to go
I<00:01:51.880> don't<00:01:52.420> have<00:01:52.509> any<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:52.750> need<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:53.020> buy<00:01:53.140> some<00:01:53.440> this

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
I don't have any I need to buy some this

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.510 
I don't have any I need to buy some this
carbon<00:01:54.970> is<00:01:55.119> old<00:01:55.740> again<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:57.039> can<00:01:57.190> still<00:01:57.369> use

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
carbon is old again you can still use

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.790 
carbon is old again you can still use
the<00:01:57.640> filter<00:01:58.000> with<00:01:58.539> bad<00:01:58.840> carbon<00:01:59.319> you're<00:01:59.590> just

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
the filter with bad carbon you're just

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.100 
the filter with bad carbon you're just
not<00:01:59.950> going<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.220> have<00:02:00.399> any<00:02:00.580> of<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:01.110> flavor

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
not going to have any of the flavor

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.690 
not going to have any of the flavor
improvements<00:02:03.009> and<00:02:03.250> some<00:02:03.520> of<00:02:03.640> the

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
improvements and some of the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.690 
improvements and some of the
contaminants<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.659> carbon<00:02:04.960> takes<00:02:05.170> out

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
contaminants that the carbon takes out

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.419 
contaminants that the carbon takes out
so<00:02:06.700> it's<00:02:06.819> not<00:02:06.940> essential<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.950> making<00:02:09.250> the

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
so it's not essential to making the

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.080 
so it's not essential to making the
water<00:02:09.580> safe<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:12.100> is<00:02:12.250> definitely<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:12.940> nice

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
water safe but it is definitely a nice
