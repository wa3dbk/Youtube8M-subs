better<00:01:52.829> when<00:01:53.549> I'm<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> hormones<00:01:55.369> so<00:01:56.369> my

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
better when I'm on the hormones so my

because contamination of the product

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.990 
because contamination of the product
into<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.410> hair<00:03:32.770> will<00:03:33.130> obviously<00:03:33.520> kill<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:36.000> so

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000
