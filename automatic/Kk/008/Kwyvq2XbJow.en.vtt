Hey guys i'm Noted from GamesAcademy i wil show you today some pretty cool ways to win a round as a ct on the bombsite "B' of de_dust2

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:27.266
usually the guy who plays on the bombsite "B" is very lonely player

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:30.332
he needs to have some tricks to handle this bomb

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:36.333
so in a pistol round there somethings you can do to win a round for your team

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:42.199
the first thing is to come behind this box here on de half-body position sometimes i like to press duck here

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.733
is a very interesting position

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:51.033
and at the same time i have 2 flashbangs with me, I'm used to stop the terrorists rush

00:00:51.033 --> 00:01:03.499
and also help on the backup of my teammates

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:11.833
so what i like to do, i'm aways try to do a good teamplay, like making some grenade 

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:23.466
this will show i am here but will help my teammates a lot because on the pistol trs are not using kevlar

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:27.466
so this will take a lot of health of terrorists

00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:33.866
so.. ok i bang a grenade, i need a defensive flashbang now so i make that one, and back to the half-position

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:40.999
so this flash will not blind you, they wil turn to the flash and you try to kill someone in this seconds

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.833
when you realize the flash time is over, you come here and make this another flashbang and get back to the half-position

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:58.199
so this another flash will give you more time to kill 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.200
i will show you how good is that flashbang now

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:13.000
then you need to understand the flash time, takes three seconds to blow, then in the meantime you need to be quick

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
so is basically this guys

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.066
this flash takes a lot of time to explode and you can kill a lot of terrorists doing this

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:31.066
so is pretty usefull

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:34.566
I do not advise you to do the armed, because this box is easy to wallbang

00:02:34.566 --> 00:02:38.966
on armed i like to come here, on the starix box wait for some rush

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:45.466
another really cool flashbang is that one, you can do it on armed is really good

00:02:45.466 --> 00:02:53.699
is that one, so you come here, point your crosshair side this box and bang!

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.700
this flash explode high, and its a no reaction flash also

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:09.533
so what i do, it's make this flash, kill one or two, and get back for a good position

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:13.533
i like to stay on NO obvious positions, like that one 

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:18.233
i will show you some BAD position, 

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:22.233
so a relly cool thing FalleN teach me is never stay on obvious positions

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:30.499
so i like stay here, waiting for the terrorists, or here

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:42.733
I want to clarify here is that you should think about what the other team is thinking too

00:03:42.733 --> 00:03:47.899
and you need to have quick actions like i said to kill some terrorists rushing

00:03:47.900 --> 00:04:00.166
another really cool movimentation to use behide this box, fallen teach this on a FREEclass i will put the link os description

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:06.399
make some strafes shooting 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.500
for a good strafe you need to press "A" and when you see a enemy pres "D" at the same time you shot him !

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.433
is basically this guys

00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:24.433
so this is it guys thanks !

00:04:24.433 --> 00:04:37.333
whatch also !
