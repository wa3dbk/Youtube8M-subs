00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:02.749 
reasons that Rob sucks and the first one

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.380

is<00:01:02.929> he's<00:01:03.350> got<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:03.679> crazy<00:01:04.189> nutritional<00:01:05.119> stuff

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
is he's got this crazy nutritional stuff

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.690 
is he's got this crazy nutritional stuff
and<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:05.780> just<00:01:05.930> works<00:01:06.229> you<00:01:06.619> know<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:07.369> that's

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
and it just works you know and that's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.850 
and it just works you know and that's
hard<00:01:08.270> to<00:01:08.509> come<00:01:08.540> up<00:01:08.720> with<00:01:09.020> any<00:01:09.170> faults<00:01:09.590> for

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
hard to come up with any faults for

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.740 
hard to come up with any faults for
which<00:01:10.430> if<00:01:10.729> you<00:01:10.850> know<00:01:10.970> anything<00:01:11.329> about<00:01:11.420> me<00:01:11.659> at

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
which if you know anything about me at

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.200 
which if you know anything about me at
all<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.049> know<00:01:12.170> I<00:01:12.200> like<00:01:12.439> to<00:01:12.560> pick<00:01:12.740> on<00:01:12.860> people

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210

secondly<00:01:14.210> he's<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.659> biochemist<00:01:15.409> and<00:01:15.680> for<00:01:16.189> some

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
secondly he's a biochemist and for some

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.609 
secondly he's a biochemist and for some
reason<00:01:17.000> people<00:01:17.240> think<00:01:17.570> being<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:17.930> biochemist

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
reason people think being a biochemist

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.410 
reason people think being a biochemist
is<00:01:18.770> more<00:01:19.040> important<00:01:19.520> than<00:01:19.670> being<00:01:19.759> a<00:01:19.909> physicist

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
is more important than being a physicist

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.780 
is more important than being a physicist
in<00:01:20.600> this<00:01:20.720> industry<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.350> that<00:01:22.100> kind<00:01:22.430> of<00:01:22.520> pisses

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
in this industry and that kind of pisses

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.039 
in this industry and that kind of pisses
me<00:01:22.909> off<00:01:22.939> a<00:01:23.090> little<00:01:23.360> bit<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:23.899> at<00:01:24.829> the<00:01:25.070> moment

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
me off a little bit and at the moment

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.510 
me off a little bit and at the moment
ruptal<00:01:27.049> sucks<00:01:27.500> because<00:01:27.740> I<00:01:28.009> think<00:01:28.070> he's<00:01:28.340> got<00:01:28.490> a

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
ruptal sucks because I think he's got a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.280 
ruptal sucks because I think he's got a
little<00:01:28.579> stronger<00:01:28.909> deadlift<00:01:29.360> than<00:01:29.509> me<00:01:29.630> I<00:01:29.899> don't

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
little stronger deadlift than me I don't

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.929 
little stronger deadlift than me I don't
really<00:01:30.799> like<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:31.219> too<00:01:31.340> much<00:01:31.490> actually<00:01:31.759> I

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.340 
really like that too much actually I
think<00:01:32.360> it's<00:01:32.479> quite<00:01:32.689> a<00:01:32.719> bit<00:01:32.869> stronger<00:01:33.229> than

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
think it's quite a bit stronger than

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.670 
think it's quite a bit stronger than
mine

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680
