what<00:00:00.599> will<00:00:00.750> our<00:00:00.840> plan<00:00:01.079> look<00:00:01.319> like<00:00:01.350> in<00:00:01.620> a

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
what will our plan look like in a

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.360 
what will our plan look like in a
hundred<00:00:01.800> years<00:00:02.810> well<00:00:03.810> I<00:00:04.230> guess<00:00:04.950> that<00:00:05.100> depends

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
hundred years well I guess that depends

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.470 
hundred years well I guess that depends
on<00:00:05.490> what<00:00:05.670> we<00:00:05.790> do<00:00:06.000> in<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.270> next<00:00:06.799> ten<00:00:07.799> or<00:00:08.480> twenty

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
on what we do in the next ten or twenty

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:20.000 
on what we do in the next ten or twenty
oh<00:00:17.930> boy

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
oh boy

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.429 
oh boy
what<00:00:20.430> will<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.820> plan<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> look<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.199> hundred

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
what will the plan a look like a hundred

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.170 
what will the plan a look like a hundred
years<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.890> mean<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.189> think<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.490> depends<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:23.880> us<00:00:24.000> I

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
years I mean I think it depends on us I

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.609 
years I mean I think it depends on us I
mean<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.510> really<00:00:24.750> do<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.869> think<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.500> know

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
mean I really do I think it's you know

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.740 
mean I really do I think it's you know
the<00:00:26.220> next<00:00:26.550> few<00:00:26.910> decades<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.510> going<00:00:27.689> to

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
the next few decades is going to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.269 
the next few decades is going to
determine<00:00:28.080> what<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.650> planet<00:00:29.010> looks<00:00:29.070> like

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
determine what the planet looks like

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.560 
determine what the planet looks like
looks<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.640> for<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.849> next<00:00:29.880> several<00:00:30.390> million

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
looks like for the next several million

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.630 
looks like for the next several million
years<00:00:31.820> probably<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:33.180> what<00:00:33.360> we<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.840> imagine

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
years probably not what we can imagine

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.430 
years probably not what we can imagine
if<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.760> ever<00:00:35.910> watch<00:00:36.180> like<00:00:36.600> these<00:00:36.780> movies<00:00:37.200> like

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
if you ever watch like these movies like

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.680 
if you ever watch like these movies like
Blade<00:00:37.469> Runner<00:00:37.980> or<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.250> back<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.760> future<00:00:39.149> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
Blade Runner or a back of the future and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.600 
Blade Runner or a back of the future and
you<00:00:39.809> realize<00:00:40.140> where<00:00:40.379> they<00:00:40.710> think<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.489> know

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
you realize where they think you know

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.459 
you realize where they think you know
technology<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.600> planets<00:00:42.960> take<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.320> is

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
technology and the planets take this is

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.170 
technology and the planets take this is
off<00:00:43.620> often<00:00:44.160> wrong<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.640> mean<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:44.910> often

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
off often wrong I mean it's often

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.060 
off often wrong I mean it's often
extraordinarily<00:00:45.600> wrong<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.649> largely

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
extraordinarily wrong that largely

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.799 
extraordinarily wrong that largely
depends<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.850> how<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:49.789> adjust<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.180> how<00:00:51.629> we're

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
depends on how we adjust to how we're

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.360 
depends on how we adjust to how we're
living<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> planet<00:00:52.410> right<00:00:52.860> now<00:00:53.039> I'm

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
living on the planet right now I'm

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.670 
living on the planet right now I'm
hopeful<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.449> our<00:00:54.870> planet<00:00:55.230> will<00:00:55.379> look<00:00:55.559> great

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
hopeful that our planet will look great

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.010 
hopeful that our planet will look great
I'm<00:00:56.070> hopeful<00:00:56.550> it'll<00:00:56.699> be<00:00:56.850> covered<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.780> solar

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
I'm hopeful it'll be covered in solar

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.220 
I'm hopeful it'll be covered in solar
panels<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:59.239> have<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> lot<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.600> electric<00:01:00.989> cars

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
panels and have a lot of electric cars

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.810 
panels and have a lot of electric cars
running<00:01:01.859> around<00:01:03.379> but<00:01:04.379> I'm<00:01:04.500> not<00:01:04.680> really<00:01:04.830> sure

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
running around but I'm not really sure

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.700 
running around but I'm not really sure
that<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.180> will<00:01:06.360> happen<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.320> nothing

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that that will happen if we do nothing

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.310 
that that will happen if we do nothing
it's<00:01:08.189> kind<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.580> look<00:01:08.729> horrible<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.990> oceans

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
it's kind of look horrible the oceans

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.770 
it's kind of look horrible the oceans
will<00:01:10.530> turn<00:01:10.740> acidic<00:01:11.189> it'll<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:12.090> mostly

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
will turn acidic it'll be mostly

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.440 
will turn acidic it'll be mostly
dominated<00:01:13.350> by<00:01:13.530> jellyfish<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.000> big<00:01:15.210> ocean

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
dominated by jellyfish all the big ocean

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.359 
dominated by jellyfish all the big ocean
fish<00:01:15.840> will<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:16.170> gone<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.979> know<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.220> know<00:01:17.340> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
fish will be gone you know we know that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.640 
fish will be gone you know we know that
the<00:01:17.549> oceans<00:01:17.880> control<00:01:18.420> weather<00:01:18.930> patterns<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the oceans control weather patterns and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.350 
the oceans control weather patterns and
we<00:01:19.830> haven't<00:01:19.979> got<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> foggiest<00:01:20.490> idea<00:01:20.850> still

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
we haven't got the foggiest idea still

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.179 
we haven't got the foggiest idea still
about<00:01:22.080> how<00:01:22.229> they're<00:01:22.439> changing<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:23.040> they're

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
about how they're changing but they're

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.070 
about how they're changing but they're
changing<00:01:23.580> rapidly<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.090> dramatically<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
changing rapidly and dramatically and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.780 
changing rapidly and dramatically and
that's<00:01:25.380> not<00:01:25.590> good<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:25.770> humans<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:26.430> don't<00:01:26.460> like

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
that's not good for humans we don't like

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.469 
that's not good for humans we don't like
change<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.450> change<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.049> coming<00:01:28.439> Wow<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:30.390> know

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
change and change is coming Wow you know

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.390 
change and change is coming Wow you know
the<00:01:30.689> tracker<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.200> right<00:01:31.439> now<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> think<00:01:32.220> one

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
the tracker on right now I think one

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.280 
the tracker on right now I think one
thing<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.670> certain<00:01:33.000> our<00:01:33.270> planet<00:01:33.720> will<00:01:34.020> have

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
thing is certain our planet will have

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.499 
thing is certain our planet will have
far<00:01:34.829> fewer<00:01:35.159> species<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.000> that's<00:01:36.329> like

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
far fewer species of it that's like

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.690 
far fewer species of it that's like
knocking<00:01:36.930> one<00:01:37.710> card<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.369> house<00:01:38.490> of

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
knocking one card out of a house of

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.760 
knocking one card out of a house of
cards<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> question<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.750> what<00:01:40.470> will<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
cards and the question of what will the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.319 
cards and the question of what will the
rest<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> following<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.790> cards<00:01:42.180> look

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
rest of the following of the cards look

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.690 
rest of the following of the cards look
like<00:01:42.950> that's<00:01:43.950> really<00:01:44.250> hard<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.640> answer

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
like that's really hard to answer

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.700 
like that's really hard to answer
vehicle<00:01:45.479> system<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.869> know<00:01:45.930> most<00:01:46.290> about<00:01:46.470> is

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
vehicle system I know most about is

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.380 
vehicle system I know most about is
coral<00:01:46.979> reefs<00:01:47.130> that's<00:01:47.520> my<00:01:47.700> specialty

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
coral reefs that's my specialty

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.300 
coral reefs that's my specialty
right<00:01:48.720> now<00:01:48.899> if<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.619> go<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.920> reef<00:01:50.159> in

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
right now if you go to a reef in

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.760 
right now if you go to a reef in
Indonesia<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:51.000> might<00:01:51.240> find<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:51.689> much<00:01:51.840> as<00:01:52.020> 150

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
Indonesia we might find as much as 150

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.789 
Indonesia we might find as much as 150
