00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
and dry because I feel like nothing will

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.520 
and dry because I feel like nothing will
stick<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.970> your<00:02:24.060> lid<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.569> it's<00:02:24.959> powdery<00:02:25.410> and

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
stick to your lid is it's powdery and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.820 
stick to your lid is it's powdery and
dry<00:02:25.769> and<00:02:26.010> if<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:26.519> tacky<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:28.019> better

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
dry and if it's tacky you have a better

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.640 
dry and if it's tacky you have a better
chance<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.580> creasing<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.269> you<00:02:30.599> when<00:02:31.140> it's<00:02:31.440> a

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
chance of it creasing on you when it's a

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.320 
chance of it creasing on you when it's a
little<00:02:31.890> too<00:02:32.069> tacky<00:02:32.400> especially<00:02:32.849> when<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.090> first

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
little too tacky especially when I first

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.479 
little too tacky especially when I first
started<00:02:33.569> using<00:02:33.660> this<00:02:33.870> primer<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.470> wasn't<00:02:35.069> too

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
started using this primer I wasn't too

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.940 
started using this primer I wasn't too
impressed<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:36.150> felt<00:02:36.390> like<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.750> did<00:02:36.989> exactly

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
impressed I felt like it did exactly

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.610 
impressed I felt like it did exactly
what<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.310> was<00:02:38.670> supposed<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.630> do<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:40.080> didn't

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
what it was supposed to do I didn't

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.860 
what it was supposed to do I didn't
really<00:02:41.160> feel<00:02:41.400> like<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.880> enhanced<00:02:42.660> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
really feel like it enhanced the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.470 
really feel like it enhanced the
vibrancy<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.739> any<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.100> my<00:02:44.130> colors<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.880> just<00:02:45.299> felt

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
vibrancy of any of my colors I just felt

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.930 
vibrancy of any of my colors I just felt
like<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.750> gave<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.319> more<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:47.069> longevity<00:02:47.730> and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
like it gave it more of a longevity and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.430 
like it gave it more of a longevity and
they<00:02:48.060> did<00:02:48.269> last<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.690> little<00:02:48.900> bit<00:02:48.989> longer<00:02:49.200> and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
they did last a little bit longer and

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.500 
they did last a little bit longer and
didn't<00:02:49.799> crease<00:02:50.100> but<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.640> wasn't<00:02:50.910> too<00:02:51.239> impressed

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
didn't crease but I wasn't too impressed

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.949 
didn't crease but I wasn't too impressed
with<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:52.019> until<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:53.160> tried<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.880> film<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.540> exact

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959

will insert a clip for you guys really
quick<00:03:38.579> of<00:03:38.730> me<00:03:39.000> showing<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.359> how<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.870> pressed

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
quick of me showing you how a pressed

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.099 
quick of me showing you how a pressed
eyeshadow<00:03:41.190> looks<00:03:41.519> with<00:03:41.910> out<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.810> space<00:03:43.079> and

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
eyeshadow looks with out the space and

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.319 
eyeshadow looks with out the space and
then<00:03:43.530> with<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:44.069> base<00:03:44.250> underneath<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:45.090> you

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
then with the base underneath and you

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.300 
then with the base underneath and you
can<00:03:45.510> see<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.139> enhances<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.769> vibrancy<00:03:47.280> a

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
can see that it enhances the vibrancy a

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.699 
can see that it enhances the vibrancy a
lot<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.510> really<00:03:48.870> gives<00:03:49.109> it<00:03:49.260> something<00:03:49.500> to

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
lot and it really gives it something to

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.039 
lot and it really gives it something to
stick<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.130> my<00:03:50.670> only<00:03:51.060> concern<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.660> that

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
stick to my only concern is that

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.690 
stick to my only concern is that
sometimes<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.739> do<00:03:52.799> find<00:03:53.190> that<00:03:53.280> it's<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.549> little

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
sometimes I do find that it's a little

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.520 
sometimes I do find that it's a little
bit<00:03:53.880> too<00:03:54.090> hard<00:03:54.359> to<00:03:54.540> blend<00:03:54.750> with<00:03:55.350> this

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
bit too hard to blend with this

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.319 
bit too hard to blend with this
particular<00:03:55.799> base<00:03:56.160> it<00:03:56.670> all<00:03:56.819> depends<00:03:57.180> with<00:03:57.269> the

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
particular base it all depends with the

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.259 
particular base it all depends with the
eyeshadows<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:57.900> you're<00:03:58.290> using<00:03:59.090> there<00:04:00.090> are

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
eyeshadows that you're using there are

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.699 
eyeshadows that you're using there are
certain<00:04:00.630> eyeshadows<00:04:01.079> that<00:04:01.109> I've<00:04:01.290> used<00:04:01.560> with

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
certain eyeshadows that I've used with

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.699 
certain eyeshadows that I've used with
this<00:04:01.950> Mac<00:04:02.549> brand<00:04:03.090> included<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:04.139> it<00:04:04.319> does<00:04:04.470> not

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
this Mac brand included that it does not

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.580 
this Mac brand included that it does not
blend<00:04:05.100> out<00:04:05.310> very<00:04:05.670> well<00:04:05.750> but<00:04:06.750> other<00:04:07.230> than<00:04:07.530> that

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
blend out very well but other than that

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.770 
blend out very well but other than that
for<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.069> majority<00:04:08.190> of<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:09.090> shadows<00:04:09.510> that<00:04:09.540> I

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
for the majority of the shadows that I

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.750 
for the majority of the shadows that I
use<00:04:10.109> I<00:04:10.380> feel<00:04:11.010> like<00:04:11.190> this<00:04:11.430> worked

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
use I feel like this worked

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.789 
use I feel like this worked
exceptionally<00:04:12.180> well<00:04:12.690> so<00:04:13.079> yeah<00:04:13.200> I<00:04:13.410> think<00:04:13.470> it's

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
exceptionally well so yeah I think it's

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.229 
exceptionally well so yeah I think it's
nice<00:04:13.980> I<00:04:14.160> think<00:04:14.310> it's<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:14.459> pretty<00:04:14.670> good<00:04:14.910> product

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
nice I think it's a pretty good product

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.089 
nice I think it's a pretty good product
I<00:04:15.510> don't<00:04:15.659> think<00:04:15.840> it's<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.229> best<00:04:16.500> eye<00:04:16.739> primer

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
I don't think it's the best eye primer

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:18.860 
I don't think it's the best eye primer
I've<00:04:17.310> tried<00:04:17.609> I've<00:04:17.820> even<00:04:18.150> tried<00:04:18.299> drugstore

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
I've tried I've even tried drugstore

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.690 
I've tried I've even tried drugstore
primers<00:04:19.289> like<00:04:19.440> my

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
primers like my

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.790 
primers like my
Jessie's<00:04:20.000> Girl<00:04:20.210> I<00:04:20.420> primer<00:04:20.720> that<00:04:20.990> I<00:04:21.290> feel<00:04:21.620> like

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:21.800 
Jessie's Girl I primer that I feel like

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.410 
Jessie's Girl I primer that I feel like
works<00:04:22.040> a<00:04:22.160> little<00:04:22.370> bit<00:04:22.460> better<00:04:22.610> than<00:04:22.820> this<00:04:22.970> but

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
works a little bit better than this but

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.330 
works a little bit better than this but
overall<00:04:23.810> I<00:04:23.960> think<00:04:24.320> it<00:04:24.410> will<00:04:24.500> get<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.770> job<00:04:24.980> done

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
overall I think it will get the job done

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.220 
overall I think it will get the job done
so<00:04:25.640> that<00:04:25.790> is<00:04:26.030> it<00:04:26.270> for<00:04:26.540> what<00:04:26.660> I<00:04:26.690> think<00:04:26.990> about

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
so that is it for what I think about

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.740 
so that is it for what I think about
