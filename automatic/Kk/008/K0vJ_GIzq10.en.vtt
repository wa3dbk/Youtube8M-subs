00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.549
 you die of all and marcus that he has 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:16.470
 released the new frames the sun 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.160
 frame this inter inform you of stv the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.830
 name of the mind 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.540
 me until I see you in a video with 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.540
 thong and bra dancing 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.590
 can be 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:37.420
 but I'm not going to look for it in our 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.289
 twitter 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.780
 It's very good 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:45.989
 today we bring you a mini fool that 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.760
 well I can not put the name of 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.370
 mini machines because it is not a mini 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.860
 machine 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.420
 but good a foolish one that is then 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.700
 simply to solve a doubt that 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.340
 he made us a 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.410
 a user who said that how can you 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.210
 do with mutations with the repo 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.400
 res power to start has a 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.070
 commutation for those who do not know is 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.750
 this is you can turn on the lights 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.910
 from here and markku can turn them off 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.740
 from there and I can return the agency 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.479
 ndr from here without problems this is a 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.390
 switching have two different keys 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.050
 for the same circuit 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.979
 with the same function turn on and turn off 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.580
 independently from one side and from 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.290
 the other that is a commutation 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.940
 and surely explains a teacher 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.980
 Electricity explain another 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.700
 way and more technical and better but I do not 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.700
 I am the teacher 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.310
 that is to say I explain it of balès and good 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.310
 the circuit marc 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.730
 is very basic this repóker has its 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.020
 own a block with a block equal to 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.680
 has all the logical doors in a 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.540
 block because it has this I imagine being 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.000
 a logical door I do not know either very 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.210
 well how is this going 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.119
 and Kate 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.659
 thank you, I imagine that will be x or 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.659
 eregate 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.039
 x 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.110
 different 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:24.810
 Marcus knows all this because he is 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.519
 studying for them that of course here 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:33.640
 is studying a career if I do not 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:35.400
 I'm wrong that although the circuit is 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.590
 switched on 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.989
 the door has the property of making 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.840
 that light can be independently 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.370
 turn on or off from cats 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.290
 this can also be done with the rest 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.200
 normal and I know it 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.760
 you could build us and this only 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.680
 I'm seeing treason because it's not the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.569
 analysis before you start recording 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.069
 I could not build against are 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.140
 normal at times and it is very difficult not 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.330
 obviously you do it and then what 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.350
 we record 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.600
 I will not look but I pulse 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:11.510
 make you want to not explain what is 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.340
 Variant is already'm asking 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.910
 warned before I start recording of 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.910
 let him get off 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.870
 because it's running I have not had 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.980
 patience is that it seemed to me when we 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.300
 we have put to record I neither what 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.740
 I had thought but it seems a bit 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.750
 absurd to make a video to teach them 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.520
 what they have had seems to me of two 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.020
 minutes then well then we make a 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.020
 little more interesting like this is already 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.069
 I really do not care much about the long 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.709
 or short that is simply it is therefore because 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.440
 you because I think about it a bit 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.980
 you repeat I authorize you a piston 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.390
 this network status are touch 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.390
 to the red as not 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:11.130
 let's go to these little things these things if 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.170
 you want to see more of these things the one 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.850
 does many things with remains and other 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.920
 this nacho you will not know everything 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.170
 valeria so I'm sure he has his 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.930
 own door model and who are or how 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.420
 whatever you want to know and that is other than good 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.220
 Marco is doing it because 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.700
 I tell you that we have not 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.100
 explained here is a block or is it worth 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.140
 it is absurd then good so that 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.150
 you know a little bit more since he understands 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.150
 of rest that does the same 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.650
 because wait 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.539
 and thanks for that course 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.630
 This here 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.630
 today that is a normal and ordinary repetition 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.460
 already two tics once 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.790
 here we can a repeat that I forgot 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.190
 to catch the few saved buttons 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.430
 agreed at the time of the tics that 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.650
 we are in version 125 in the 132 by 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.550
 what I know what I talk about with tunes 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.760
 and else 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.890
 they have not changed or they have changed and 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.650
 now the pulses 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.500
 let's say we say that they have more 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.790
 delay in this then agreed that 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.480
 we are in 125 and this is being 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.040
 applying framework goes for the 15 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:44.200
 OK 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.200
 and good as you see here is the exit 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.070
 you can put any fool to a 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.340
 piston or anything that looks and already 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.340
 is 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:06:00.430
 the active from 1 deactivates it from the 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:06:04.050
 another with a piston please looking 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.050
 upwards for example if it can be 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.960
 we deactivate it for example 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.960
 we are going to 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.890
 wind 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.790
 problems that surely from himself 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.290
 we can reactivate and now 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:29.380
 text we can disable as you see 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:29.380
 clues that I do not know why a lamp 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:38.480
 since we activated it, we deactivated and 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:45.389
 we can come back here and here 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:48.810
 well, you have delay for these two 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:52.110
 repeat that we have here and good the 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:54.810
 circuit I think you have it right here 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.970
 clear there under and behind torch bet 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.300
 sideways 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:04.020
 like this would be a door x or with 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:06.320
 exxon with subtraction and normal and this is a 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.320
 door 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:18.150
 if it is very because it is very tiny 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.380
 part has a tip of a one piece 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.780
 of puzzle tetrix 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:26.070
 it really is in the bitch piece that 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.070
 never get to fit well 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:35.150
 and then you know we do not see in this 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.150
 goodbye video
