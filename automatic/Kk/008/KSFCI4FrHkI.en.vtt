00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.680
 the origins of humanity are seen different 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.340
 researchers different times in different 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:26.660
 places and strange as it seems on 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.240
 current view of mankind was derived 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.689
 even wide nose monkeys south america 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.140
 especially distinguished in this famous 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.080
 south american argentine 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:43.280
 paleontologist amiga which in 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:46.040
 nineteenth century studied bones 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.089
 fossil animals south america was 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.369
 really outstanding person 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.620
 wrote a huge number of books and 

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:55.530
 articles described almost 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.050
 most of the southern fossil animals 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.750
 America and the modern way too here 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.470
 but among other things he found the remains 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.880
 ancient widely nose of monkeys and skulls 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.399
 ancient people and omega on lined up 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.670
 such a wonderful line from the ancient 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.649
 animals down to humans 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.760
 locating there really fossils 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:24.500
 finds and freakishly splif them 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:27.440
 with finds of modern people whom he 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.710
 there were neighboring caves and in particular 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.910
 you dina in evolutionary line as 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.760
 now understandable in such a fantastic 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.330
 lines were present for example de pro 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.320
 tom 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.410
 Here is the skull of this very diploma, he described 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.500
 other remains are the same as yet 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.210
 theater volume 3 pro volume and so on 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.480
 what evolutionary line quickly emerged 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.200
 Well, in particular, about the volume, it believed that 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.850
 such a very organic person if 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.770
 look you can see that the chip is pretty 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.680
 did a little orient it when 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.750
 You can by any means and you can 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.250
 draw in such a way that the forehead 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.410
 it turns out incredible while there 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.130
 eyebrows were seemingly strong 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.080
 speakers and skull timur turns 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.770
 very archaic pain the thickness of him too 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.110
 not small however 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.840
 further research significant 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.190
 Some of these South American finds 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.260
 they don't really belong like that 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.120
 so right for primitive people so here it is 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.930
 eg 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.010
 the skull also seemed to have a sloping forehead 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.959
 cattle there a little strange face 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.930
 protruding parts but prilezhat 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:46.540
 business of modern indians who are just 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.010
 had an artificial skull deformity and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.040
 large frontal slope 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.870
 this skull and the characteristic such here 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.239
 Smooth facial stretch 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.250
 forward this is actually a consequence 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.860
 artificial strain which was 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.900
 the widest is common in the south 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.230
 America in many different cultures and 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.400
 practically before the advent of Europeans and 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:13.070
 even after there existed but for 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.410
 some skulls as primitive 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.180
 described for example signs such as 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.430
 weak projection of the chin protrusion 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.690
 but if you look at this lower one 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.730
 jaw that agrees 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.560
 gina ballad about some primitive 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.500
 actually the jaw is very, very 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.690
 advanced tusa on the mountains is small here 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.420
 this jaw is frankly female over all 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.220
 Parameters this that podvarovnogo ledge 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.190
 here the truth is not so big 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.630
 does not change the fact that morphology 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:45.150
 chin projection perfectly 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:46.140
 sapient on me so all this 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.300
 concept 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.000
 origin of man in south america 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.390
 from 40 anos monkeys present 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.710
 is already a history of science 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.450
 despite the fact that occasionally someone and 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:02.600
 trying to reanimate but more often 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.600
 ignorance rather than necessity
