00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello how good are you all 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.910
 Welcome to your home welcome 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.680
 sandro from if I have not confused I'm 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.540
 at the Nokia stand to talk about 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.910
 things related to android because 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.620
 we have come to see the nokia in one a 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.470
 tablet made by Nokia for the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.940
 Finns running stock android 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.860
 specifically in the lollipop version 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.600
 distributed at the moment only in China 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.920
 but let's hope that later a 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.850
 little by the market we are going to see this 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.300
 device that I thought was very 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.300
 interesting 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.340
 we can comment by taking a look 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.960
 to this one in nokia and first thing 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.580
 that we are going to see how it is always a 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.410
 little what we have outside the 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.970
 aspect of this device we know the 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.830
 Finnish firm is a specialist in 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.949
 make good and good designs 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.300
 finished and this seems like it's going a bit 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.580
 the design line of what we are 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.280
 accustomed relevant things we are 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.320
 before a tablet of an average size 79 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.059
 inches of screen and how are you 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.290
 watching pretty well manufactured I can 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.540
 assure me that I am touching it now 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.010
 same that gives me quite good feeling 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.570
 as we see the frames 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.490
 well they are normalitos we are not during 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.320
 one of the tablets with more frames 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.360
 achieved but in general the aspect 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.979
 it's pretty good if we go to the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.540
 lateral we can observe for example 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.909
 here that we have the keypad to go up 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.110
 and lower volume of the device in the 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.630
 lower part we have the classic 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.040
 connector together with the speakers what 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.170
 you are looking here in the bottom 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.360
 and if we go to the other side there 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.650
 we have nothing since we will not have the 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.150
 less in this model have not left me 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.650
 sure there will be other models of 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.869
 future that they will have it but in principle 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.579
 we do not have slot for microsd and in the 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.270
 top we have the button 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.270
 unlocking 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.369
 and check 3 with 5 if we go back 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.369
 we find this good finish 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.509
 true metallic feel very good 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.610
 surely it will also help dispel the 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.890
 device heat and well here you see 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.509
 parco in details there is not much much 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.119
 story here so we see the camera 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.319
 without flash led the truth is that it is something 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.899
 relatively usual when we speak 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.549
 of tablets and if you want to finish 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.140
 I say a little bit the exact dimensions 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.119
 so that you have it in mind 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.470
 since this is a device of 20 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.269
 centimeters high 13 wide and has 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.579
 69 millimeters thick as you are 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.620
 watching a tablet that will like a lot 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:16.450
 a broad to a wide range of users 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.920
 in the hardware section we find 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.380
 which is running with intel processor 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.450
 if intel is the heart of this 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.130
 device specifically we talk about the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.420
 intel atom the zeta 35 80 well said well 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.640
 It sounds a bit weird but we are talking 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.739
 a 2.3 gigahertz processor with 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.900
 64 bit technology we remember how 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.790
 played more than one device that 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.440
 Well bears with processor 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.390
 the firm intel and it seems that little by little 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.370
 they disembark a little more in 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.080
 our system other aspects 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.990
 important we find 2 gigas 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.280
 with ddr3 technology, it is true that 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.740
 last devices that we are seeing 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.870
 they come with ddr4 technology but still 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.000
 we are using ddr3 this time 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.040
 things also relevant we have 32 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.360
 gigabytes of internal storage as os 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.190
 he said in this version you can not 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.650
 expand but good it seems that it is a 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.500
 Important substantial storage 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.530
 also that you know that we have version 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.790
 wifi only wifi in principle at least the 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.920
 that are selling today that 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.720
 It is only sold in China but it is quite 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.580
 likely that in a relatively future 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.620
 close a version with 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.720
 connectivity most likely 4g 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.160
 lte the software as always 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.500
 is one of the most important and here 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.850
 we have good news I think that in 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.040
 general first of all because we have 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.020
 the installed lollipop version 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.790
 directly on the n-1 of nokia and that 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.590
 it's always good news about everything 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.209
 for all those lovers of android 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.800
 but we are seeing that the 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.360
 customization is quite distinct 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.520
 is what we are so accustomed to 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.990
 you are watching we have z launcher this 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.420
 launcher created by the Finnish firm 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.560
 which is the least curious has 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.510
 some things also seem to me 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.800
 interesting and I would like to show you 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.260
 as you can see this is the main screen 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.360
 that is customized with some of the 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.069
 actions that we can execute in a way 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.930
 extremely simple 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.030
 applications do not appear here in a 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.250
 casual but there is an algorithm behind 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.040
 that is configuring it according to the day 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.260
 the time of day that we are on 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.090
 where we are and everything 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.769
 this will change for example at 10 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.540
 in the morning the work we will not have the 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.030
 same applications as at 8 o'clock in the 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.470
 late at home and well that's something that in 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.120
 theory is learning from us and what 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.489
 is configuring other things 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.620
 striking you have seen it we can 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.930
 make some letters directly with 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.669
 our hand and as you are seeing it 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.139
 perform a search in the wake of this 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.910
 letter for example how do we see the letter c 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.590
 and as you see we see the 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.330
 applications that contain this letter c 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.520
 like chrome camera the calculator 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.660
 etcetera et cetera as you are seeing the 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.610
 true a launcher that works very well 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.510
 Very fluid to me gives me very good 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.860
 sensations 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.139
 you also know that we have it in google 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.789
 play and to finish like this a little fast 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.620
 as you can see we can move and here 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.539
 we have all the box- style apps 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.919
 applications trayter in the section more 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.020
 related to multimedia we 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.130
 We found with a screen of 7.9 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.199
 inches we already told you 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.830
 previously, specifically 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.940
 panel technology we found ips 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.810
 backlit let the truth that the 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.980
 first sensations that I am 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.420
 finding here from the screen I have 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.400
 left quite surprised he has very 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.930
 good looking the level of brightness seems 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.550
 pretty high would have to prove it 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.260
 also in other conditions I would like 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.880
 to be able to select a little more 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:14.170
 about this but in general I have good 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.730
 sensations resolution 2048 x 1536 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.380
 We have a very good resolution for 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.660
 screen size that counts this 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.130
 device and this is good very good 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.810
 news for all those who love 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.670
 these devices that we know that 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.560
 We take time with resolution is a 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.870
 little bit more precarious besides for the 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.280
 big hands like me have gorilla glass 3 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.560
 the third version of the monkey for the 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.240
 maximum protection in terms of scratches or 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.980
 any kind of hit then good 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.350
 you can be a little calmer as 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.340
 with this important also the format 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.020
 you know that not all the tablets in the 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.840
 same format we have a tablet in 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.550
 four thirds possibly my format 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.650
 favorite I think it's pretty close on 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.450
 everything to consume multimedia content 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.610
 I believe that it is one of the most 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.200
 adequate and in general as good as 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.490
 you see works pretty well in the 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.870
 section of the audio as we said 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.490
 previously we have the speakers in 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.380
 the bottom a pretty good 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.910
 location we like quite a lot that they are 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.880
 below we would obviously prefer that 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.660
 were in the part 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.860
 but it's not the case we have two speakers 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.320
 stereo that is something also pretty 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.760
 important that good when we can 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.050
 try the device because we will be a 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.730
 little more about 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.200
 this and already to finish the 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.300
 multimedia aspects we are going to spend a 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.160
 little to the camera you know that it is not 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.230
 most relevant in a device like in 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.780
 a tablet but we have a camera of 8 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.520
 megapixels in the back and of 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.070
 five megapixels in the missing part 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.750
 I come back up to here station the Nokia n 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.340
 1 a device that has left me 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.020
 great feelings because first 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.730
 because it is very well manufactured has a 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.230
 hardware that at least the first 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.660
 feeling has been that it is very good with 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.460
 the intel processor running is touching 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.410
 of lollipop introversion and we look forward to 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.420
 have more information about 4g versions 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.100
 and about also the distribution in 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.220
 different countries see you soon up 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.220
 then
