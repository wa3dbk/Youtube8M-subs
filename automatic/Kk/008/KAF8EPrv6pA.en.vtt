but<00:01:07.840> I'm<00:01:07.960> going<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.140> use<00:01:08.290> this<00:01:08.860> um<00:01:09.040> paper<00:01:09.750> this

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
but I'm going to use this um paper this

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.720 
but I'm going to use this um paper this
pellets<00:01:11.200> are<00:01:11.350> pretty<00:01:11.560> amazing<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:12.340> they<00:01:12.460> burn

pellets are pretty amazing and they burn

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.820 
pellets are pretty amazing and they burn
great<00:01:13.120> so<00:01:14.040> we're<00:01:15.040> gonna<00:01:15.130> try<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:15.550> out<00:01:15.580> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
great so we're gonna try that out and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.430 
great so we're gonna try that out and
I'm<00:01:17.830> also<00:01:18.010> gonna<00:01:18.250> time<00:01:18.640> it<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.659> I'm<00:01:20.050> gonna<00:01:20.170> try

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
I'm also gonna time it and I'm gonna try

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.110 
I'm also gonna time it and I'm gonna try
to<00:01:20.470> boil<00:01:20.800> 1<00:01:21.130> quart<00:01:21.430> of<00:01:21.490> water<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:21.940> see<00:01:22.090> how

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
to boil 1 quart of water and see how

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.060 
to boil 1 quart of water and see how
long<00:01:22.420> that<00:01:22.479> takes

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
long that takes

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.010 
long that takes
so<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:26.740> will<00:01:27.010> see<00:01:27.729> how<00:01:27.760> things<00:01:28.060> go<00:01:28.240> I'll<00:01:28.720> come

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
so we will see how things go I'll come

and<00:02:28.569> we'll<00:02:29.110> see<00:02:29.319> about<00:02:29.739> how<00:02:29.890> long<00:02:30.069> it<00:02:30.190> takes<00:02:30.400> to

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
and we'll see about how long it takes to

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.290 
and we'll see about how long it takes to
get<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:31.180> 1<00:02:32.170> quart<00:02:32.410> of<00:02:32.530> water<00:02:32.769> boiling<00:02:33.190> on<00:02:33.970> this

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
get a 1 quart of water boiling on this

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.350 
get a 1 quart of water boiling on this
guy<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:35.290> fire<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:35.709> already<00:02:36.030> amazingly<00:02:37.030> good

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
and I don't think it's gonna take too

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.840 
and I don't think it's gonna take too
long<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.630> cook<00:02:41.350> this<00:02:41.590> water<00:02:41.860> but<00:02:42.130> I<00:02:42.160> just<00:02:42.670> put

bird<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.080> good<00:03:00.260> I<00:03:00.290> may<00:03:00.500> turn<00:03:00.710> it<00:03:00.770> down<00:03:00.890> whoa

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.530 

there<00:03:04.010> we<00:03:04.130> go<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.280> turned<00:03:04.640> it<00:03:04.700> down<00:03:04.730> too<00:03:04.970> low<00:03:05.180> and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
there we go I turned it down too low and

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.930 
there we go I turned it down too low and
that<00:03:05.600> looks<00:03:06.470> like<00:03:06.620> it's<00:03:06.860> uh<00:03:06.950> not<00:03:07.460> quite<00:03:07.700> as

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
that looks like it's uh not quite as

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.230 
that looks like it's uh not quite as
intense<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:11.110> we'll<00:03:12.110> see<00:03:12.290> how<00:03:12.410> that<00:03:12.500> goes

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
intense so we'll see how that goes

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
intense so we'll see how that goes
it<00:03:14.240> looks<00:03:14.420> like<00:03:14.540> it's<00:03:14.720> getting<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:15.020> good<00:03:15.050> supply

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
it looks like it's getting a good supply

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.920 
it looks like it's getting a good supply
of<00:03:15.680> air<00:03:15.890> even<00:03:16.160> on<00:03:16.340> number<00:03:16.670> one<00:03:16.940> so<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:19.690> used<00:03:20.690> to

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
of air even on number one so I used to

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.150 
of air even on number one so I used to
to<00:03:21.080> get<00:03:21.230> it<00:03:21.350> started<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:21.920> one<00:03:22.960> to<00:03:24.160> maintain

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.070 
will see the breeziness is gonna affect
that<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.290> total<00:04:06.770> time<00:04:06.980> I'm<00:04:07.280> sure<00:04:07.570> but<00:04:08.570> this<00:04:09.020> is

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
that the total time I'm sure but this is

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.770 
that the total time I'm sure but this is
without<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:10.150> windshield<00:04:11.150> so<00:04:12.070> it's<00:04:13.070> just<00:04:13.310> uh<00:04:13.780> the

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
without a windshield so it's just uh the

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.810 
without a windshield so it's just uh the
cooker<00:04:15.140> itself<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:16.340> you<00:04:16.430> can<00:04:16.549> see<00:04:16.670> it's

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
cooker itself and you can see it's

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.449 
cooker itself and you can see it's
blowing<00:04:17.060> around<00:04:17.180> kind<00:04:17.600> of<00:04:17.660> good<00:04:17.950> so<00:04:18.950> it's<00:04:19.280> not

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
blowing around kind of good so it's not

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.400 
blowing around kind of good so it's not
very<00:04:19.730> smoky<00:04:20.150> unless<00:04:20.420> until<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:20.930> wind<00:04:21.109> starts

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
very smoky unless until the wind starts

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.630 
very smoky unless until the wind starts
blowing<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.799> then<00:04:21.890> you<00:04:21.980> get<00:04:22.130> a<00:04:22.160> little<00:04:22.460> tiny

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
blowing and then you get a little tiny

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.620 
blowing and then you get a little tiny
bit<00:04:22.880> of<00:04:22.910> smoke<00:04:23.270> as<00:04:23.450> you<00:04:23.570> might<00:04:23.750> be<00:04:23.870> able<00:04:23.990> to<00:04:24.110> see

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.740 

it's<00:04:28.630> an<00:04:28.780> involuntary<00:04:29.139> zoom<00:04:30.039> in<00:04:30.220> there<00:04:30.400> sorry

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
it's an involuntary zoom in there sorry

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.980 
it's an involuntary zoom in there sorry
so<00:04:31.750> we<00:04:32.650> will<00:04:32.949> keep<00:04:33.820> checking<00:04:33.880> all<00:04:34.750> right<00:04:36.990> well

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
so we will keep checking all right well

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.240 
so we will keep checking all right well
in<00:04:38.259> 9<00:04:38.440> minutes<00:04:38.680> 30<00:04:38.919> seconds<00:04:39.580> my<00:04:40.590> my<00:04:41.590> half<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:41.979> cup

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
in 9 minutes 30 seconds my my half a cup

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
in 9 minutes 30 seconds my my half a cup
of<00:04:43.949> wood<00:04:44.949> pellets<00:04:45.130> just<00:04:45.610> about<00:04:45.789> ready<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.060> give

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
of wood pellets just about ready to give

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.760 
of wood pellets just about ready to give
up<00:04:47.100> however<00:04:49.020> as<00:04:50.020> you<00:04:50.650> can<00:04:50.680> see<00:04:51.039> we<00:04:51.759> have<00:04:51.970> a<00:04:52.000> boil

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
up however as you can see we have a boil

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.529 
up however as you can see we have a boil
so<00:04:53.770> apparently<00:04:54.220> half<00:04:54.400> a<00:04:54.550> cup<00:04:54.759> was<00:04:54.910> exactly

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
so apparently half a cup was exactly

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.620 
so apparently half a cup was exactly
right<00:04:55.870> not<00:04:56.530> I<00:04:56.560> guessed<00:04:57.250> correctly<00:04:57.729> and<00:04:58.449> look

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
right not I guessed correctly and look

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.520 
right not I guessed correctly and look
at<00:04:58.720> that<00:04:58.840> we're<00:04:59.530> just<00:04:59.710> down<00:04:59.860> to<00:05:00.009> coals<00:05:00.690> so<00:05:01.690> not

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530
