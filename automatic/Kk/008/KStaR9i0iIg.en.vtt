00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
duel runner in the keyless see for the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.819 
duel runner in the keyless see for the
first<00:00:38.340> time<00:00:39.290> basically<00:00:40.290> grab<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.649> ball<00:00:40.770> and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
first time basically grab the ball and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.530 
first time basically grab the ball and
run<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> goal<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.120> kind<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.360> like

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
run to the goal so it's kind of like

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.279 
run to the goal so it's kind of like
keep<00:00:43.200> away<00:00:43.469> or<00:00:43.620> catch<00:00:43.860> too<00:00:44.070> shiny<00:00:44.719> but<00:00:45.719> also<00:00:45.960> we

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
keep away or catch too shiny but also we

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.619 
keep away or catch too shiny but also we
start<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.860> stamina<00:00:47.670> running<00:00:47.969> mechanics<00:00:48.090> in

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
start the stamina running mechanics in

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.959 
start the stamina running mechanics in
that<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> faster<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:49.710> run<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.399> less<00:00:50.579> energy

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
that the faster they run the less energy

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.110 
that the faster they run the less energy
you<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.469> got<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.680> keep<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.920> pace<00:00:53.129> but

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
you have so you got to keep a pace but

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.580 
you have so you got to keep a pace but
strategies<00:00:54.629> first<00:00:54.870> grab<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> balls<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.530> this

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
strategies first grab the balls in this

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.170 
strategies first grab the balls in this
puzzle<00:00:57.109> and<00:00:58.160> now<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.730> just<00:00:59.879> keep<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.149> steady

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
puzzle and now we just keep a steady

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.139 
puzzle and now we just keep a steady
pace<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.859> bad<00:01:02.010> guy<00:01:02.160> comes<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:02.670> weave<00:01:02.879> back

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
pace if the bad guy comes we weave back

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.020 
pace if the bad guy comes we weave back
and<00:01:03.180> forth<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.350> Top<00:01:04.710> Gun<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.610> then

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
and forth like in Top Gun and then

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.920 
and forth like in Top Gun and then
Nintendo<00:01:06.270> Tucker<00:01:06.840> ah<00:01:08.180> if<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.360> must<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.750> hit

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
Nintendo Tucker ah if you must get hit

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.630 
Nintendo Tucker ah if you must get hit
hit<00:01:10.260> hit<00:01:10.470> from<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> behind<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.400> might

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
hit hit from the behind so you might

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.010 
hit hit from the behind so you might
have<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> chance<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.119> get<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> ball<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.869> then

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
have a chance to get the ball and then

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.230 
have a chance to get the ball and then
see<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.380> get<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.590> back

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
see if you can get it back

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.499 
see if you can get it back
oh<00:01:15.860> shoot<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.579> a<00:01:17.610> bad<00:01:17.820> take<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.329> I'm

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
can actually get 301 z93 under 3,000 and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.139 
can actually get 301 z93 under 3,000 and
yeah<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.679> definitely<00:01:44.009> or<00:01:46.819> okay<00:01:47.819> study

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
yeah this is a definitely or okay study

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.580 
yeah this is a definitely or okay study
phase<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.600> keep<00:01:48.780> my<00:01:48.959> energy<00:01:49.200> up<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.810> I'm<00:01:52.530> gonna

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
phase to keep my energy up and I'm gonna

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.870 
phase to keep my energy up and I'm gonna
barely<00:01:52.860> qualifies<00:01:54.350> yeah<00:01:55.350> my<00:01:56.220> energy<00:01:56.520> goes<00:01:56.700> to

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
barely qualifies yeah my energy goes to

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.870 
barely qualifies yeah my energy goes to
zero<00:01:57.179> then<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.509> come<00:01:57.959> to<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.140> complete<00:01:58.350> stop<00:02:01.880> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
zero then I come to a complete stop and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.919 
zero then I come to a complete stop and
I<00:02:03.090> will<00:02:04.729> not<00:02:05.729> pitiful<00:02:06.270> see<00:02:08.450> retry<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:09.810> I

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
I will not pitiful see retry because I

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.120 
I will not pitiful see retry because I
have<00:02:10.049> no<00:02:10.170> choice<00:02:12.620> generally<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> good<00:02:13.709> steady

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
have no choice generally a good steady

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.339 
have no choice generally a good steady
