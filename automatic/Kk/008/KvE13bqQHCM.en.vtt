00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.670
 when sports journalists leave 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.760
 of the study sometimes you have to deal with 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.940
 fans too passionate as you 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.210
 went to rivas in the last classic of 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.710
 step of agreement and eduardo eduardo up 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.100
 I was talking about eduardo upstairs 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.780
 air is for people to understand the 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.310
 risks that has been added in this 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.310
 noble profession around what 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.779
 meant this national victory by 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.300
 two goals to one of the final moments 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:38.160
 of commitment to this party that will 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.390
 allows the national team to take out already 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.610
 14 points of advantage over the set 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.520
 of peñarol and that in this way also 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.309
 allows you to tell the tricolor set 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.559
 to give precisely what it represents 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.989
 a way which means less want 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:57.140
 the activity obviously of a national 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:59.390
 that has the chance in definitive of 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.760
 to me 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.570
 and let's go a little central studies and 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.570
 I am with you 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.640
 but the environment was complicated there 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.740
 in the difficult centennial stadium for 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.159
 work in those conditions but 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.159
 still 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:28.240
 the subject is an insult of you 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.240
 pimp what 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.010
 is installed behind the camera that 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.010
 I was working 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.880
 eduardo said the study 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.560
 to be something 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.060
 we go a little central studies and now 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.060
 I am with you 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.179
 at the level that remembered the rubber but 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:02:01.619
 I understand that nothing damn happened 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:04.140
 custom so guilty beyond that every 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.420
 one has his favorite team when 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.509
 the selection plays journalists 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.310
 they put the sky blue and row it like the one 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.310
 more there is a big problem 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.850
 hitting the good journalists 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.150
 tips that you have to for the game 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.150
 the switch 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.000
 of the word 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.840
 do not touch my hand 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.769
 today 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.769
 it was given to me and tell me 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.070
 I 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.280
 although we envy that they have access to 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.920
 places that others can not we are the 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.319
 white of the teasing that the court comes out 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.769
 and stay out of the stadium with 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.250
 rails is placed the 7 is roughly it 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.990
 will hurt 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.710
 now they do not do shows before 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:30.920
 centenary 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:34.100
 but to be told that we 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.350
 we want it to always be placed more or 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.660
 less is going to hurt you now do not 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.490
 shows before the centennial despite 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.490
 of his close relationship with the technicians 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.460
 these can also be quite 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.880
 hostile to journalists or something that 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.880
 you do not like me 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.320
 all 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.800
 when we ask you 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.030
 what happened to the referees 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.030
 and something that you did not like 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.790
 quiet 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.359
 those cited 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:30.599
 a difficult team back in his redoubt 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.599
 It has never been easy and after class 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:36.819
 Uruguay and after 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:44.530
 you know, you say they will ask me 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.530
 I ask Spanish or not for the habit 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:54.129
 but you're loading me and because I just 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.319
 say I was leaving without talking about the referee 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:05:02.159
 because you ask me that because I want 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:02.159
 know if the million dollar question 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.300
 1 point 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.920
 me too and well I also the 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.920
 beheading asked and a thick 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.740
 Of course it can sometimes be that 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.620
 communicators skate and the 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.620
 protagonists leave them lying 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:37.400
 result of ones that are not usually 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.740
 aggressive but that make it difficult 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:45.580
 the work is the fans that come to 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.580
 the court in search of the cup of one more 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.580
 he is a fan characterized 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.370
 you see raul who makes many gestures 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.640
 back after doing any 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:09.080
 comment but he told me fabián canobbio 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:12.949
 he put me with permission but hard 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.949
 I have no return 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:18.509
 martín what exists so you 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:21.479
 You gave a bit of notoriety is 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:23.309
 seeing people here in the locker room and 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.870
 sent him such good now if 

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:28.840
 you are looking inward 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.790
 they are not telling us they are happy 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.680
 a figure that today we ask you to 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.870
 keep on the sidelines but in the end do not 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:39.240
 he could with his genius 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.240
 what I want 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:46.189
 and make two goals to Argentina 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:47.989
 you can not stop people from sucking 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:50.649
 today the man failed me and I would not have 

00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:50.649
 needed that we talked 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:07:01.070
 I know there are people up there 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.070
 the popping for all my people the tile 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:12.440
 it's like that and then people and you too 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.440

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:37.069

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:42.349
 when you sing they are peeling the sizes 

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:46.300
 bazan watching the chacha all the world and 

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:46.300
