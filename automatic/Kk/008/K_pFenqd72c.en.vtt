 hello you love in this video daily 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.899
 times three recipes for super delicious 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.760
 Salads with pasta are also very good for 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.349
 You can or just prepare a barbecue 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.360
 so it can eat delicious fresh 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.460
 meal so i would say let's go 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.570
 okay we start with the first salad 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.580
 and so on 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.890
 Italian style made with farfalle 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.660
 For this you need my first decay 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.430
 Bio are now totally pop all out 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.140
 the buying country and then you still need 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.869
 some fresh ingredients like eg 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.849
 leek onions champignons two to three 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.650
 tomatoes then I have small ones 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.020
 mozzarella balls added to it and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.850
 season sunflower seeds or for that 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.129
 dressing from the salad do we need 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.329
 still some olive oil basil herbs 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.309
 pepper and salt 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.660
 Let's get the noodles and the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.280
 We drain when they are al dente 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.110
 are and therefore the noodles easy 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.270
 Cool a bit faster because of us 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.500
 want salad to eat cold so they find 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.649
 also just a little bit cold 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.699
 pour water over it 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.829
 Of course you have to do that too 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.020
 prepare the remaining ingredients so the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.030
 mushrooms in slices cut the tomatoes 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.989
 dice and also the leek onions 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.989
 cut a bit small 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.790
 can you then put a little oil in the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.740
 Heat the pan and then just the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.360
 fry mushrooms I have the mushrooms then 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.440
 also seasoned with salt 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.520
 and pepper them just one 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.520
 have better taste 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.020
 and then that's all 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.790
 already together in a bowl the 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.980
 cooled down because the 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.240
 Add the onions and add the tomatoes 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.740
 I'll just have that whole thing 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.140
 ever give birth a bit 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.480
 I then shoot olive oil neatly 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.190
 salt and pepper and then I have too 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.690
 a few more basil herbs 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.860
 but of course you can 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.860
 take fresh basil 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.149
 and then I give that too 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.729
 remaining ingredients so a few 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.869
 sunflower seeds then the mushrooms and 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.979
 Finally, a few of 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.979
 this mini mozzarella 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.759
 yes and that's how it all looks 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.829
 and I say it really is you 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.969
 really really delicious then you have to 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.979
 example , too, a piece towards 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:15.459
 meat from the grill and oh my god 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:17.080
 creators like to linger on it 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.430
 second pasta salad and so on 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.349
 bit made in the Greek way 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.970
 Here are the ingredients so you need 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.349
 rice noodles on every passage 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.630
 Greek art as it is for 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.760
 example in the buying country then comes 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.319
 still chicken breast so just write 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.730
 I know those of teens recommend the 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.680
 I really like it 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.410
 still my dream for a bit 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.819
 fruity taste corn and peas there 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.019
 I think the glass actually 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.519
 yummy you can too 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.920
 take frozen peas if you can 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.930
 I like love and as a dressing I use 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.579
 then just mix this knorr salad 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.560
 the also extra Greek style 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.930
 It is then simply needed 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.310
 only olive oil and water we 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.260
 start again with it for the water 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.640
 noodles to put on the water since 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.709
 then a little and then 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.480
 just cook the noodles in it until they are 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.370
 finished and then pour the noodles 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.079
 and again something with cold water 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.120
 pour it over faster 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.859
 cooling down 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.900
 then we prepare the other ingredients 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.970
 pour that mainz water off and that too 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.200
 water in the glass of the peas and then 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.859
 I also wash the grapes off 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.359
 then I cut the 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.829
 turkey slices a little 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.180
 you should not eat it meat 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.950
 then you can eat this step 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.840
 of course, you just tilt 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.840
 You do not have to do any meat in it 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.650
 and then everything comes together again 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.170
 a bowl so the cooled 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.600
 Greek pasta the pea of corn 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.070
 the chicken pieces and then too 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.310
 I still have the grapes 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.310
 halved 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.180
 Rossing for the salad is also complete 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.739
 done quickly then you just give 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.019
 mix these herbs according to Greek 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.939
 Art in a cup and then goes loud 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.250
 Pack just three tablespoons of oil 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.200
 then and three tablespoons of water then 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.939
 mix everything together well and then 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.939
 Just give it over your salad 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.970
 Mix everything well and then 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.860
 is your fruity savory salad too 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.780
 already done and for example too 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:19.889
 still quite good feta cheese to it falls 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:21.840
 the courage and last but not least mine 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.010
 absolute favorite is this here and now 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.139
 It's a salad after all 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.580
 Thai style with glass noodles and 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.229
 Shrimp and people I tell you that 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.050
 will change your life he is like that 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.880
 yummy you need glass noodles for it 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.889
 bit of green salad fits best 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.900
 actually iceberg lettuce or something 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.789
 is also so good is a salad mixed so 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.740
 a finished one as I have him here now 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.570
 There are already different types of salad 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.070
 founding mixed and for example too 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.199
 a few carrots which are also very 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.820
 Well to the salad fit then too 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.500
 Prawn or kink browns like me 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.110
 now have here and fresh ingredients 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.229
 then paprika and a onion 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.400
 fresh coriander for seasoning for 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.100
 salad do you need in any case 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.979
 Soy sauce for a bit vegetable broth 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.060
 pepper chili seasoning garlic there you can 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.070
 Of course you also fresh again 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.889
 take and a few grains of sand the 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.300
 you can find it for example in dm this time 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.889
 Let's not start with the noodles because 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.660
 the glass noodles usually only three 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.190
 minutes in hot water 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.349
 therefore we have to cut now 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.240
 first our vegetables so the paprika in 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.370
 Cut the cube and the coriander small 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.940
 chop and then the onions nice too 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.940
 chop small 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.150
 then you can already in your bowl 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.430
 Add the salad mix and the coriander 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.810
 and the peppers to the onions 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.300
 but not yet because 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.979
 fry the trees then it works 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.210
 even to the glazes and there looks 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.010
 her best back again also the 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.669
 packaging the euro now prepared 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.169
 should be 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.510
 my come now for a few 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.160
 minutes in lightly boiling water then 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.720
 you pour these off again when they are there 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.820
 are and only with one 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.169
 Drain a little cold water because of the 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.949
 should still be a bit lukewarm 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.050
 stay 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.720
 Traditionally , this salad is one 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.909
 will also take lukewarm noodles then 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.740
 directly with a little salt and also 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.300
 with the shot soy sauce and then the 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.289
 Cover it with it again 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.289
 become sensuality 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.780
 then the last big step is 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.760
 actually only the shrimp 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.540
 Just sauté with a bit of oil 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.400
 the pan 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.199
 if the first time so three minutes 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.449
 I fried then I enter there 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.310
 a little salt and pepper to it and with it 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.530
 because such a sud arises what actually 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.210
 also our dressing for the salad is 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:29.830
 I give a quarter glass 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:31.750
 then add the broth 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.669
 on we can also onions 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.139
 Fry a bit with and to 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:37.690
 Finally comes a decent 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:39.100
 shot soy sauce to that then everything 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.750
 sizzle a bit more 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.200
 let the prawns really do too 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.200
 even are 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.910
 then also give me vegetable noodles from the 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.040
 pot to it and also the shrimp and the 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.020
 onions from the pan and there you see 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.300
 that the liquid from vegetable broth and 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.520
 soy sauce that is our dressing 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.229
 for the entire salad is at the end 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.479
 sesame cologne have to give it and 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:03.190
 finished is the lukewarm thai sala the 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:04.600
