00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
Sanwa compatible case so if you had jLF

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.820 
Sanwa compatible case so if you had jLF
in<00:00:27.359> there<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.660> begin<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.230> can<00:00:28.289> swap<00:00:28.619> this

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
in there to begin with you can swap this

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.540 
in there to begin with you can swap this
stick<00:00:29.099> into<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.840> pretty<00:00:30.840> easily<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.550> you'll

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
stick into that pretty easily so you'll

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.370 
stick into that pretty easily so you'll
notice<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.239> bottom<00:00:33.360> here<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.290> little

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
notice on the bottom here it's a little

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.870 
notice on the bottom here it's a little
bit<00:00:34.530> different<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.190> switches<00:00:35.670> are<00:00:35.790> all

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
bit different the switches are all

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.990 
bit different the switches are all
exposed<00:00:36.270> there's<00:00:36.719> no<00:00:37.309> PCB<00:00:38.309> with<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> little<00:00:38.790> 5

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
exposed there's no PCB with a little 5

pin connector that makes it easy to
connect<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.910> your<00:00:42.300> joystick<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:42.930> if<00:00:43.770> you

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
connect up to your joystick but if you

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.350 
connect up to your joystick but if you
buy<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.100> stick<00:00:44.489> through<00:00:44.760> focus<00:00:45.090> at<00:00:45.210> Jack

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
buy this stick through focus at Jack

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.049 
buy this stick through focus at Jack
comm<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.960> also<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> option<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.399> getting

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
comm you also have the option of getting

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.600 
comm you also have the option of getting
this<00:00:48.390> harness<00:00:48.629> included<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.460> see

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
this harness included and you can see

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.580 
this harness included and you can see
here<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.940> comes<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.390> male<00:00:52.050> 5<00:00:52.350> pin

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
here it comes with a male 5 pin

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.630 
here it comes with a male 5 pin
connector<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.190> we're<00:00:53.309> essentially

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
connector so we're essentially

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.220 
connector so we're essentially
recreating<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.420> PCB<00:00:55.129> with<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.309> harness

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
recreating that PCB with this harness

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.569 
recreating that PCB with this harness
okay<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.410> most<00:00:58.620> mods<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.039> one<00:00:59.219> starts<00:00:59.489> with

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
okay like most mods this one starts with

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:08.630 
okay like most mods this one starts with
taking<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> top<00:01:00.420> panel<00:01:00.600> off<00:01:07.369> okay<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.430> you'll

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
taking the top panel off okay so you'll

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.980 
taking the top panel off okay so you'll
notice<00:01:08.790> my<00:01:09.000> buttons<00:01:09.299> aren't<00:01:09.479> connected<00:01:09.900> up

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
notice my buttons aren't connected up

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.109 
notice my buttons aren't connected up
just<00:01:10.200> ignore<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
just ignore that but I do have the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.750 
just ignore that but I do have the
joystick<00:01:12.510> connected<00:01:12.930> right<00:01:13.110> here<00:01:13.490> all<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.610> do

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
joystick connected right here all you do

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.030 
joystick connected right here all you do
is<00:01:15.000> obviously<00:01:15.780> pull<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.320> off<00:01:16.439> if<00:01:16.619> there's<00:01:16.799> glue

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
is obviously pull it off if there's glue

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.560 
is obviously pull it off if there's glue
on<00:01:17.189> there<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.520> want<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.790> maybe<00:01:17.939> use<00:01:18.150> an<00:01:18.270> exacto

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
on there you want to maybe use an exacto

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.870 
on there you want to maybe use an exacto
to<00:01:18.810> cut<00:01:19.049> between<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.549> but<00:01:20.549> what<00:01:20.670> I've<00:01:20.759> done

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
to cut between it but what I've done

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.550 
to cut between it but what I've done
here<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.240> very<00:01:21.540> front<00:01:21.869> pin<00:01:22.080> towards<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
here this very front pin towards the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.850 
here this very front pin towards the
front<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.070> case<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:24.290> I've<00:01:25.290> marked<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
front of the case here I've marked that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.740 
front of the case here I've marked that
with<00:01:27.140> a<00:01:28.140> black<00:01:28.770> sharpie<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.509> know<00:01:30.659> that

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
with a black sharpie so I know that

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.630 
with a black sharpie so I know that
that's<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.229> ground<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.220> way<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.460> was

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
that's the ground so the way this was

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.399 
that's the ground so the way this was
connected<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.329> very<00:01:33.600> far<00:01:33.869> pin<00:01:34.110> from<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
connected up this very far pin from the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.710 
connected up this very far pin from the
camera<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.549> ground<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.060> that's<00:01:36.240> important

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
camera is the ground so that's important

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.240 
camera is the ground so that's important
just<00:01:36.950> move<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.070> out<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.400> way<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> way

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
just move this out of the way so the way

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.310 
just move this out of the way so the way
that<00:01:41.280> jLF<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.240> there<00:01:42.420> was<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.079> plate

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
that jLF was in there was with the plate

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.160 
that jLF was in there was with the plate
going<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.159> way<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:45.180> what<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.360> want<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:45.899> is

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
going this way so what I want to do is

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.510 
going this way so what I want to do is
set<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.740> my<00:01:46.920> harness<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.520> connector

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
set up my harness so that this connector

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.179 
set up my harness so that this connector
comes<00:01:50.759> out<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.060> side<00:01:51.680> now<00:01:52.680> if<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.829> follow<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
comes out this side now if I follow the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.370 
comes out this side now if I follow the
pin<00:01:53.369> out<00:01:53.490> here<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> joystick<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:55.140> goes

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
pin out here for the joystick it goes

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.709 
pin out here for the joystick it goes
down<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:56.009> left<00:01:56.340> right<00:01:56.490> ground<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> know

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
down up left right ground so I know

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.800 
down up left right ground so I know
looking<00:01:58.229> at<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.950> would<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.310> ground<00:01:59.820> right

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
looking at this it would be ground right

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.639 
looking at this it would be ground right
left<00:02:01.259> up<00:02:01.500> down<00:02:01.549> so<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.149> harness<00:02:03.649> this

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
left up down so on this harness this

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.950 
left up down so on this harness this
bottom<00:02:04.979> black<00:02:05.159> wire<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.579> ground<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.390> these<00:02:06.630> are

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
bottom black wire is ground so these are

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.920 
bottom black wire is ground so these are
going<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.140> end<00:02:07.229> up<00:02:07.380> going<00:02:07.619> together<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:08.129> this

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.750 

now<00:02:13.930> when<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.200> comes<00:02:14.319> to<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.620> joystick<00:02:15.129> when<00:02:15.730> I

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
now when it comes to the joystick when I

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.479 
now when it comes to the joystick when I
press<00:02:16.060> up<00:02:16.980> it's<00:02:17.980> actually<00:02:18.550> pushing<00:02:18.970> on<00:02:19.180> this

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
press up it's actually pushing on this

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.040 
press up it's actually pushing on this
switch<00:02:21.489> right<00:02:21.519> here<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:22.300> this<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.810> switch

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
switch right here so this is the switch

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.220 
switch right here so this is the switch
that<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.290> need<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.590> connect<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.069> up<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.810> up<00:02:26.110> on

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
that I need to connect to up so up on

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.839 
that I need to connect to up so up on
this<00:02:26.410> harness<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.860> going<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.130> be<00:02:27.340> this<00:02:27.489> orange

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
this harness is going to be this orange

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.120 
this harness is going to be this orange
connector<00:02:28.380> okay<00:02:29.380> these<00:02:29.530> switches<00:02:29.920> aren't

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
connector okay these switches aren't

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.009 
connector okay these switches aren't
labeled<00:02:30.310> but<00:02:30.730> on<00:02:30.910> normal<00:02:31.660> like

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
labeled but on normal like

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.259

american-style<00:02:32.890> cherry<00:02:33.340> switches<00:02:33.790> this<00:02:33.970> top

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
american-style cherry switches this top

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.960 
american-style cherry switches this top
guy<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:35.319> comes<00:02:35.560> out<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:35.950> always<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.670> ground

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
guy that comes out is always the ground

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.750 
guy that comes out is always the ground
and<00:02:37.299> this<00:02:37.780> one<00:02:38.019> is<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.290> signal<00:02:38.709> so<00:02:39.459> I'm<00:02:39.580> going

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
and this one is the signal so I'm going

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:48.270 
and this one is the signal so I'm going
to<00:02:39.819> connect<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.269> up<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.540> way<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.950> orange

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
to connect it up that way so the orange

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.660 
to connect it up that way so the orange
wire<00:02:48.489> is<00:02:48.989> on<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.440> signal<00:02:50.920> part<00:02:51.069> and<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.459> black

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
wire is on the signal part and the black

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.360 
wire is on the signal part and the black
wire<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:52.209> on<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.569> ground<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.349> down<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.250> this

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
wire is on the ground so down in this

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.280 
wire is on the ground so down in this
case<00:02:54.610> is<00:02:54.849> going<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.090> be<00:02:55.180> this<00:02:55.450> switch<00:02:55.690> up<00:02:55.900> here

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
case is going to be this switch up here

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:06.780 
case is going to be this switch up here
which<00:02:56.500> is<00:02:56.680> red

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.210 

when<00:03:07.330> I<00:03:07.360> push<00:03:07.629> to<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.870> left<00:03:08.170> it's<00:03:08.980> hitting

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
when I push to the left it's hitting

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.850 
when I push to the left it's hitting
this<00:03:09.670> switch<00:03:09.939> right<00:03:09.970> here<00:03:10.870> so<00:03:11.290> this<00:03:11.500> one<00:03:11.709> is

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
this switch right here so this one is

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.949 
this switch right here so this one is
yellow<00:03:12.340> which<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:13.030> good<00:03:13.390> because<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.780> lines

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
yellow which is good because that lines

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.679 
yellow which is good because that lines
up<00:03:14.140> with<00:03:14.200> what<00:03:14.470> we're<00:03:14.590> doing<00:03:14.620> here<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:19.120> by

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:19.689 
up with what we're doing here and by

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:21.420 
up with what we're doing here and by
process<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:20.200> elimination<00:03:20.290> then<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.250> green

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
process of elimination then the green

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:32.039 
process of elimination then the green
one<00:03:21.610> goes<00:03:21.819> on<00:03:21.849> the<00:03:22.920> bottom<00:03:23.920> left<00:03:24.159> one<00:03:24.370> here<00:03:31.049> so

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
one goes on the bottom left one here so

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.720 
one goes on the bottom left one here so
just<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.409> double-check<00:03:32.680> if<00:03:32.980> we<00:03:33.099> watch<00:03:33.310> here

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
just to double-check if we watch here

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.649 
just to double-check if we watch here
ground<00:03:34.720> is<00:03:35.049> black<00:03:35.430> right<00:03:36.430> is<00:03:36.640> green<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.239> if<00:03:37.540> I

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
ground is black right is green and if I

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.059 
ground is black right is green and if I
move<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.200> right<00:03:38.319> it's<00:03:38.709> hitting<00:03:38.950> the

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
move this to the right it's hitting the

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.369 
move this to the right it's hitting the
switch<00:03:39.310> here<00:03:39.519> which<00:03:39.549> is<00:03:39.879> green<00:03:40.120> if<00:03:40.930> I<00:03:41.109> move

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
switch here which is green if I move

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.349 
switch here which is green if I move
this<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.129> left<00:03:42.519> it's<00:03:42.790> hitting<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.060> switch

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
this to the left it's hitting the switch

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.660 
this to the left it's hitting the switch
up<00:03:43.510> here<00:03:43.720> which<00:03:43.900> is<00:03:43.930> yellow<00:03:44.500> that's<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.489> very

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
up here which is yellow that's the very

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.629 
up here which is yellow that's the very
next<00:03:45.849> one<00:03:46.090> then<00:03:47.049> orange<00:03:47.739> is<00:03:47.920> up<00:03:48.099> so<00:03:48.459> when<00:03:48.609> I

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
next one then orange is up so when I

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.729 
next one then orange is up so when I
push<00:03:48.849> up<00:03:49.030> I'm<00:03:49.359> hitting<00:03:49.900> down<00:03:50.079> here<00:03:50.349> which<00:03:50.560> is

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
push up I'm hitting down here which is

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.099 
push up I'm hitting down here which is
orange<00:03:51.040> if<00:03:51.940> I<00:03:52.090> push<00:03:52.299> down<00:03:52.329> I'm<00:03:52.750> hitting<00:03:52.989> up

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
orange if I push down I'm hitting up

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.410 
orange if I push down I'm hitting up
here<00:03:53.349> which<00:03:53.530> is<00:03:53.680> red<00:03:53.920> so<00:03:54.760> we<00:03:55.120> have<00:03:55.269> this

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
here which is red so we have this

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.860 
here which is red so we have this
correctly<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.099> connected<00:03:57.099> up<00:03:57.299> unlike<00:03:58.299> a<00:03:58.329> jLF

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
correctly and connected up unlike a jLF

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.960 
correctly and connected up unlike a jLF
shaft<00:03:59.170> there's<00:03:59.500> no<00:03:59.829> place<00:04:00.459> for<00:04:00.489> you<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:00.760> put<00:04:00.940> a

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
shaft there's no place for you to put a

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.629 
shaft there's no place for you to put a
screwdriver<00:04:01.389> in<00:04:01.750> here<00:04:02.049> so<00:04:02.920> what<00:04:03.340> we<00:04:03.430> need<00:04:03.579> to

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
screwdriver in here so what we need to

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.009 
screwdriver in here so what we need to
do<00:04:03.760> is<00:04:03.879> just<00:04:04.030> get<00:04:04.150> this<00:04:04.329> Eclipse

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
do is just get this Eclipse

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.009 
do is just get this Eclipse
and<00:04:05.349> that'll<00:04:05.709> get<00:04:05.829> the<00:04:06.069> stick<00:04:06.579> out<00:04:06.959> so<00:04:07.959> I'm

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
and that'll get the stick out so I'm

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.720 
and that'll get the stick out so I'm
just<00:04:08.079> going<00:04:08.349> to<00:04:08.409> carefully<00:04:08.650> pry<00:04:09.069> this<00:04:09.400> away

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
just going to carefully pry this away

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.300 
just going to carefully pry this away
these<00:04:10.180> have<00:04:10.359> a<00:04:10.480> tendency<00:04:10.919> to<00:04:11.919> shoot<00:04:12.220> across

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
these have a tendency to shoot across

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.670 
these have a tendency to shoot across
the<00:04:12.519> room<00:04:12.849> usually<00:04:13.060> so

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.380 

ok<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:20.770> I<00:04:20.860> got<00:04:20.980> the<00:04:21.100> Eclipse<00:04:21.490> off<00:04:21.610> just<00:04:22.240> going

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
ok so I got the Eclipse off just going

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.360 
ok so I got the Eclipse off just going
to<00:04:22.450> pull<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.690> shaft<00:04:22.900> out<00:04:25.740> lost<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.920> actuator

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
to pull the shaft out lost the actuator

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.210 
to pull the shaft out lost the actuator
so<00:04:27.820> we<00:04:28.000> want<00:04:28.180> to<00:04:28.270> keep<00:04:28.360> that<00:04:28.570> handy<00:04:29.130> so<00:04:30.130> the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
so we want to keep that handy so the

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.680 
so we want to keep that handy so the
next<00:04:30.400> step<00:04:30.550> is<00:04:30.760> getting<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.180> top<00:04:31.330> panel<00:04:31.660> back

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
next step is getting the top panel back

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.220 
next step is getting the top panel back
as<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:33.520> mentioned<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.030> jLF<00:04:34.420> shaft<00:04:34.750> has<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:34.990> nice

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
as I mentioned the jLF shaft has a nice

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.350 
as I mentioned the jLF shaft has a nice
screwdriver<00:04:35.680> groove<00:04:36.280> here<00:04:36.580> so<00:04:36.820> I'll<00:04:36.970> just<00:04:37.000> use

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
screwdriver groove here so I'll just use

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.100 
screwdriver groove here so I'll just use
that<00:04:37.390> to<00:04:37.570> remove<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:37.960> ball<00:04:38.140> top<00:04:42.750> now<00:04:43.750> I<00:04:43.780> need

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
that to remove the ball top now I need

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.230 
that to remove the ball top now I need
to<00:04:44.200> do<00:04:44.320> our<00:04:44.350> remove<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.860> four<00:04:45.100> screws<00:04:45.130> here

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.550 

okay<00:04:49.240> so<00:04:49.300> remember<00:04:49.540> we<00:04:49.840> added<00:04:49.930> in<00:04:50.230> this<00:04:50.380> way

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
okay so remember we added in this way

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.320 
okay so remember we added in this way
with<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:51.010> green<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.580> bottom<00:04:51.850> left<00:04:52.060> here

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
with the green and the bottom left here

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:59.210 
with the green and the bottom left here
so<00:04:53.040> if<00:04:54.040> I<00:04:54.160> just<00:04:54.370> line<00:04:54.610> this<00:04:54.760> up<00:04:54.970> flip<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.480> over

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.440 

this<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.550> way<00:05:00.670> we're<00:05:00.850> going<00:05:01.000> to<00:05:01.090> screw<00:05:01.420> it

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
this is the way we're going to screw it

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.600 
this is the way we're going to screw it
back<00:05:01.690> in<00:05:01.900> with<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.440> green<00:05:03.100> on<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.370> bottom

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
back in with the green on the bottom

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.540 
back in with the green on the bottom
right<00:05:03.790> here<00:05:04.030> in<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.330> yellow<00:05:04.450> on<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.870> top<00:05:05.050> left

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.710 

once<00:05:09.550> I<00:05:09.640> have<00:05:09.730> that<00:05:09.790> screwed<00:05:10.180> in<00:05:10.300> all<00:05:10.480> I<00:05:10.510> need

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
once I have that screwed in all I need

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.970 
once I have that screwed in all I need
to<00:05:10.780> do<00:05:10.930> is<00:05:11.110> come<00:05:11.320> back<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:12.490> top<00:05:12.670> side<00:05:13.980> put

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
to do is come back to the top side put

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.640 
to do is come back to the top side put
the<00:05:15.010> shaft<00:05:15.310> through<00:05:17.580> put<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.610> actuator<00:05:19.650> back

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
the shaft through put the actuator back

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.550 
the shaft through put the actuator back
on<00:05:20.890> and<00:05:21.660> there<00:05:22.660> were<00:05:22.750> two<00:05:22.900> sides<00:05:23.110> to<00:05:23.410> this

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
on and there were two sides to this

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.240 
on and there were two sides to this
there's<00:05:25.170> this<00:05:26.170> side<00:05:26.470> with<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.710> little<00:05:27.010> groove

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
there's this side with the little groove

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.670 
there's this side with the little groove
on<00:05:27.430> top<00:05:27.700> and<00:05:27.940> then<00:05:28.270> the<00:05:28.660> smooth<00:05:29.200> side<00:05:29.440> the

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
on top and then the smooth side the

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:39.989 
on top and then the smooth side the
smooth<00:05:29.950> side<00:05:30.220> is<00:05:30.250> what<00:05:30.640> faced<00:05:30.940> out

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:39.999 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:41.949 

maybe<00:05:40.999> I'll<00:05:41.119> push<00:05:41.389> that<00:05:41.539> on<00:05:41.689> with<00:05:41.839> your

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:41.959 
maybe I'll push that on with your

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:43.329 
maybe I'll push that on with your
fingers<00:05:42.319> or<00:05:42.589> you<00:05:42.709> could<00:05:42.859> use<00:05:42.979> a<00:05:43.009> flat

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:43.339 
fingers or you could use a flat

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:45.609 
fingers or you could use a flat
screwdriver<00:05:43.609> to<00:05:44.089> push<00:05:44.299> against<00:05:44.749> it<00:05:44.899> or<00:05:45.109> maybe

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:45.619 
screwdriver to push against it or maybe

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:48.519 
screwdriver to push against it or maybe
pair<00:05:46.189> of<00:05:46.249> pliers<00:05:47.079> so<00:05:48.079> you<00:05:48.139> can<00:05:48.229> see<00:05:48.349> there<00:05:48.499> I

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:48.529 
pair of pliers so you can see there I

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:49.719 
pair of pliers so you can see there I
got<00:05:48.679> it<00:05:48.769> back<00:05:48.889> on<00:05:49.069> with<00:05:49.219> a<00:05:49.309> flat<00:05:49.429> screwdriver

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
got it back on with a flat screwdriver

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.849 
got it back on with a flat screwdriver
so<00:05:50.329> that's<00:05:50.509> basically<00:05:50.869> it<00:05:50.989> all<00:05:51.349> I<00:05:51.409> need<00:05:51.619> to<00:05:51.709> do

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:51.859 
so that's basically it all I need to do

00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:58.629 
so that's basically it all I need to do
now<00:05:52.039> is<00:05:52.309> connect<00:05:53.149> this<00:05:53.239> back<00:05:53.479> up<00:05:57.549> remember<00:05:58.549> the

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
now is connect this back up remember the

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.729 
now is connect this back up remember the
black<00:05:58.819> wire<00:05:59.059> goes<00:05:59.089> to<00:05:59.329> where<00:06:00.139> hopefully<00:06:00.619> you

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:00.739 
black wire goes to where hopefully you

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:05.859 
black wire goes to where hopefully you
marked<00:06:01.009> where<00:06:01.219> your<00:06:01.339> ground<00:06:01.579> was<00:06:04.779> so<00:06:05.779> I'm

00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:05.869 
marked where your ground was so I'm

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:08.189 
marked where your ground was so I'm
still<00:06:06.079> having<00:06:06.259> issues<00:06:06.649> closing<00:06:07.129> the<00:06:07.219> case<00:06:07.429> and

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
still having issues closing the case and

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.659 
still having issues closing the case and
the<00:06:09.199> reason<00:06:09.499> is<00:06:09.709> because<00:06:09.739> these<00:06:10.309> micro

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
the reason is because these micro

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.139 
the reason is because these micro
switches<00:06:11.139> sink<00:06:12.139> down<00:06:12.289> a<00:06:12.319> little<00:06:12.469> bit<00:06:12.589> lower<00:06:12.799> so

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:13.149 
switches sink down a little bit lower so

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:15.669 
switches sink down a little bit lower so
the<00:06:14.149> harness<00:06:14.509> that<00:06:14.539> was<00:06:14.779> going<00:06:15.019> around<00:06:15.259> here

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:15.679 
the harness that was going around here

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:17.529 
the harness that was going around here
was<00:06:16.009> hitting<00:06:16.519> the<00:06:16.639> edges<00:06:16.939> of<00:06:17.089> this<00:06:17.239> now<00:06:17.479> you

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539 
was hitting the edges of this now you

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:20.049 
was hitting the edges of this now you
have<00:06:17.629> a<00:06:17.659> couple<00:06:17.839> options<00:06:18.309> you<00:06:19.309> could<00:06:19.549> Dremel

00:06:20.049 --> 00:06:20.059 
have a couple options you could Dremel

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:22.719 
have a couple options you could Dremel
out<00:06:20.239> around<00:06:20.659> this<00:06:20.899> area<00:06:21.199> as<00:06:21.589> you<00:06:22.429> can<00:06:22.549> see<00:06:22.699> I

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
out around this area as you can see I

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.149 
out around this area as you can see I
have<00:06:22.999> no<00:06:23.149> problem<00:06:23.479> dribbling<00:06:23.899> my<00:06:24.049> case<00:06:24.289> but<00:06:24.589> if

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.159 
have no problem dribbling my case but if

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:26.349 
have no problem dribbling my case but if
you<00:06:25.309> don't<00:06:25.489> want<00:06:25.639> to<00:06:25.699> do<00:06:25.759> that<00:06:25.939> another<00:06:26.209> thing

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:26.359 
you don't want to do that another thing

00:06:26.359 --> 00:06:28.179 
you don't want to do that another thing
you<00:06:26.479> do<00:06:26.659> is<00:06:26.749> very<00:06:26.989> carefully<00:06:27.379> bend<00:06:27.679> these<00:06:27.799> tabs

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:28.189 
you do is very carefully bend these tabs

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:31.119 
you do is very carefully bend these tabs
so<00:06:28.699> I'd<00:06:28.789> been<00:06:28.999> this<00:06:29.239> one<00:06:29.709> more<00:06:30.709> towards<00:06:30.979> the

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:31.129 
so I'd been this one more towards the

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.519 
so I'd been this one more towards the
corner<00:06:31.519> and<00:06:31.729> this<00:06:32.599> one<00:06:32.809> more<00:06:33.079> towards<00:06:33.349> that

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:33.529 
corner and this one more towards that

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:35.589 
corner and this one more towards that
corner<00:06:33.769> and<00:06:34.129> this<00:06:34.909> one<00:06:35.059> more<00:06:35.239> towards<00:06:35.479> that

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 
corner and this one more towards that

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:36.879 
corner and this one more towards that
corner<00:06:35.779> so<00:06:36.049> that's<00:06:36.139> actually<00:06:36.439> what<00:06:36.769> I'm<00:06:36.859> going

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
corner so that's actually what I'm going

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:38.619 
corner so that's actually what I'm going
to<00:06:37.159> do<00:06:37.309> because<00:06:37.609> probably<00:06:37.879> most<00:06:38.059> people<00:06:38.509> will

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:38.629 
to do because probably most people will

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:43.659 
to do because probably most people will
do<00:06:38.779> that<00:06:41.469> so<00:06:42.469> you<00:06:42.529> can<00:06:42.619> see<00:06:42.649> here<00:06:42.949> that<00:06:43.279> I<00:06:43.339> bent

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
do that so you can see here that I bent

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.439 
do that so you can see here that I bent
the<00:06:43.759> prongs<00:06:44.389> on<00:06:44.779> the<00:06:45.589> switches<00:06:46.369> so<00:06:46.969> that<00:06:47.179> the

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:47.449 
the prongs on the switches so that the

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.209 
the prongs on the switches so that the
those<00:06:47.929> connectors<00:06:48.409> are<00:06:48.589> kind<00:06:48.739> of<00:06:48.799> going<00:06:49.069> into

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:49.219 
those connectors are kind of going into

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:51.159 
those connectors are kind of going into
the<00:06:49.339> corners<00:06:49.729> and<00:06:49.759> getting<00:06:50.749> out<00:06:50.839> of<00:06:50.869> the<00:06:51.019> lay

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:51.169 
the corners and getting out of the lay

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:54.039 
the corners and getting out of the lay
and<00:06:51.469> the<00:06:52.159> I've<00:06:52.699> managed<00:06:53.149> to<00:06:53.389> basically<00:06:53.809> get

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:54.049 
and the I've managed to basically get

00:06:54.049 --> 00:06:58.769 
and the I've managed to basically get
this<00:06:55.149> to<00:06:56.149> be<00:06:56.389> flat<00:06:56.869> it<00:06:57.409> takes<00:06:57.649> a<00:06:57.739> little<00:06:57.889> bit<00:06:58.009> of

00:06:58.769 --> 00:06:58.779 
this to be flat it takes a little bit of

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:01.479 
this to be flat it takes a little bit of
convincing<00:06:59.779> but<00:07:00.649> once<00:07:00.829> the<00:07:00.949> screws<00:07:01.219> are<00:07:01.369> in

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:01.489 
convincing but once the screws are in

00:07:01.489 --> 00:07:20.269 
convincing but once the screws are in
this<00:07:01.639> will<00:07:01.819> stay<00:07:02.059> down<00:07:02.269> flush

00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:20.279 

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:22.589 

so<00:07:21.279> that's<00:07:21.520> it<00:07:21.669> that's<00:07:21.939> all<00:07:22.120> there<00:07:22.270> is<00:07:22.300> to<00:07:22.479> this

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:22.599 
so that's it that's all there is to this

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:27.779 
so that's it that's all there is to this
mud<00:07:22.810> see<00:07:23.710> you<00:07:23.770> next<00:07:23.979> time<00:07:24.779> wash
