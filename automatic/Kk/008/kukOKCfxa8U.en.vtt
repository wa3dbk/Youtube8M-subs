USB<00:02:02.280> cable<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.299> could<00:02:03.659> if<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.930> wanted<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.439> on

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
USB cable and I could if I wanted to on

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.059

the left side connect this extension to

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.520 
the left side connect this extension to
add<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> sustain<00:02:09.000> pedal<00:02:09.390> if<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.539> had<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:09.959> or<00:02:10.410> an

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
add a sustain pedal if I had one or an

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.410 
add a sustain pedal if I had one or an
expression<00:02:10.800> pedal<00:02:11.039> I'm<00:02:11.910> not<00:02:12.030> going<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.300> do

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
expression pedal I'm not going to do

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.100 
expression pedal I'm not going to do
that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.870 
that
can<00:02:13.260> use<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:15.320> keyboard<00:02:16.320> controls<00:02:17.130> just

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
can use the on keyboard controls just

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.550 
can use the on keyboard controls just
because<00:02:18.270> I'm<00:02:18.390> curious<00:02:18.660> I've<00:02:19.230> never<00:02:19.380> seen

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
because I'm curious I've never seen

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.760 
because I'm curious I've never seen
those<00:02:19.680> before<00:02:19.740> like<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:21.840> am<00:02:22.290> using<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.590> Mac

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
those before like that I am using a Mac

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.350 
those before like that I am using a Mac
but<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.610> supposed<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:23.940> be<00:02:24.030> compatible

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
but this is supposed to be compatible

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.790 
but this is supposed to be compatible
with<00:02:25.010> also<00:02:26.010> an<00:02:26.130> iOS<00:02:26.550> device<00:02:27.000> iPad<00:02:27.810> iPhone<00:02:28.410> for

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
with also an iOS device iPad iPhone for

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.150 
with also an iOS device iPad iPhone for
those<00:02:28.950> those<00:02:29.850> mini<00:02:30.360> apps<00:02:30.920> Android<00:02:32.150> Windows

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
those those mini apps Android Windows

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.940 
those those mini apps Android Windows
Linux<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:36.000> we'll<00:02:36.810> do<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.260> on<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.530> Mac<00:02:37.710> but

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
Linux so we'll do it on the Mac but

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.590 
Linux so we'll do it on the Mac but
you're<00:02:38.070> supposed<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.370> work<00:02:38.670> properly<00:02:39.180> on<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
you're supposed to work properly on the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.410 
you're supposed to work properly on the
other<00:02:39.860> devices<00:02:40.860> -<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.730> does<00:02:41.910> not<00:02:42.030> come<00:02:42.270> with

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
other devices - it does not come with

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.270 
other devices - it does not come with
any<00:02:42.450> drivers<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.260> guess<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:43.830> just<00:02:43.950> going

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
any drivers so I guess it's just going

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.130 
any drivers so I guess it's just going
to<00:02:44.340> be<00:02:44.430> recognized<00:02:44.910> automatically<00:02:45.900> we're

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
to be recognized automatically we're

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.420 
to be recognized automatically we're
about<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.500> find<00:02:46.650> out<00:02:46.800> I'm<00:02:47.010> going<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.220> launch

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
about to find out I'm going to launch

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.280 
about to find out I'm going to launch
logic<00:02:48.090> for<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.630> one<00:02:48.780> thing<00:02:48.959> I'm<00:02:49.080> really

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
logic for this and one thing I'm really

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.860 
logic for this and one thing I'm really
curious<00:02:49.410> about<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.850> know<00:02:51.000> if<00:02:51.270> this<00:02:51.570> is

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
curious about is to know if this is

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.120 
curious about is to know if this is
going<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.260> do<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.410> good<00:02:52.560> job<00:02:52.620> at<00:02:52.920> recognizing

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
going to do a good job at recognizing

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.760 
going to do a good job at recognizing
the<00:02:53.910> amount<00:02:54.270> of<00:02:54.570> strength<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.260> I'm<00:02:55.440> putting

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
the amount of strength that I'm putting

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.990 
the amount of strength that I'm putting
on<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.430> keys<00:02:56.640> doesn't<00:02:57.510> seem<00:02:57.750> like<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.110> will

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
on the keys doesn't seem like it will

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.490 
on the keys doesn't seem like it will
but<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.209> might<00:03:00.570> be<00:03:00.720> surprised<00:03:01.050> we're<00:03:01.320> going<00:03:01.440> to

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
but I might be surprised we're going to

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.280 
but I might be surprised we're going to
see<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:02.610> I've<00:03:02.700> got<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> just<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.690> piano<00:03:03.930> patch

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
see so I've got a just a piano patch

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.680 
see so I've got a just a piano patch
with<00:03:04.590> strings<00:03:04.980> here

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.540 

it<00:03:08.690> does<00:03:11.560> let's<00:03:12.560> try<00:03:12.680> another<00:03:12.830> passion<00:03:13.430> are

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
it does let's try another passion are

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.160 
it does let's try another passion are
going<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.760> see<00:03:13.910> those<00:03:14.120> controls<00:03:14.840> here<00:03:14.990> like

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
going to see those controls here like

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:25.330 
going to see those controls here like
the<00:03:15.290> modulation<00:03:15.850> here's<00:03:16.850> an<00:03:17.000> organ<00:03:17.300> patch<00:03:24.340> so

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
the modulation here's an organ patch so

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.280 
the modulation here's an organ patch so
that<00:03:25.370> recognizes<00:03:26.120> it<00:03:26.240> the<00:03:26.420> sustain<00:03:26.780> I'm

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
that recognizes it the sustain I'm

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.830 
that recognizes it the sustain I'm
pressing<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.740> sustain<00:03:28.100> here<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:31.840> little

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
pressing the sustain here a little

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.510 
pressing the sustain here a little
problem<00:03:33.260> with<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.470> sustain<00:03:33.830> here<00:03:36.370> it's<00:03:37.370> not

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
problem with the sustain here it's not

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.370 
problem with the sustain here it's not
doing<00:03:37.819> anything<00:03:38.030> maybe<00:03:38.330> I<00:03:38.450> need<00:03:38.630> to<00:03:38.780> read<00:03:39.290> the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
doing anything maybe I need to read the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.290 
doing anything maybe I need to read the
manual<00:03:39.709> we're<00:03:40.610> going<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:40.790> check<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.090> out<00:03:41.209> in

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
manual we're going to check that out in

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.750 
manual we're going to check that out in
a<00:03:41.330> second<00:03:41.810> let's<00:03:42.320> do<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.650> e<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.890> octave<00:03:43.220> +<00:03:43.489> and

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
a second let's do the e the octave + and

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:58.900 
a second let's do the e the octave + and
down<00:03:44.410> this<00:03:45.410> +<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:50.870> works<00:03:51.310> pitch<00:03:52.310> Bend

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.220 

it's<00:03:59.910> kind<00:04:00.120> of<00:04:00.150> interesting<00:04:00.630> how<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:00.990> works

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
it's kind of interesting how it works

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.900 
it's kind of interesting how it works
I've<00:04:01.470> never<00:04:01.680> seen<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:01.980> pitch<00:04:02.250> Bend<00:04:02.520> with<00:04:02.670> just

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
I've never seen a pitch Bend with just

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.870 
I've never seen a pitch Bend with just
two<00:04:03.150> buttons<00:04:03.540> usually<00:04:03.900> it's<00:04:04.050> a<00:04:04.250> it's<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.430> two

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
two buttons usually it's a it's a two

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.390 
two buttons usually it's a it's a two
wheel<00:04:06.260> which<00:04:07.260> gives<00:04:07.500> you<00:04:07.620> more<00:04:07.770> control<00:04:07.890> in

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
wheel which gives you more control in

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:16.580 
wheel which gives you more control in
this<00:04:08.630> just<00:04:09.630> press<00:04:10.170> it<00:04:10.350> up<00:04:15.020> it's<00:04:16.020> kind<00:04:16.230> of<00:04:16.320> cool

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
this just press it up it's kind of cool

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.420 
this just press it up it's kind of cool
but<00:04:16.800> it<00:04:16.920> doesn't<00:04:17.280> really<00:04:17.670> give<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:19.430> speed

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
but it doesn't really give you the speed

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.030 
but it doesn't really give you the speed
factor<00:04:20.670> that<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:21.209> would<00:04:21.330> have<00:04:21.510> with<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.720> real

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
factor that you would have with a real

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.370 
factor that you would have with a real
with<00:04:23.040> a<00:04:23.070> wheel<00:04:23.670> wheel<00:04:24.000> but<00:04:24.690> it's<00:04:24.930> still<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.170> good

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
with a wheel wheel but it's still a good

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.290 
with a wheel wheel but it's still a good
idea<00:04:25.440> thank<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.190> taking<00:04:26.790> this<00:04:26.910> on<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.120> road

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
idea thank you taking this on the road

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.960 
idea thank you taking this on the road
in<00:04:27.450> a<00:04:27.540> coffee<00:04:27.750> shop<00:04:27.870> or<00:04:28.170> whatever<00:04:28.410> to<00:04:29.040> work<00:04:29.310> you

in a coffee shop or whatever to work you

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.000 
in a coffee shop or whatever to work you
still<00:04:30.210> have<00:04:30.390> access<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.170> pitch<00:04:31.350> bends<00:04:31.800> so

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
still have access to the pitch bends so

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.890 
still have access to the pitch bends so
that's<00:04:32.250> that's<00:04:32.520> good<00:04:32.850> let's<00:04:33.420> find<00:04:33.660> out<00:04:33.780> about

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
that's that's good let's find out about

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.260 
that's that's good let's find out about
the<00:04:34.080> sustain<00:04:34.530> thing<00:04:34.800> so<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.340> changed<00:04:35.700> patches

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
the sustain thing so I changed patches

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.730 
the sustain thing so I changed patches
and<00:04:36.480> this<00:04:36.600> time<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:36.930> sustain<00:04:37.230> is<00:04:37.380> working

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
and this time the sustain is working

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.770 
and this time the sustain is working
everything<00:04:38.280> worked<00:04:38.670> outside<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.420> the<00:04:39.540> box

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
everything worked outside of the box

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.710 
everything worked outside of the box
very<00:04:40.470> simple<00:04:40.950> to<00:04:41.070> plug<00:04:41.280> in<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.790> was<00:04:42.120> recognized

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
very simple to plug in it was recognized

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.410 
very simple to plug in it was recognized
by<00:04:42.930> my<00:04:43.080> sequencer<00:04:43.680> automatically<00:04:44.580> all<00:04:44.790> the

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
by my sequencer automatically all the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.720 
by my sequencer automatically all the
buttons<00:04:45.780> worked<00:04:46.140> perfectly<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:47.070> sustain

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
buttons worked perfectly the sustain

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.160 
buttons worked perfectly the sustain
does<00:04:47.970> work<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.480> was<00:04:48.570> just<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.870> matter<00:04:49.050> of

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
does work it was just a matter of

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.070 
does work it was just a matter of
finding<00:04:49.350> a<00:04:49.620> patch<00:04:49.860> that<00:04:50.060> would<00:04:51.060> use<00:04:51.840> that

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
finding a patch that would use that

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.520 
finding a patch that would use that
sustain<00:04:53.030> everything<00:04:54.030> worked<00:04:54.330> great<00:04:54.510> I<00:04:55.020> don't

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
sustain everything worked great I don't

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.170 
sustain everything worked great I don't
think<00:04:56.100> this<00:04:56.190> is<00:04:56.250> going<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.490> replace<00:04:56.760> my

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
think this is going to replace my

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.340 
think this is going to replace my
regular<00:04:57.660> 49<00:04:58.350> key<00:04:58.710> MIDI<00:04:59.870> controller<00:05:00.870> my

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
regular 49 key MIDI controller my

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.110 
regular 49 key MIDI controller my
keyboard<00:05:01.770> controller<00:05:02.160> because<00:05:02.670> it's<00:05:02.820> smaller

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
keyboard controller because it's smaller

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.440 
keyboard controller because it's smaller
and<00:05:03.480> the<00:05:04.140> keys<00:05:04.380> are<00:05:04.740> smaller<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.820> fit<00:05:06.090> this

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
and the keys are smaller to fit this

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.490 
and the keys are smaller to fit this
size<00:05:07.850> it's<00:05:08.850> really<00:05:09.420> thin<00:05:09.720> and<00:05:10.020> it's<00:05:10.200> kind<00:05:10.380> of

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
size it's really thin and it's kind of

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.660 
size it's really thin and it's kind of
weird<00:05:10.800> I<00:05:11.100> think<00:05:11.300> using<00:05:12.300> this<00:05:12.480> on<00:05:12.750> a<00:05:13.710> desk<00:05:14.400> on<00:05:14.640> a

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
weird I think using this on a desk on a

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.510 
weird I think using this on a desk on a
flat<00:05:14.910> surface<00:05:15.180> when<00:05:15.810> when<00:05:16.350> you<00:05:17.160> know<00:05:17.190> you're

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
flat surface when when you know you're

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.540 
flat surface when when you know you're
used<00:05:17.820> to<00:05:17.940> a<00:05:18.030> regular<00:05:18.510> keyboard<00:05:19.500> a<00:05:19.800> regular

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
used to a regular keyboard a regular

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.750 
used to a regular keyboard a regular
thicker<00:05:21.150> keyboard<00:05:22.070> so<00:05:23.070> I<00:05:23.100> don't<00:05:23.310> think<00:05:23.460> this

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
thicker keyboard so I don't think this

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.900 
thicker keyboard so I don't think this
is<00:05:23.790> necessarily<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:24.720> best<00:05:25.170> route<00:05:25.740> for<00:05:26.310> a<00:05:26.700> home

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
is necessarily the best route for a home

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.300 
is necessarily the best route for a home
studio<00:05:27.360> use<00:05:27.630> but<00:05:27.990> to<00:05:28.530> take<00:05:28.650> this<00:05:28.830> on<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.130> road

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.270 
studio use but to take this on the road
or<00:05:29.520> on<00:05:29.550> vacation<00:05:29.960> totally<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.680> addition<00:05:32.220> of

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
or on vacation totally the addition of

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.230 
or on vacation totally the addition of
the<00:05:32.720> the<00:05:33.740> pitch<00:05:34.740> bends<00:05:35.220> here<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:36.030> mod

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
the the pitch bends here and the mod

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.670 
the the pitch bends here and the mod
control<00:05:36.690> like<00:05:36.870> everything<00:05:37.320> is<00:05:37.470> right<00:05:37.650> here

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
control like everything is right here

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.770 
control like everything is right here
and<00:05:38.160> that's<00:05:38.820> great<00:05:39.090> that's<00:05:39.150> something<00:05:39.630> that

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
and that's great that's something that

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.540 
and that's great that's something that
is<00:05:39.900> lacking<00:05:40.140> a<00:05:40.380> lot<00:05:40.530> of<00:05:40.650> portable<00:05:41.010> keyboards

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
is lacking a lot of portable keyboards

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.130 
is lacking a lot of portable keyboards
even<00:05:42.270> though<00:05:42.360> you<00:05:42.420> don't<00:05:42.630> have<00:05:42.810> as<00:05:42.960> much

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
even though you don't have as much

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.800 
even though you don't have as much
control<00:05:43.590> on<00:05:43.980> the<00:05:44.130> pitch<00:05:44.400> with<00:05:45.210> these<00:05:45.390> buttons

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
control on the pitch with these buttons

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.390 
control on the pitch with these buttons
that<00:05:46.050> you<00:05:46.140> would<00:05:46.290> have<00:05:46.500> with<00:05:46.680> a<00:05:46.740> regular<00:05:47.130> wheel

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
that you would have with a regular wheel

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.640 
that you would have with a regular wheel
it's<00:05:48.180> still<00:05:48.390> very<00:05:48.540> portable<00:05:48.870> and<00:05:49.320> it<00:05:49.470> will

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
it's still very portable and it will

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.400 
it's still very portable and it will
allow<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:49.890> to<00:05:50.070> track<00:05:50.430> ideas<00:05:51.000> in<00:05:51.330> your

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
allow you to track ideas in your

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.920 
allow you to track ideas in your
sequencer<00:05:52.440> on<00:05:53.340> vacation<00:05:53.910> you<00:05:54.420> can<00:05:54.510> bring<00:05:54.810> this

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
sequencer on vacation you can bring this

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.130 
sequencer on vacation you can bring this
in<00:05:55.110> a<00:05:55.200> large<00:05:56.130> backpack<00:05:56.790> if<00:05:57.030> you<00:05:57.150> have<00:05:57.330> the<00:05:57.510> 37

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
in a large backpack if you have the 37

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.960 
in a large backpack if you have the 37
key<00:05:58.350> version<00:05:58.590> like<00:05:58.920> I<00:05:59.070> did<00:05:59.340> but<00:05:59.790> they<00:05:59.880> also

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
key version like I did but they also

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.420 
key version like I did but they also
have<00:06:00.270> smaller<00:06:00.600> ones<00:06:00.900> so<00:06:01.110> I<00:06:01.650> think<00:06:02.100> this<00:06:02.250> has

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
have smaller ones so I think this has

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.780 
have smaller ones so I think this has
its<00:06:02.640> use<00:06:02.880> for<00:06:03.330> the<00:06:03.840> traveling<00:06:04.230> musicians

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
its use for the traveling musicians

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.180 
its use for the traveling musicians
definitely<00:06:05.790> absolutely<00:06:06.090> I<00:06:06.690> don't<00:06:07.470> think<00:06:07.830> it

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
definitely absolutely I don't think it

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.510 
definitely absolutely I don't think it
has<00:06:08.700> its<00:06:08.940> place<00:06:09.180> in<00:06:09.660> my<00:06:10.200> home<00:06:10.410> studio

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
has its place in my home studio

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.020 
has its place in my home studio
but<00:06:12.590> to<00:06:13.590> travel<00:06:14.039> this<00:06:14.370> is<00:06:14.550> great

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
but to travel this is great

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.740 
but to travel this is great
it<00:06:15.419> feels<00:06:15.770> pretty<00:06:16.770> robust<00:06:17.629> especially<00:06:18.629> the

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
it feels pretty robust especially the

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.680 
it feels pretty robust especially the
base<00:06:18.990> here<00:06:19.349> I<00:06:19.729> don't<00:06:20.729> think<00:06:21.000> now<00:06:21.210> this<00:06:21.389> is<00:06:21.539> not

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
base here I don't think now this is not

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.540 
base here I don't think now this is not
metal<00:06:22.050> this<00:06:22.139> is<00:06:22.199> plastic<00:06:22.800> it<00:06:22.949> looks<00:06:23.250> like

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
metal this is plastic it looks like

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.059 
metal this is plastic it looks like
metal<00:06:24.000> like<00:06:24.389> the<00:06:24.509> kind<00:06:24.720> of<00:06:24.830> thing<00:06:25.830> that<00:06:25.860> you

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:26.069 
metal like the kind of thing that you

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:28.279 
metal like the kind of thing that you
would<00:06:26.159> have<00:06:26.340> on<00:06:26.370> a<00:06:26.490> Mac<00:06:26.759> it's<00:06:27.030> it's<00:06:27.539> not<00:06:27.780> it

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
would have on a Mac it's it's not it

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.059 
would have on a Mac it's it's not it
feels<00:06:29.190> more<00:06:29.430> like<00:06:29.610> like<00:06:30.240> plastic<00:06:30.720> to<00:06:30.840> me
