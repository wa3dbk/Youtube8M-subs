00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello friends in this video I'm going to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.820
 show some pictures of the avengers 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.480
 it was from the throne of some new one that pulled 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.500
 bread and I bought 5 leftovers and in the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.850
 album come from gift 8 stamps that already 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.850
 I had shown them in my video 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.350
 earlier here they are and well let's open 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.730
 a couple of envelopes so you can 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.859
 see this as are the pictures that 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.300
 come in this collection as they 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.189
 I was commenting in my previous video I did not 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.160
 I'm thinking of collecting this album 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.780
 like the quality of the inner leaves 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.879
 from the album 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.680
 then how are 168 pictures 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.260
 practically every stamp comes out in a 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.980
 weight and many are repeated to you I'm not going 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.140
 to invest in that but this one 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.030
 Well, here I am going to show you some 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.629
 I'm not going to open all of them 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.670
 draw or sell the album the people who 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.000
 what's left have the opportunity to open 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.460
 three envelopes so look here is 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.680
 in this image quiksilver is very father 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.200
 the stamp the picture yes I liked it 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.780
 he really liked the quality and the printing 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.030
 these are recommended, they are 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.600
 autoadheribles here is the throne 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.600
 destroyed 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.180
 apart from a collage comes the eye of a hammer 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.610
 part of hulk and part of thor 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.140
 this one is more or less of eye of alcÃ³n no 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.450
 the quality that we say is very good 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.400
 here is part of another collage of 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.810
 capitan america and opening another one of 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.380
 the prints with care for not 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.380
 break them 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.429
 this is father because it 's metallic 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.850
 in the boot of eyes of alcohol it is seen that 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.799
 will be very well formed is 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.280
 I do not remember who it is, I do not know if it's 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.840
 assistant doctor or whoever for 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.680
 the reverse does not say that what is both 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.530
 the number 60 look here nothing else 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.630
 they left 4 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.009
 instead of 5 because it's metallic 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.430
 here is the throne 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.319
 and here is 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.560
 I imagine that it is part of joel 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.520
 like for the size 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.430
 and well, good friends, I think that 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.750
 As you can see, we open the others, we leave them 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.630
 closed let's open one more 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.600
 because as part of queues come 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.210
 we could even see several that are 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.960
 well complete let's open one more and 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:42.990
 we leave two for the person who goes to 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.990
 stay with this album and these pictures 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.450
 let's see here comes iron man if it comes 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.210
 full 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.190
 over here is another part of another collage 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.680
 he could not distinguish I imagine that 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:03.519
 it must be a throne or a bus 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.969
 until another collage of all that is a 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.209
 complete ironman and finally here 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:12.280
 there is the scarlet witch 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.040
 friends so I see is there is no 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.409
 enough is sneaking the album that's not me 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.560
 it convinces so much because then I prefer 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.209
 so come stamps where you see the 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.500
 complete image in one and now better than 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.200
 there would be one or two colors but right now 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.030
 They already saw that many came out very 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.239
 good to see the video where I open the 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.340
 album and I give my opinion and this one I hope 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.109

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.060

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:59.439
