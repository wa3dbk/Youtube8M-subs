00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
caverns all we got to do basically is

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.720 
caverns all we got to do basically is
just<00:03:34.930> one<00:03:35.080> a<00:03:35.110> complete<00:03:35.560> loop<00:03:35.770> around<00:03:35.950> caustic

just one a complete loop around caustic

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.970 
just one a complete loop around caustic
caverns<00:03:37.060> you'll<00:03:37.239> find<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.540> few<00:03:37.780> each<00:03:37.989> time<00:03:38.290> save

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980

exit<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.489> do<00:03:39.610> it<00:03:39.700> again<00:03:39.880> now<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.150> couple<00:03:40.600> other

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
exit and do it again now a couple other

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.180 
exit and do it again now a couple other
places<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.380> I'll<00:03:41.620> show<00:03:41.800> you<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.010> one<00:03:42.160> I

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
places and I'll show you the one I

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.280 
places and I'll show you the one I
recommend<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.880> most<00:03:43.030> after<00:03:43.390> this<00:03:43.900> caustic

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
recommend the most after this caustic

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.800 
recommend the most after this caustic
caverns<00:03:44.590> run<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:45.580> can<00:03:45.730> go<00:03:45.820> to<00:03:45.880> salty<00:03:46.300> cauldron

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
caverns run you can go to salty cauldron

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.110 
caverns run you can go to salty cauldron
back<00:03:47.110> there<00:03:47.290> where<00:03:47.440> all<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.770> like<00:03:48.120> the

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
back there where all the like the

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.610 
back there where all the like the
buzzards<00:03:49.540> spawn<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.110> stuff<00:03:50.290> like<00:03:50.380> that

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
buzzards spawn and stuff like that

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.840 
buzzards spawn and stuff like that
there's<00:03:50.800> a<00:03:50.860> couple<00:03:51.010> places<00:03:51.220> you<00:03:51.580> can<00:03:51.760> go

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
there's a couple places you can go

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.810 
there's a couple places you can go
caustic<00:03:52.270> caverns<00:03:52.660> um<00:03:53.220> stuff<00:03:54.220> like<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:54.580> but<00:03:54.790> I

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
caustic caverns um stuff like that but I

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.880 
caustic caverns um stuff like that but I
prefer<00:03:55.300> right<00:03:55.480> here<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.810> Highlands<00:03:56.350> and<00:03:56.560> if

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
prefer right here the Highlands and if

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.930 
prefer right here the Highlands and if

where<00:04:01.870> I'm<00:04:01.959> going<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.380> and<00:04:02.739> as<00:04:02.920> soon<00:04:03.070> as<00:04:03.160> you

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
where I'm going to and as soon as you

underneath<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.989> bridge<00:04:05.200> you'll<00:04:05.500> see<00:04:05.650> right

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
underneath the bridge you'll see right

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.070 
underneath the bridge you'll see right
here<00:04:05.860> and<00:04:06.250> I<00:04:06.790> always<00:04:07.150> got<00:04:07.330> at<00:04:07.450> least<00:04:07.480> one

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
here and I always got at least one

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.620 
here and I always got at least one
wormhole<00:04:08.560> thrushes<00:04:08.980> this<00:04:09.190> way<00:04:09.400> sometimes<00:04:10.060> -

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
wormhole thrushes this way sometimes -

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.840 
wormhole thrushes this way sometimes -
okay<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.380> like<00:04:11.950> doing<00:04:12.220> it<00:04:12.310> this<00:04:12.400> way<00:04:12.459> because

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
okay I like doing it this way because

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.610 
okay I like doing it this way because
you<00:04:13.030> know<00:04:13.300> you<00:04:13.360> could<00:04:13.630> spawn<00:04:13.959> in<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:14.260> just<00:04:14.380> run

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
you know you could spawn in you just run

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.380 
you know you could spawn in you just run
over<00:04:14.650> here<00:04:15.040> you'll<00:04:15.459> always<00:04:15.670> see<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.030> wormhole

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
over here you'll always see the wormhole

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.479 
over here you'll always see the wormhole
pressure<00:04:16.660> first<00:04:17.080> in<00:04:17.350> this<00:04:17.500> case<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:18.010> killed

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
pressure first in this case I killed

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.280 
pressure first in this case I killed
them<00:04:18.640> all<00:04:18.730> just<00:04:19.000> to<00:04:19.090> show<00:04:19.269> you<00:04:19.330> guys<00:04:19.419> where<00:04:20.140> the

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
them all just to show you guys where the

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.900 
them all just to show you guys where the
threshers<00:04:20.739> would<00:04:20.950> spawn<00:04:21.190> but<00:04:21.489> what<00:04:21.640> I<00:04:21.669> would

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
threshers would spawn but what I would

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.760 
threshers would spawn but what I would
recommend<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.600> just<00:04:22.870> come<00:04:23.169> up<00:04:23.320> there<00:04:23.500> there's

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
recommend is just come up there there's

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.529 
recommend is just come up there there's
the<00:04:23.890> wormhole<00:04:24.220> thruster<00:04:24.580> they're<00:04:24.789> shooting

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
the wormhole thruster they're shooting

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.060 
the wormhole thruster they're shooting
killing<00:04:25.840> save<00:04:26.260> exit<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:26.740> just<00:04:26.919> keep

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
killing save exit and just keep

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.220 
killing save exit and just keep
repeating<00:04:27.250> that<00:04:27.640> way

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
repeating that way

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.250 
repeating that way
like<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:29.100> feel<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.030> that's<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.660> fastest<00:04:31.110> way

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
like I feel that that's the fastest way

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.840 
like I feel that that's the fastest way
sure<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:31.770> may<00:04:31.920> get<00:04:32.070> five<00:04:32.310> or<00:04:32.340> six<00:04:32.520> out<00:04:32.820> of

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
sure you may get five or six out of

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.640 
sure you may get five or six out of
running<00:04:33.060> caustic<00:04:33.510> caverns<00:04:33.870> maybe<00:04:34.320> three<00:04:34.620> or

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
running caustic caverns maybe three or

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.250 
running caustic caverns maybe three or
four<00:04:34.800> each<00:04:35.130> time<00:04:35.430> you<00:04:36.150> may<00:04:36.360> get<00:04:36.570> that<00:04:36.720> mini<00:04:36.960> but

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
four each time you may get that mini but

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.780 
four each time you may get that mini but
the<00:04:37.440> amount<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:37.740> time<00:04:37.950> it<00:04:38.130> takes<00:04:38.310> it<00:04:38.520> takes<00:04:38.700> a

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
the amount of time it takes it takes a

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.130 
the amount of time it takes it takes a
few<00:04:38.970> minutes<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.420> run<00:04:39.540> all<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.780> way<00:04:39.870> around

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
few minutes to run all the way around

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.290 
few minutes to run all the way around
caustic<00:04:40.530> caverns<00:04:40.890> I<00:04:41.070> feel<00:04:41.550> like<00:04:41.760> you<00:04:41.910> can<00:04:42.060> save

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
caustic caverns I feel like you can save

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.970 
caustic caverns I feel like you can save
and<00:04:42.480> exit<00:04:42.720> kill<00:04:42.870> this<00:04:43.020> first<00:04:43.260> one<00:04:43.470> motor<00:04:43.650> ship
