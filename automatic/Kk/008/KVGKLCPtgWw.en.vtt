my<00:00:05.430> friend<00:00:05.790> has<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.089> problem<00:00:06.720> here<00:00:06.930> with<00:00:07.109> this

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
my friend has a problem here with this

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.240 
my friend has a problem here with this
83<00:00:07.890> 300<00:00:08.610> D<00:00:08.790> turbo<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.800> we're<00:00:10.800> going<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.040> try<00:00:11.190> to

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
83 300 D turbo and we're going to try to

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.459 
83 300 D turbo and we're going to try to
solve<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:12.690> first<00:00:12.870> thing<00:00:13.080> we<00:00:13.170> have<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.380> do

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
solve it the first thing we have to do

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.010 
solve it the first thing we have to do
is<00:00:13.590> find<00:00:13.830> out<00:00:14.040> what<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.179> really<00:00:15.360> causing<00:00:15.990> the

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
is find out what is really causing the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.019 
is find out what is really causing the
problem<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.650> then<00:00:17.310> we're<00:00:17.490> going<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.670> have<00:00:17.850> to

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
problem and then we're going to have to

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.210 
problem and then we're going to have to
repair<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:19.080> as<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.410> thought<00:00:19.650> through<00:00:20.010> this

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
repair it and as I thought through this

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.630 
repair it and as I thought through this
problem<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:21.140> to<00:00:22.140> realize<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.650> might<00:00:22.920> make<00:00:23.340> a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
problem I to realize this might make a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.170 
problem I to realize this might make a
great<00:00:24.060> video<00:00:24.990> workshop<00:00:25.619> series<00:00:25.859> on<00:00:26.279> how<00:00:27.119> to

himself<00:00:46.800> let<00:00:47.670> me<00:00:47.789> explain<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.420> problem<00:00:48.809> when

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
himself let me explain the problem when

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.670 
himself let me explain the problem when
he<00:00:49.230> picked<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.770> car<00:00:51.140> he<00:00:52.140> knew<00:00:52.350> there<00:00:52.590> was

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
he picked up this car he knew there was

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.790 
he picked up this car he knew there was
a<00:00:52.739> problem<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.460> because<00:00:53.820> there<00:00:54.719> was<00:00:54.930> it

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
a problem with it because there was it

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.200 
a problem with it because there was it
was<00:00:55.980> losing<00:00:56.340> coolant<00:00:56.789> there<00:00:56.969> was<00:00:57.090> an

was losing coolant there was an

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.389 
was losing coolant there was an
overheating<00:00:57.690> problem<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.260> right<00:00:58.980> away<00:00:59.340> you

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
overheating problem and right away you

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.939 
overheating problem and right away you
could<00:00:59.940> spot<00:01:00.329> something<00:01:00.989> was<00:01:01.289> going<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.890> with

could spot something was going on with

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.240 
could spot something was going on with
this<00:01:02.930> coolant<00:01:03.930> reservoir<00:01:04.140> tank<00:01:04.680> look<00:01:05.010> at<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
this coolant reservoir tank look at the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.570 
this coolant reservoir tank look at the
coloring<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.090> thing<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.510> mean<00:01:07.430> it's<00:01:08.430> a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
coloring on that thing I mean it's a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.560 
coloring on that thing I mean it's a
little<00:01:08.790> dirty<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.180> little<00:01:09.510> rusty<00:01:09.960> inside<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
little dirty a little rusty inside and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.359 
little dirty a little rusty inside and
when<00:01:12.570> he<00:01:12.659> started<00:01:12.990> driving<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.770> he<00:01:14.010> said<00:01:14.189> me

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
when he started driving this he said me

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.359 
when he started driving this he said me
and<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.640> engine<00:01:15.000> runs<00:01:15.210> great<00:01:15.500> but<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.799> smokes

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
and this engine runs great but it smokes

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.190 
and this engine runs great but it smokes
when<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.880> start<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.270> up<00:01:18.390> kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.780> whitish

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
when you start it up kind of a whitish

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.100 
when you start it up kind of a whitish
smoke<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.909> then<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.689> keeps<00:01:22.520> overheating<00:01:24.080> so<00:01:25.080> I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
smoke and then it keeps overheating so I

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.050 
smoke and then it keeps overheating so I
recommended<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:25.979> he<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.490> pulled<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
recommended that he just pulled the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.609 
recommended that he just pulled the
thermostat<00:01:27.600> out<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.049> he<00:01:28.170> went<00:01:28.350> into<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
thermostat out so he went into the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.069 
thermostat out so he went into the
thermostat<00:01:29.130> housing<00:01:29.790> pulled<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> thermostat

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
thermostat housing pulled the thermostat

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.810 
thermostat housing pulled the thermostat
out<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.380> started<00:01:31.590> driving<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.979> car<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.549> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
out and started driving the car and that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.940 
out and started driving the car and that
kind<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.509> solved<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> overheating<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.710> mean<00:01:34.860> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
kind of solved the overheating I mean it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.560 
kind of solved the overheating I mean it
was<00:01:35.070> still<00:01:35.430> running<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.909> high<00:01:36.090> side<00:01:36.390> of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
was still running on the high side of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.240 
was still running on the high side of
temperature<00:01:36.930> but<00:01:37.560> he's<00:01:37.710> actually<00:01:37.920> been

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
temperature but he's actually been

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.280 
temperature but he's actually been
driving<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.000> car<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.570> last<00:01:39.780> month<00:01:40.049> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
driving this car for the last month and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.649 
driving this car for the last month and
he's<00:01:40.770> he<00:01:41.189> says<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> best

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
he's he says this is one of the best

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.139 
he's he says this is one of the best
running<00:01:43.020> turbo<00:01:43.979> diesel<00:01:44.310> engines<00:01:44.640> he's<00:01:44.970> ever

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
running turbo diesel engines he's ever

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.789 
running turbo diesel engines he's ever
been<00:01:45.360> around<00:01:45.630> he's<00:01:45.990> had<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> few<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.680> these

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
been around he's had a few of these

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.720 
of a diagnostic and teardown procedure
and<00:03:51.810> then<00:03:52.220> looking<00:03:53.220> at<00:03:53.370> some<00:03:53.579> of<00:03:53.669> the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
and then looking at some of the

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.670 
and then looking at some of the
challenges<00:03:53.940> you'll<00:03:54.599> have<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.930> take<00:03:55.139> on<00:03:55.349> if

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
challenges you'll have to take on if

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.009 
challenges you'll have to take on if
you're<00:03:56.220> going<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.519> try<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:56.819> to<00:03:57.599> do<00:03:57.840> this

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
you're going to try to to do this

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.330 
you're going to try to to do this
yourself<00:03:58.409> so<00:03:58.739> when<00:03:59.430> this<00:03:59.730> video<00:04:00.209> workshop<00:04:00.510> is

to where you can go to watch this
multi-part<00:04:18.570> series<00:04:19.130> there's<00:04:20.130> one<00:04:20.400> thing<00:04:20.549> I

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
multi-part series there's one thing I

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.339 
multi-part series there's one thing I
forgot<00:04:20.699> to<00:04:21.000> mention<00:04:21.299> that<00:04:21.659> the<00:04:21.810> owner<00:04:22.019> did

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
forgot to mention that the owner did

forgot to mention that the owner did
have<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.740> do<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.950> keep<00:04:23.099> driving<00:04:23.460> this<00:04:23.669> car<00:04:23.880> now

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
have to do to keep driving this car now

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.390 
have to do to keep driving this car now
you<00:04:24.719> won't<00:04:25.200> be<00:04:25.349> able<00:04:25.469> to<00:04:25.560> do<00:04:25.740> this<00:04:25.950> with<00:04:26.190> all

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
you won't be able to do this with all

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.080 
you won't be able to do this with all
cars

it<00:04:27.150> developed<00:04:27.570> this<00:04:27.660> kind<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.050> problem

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
it developed this kind of a problem

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.290 
it developed this kind of a problem
because<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:29.070> all<00:04:29.190> depends<00:04:29.490> on<00:04:29.610> how<00:04:29.820> big<00:04:30.270> the

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
because it all depends on how big the

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.050 
because it all depends on how big the
leak<00:04:30.630> is<00:04:30.870> if<00:04:31.380> you<00:04:31.590> have<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.830> big<00:04:32.340> head<00:04:32.580> gasket

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
leak is if you have a big head gasket

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.820 
leak is if you have a big head gasket
leak<00:04:33.180> or<00:04:33.389> you<00:04:33.510> have<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.660> large<00:04:34.169> crack<00:04:34.560> in<00:04:34.740> the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
leak or you have a large crack in the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.460 
leak or you have a large crack in the
Sun<00:04:35.040> right<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.970> high<00:04:36.300> compression<00:04:37.260> of<00:04:37.380> a

desolation<00:04:37.979> will<00:04:38.280> force<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:39.030> much<00:04:39.210> pressure

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
desolation will force so much pressure

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.659 
desolation will force so much pressure
into<00:04:39.900> your<00:04:40.050> cooling<00:04:40.350> system<00:04:40.400> that's<00:04:41.400> going<00:04:41.610> to

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
into your cooling system that's going to

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.719 
into your cooling system that's going to
start<00:04:42.000> blowing<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.690> cap<00:04:43.130> so<00:04:44.130> you'll<00:04:44.340> build<00:04:44.610> up

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
start blowing the cap so you'll build up

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.230 
start blowing the cap so you'll build up
a<00:04:44.880> lot<00:04:45.030> of<00:04:45.150> pressure<00:04:45.389> but<00:04:45.690> for<00:04:46.500> some<00:04:46.710> reason<00:04:47.240> he

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
a lot of pressure but for some reason he

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.120 
a lot of pressure but for some reason he
was<00:04:48.270> able<00:04:48.750> to<00:04:48.780> just<00:04:49.080> come<00:04:49.320> in<00:04:49.350> here<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:49.710> drill

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
was able to just come in here and drill

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.590 
was able to just come in here and drill
a<00:04:50.160> very<00:04:51.030> very<00:04:51.600> small<00:04:52.160> little<00:04:53.160> hole<00:04:53.430> in<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:54.330> top

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
a very very small little hole in the top

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.719 
a very very small little hole in the top
of<00:04:54.780> this<00:04:54.900> coolant<00:04:55.320> reservoir<00:04:55.590> tank<00:04:56.130> that<00:04:56.430> just

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
of this coolant reservoir tank that just

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.939 
of this coolant reservoir tank that just
allowed<00:04:57.090> enough<00:04:57.600> of<00:04:57.780> that<00:04:57.960> excess<00:04:58.650> pressure

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
allowed enough of that excess pressure

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.790 
allowed enough of that excess pressure
to<00:04:59.340> escape<00:04:59.610> without<00:05:00.600> losing<00:05:01.500> a<00:05:01.590> lot<00:05:01.770> of

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
to escape without losing a lot of

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.969 
to escape without losing a lot of

you how we're going to hook up a tester
to<00:05:17.130> test<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.700> pressure<00:05:18.000> inside<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:18.780> cooling

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
to test the pressure inside the cooling

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.250 
to test the pressure inside the cooling
system<00:05:19.620> to<00:05:20.039> see<00:05:20.340> how<00:05:20.729> much<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:21.330> how<00:05:21.389> fast<00:05:21.870> it

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
system to see how much and how fast it

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:32.660 
system to see how much and how fast it
leaks<00:05:22.500> down
