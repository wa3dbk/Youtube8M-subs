00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
to go a to a 72 d and then back to a so

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.010 
to go a to a 72 d and then back to a so
it's<00:01:22.049> going<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.290> go<00:01:22.790> like<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.359> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
it's going to go like this and the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.539 
it's going to go like this and the
rhythm<00:01:25.170> we're<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.619> use<00:01:25.829> is<00:01:26.039> all<00:01:26.280> down

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
rhythm we're going to use is all down

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.120 
rhythm we're going to use is all down
strums<00:01:26.969> it's<00:01:27.149> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.329> be<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.289> two<00:01:28.859> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
strums it's going to be one and two and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.940 
strums it's going to be one and two and
three<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.759> four<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:31.259> two<00:01:32.149> three<00:01:33.149> four<00:01:33.990> if

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
three and four and one two three four if

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.859 
three and four and one two three four if
that's<00:01:35.249> too<00:01:35.880> much<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> do<00:01:36.659> right<00:01:36.689> now

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
that's too much for you to do right now

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.630 
that's too much for you to do right now
if<00:01:37.109> you're<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.409> really<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:38.009> started<00:01:38.520> you

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
if you're just really just started you

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.130 
if you're just really just started you
can<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.999> use<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.689> down<00:01:39.899> strums<00:01:40.319> you<00:01:40.469> can<00:01:40.590> go

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
can just use for down strums you can go

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.929 
can just use for down strums you can go
three<00:01:43.140> more<00:01:43.979> then<00:01:44.340> switch

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.389 

so<00:01:49.939> you<00:01:50.000> can<00:01:50.149> do<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.479> if<00:01:50.659> that's<00:01:50.869> if<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.439> the

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
so you can do that if that's if the the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.490 
so you can do that if that's if the the
H<00:01:52.520> strums<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:53.090> too<00:01:53.509> much<00:01:53.659> for<00:01:53.930> you<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.320> what
