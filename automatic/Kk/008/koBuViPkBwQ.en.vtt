vanilla cookies and cream this one is I
was<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.600> wanting<00:00:45.930> something<00:00:46.110> different<00:00:46.500> um

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
was just wanting something different um

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.459 
was just wanting something different um
so<00:00:47.430> they<00:00:47.640> come<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.090> vanilla<00:00:48.809> cake<00:00:49.079> chocolate

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469

cake peanut butter cookie and banana I

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.600 
cake peanut butter cookie and banana I
think<00:00:52.410> there<00:00:52.500> might<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.680> strawberry<00:00:53.160> one<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
think there might be strawberry one and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.979 
think there might be strawberry one and
I<00:00:53.699> might<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:53.969> making<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.600> I'm<00:00:54.719> not<00:00:54.840> sure

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
I might be making that up I'm not sure

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.680 
I might be making that up I'm not sure
so<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.910> definitely<00:00:57.030> still<00:00:57.510> more

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
so this one is definitely still more

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.380 
so this one is definitely still more
creamy<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.050> feel<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.309> has<00:00:59.489> amazing

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
creamy I feel but this one has amazing

pretty<00:02:29.980> sure<00:02:30.099> i<00:02:30.299> would<00:02:31.299> have<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.480> check<00:02:31.660> again

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
pretty sure i would have to check again

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.740 
pretty sure i would have to check again
um<00:02:32.129> so<00:02:33.129> if<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.519> were<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.730> guys<00:02:33.849> I<00:02:34.299> would<00:02:34.599> just

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
um so if I were you guys I would just

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.850 
um so if I were you guys I would just
find<00:02:34.870> something<00:02:35.140> that's<00:02:35.349> equivalent<00:02:35.590> to

those macros um so you know one rice

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.059 
those macros um so you know one rice
cake<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.459> seven<00:02:39.790> grams<00:02:40.060> of<00:02:40.650> carbs<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:41.799> maybe

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
cake is seven grams of carbs so maybe

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.569 
cake is seven grams of carbs so maybe
you'd<00:02:42.250> like<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.430> plain<00:02:42.819> rice<00:02:43.000> cakes<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.540> then
