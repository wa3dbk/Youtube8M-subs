00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the wind with it so we designed it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.780 
the wind with it so we designed it
that's<00:01:21.509> what<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.020> design<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:23.280> hey

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
that's what the design was for but hey

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.770 
that's what the design was for but hey
we<00:01:23.880> went<00:01:24.000> through<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> couple<00:01:24.210> different

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
retooling stages and then getting the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.840 
retooling stages and then getting the
plastics<00:01:28.229> right<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:29.040> weights<00:01:29.250> right<00:01:29.400> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
plastics right the weights right and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.580 
plastics right the weights right and
having<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.240> distil<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.780> durable<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.350> fly<00:01:31.530> the

way<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:31.890> wanted<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:33.150> took<00:01:33.360> some<00:01:33.509> time<00:01:33.540> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
way we wanted to it took some time to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.800 
way we wanted to it took some time to
perfect<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.009> some<00:01:35.850> people<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.420> well<00:01:36.659> you

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.109 
we've kinda got it where we wanted to be
that<00:01:55.259> was<00:01:55.409> maybe<00:01:56.009> about<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.610> month<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.090> half

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
that was maybe about a month and a half

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.139 
that was maybe about a month and a half
ago<00:01:57.450> we<00:01:58.170> shot<00:01:58.469> two<00:01:58.590> prototypes<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.460> went<00:02:00.060> out

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
ago we shot two prototypes I went out

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.819 
ago we shot two prototypes I went out
and<00:02:00.270> tested<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.840> had<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> few<00:02:01.259> other<00:02:01.409> guys<00:02:01.590> who

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
and tested it I had a few other guys who

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.819 
and tested it I had a few other guys who
a<00:02:01.860> big<00:02:02.100> arms<00:02:02.399> tested<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:03.000> me<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.409> once<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.619> knew

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
a big arms tested for me and once I knew

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.649 
a big arms tested for me and once I knew
that<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.189> was<00:02:05.430> not<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.790> flip<00:02:06.060> over<00:02:06.299> in

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
that this was not going to flip over in

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.169 
that this was not going to flip over in
some<00:02:07.320> decent<00:02:07.860> headwinds<00:02:08.520> that's<00:02:08.910> when<00:02:09.119> I

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
some decent headwinds that's when I

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.479 
some decent headwinds that's when I
thought<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.289> ready<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.560> go<00:02:10.739> now<00:02:10.890> all

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
thought that this is ready to go now all

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.430 
thought that this is ready to go now all
right<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.700> what's<00:02:12.090> kind<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.450> maybe<00:02:12.989> surprising

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
right so what's kind of maybe surprising

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.350 
right so what's kind of maybe surprising
to<00:02:13.709> people<00:02:13.739> out<00:02:14.099> there<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.790> not<00:02:15.000> necessarily

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
to people out there it's not necessarily

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.059 
to people out there it's not necessarily
the<00:02:15.450> fastest<00:02:16.020> is<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.379> you<00:02:16.470> guys<00:02:16.620> make<00:02:16.860> you

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
the fastest is that you guys make you

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.380 
the fastest is that you guys make you
guys<00:02:17.160> have<00:02:17.310> come<00:02:17.489> out<00:02:17.580> with<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.700> rampage<00:02:18.180> and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
guys have come out with a rampage and

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.640 
guys have come out with a rampage and
you've<00:02:18.480> come<00:02:18.629> out<00:02:18.780> with<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.989> cannon

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
you've come out with the cannon

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.399 
you've come out with the cannon
this<00:02:19.890> isn't<00:02:20.280> faster<00:02:21.000> than<00:02:21.150> those<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.569> it<00:02:21.750> it's

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
this isn't faster than those is it it's

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.080 
this isn't faster than those is it it's
a<00:02:22.439> little<00:02:22.500> bit<00:02:22.709> slower<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.370> rim<00:02:23.549> is<00:02:23.700> not<00:02:23.730> as

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
a little bit slower the rim is not as

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.690 
a little bit slower the rim is not as
wide<00:02:24.560> still<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.590> fast<00:02:25.890> driver<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.370> got<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.519> lot<00:02:26.670> of

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
wide still a fast driver I got a lot of

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.670 
wide still a fast driver I got a lot of
glide<00:02:26.970> but<00:02:27.659> this<00:02:27.989> is<00:02:28.140> something<00:02:28.349> that<00:02:28.500> was

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
glide but this is something that was

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.470 
glide but this is something that was
missing<00:02:28.829> that<00:02:29.159> of<00:02:29.280> our<00:02:29.430> out<00:02:29.939> of<00:02:30.000> our<00:02:30.239> lineup

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
missing that of our out of our lineup

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.050 
missing that of our out of our lineup
and<00:02:30.900> overstable<00:02:31.349> still<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.250> fast<00:02:32.519> driver<00:02:32.790> but<00:02:33.030> a

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
and overstable still a fast driver but a

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.580 
and overstable still a fast driver but a
lot<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.329> people<00:02:33.540> can't<00:02:33.780> get<00:02:33.900> there<00:02:34.049> their

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
lot of people can't get there their

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.140 
lot of people can't get there their
hands<00:02:34.829> wrapped<00:02:35.099> around<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.430> lip<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.790> cannon

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
hands wrapped around the lip of a cannon

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.449 
hands wrapped around the lip of a cannon
or<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.299> rampage<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.829> little<00:02:38.069> bit<00:02:38.189> smaller

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
or a rampage so the little bit smaller

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.830 
or a rampage so the little bit smaller
rim<00:02:38.700> allows<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.359> a<00:02:39.390> little<00:02:39.599> bit<00:02:39.689> more

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
rim allows that a little bit more

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.839 
rim allows that a little bit more
comfort<00:02:40.319> for<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.890> smaller<00:02:41.129> hands<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.609> grip

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
comfort for the smaller hands to grip

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.539 
comfort for the smaller hands to grip
and<00:02:42.140> still<00:02:43.140> maintain<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> lot<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.859> distance<00:02:44.280> and

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
and still maintain a lot of distance and

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.990 
and still maintain a lot of distance and
stability<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.799> it<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:47.220> people<00:02:47.909> are

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
stability and this is it so people are

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.729 
stability and this is it so people are
going<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.209> be<00:02:48.299> watching<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.780> rip<00:02:49.109> this<00:02:49.319> from<00:02:49.650> a

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
going to be watching you rip this from a

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.839 
going to be watching you rip this from a
couple<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:50.069> different<00:02:50.340> angles<00:02:50.430> you're<00:02:50.730> going

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
couple of different angles you're going

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.000 
couple of different angles you're going
to<00:02:50.909> see<00:02:51.060> how<00:02:51.180> they<00:02:51.329> fly<00:02:51.569> talk<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> little<00:02:52.829> bit

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
to see how they fly talk a little bit

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.949 
to see how they fly talk a little bit
about<00:02:53.040> what<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.909> want<00:02:54.209> out<00:02:54.389> of<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.599> flight

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
about what you want out of that flight

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.240 
about what you want out of that flight
when<00:02:55.230> you're<00:02:55.379> throwing<00:02:55.620> one<00:02:55.859> of<00:02:55.889> these<00:02:56.069> and

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
when you're throwing one of these and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.619 
when you're throwing one of these and
what<00:02:56.340> kind<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.549> situations<00:02:57.090> where<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.329> will

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
what kind of situations where you will

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.530 
what kind of situations where you will
you<00:02:57.750> use<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.730> mainly<00:02:59.730> headwinds<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.420> know

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
you use it in mainly headwinds you know

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.690 
you use it in mainly headwinds you know
and<00:03:00.810> it's<00:03:01.650> still<00:03:01.859> trying<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.129> maintain<00:03:02.250> some

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
and it's still trying to maintain some

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.479 
and it's still trying to maintain some
distance<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:04.079> disc<00:03:04.319> is<00:03:04.470> really<00:03:04.739> reliable<00:03:05.280> I

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
distance the disc is really reliable I

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.129 
distance the disc is really reliable I
can<00:03:05.700> torque<00:03:05.970> on<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.359> could<00:03:06.420> turn<00:03:06.689> it<00:03:06.750> over<00:03:06.989> I

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
can torque on it I could turn it over I

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.289 
can torque on it I could turn it over I
know<00:03:07.319> it's<00:03:07.620> gonna<00:03:07.709> fight<00:03:08.010> back<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.579> basically

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
know it's gonna fight back and basically

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.149 
know it's gonna fight back and basically
that's<00:03:09.510> what<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.319> look<00:03:10.439> for<00:03:10.650> in<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.799> disc<00:03:11.040> you

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
that's what you look for in a disc you

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.679 
that's what you look for in a disc you
want<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:11.489> able<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:11.700> trust<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.120> disc<00:03:12.480> to

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
want to be able to trust that disc to

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.080 
want to be able to trust that disc to
fight<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.230> winds<00:03:13.530> or<00:03:13.650> or<00:03:13.980> just<00:03:14.189> any<00:03:14.519> situation

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
fight the winds or or just any situation

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.640 
fight the winds or or just any situation
you<00:03:15.180> want<00:03:15.359> that<00:03:15.540> disc<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.840> be<00:03:15.930> able<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.139> turn

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
you want that disc to be able to turn

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.190 
you want that disc to be able to turn
over<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.250> then<00:03:17.519> fight<00:03:17.790> back<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.389> that<00:03:18.989> was<00:03:19.109> the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
over and then fight back so that was the

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.330 
over and then fight back so that was the
main<00:03:19.349> thing<00:03:19.379> we<00:03:19.650> were<00:03:19.739> going<00:03:19.950> for<00:03:20.129> and<00:03:20.280> we

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
main thing we were going for and we

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.819 
main thing we were going for and we
