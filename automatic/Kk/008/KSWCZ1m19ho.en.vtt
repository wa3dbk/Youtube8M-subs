00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.429
 Welcome to the next unboxing of the 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:12.990
 gigabyte geforce gtx 680 overclocked 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:20.820
 edition with the grund force 3 cooler 2 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:24.119
 gb gddr5 ram directx 11 so far 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:30.689
 google has displayport hdmi the family 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:36.260
 all sorts of things nice and the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:42.930
 camper k 104 gpu this mega fast the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:45.829
 currently at about 430 150 euro absolutely 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:51.649
 enthusiastically fired at a low price 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.460
 419 really cheap about 419 euro 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.100
 including have at this trick 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.100
 academics go to the shit but 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.260
 Suitable for the future as ok, maybe even 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.619
 dedicate 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.619
 6 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:18.840
 1 gigabyte traffic sports quick memorial 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.070
 to put 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:35.050
 gigabyte traffic jam gaming drivers very much 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:38.130
 nice to take the stream had two 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.180
 6 pin connector and power 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.580
 gigabyte has decided to 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.390
 once set and once eight 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.850
 add the 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.190
 it seems like a political thing 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.860
 all say this will make mega chaos 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.440
 the license is in the fight and has more 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.420
 What's more interesting ? 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.190
 it's just shit 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.740
 okay, then it has a higher 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.750
 power consumption what does it mean? 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.910
 turbodiesel side up a bike ride 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.729
 can clock higher because of the performance 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.070
 The turbo will be active if the card is still 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.760
 reserves in performance so if their 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.530
 tdp her watt attributed to her 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.920
 pay has not reached the pats 100 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.350
 95 watts and the European one has 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.209
 little more I do not know how much 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.200
 Let's say 210 if the card is at 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.209
 200 hangs and it will theoretically still 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.380
 what in it overclocks itself up 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.070
 then 210 watt reached and that it 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.459
 better and better 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.910
 deliver march 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.910
 the card allows 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:16.760
 Kepler sees Gallois is in fund 3 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.370
 kg has pending special design with 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.379
 the heatpipes and so on very much cooled 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.599
 good and should also be relatively quiet 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.470
 his 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:32.180
 in the pixi world is not official 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:34.040
 in fact the same same points 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.769
 loud in them 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.950
 the quiet then actually heats at the 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:45.590
 get volume like the absolute top 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:50.629
 model diaz sd 2 ct scanner ok twice 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.549
 dvi displayport and hdmi huge 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.560
 heatsink as pet system is in itself 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:04:00.859
 also very difficult 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:06.819
 so far extra start and 03 fans and 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:06.819
 the power connection is exactly something 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:20.489
 nice device too 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:20.489
 who comes in the box 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.790
 See you then
