non-invasive way it's it's very clear
with<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> smiles<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:50.040> they<00:01:50.430> come<00:01:50.640> back<00:01:50.820> with

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
how much better it makes them feel on

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.280 
how much better it makes them feel on
the<00:01:52.710> inside<00:01:53.180> it's<00:01:54.180> really<00:01:54.479> gratifying<00:01:54.689> when<00:01:55.229> a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
the inside it's really gratifying when a

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.859 
the inside it's really gratifying when a
patient<00:01:55.740> comes<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.729> they've<00:01:57.390> been<00:01:57.630> so

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
patient comes in and they've been so

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.109 
patient comes in and they've been so
worried<00:01:58.290> about<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.590> particular<00:01:58.890> problem<00:01:59.610> and

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
worried about a particular problem and

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.690 
worried about a particular problem and
I'm<00:02:00.930> able<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.290> look<00:02:01.469> at<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.890> say<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.579> know

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
I'm able to look at it and say you know

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.340 
I'm able to look at it and say you know
what<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.329> fix<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.930> one<00:02:04.200> or<00:02:04.320> two

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
what we can fix that in one or two

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.219 
what we can fix that in one or two
treatments<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.310> yes<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:06.329> really<00:02:06.630> tell<00:02:07.049> you

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
treatments and yes I can really tell you

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.800 
treatments and yes I can really tell you
this<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.649> going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.099> work<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:09.390> see<00:02:09.629> the

this is going to work and to see the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.760 
this is going to work and to see the
