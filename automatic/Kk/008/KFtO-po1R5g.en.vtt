two additional screws one here and one
here<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:11.130> then<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.610> can<00:02:11.790> lift<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.180> up<00:02:12.470> then

these pins you see out this part of the
speaker<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:51.330> problem<00:02:51.750> will<00:02:51.959> be<00:02:51.989> this<00:02:52.590> circle

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
speaker the problem will be this circle

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:01.790 
speaker the problem will be this circle
metallic<00:02:58.819> because<00:02:59.819> it<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.410> very<00:03:01.410> very

see<00:03:11.940> here<00:03:13.190> normally<00:03:14.190> these<00:03:14.720> pins<00:03:15.720> are

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
see here normally these pins are

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.559 
see here normally these pins are
supposed<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.830> be<00:03:16.980> like<00:03:17.250> that

it on the Philips screwdriver and

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.410 
it on the Philips screwdriver and
managed<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:05.980> force<00:04:06.310> a<00:04:06.459> little<00:04:06.700> bit<00:04:06.849> of<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.120> then

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
managed to force a little bit of it then

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.380 
managed to force a little bit of it then
it<00:04:07.569> will<00:04:07.750> be<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.959> bit<00:04:08.200> larger<00:04:08.739> so<00:04:08.769> you<00:04:09.010> can<00:04:09.390> put

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
it will be a bit larger so you can put

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.660 
it will be a bit larger so you can put
it<00:04:10.540> in<00:04:10.690> place<00:04:11.790> easier<00:04:13.349> one<00:04:14.349> or<00:04:14.590> two<00:04:15.160> are<00:04:15.370> really

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
it in place easier one or two are really

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.390 
it in place easier one or two are really
enough<00:04:16.150> to<00:04:16.359> hold<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.840> speaker<00:04:17.139> in<00:04:17.440> place<00:04:17.769> and

enough to hold the speaker in place and

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.849 
enough to hold the speaker in place and
then<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.359> just<00:04:19.630> have<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:19.989> reassemble<00:04:20.530> the
