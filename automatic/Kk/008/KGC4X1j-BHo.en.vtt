then there is a Bordeaux like a dark red

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.809 
then there is a Bordeaux like a dark red
it's<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:07.259> not<00:02:07.560> picking<00:02:07.920> up<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.250> great<00:02:08.580> on

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
it's it's not picking up that great on

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.170 
it's it's not picking up that great on
on<00:02:09.239> camera<00:02:09.690> because<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.099> bit<00:02:11.250> darker
