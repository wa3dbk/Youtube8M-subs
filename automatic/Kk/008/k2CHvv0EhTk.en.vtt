00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.380
 me 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:36.370
 A closed course by say Honda of action sentient beings once that has been done in Hitachinaka City, Ibaraki Prefecture 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.710
 Through 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.650
 A variety of bikes, including new model is now in that stretch ride I have message 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.829
 Is the new size pc 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:51.780
 125 Are You a referee 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:56.820
 It is in Chapter 1 of quite powerful as a 125 pushing 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.719
 It is an impression that it should be included. There is no big difference with the conventional model in this area. 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.010
 But 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:06.020
 Is around the height of his by a sense of stability when you are that the wheel 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:11.359
 I think that it is an excellent feature of pcx 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.880
 She can also how about the other traffic lead of the city by the case in pretty good pace 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:19.700
 Stable handling to say that 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:24.350
 And it can be run safely without being born in traffic such as powerful engine noise 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.010
 I think that is a good part of this new pcx 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.430
 When you open the throttle 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:34.380
 It is very smooth to Tteyuu acceleration of this new pcx 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:39.840
 Of course, with a displacement of 125 cc, the power does not rise rapidly. 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:45.450
 But I think it is toxic even if you deepen this cbt tuning 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.030
 It is said that it accelerates quite smoothly without feeling the lack of power 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.420
 It is feeling 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.420
 Yeah yeah 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.909
 I want to go put the Dechotto speed of Ide outer circumference road 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.280
 It is 60 kilometers there now 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:08.329
 It's about 10 kilometers here now , but it 's really quick to say acceleration 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.329
 I'm accelerating in a while so I can't think it's a hope to enter 125 promotion 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:18.069
 If the meeting Tokudo is 90 km 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.090
 It goes into a long straight line, but right now the hand of the black watch is just 100 kg 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.040
 About to hang 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:28.410
 It is almost open because it is about the speed of the table tennis chuck, but around here 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:33.780
 In the feeling that it will accelerate without much trouble so much 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.430
 Whether not much faster as a scooter that was enigmatic this stop ex 120 star recording 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.590
 think 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:44.080
 a And you know , even if you enter the suburbs of this area in this state, the car body is also fine 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.190
 It is no anxiety at all if you are firm 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:52.080
 Even with 125 cc pcx 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:57.270
 Put out the rate of about this but I feel that the meter polarimetric reading of tired really guardian 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:00.150
 If you think that you are arrested and the handling is extremely stable, consider the emissions class. 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:05.790
 I think it's quite amazing 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.210
 Than with regard to the 125 cc of the split without really anxiety body would riding in West Lake 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.560
 How long it can be done 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.570
 It feels like I'm a little nervous about it and I loose my own slip 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.970
 Well this pcx 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.900
 A talented and stable person 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:26.780
 It feels like there is nothing to be able to have the first heat 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:28.069
 Conventional model a Well because I am quite a previous story, I am also vague memory 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.780
 But also 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.189
 Well, this is to come from the car or from the undercarriage I'm a little certain 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.829
 Though not 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:41.640
 Compared with the conventional model, it is better to feel the firmness or society of the underbody well 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:46.920
 I feel like I am 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.350
 I felt that the Sendai hotel conventional model was quite solid and it was a taste beyond class. 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:54.090
 But it is about more than that 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:56.700
 The society and footsteps of this new pcx are solid 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:02.160
 I also listen to the brakes by a 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.060
 I think that it is a brake that has quite good touch, is easy to handle , and has practical braking power 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.540
 I will 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.890
 Although the nail design department which was data was changed 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:15.450
 It is body weight is also easy to see in the drenched such a daytime date from name 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:18.620
 Considerably cheap if perhaps it is nighttime eyes in this meter but I can not now night people 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.620
 I think that I think we 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:27.190
 Though it is the model being noticed that doubles with this which came back to the departure point 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:32.170
 Even though I was able to ride to finally and new pcx 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:36.760
 Yes, I could not feel the difference that was Chiba 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.390
 Power So, and things like that the car is firm well overall has improved 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.830
 Feel 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.830
 I feel that this new pcx is well done compared to the conventional model 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.130
 tar 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.360
 yeah yeah 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.810
 me 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.550
 me 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.270
 car 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.270
 ana 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.300
 car
