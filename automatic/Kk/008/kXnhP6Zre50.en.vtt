00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 go hi everyone knows crawler 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:11.160
 18 and we meet again today for the 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:13.400
 fifty-eighth part of our 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.599
 adventure on pokemon platinum version 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.289
 yeah I think that's it I think 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.289
 it's 58 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:28.010
 I'm wrong maybe but it's good 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:35.579
 it's been a long time since I shot a 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.590
 episode but it's a long time 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.020
 that I look over the numbers no I 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.670
 am more sure ok he makes us a little 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.210
 care so we can not heal that it's 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.640
 less cool since if we bump up heal there 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:56.129
 it's going to be very hot 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:59.550
 so here we have more milk gun ad 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:05.610
 enough it's not cool that more adults 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:09.750
 cannon then spacey rif ah yeah that makes 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:13.470
 badly it hurts so these powers without 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.740
 spacious rist 1 it would be cool that only 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.030
 perfect paralyzes as he perfect and one 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.030
 has a crazy chance 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.510
 ok are we trying 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.450
 the third stroke of juice but when we 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:46.440
 is dead we will not be able 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.440
 So what can we do? 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.790
 we're going to make Flemish flames they resist 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:58.990
 katia times no chance to continue 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:02.280
 it can be pretty much in flames yeah 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.930
 yeah we have no chance to kill him there 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.429
 me and that can do even more 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:14.250
 on the other hand if we feast and safe and strong 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.250
 this very cool soap opera 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:25.890
 ouf or 8 pv 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.890
 we still have a pv 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:40.329
 ok we'll stop there we go over the attacked 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:45.469
 that's pretty much a dialect case 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:52.700
 I hope we'll be lucky 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:56.329
 would be cool if we have so many chances 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.780
 that for dialga frankly it's a 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.780
 crazy thing 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:11.150
 no no no no 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:12.980
 twice after that but there I you 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.709
 old swear no action reminded I 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:21.370
 nothing at all ah yeah what's this 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.370
 crazy luck 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:35.349
 Well, that's it's done it's done 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:35.349
 had both 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.390
 I do not know if we can fly from here 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.950
 we can not go well we'll have to 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.530
 we're going to leave Mount Horny not that 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.960
 it makes a three-minute video 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.500
 all the same because for the moment 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.110
 this is the case for yuko and co him so he 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.580
 is rare if you fall on it I you 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.180
 advise to capture him but here we go 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.180
 not take it 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.390
 knowing that it will serve no purpose for the 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.390
 after 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.860
 ah yeah chances of dengue there a chance 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.860
 crazy 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:33.740
 yeah the two influenza dealers who 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:40.460

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:45.790
 the camera there sorry good pokemon 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:49.610
 wild it's a bit a little boring has it 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:55.790
 strongly that we leave the cave and we 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:57.460
 will fly we will fly to frima stung in 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.690

 then there again in wild pokemon 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.580
 in the next episode I think we 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:11.480
 did not think about it we'll do that 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:15.550
 rare catch and guillas so yeah for 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.550
 to capture it I will have to transfer 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:26.720
 but finally governed regis roques and rÃ©gis 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.730
 style of my diamond version so I 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:35.450
 would finally do to not lose too much 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:37.840
 time then we capture arias in the 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.840
