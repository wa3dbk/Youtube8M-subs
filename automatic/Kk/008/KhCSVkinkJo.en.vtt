00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello everyone my name is Stas and now 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.940
 let's correctly set up our background so 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.010
 the first thing I would like to mention is you 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.860
 lowering the curtain of notifications you allow 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.839
 weather access but then we are here on under 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.210
 notice center will go and so 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.039
 go to the bluetooth settings you 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.350
 turned it off turn on already naturally 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.840
 at your request what is it for in 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.090
 principle for airdrop and i choose 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.160
 initially for all fell me well 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.500
 fully worked gave cellular data 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.300
 you can turn on l i either you can 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.070
 turn it off data roaming should be 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.770
 you in any case included if you 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.059
 want to work with the Internet further 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.950
 let's see this will you 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.480
 enjoy freestyle or sounds 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.309
 all other applications that 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.020
 little by little will be set to go out 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.940
 from us network tumbler can here 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.920
 turn off or turn on naturally 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.780
 go to your discretion 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.760
 notice here you are setting up either 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.160
 manually or in time for me personally 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.750
 time is much more convenient then how will 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.039
 look like notifications like that 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.050
 concerns messages 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.460
 and here there is a repeat warning then 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.199
 there is if you don't even once 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.710
 read the message but the pain is repeated 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.390
 once two three 4 5 10 times I personally 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.610
 exposing never because she is me 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.229
 straining and all the points here you can 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.030
 view those you'll either 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.369
 will not use just plain 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.290
 turn them off for example by sounds and i 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.700
 I use the game but I'm in the center 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.330
 I don't use it, so I use it. 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.000
 turn off 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.450
 so go back further go a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.130
 in the main we further choose siri and I will give you 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.439
 I recommend to enable it in order 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.090
 you then worked first from Syria 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.009
 these are commands that you can look at 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.390
 our channel already has a video as well as 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.950
 dictation to work for you 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.900
 to Werner a little later 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.420
 universal access you choose here 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.579
 reduction of movement it will you so 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.520
 here work animation or not according to your 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.500
 If desired, this setting is natural 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.360
 shortens the time you work here on your 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.220
 iphone if it is turned on 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.990
 include tags wish 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.930
 and of course flash if you will 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.030
 call the bottom will be a combination 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.590
 keys this if you press three times 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.720
 button that will be displayed 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.520
 grayscale 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.750
 color inversion or magnification here you are 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.530
 Of course you can choose your own 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.810
 to wish 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.730
 further very important point of this statistics 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.160
 choose charge percentage naturally 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.110
 your iphone in content update you 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.970
 can either you completely turn off either 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.610
 leave it on separately 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.410
 turn off some programs this in the background 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.760
 these applications will naturally 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.190
 updated time too 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.110
 naturally affects your iphone date 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.390
 and the time you choose the time zone either 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.280
 automatically or if you already live in 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.990
 principle in one city ​​do not travel 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.940
 i recommend turning off in order to 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.690
 iphone without wasting time looking 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.970
 Timezone 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.709
 further the screen and you are here naturally 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.630
 choose the kind of thing we did when 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.610
 activation if you watched previous 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.500
 Movie can change further choose 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.570
 auto brightness either it will only be in 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.280
 manual mode then how many do you choose 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.260
 I personally use auto brightness 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.670
 and of course the size of the text I personally 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.340
 I use the most minimal 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.110
 choose wallpaper i think you too in 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.830
 further sound is natural 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.080
 exposes whether the vibration will work in 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.760
 in silent mode, personally, I turn off because 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.370
 that I don’t need it in principle 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.070
 of course the sounds of the keyboard keys sounds 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.910
 lock much more 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.340
 privacy you choose service 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.320
 Acacia affairs further system services often 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.670
 visited places and this item i 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.790
 recommend turning off in order to 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.680
 iphone did not follow 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.689
 your locations are what i have 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.280
 threw it naturally while that bugs 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:26.469
 operating system itself but in any 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.200
 If this switch is better off 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:31.930
 further item aytyuns here you turn off 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.489

 Downloading music program books is also 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.590
 all at your request, I personally turn off 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.720
 leaving only programs and updates 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.909
 going to the mail you will configure 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.819

 Further while lines it is 100 quantity 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.569
 lines of information that will 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.010
 show up with an incoming letter of course 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.389
 same signature you set up when you 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.819
