00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
okay guys there's a really quick video

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.159 
okay guys there's a really quick video
and<00:00:24.859> I'm<00:00:25.730> just<00:00:25.970> thrilled<00:00:26.210> on<00:00:28.509> 1855<00:00:29.509> lens<00:00:29.809> on

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
and I'm just thrilled on 1855 lens on

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.389 
and I'm just thrilled on 1855 lens on
the<00:00:30.529> Sony<00:00:31.059> I've<00:00:32.059> moved<00:00:32.949> from<00:00:33.949> the<00:00:34.100> center

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
the Sony I've moved from the center

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.750 
the Sony I've moved from the center
point<00:00:34.610> here<00:00:34.790> back<00:00:38.230> to<00:00:39.230> adjust<00:00:39.949> it<00:00:40.159> as<00:00:40.309> far<00:00:40.550> back

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
point here back to adjust it as far back

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.170 
point here back to adjust it as far back
as<00:00:40.820> it<00:00:41.059> will<00:00:41.180> possibly<00:00:41.659> go<00:00:43.870> obviously<00:00:44.870> it's<00:00:45.409> a

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
as it will possibly go obviously it's a

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.219 
as it will possibly go obviously it's a
wee<00:00:47.180> bit<00:00:47.589> on<00:00:48.589> the<00:00:48.739> heavy<00:00:48.920> side<00:00:49.809> so<00:00:50.809> we<00:00:51.019> may<00:00:51.199> have

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:51.229 
wee bit on the heavy side so we may have

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:54.700 
wee bit on the heavy side so we may have
to<00:00:51.680> counterbalance<00:00:52.430> some<00:00:53.300> weights<00:00:53.710> either

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
to counterbalance some weights either

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.259 
to counterbalance some weights either
here<00:00:56.109> on<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:58.640> back<00:00:58.850> I<00:00:59.230> would<00:01:00.230> say<00:01:01.269> possibly

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
here on the back I would say possibly

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.439 
here on the back I would say possibly
through<00:01:02.780> this<00:01:03.019> hole<00:01:03.289> here<00:01:04.239> there's<00:01:05.239> enough

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
through this hole here there's enough

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.700 
through this hole here there's enough
clearance<00:01:07.149> possibly<00:01:08.149> save<00:01:09.080> this<00:01:09.229> side<00:01:09.500> of<00:01:09.649> the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
clearance possibly save this side of the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.620 
clearance possibly save this side of the
camera<00:01:10.990> but<00:01:11.990> then<00:01:12.440> I<00:01:12.740> have<00:01:13.340> not<00:01:13.640> adjusted<00:01:13.970> the

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
camera but then I have not adjusted the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.510 
camera but then I have not adjusted the
seconds<00:01:15.140> or<00:01:15.320> anything<00:01:15.679> on<00:01:15.950> this<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:16.310> it's<00:01:16.429> a

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
seconds or anything on this so it's a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.060 
seconds or anything on this so it's a
still<00:01:16.729> say<00:01:16.970> app<00:01:17.090> for<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.479> other<00:01:17.830> ones<00:01:18.830> who

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
still say app for the other ones who

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.440 
still say app for the other ones who
will<00:01:19.360> try<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.539> plug<00:01:21.140> this<00:01:22.179> battery<00:01:23.179> and<00:01:23.210> it's

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
will try and plug this battery and it's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.570 
will try and plug this battery and it's
a<00:01:23.539> dodgy<00:01:23.899> battery<00:01:24.259> I've<00:01:24.380> got<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:24.860> there<00:01:25.280> we<00:01:25.399> go

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
a dodgy battery I've got so there we go

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.569 
a dodgy battery I've got so there we go
just<00:01:25.899> to<00:01:26.899> see<00:01:26.930> this<00:01:27.770> is<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.100> original

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
just to see this is the original

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.600 
just to see this is the original
settings<00:01:29.000> with<00:01:29.240> my<00:01:29.390> other<00:01:29.540> lanes<00:01:29.840> just<00:01:30.430> to<00:01:31.430> see

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
settings with my other lanes just to see

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.810 
settings with my other lanes just to see
what<00:01:31.759> we'll<00:01:31.880> do<00:01:35.110> as<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.259> can<00:01:36.409> see<00:01:36.619> it<00:01:37.369> has<00:01:37.579> got

what we'll do as you can see it has got

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.319 
what we'll do as you can see it has got
the<00:01:37.939> power<00:01:38.180> to<00:01:38.450> lift

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
the power to lift

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.499 
the power to lift
that's<00:01:41.329> default<00:01:41.780> Shane's<00:01:42.079> with<00:01:42.950> my<00:01:43.159> other

that's default Shane's with my other

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.350 
that's default Shane's with my other
smaller<00:01:44.509> lens<00:01:44.810> which<00:01:45.200> is<00:01:45.229> here<00:01:46.090> so<00:01:47.090> I've<00:01:47.180> not
