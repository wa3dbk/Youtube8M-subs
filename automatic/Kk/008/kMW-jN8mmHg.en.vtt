00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
I do have a lot of kind of fan who has

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.440 
I do have a lot of kind of fan who has
enough<00:03:50.250> speed<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.550> i<00:03:52.300> can<00:03:54.210> control<00:03:55.210> the

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
enough speed that i can control the

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.500 
enough speed that i can control the
speed<00:03:56.160> because<00:03:57.160> this<00:03:57.340> is<00:03:57.490> full<00:03:57.700> speed<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.270> I

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
speed because this is full speed and I

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.650 
speed because this is full speed and I
have<00:03:58.660> another<00:03:58.900> one<00:03:59.020> he<00:03:59.380> can<00:03:59.650> work<00:04:00.580> on<00:04:00.910> half<00:04:01.270> of

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
have another one he can work on half of

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.480 
have another one he can work on half of
the<00:04:02.160> speed

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
the speed

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.009 
the speed
now<00:04:04.420> this<00:04:04.660> is<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:04.840> little<00:04:05.230> bit<00:04:05.320> too<00:04:05.590> much

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.300 

we<00:04:09.469> can<00:04:09.650> slow<00:04:09.890> it<00:04:09.920> down<00:04:10.099> I<00:04:10.640> think<00:04:10.939> you<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:13.010> little

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
we can slow it down I think you a little

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.499 
we can slow it down I think you a little
experiment<00:04:13.700> right

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:16.509 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.420 

disconnect<00:04:17.509> the<00:04:17.840> fan<00:04:18.079> looking<00:04:18.979> what<00:04:19.160> look

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
disconnect the fan looking what look

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.850 
disconnect the fan looking what look
what<00:04:19.579> happens<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.320> think<00:04:21.320> he<00:04:21.610> will<00:04:22.610> go<00:04:22.759> to<00:04:22.789> smoke

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
what happens I think he will go to smoke

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.580 
what happens I think he will go to smoke
no<00:04:24.860> he<00:04:25.039> slows<00:04:25.310> down<00:04:26.380> yeah<00:04:28.960> now<00:04:29.960> we<00:04:30.020> have<00:04:30.259> smoke

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
no he slows down yeah now we have smoke

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:37.980 
no he slows down yeah now we have smoke
of<00:04:30.830> course<00:04:32.020> because<00:04:33.020> there<00:04:33.229> is<00:04:33.320> no<00:04:33.500> chimney

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.230 

and<00:04:38.990> we<00:04:39.110> start<00:04:39.500> again

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.100 

fully<00:04:45.240> automatically<00:04:46.280> very<00:04:47.280> good

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
fully automatically very good

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.369 
fully automatically very good
still<00:04:49.889> working<00:04:50.370> after<00:04:50.879> 20<00:04:51.419> minutes<00:04:51.720> on<00:04:51.960> one

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
still working after 20 minutes on one

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.040 
still working after 20 minutes on one
load<00:04:52.620> but<00:04:53.490> I<00:04:53.520> think<00:04:53.909> the<00:04:54.150> pellets<00:04:54.569> are<00:04:54.659> almost

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
load but I think the pellets are almost

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.559 
load but I think the pellets are almost
gone<00:04:55.379> I<00:04:55.849> smell<00:04:56.849> something<00:04:57.180> like<00:04:57.689> plastic<00:04:59.569> this

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
gone I smell something like plastic this

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.439 
gone I smell something like plastic this

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
can see the difference between here and

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.649 
can see the difference between here and
here<00:05:08.340> I<00:05:09.469> don't<00:05:10.469> know<00:05:10.620> if<00:05:10.770> you<00:05:10.889> can<00:05:11.009> see<00:05:11.310> it

here I don't know if you can see it

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:16.100 
here I don't know if you can see it
inside<00:05:13.849> on<00:05:14.849> the<00:05:15.000> left<00:05:15.240> and<00:05:15.419> on<00:05:15.509> the<00:05:15.539> right<00:05:15.689> is<00:05:16.080> a

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
inside on the left and on the right is a

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.390 
inside on the left and on the right is a
gap<00:05:17.419> because<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:18.689> the<00:05:19.050> inner<00:05:19.560> can<00:05:19.949> is<00:05:20.189> not

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
gap because the the inner can is not

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.149 
gap because the the inner can is not
fitting<00:05:20.909> perfectly<00:05:21.780> I<00:05:22.110> have<00:05:22.560> to<00:05:22.710> change<00:05:22.919> that

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
fitting perfectly I have to change that

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.659 
fitting perfectly I have to change that
so<00:05:24.030> that<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.360> air<00:05:24.509> is<00:05:24.780> going<00:05:25.229> through<00:05:25.669> the

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
so that the air is going through the

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.330 
so that the air is going through the
fire<00:05:26.940> now<00:05:27.690> it<00:05:27.840> goes<00:05:28.080> on<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:28.800> left<00:05:29.009> on<00:05:29.310> the

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
fire now it goes on the left on the

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.290 
fire now it goes on the left on the
right<00:05:30.150> a<00:05:30.210> little<00:05:30.539> bit<00:05:31.580> around<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:35.300> pellets

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
right a little bit around the pellets

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.290 
right a little bit around the pellets
are<00:05:36.360> almost<00:05:36.840> gone<00:05:37.580> now<00:05:38.580> I<00:05:38.610> try<00:05:38.940> to

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.290 

but<00:05:43.840> what<00:05:44.740> I<00:05:44.770> was<00:05:45.010> smelling<00:05:45.130> it<00:05:45.490> was<00:05:45.670> plastic

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
but what I was smelling it was plastic

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:56.420 
but what I was smelling it was plastic
it<00:05:46.480> that<00:05:46.960> solder<00:05:49.170> on<00:05:50.170> the<00:05:50.380> tin<00:05:50.590> catch<00:05:54.810> Philip<00:05:55.810> I

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
it that solder on the tin catch Philip I

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.970 
it that solder on the tin catch Philip I
have<00:05:57.430> to

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:09.480 

to<00:06:03.520> take<00:06:03.700> a<00:06:03.730> little<00:06:03.970> bit<00:06:04.150> more<00:06:07.590> after<00:06:08.590> I<00:06:09.190> did

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
to take a little bit more after I did

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.200 
to take a little bit more after I did
Philip<00:06:10.200> for<00:06:11.200> the<00:06:11.320> second<00:06:11.650> time<00:06:11.970> actually<00:06:12.970> he's

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
Philip for the second time actually he's

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.200 
Philip for the second time actually he's
now<00:06:13.450> burning<00:06:13.780> better<00:06:14.490> because<00:06:15.490> the<00:06:15.820> burning

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
now burning better because the burning

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.610 
now burning better because the burning
chamber<00:06:16.540> is<00:06:16.810> full<00:06:17.050> of<00:06:17.550> old<00:06:18.550> pellets<00:06:19.240> and<00:06:19.990> now<00:06:20.290> I

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
chamber is full of old pellets and now I

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.290 
chamber is full of old pellets and now I
have<00:06:20.920> blue<00:06:21.190> flames<00:06:21.490> and<00:06:23.160> the<00:06:24.160> heat<00:06:24.490> is<00:06:24.790> in<00:06:25.030> the

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
have blue flames and the heat is in the

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.070 
have blue flames and the heat is in the
burning<00:06:25.480> chamber<00:06:26.580> is<00:06:27.580> coming<00:06:28.000> out<00:06:28.210> more

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
burning chamber is coming out more

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.510 
burning chamber is coming out more
slowly<00:06:30.120> that's<00:06:31.120> okay<00:06:31.590> the<00:06:32.590> smoke<00:06:32.890> up<00:06:33.070> after

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
slowly that's okay the smoke up after

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.770 
slowly that's okay the smoke up after
this<00:06:33.760> from<00:06:34.030> the<00:06:34.270> balusters<00:06:35.170> a<00:06:35.290> little<00:06:35.740> bit<00:06:35.890> wet

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
this from the balusters a little bit wet

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.970 
this from the balusters a little bit wet

if they'll smoke the steam and the lid

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.440 
if they'll smoke the steam and the lid
doesn't<00:06:42.220> fit<00:06:42.610> very<00:06:42.640> good<00:06:43.150> here<00:06:44.080> he<00:06:44.200> comes
