00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hi of the world of these ladies this bus 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.310
 today I'm going to make you a little 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.930
 guide of the bewitching to introduce you 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.179
 a sequence of what they had 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.049
 two souls who are the sword and the gun 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.179
 you put it all together with a skill 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.890
 of illusions therefore for that you need 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.779
 put 10 points in the illusion for 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.270
 get the thinking that is the fate of 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.130
 level 4 as you can see at the top 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.350
 on the right I chose as competence 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.199
 prestige skills actually 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.650
 the interest of combining all this is 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.890
 make maximum use of the combos one that I 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.000
 will introduce you immediately 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.820
 so I chose to represent everything 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.230
 that's the site I use so he's us 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.550
 must a ski of the entrance a style of 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.870
 exit to have the combo I 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.100
 selected a router 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.390
 so we can see what they are entering 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:52.620
 reflection reflection in exit skill 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.660
 the spooky jurist who are going to me 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.660
 to allow confusion 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.660
 expect at first and in a 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:06.520
 second time so always the same 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:09.330
 only entry style that we are going 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.330
 use the exchange 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.350
 in order to get the armor of chaos 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.300
 there's nothing better than 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.420
 video to show all that so for 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.700
 see this video video ben it's 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.979
 in real time and afterwards I re 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.300
 dissect all the actions that 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.340
 I did to see exactly by three 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.590
 how did I do it so voila voila 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.400
 descent of the opponent's life is 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.659
 quite fast 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:48.450
 these struggles well now let's move on to 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:50.280
 slowed down so at first a 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.080
 magic bullet then the magic bullet 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.090
 are interested in having a stunt next 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.020
 so I invoke globalists 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.520
 phantasmagorical 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.550
 so I'm a little zoom just for 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.220
 to show stupor the time of the 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.259
 vocation in fact the duelist I'm going 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.539
 send my prestige skill and 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.360
 ie to turn back so 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.260
 the interest of the dome is that all 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.760
 weapons at a distance do not touch me 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.290
 that's going to allow me to have the first 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.800
 combo that we can see who is the 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.600
 confusion 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.690
 confusion is an alteration 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.930
 cumulative in intensity doing x damage 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.280
 whenever the target attacks 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.920
 then I make an exchange so 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.690
 to get the armor of chaos 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.420
 I take advantage of my exchange to be at 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.260
 cac is launched my frantic haze so 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.260
 to improve my dps 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.290
 the side effect of the practical ball 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.540
 so it's a distortion that makes me 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.700
 invulnerable so preventing me from having 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.500
 damage if we are fast enough between 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.700
 the first attack is good ethics 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.410
 it leaves us a long enough time 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.410
 important we are invulnerable 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.120
 to finish 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.250
 so I use the clown that will serve to 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.200
 make the changes to make a 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.180
 distortion is used aptitude 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.110
 reflection that allows me to send back 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.610
 damage here is a demonstration of 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.880
 some kills done with this 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.880
 gait 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.360
 that's okay, listen, this is the end of my 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.430
 video will I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.379
 and then as far as possible I 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.590
 will be in do some just time 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.590
 in time
