these all down supposed to cut them down
to<00:00:53.219> about<00:00:53.550> six<00:00:53.879> inches<00:00:54.300> something<00:00:54.809> like<00:00:54.960> that

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
to about six inches something like that

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.369 
to about six inches something like that
and<00:00:56.730> then<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> asparagus<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.199> going<00:00:58.320> to

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
and then the asparagus is going to

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.170 
and then the asparagus is going to
connect<00:00:58.680> very<00:00:59.010> thick<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.609> hope<00:00:59.789> next<00:01:00.000> year

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
connect very thick we hope next year

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.060 
connect very thick we hope next year
there's<00:01:00.570> where<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> new<00:01:01.079> asparagus<00:01:01.590> he<00:01:01.829> isn't

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
there's where the new asparagus he isn't

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.110 
there's where the new asparagus he isn't
you<00:01:02.129> can<00:01:02.219> see<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> grounds<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.850> kind<00:01:03.059> of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
you can see the grounds is kind of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.310 
you can see the grounds is kind of
swelling<00:01:03.510> up<00:01:03.629> under<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:03.989> where<00:01:04.170> it's

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
swelling up under there where it's

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.039 
swelling up under there where it's
growing<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.180> this<00:01:06.180> has<00:01:06.330> been<00:01:06.510> establishing

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
growing so this has been establishing

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.440 
growing so this has been establishing
itself<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.740> will<00:01:08.220> let<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.369> go<00:01:08.460> two<00:01:08.610> years<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
itself I will let it go two years and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.320 
itself I will let it go two years and
this<00:01:10.200> year<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.619> eat<00:01:10.890> from<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.280> that's<00:01:12.150> going

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
this year we eat from that that's going

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.090 
this year we eat from that that's going
to<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.450> really<00:01:12.689> great<00:01:12.990> asparagus<00:01:13.740> we're

year I've tried growing these and
they're<00:01:24.240> starting<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.780> head<00:01:25.020> up<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.740> see

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
they're starting to head up you can see

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.140 
they're starting to head up you can see
where<00:01:25.979> some<00:01:26.159> leaves<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.549> kind<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.850> frozen

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
where some leaves have kind of frozen

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.130 
where some leaves have kind of frozen
here<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.070> that's<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.280> happen<00:01:29.490> where<00:01:30.270> it

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
here and that's going to happen where it

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.870 
here and that's going to happen where it
does<00:01:31.320> get<00:01:31.530> around<00:01:31.619> 20<00:01:32.130> degrees<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.700> from

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
come out here with scissors and I'll cut

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.350 
come out here with scissors and I'll cut
the<00:02:30.599> spinach<00:02:30.959> off<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.349> top<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.769> this<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.360> some

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
the spinach off the top of this and some

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.699 
the spinach off the top of this and some
of<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.690> cut<00:02:33.900> right<00:02:34.080> down<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> ground

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
of this I cut right down to the ground

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.949 
of this I cut right down to the ground
and<00:02:34.950> it's<00:02:35.099> right<00:02:35.310> back<00:02:35.519> again<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.900> I'm

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
and it's right back again so I'm

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.740 
and it's right back again so I'm
thinking<00:02:37.379> a<00:02:37.410> couple<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.890> 8-foot<00:02:38.480> spinach<00:02:39.480> rows

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
thinking a couple of 8-foot spinach rows

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.380 
thinking a couple of 8-foot spinach rows
in<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.319> raised<00:02:40.500> bed<00:02:40.670> it's<00:02:41.670> probably<00:02:42.090> enough<00:02:42.360> for

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
in a raised bed it's probably enough for

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.290 
in a raised bed it's probably enough for
me<00:02:42.690> my<00:02:43.349> kale<00:02:43.650> I've<00:02:44.400> eaten<00:02:44.610> probably<00:02:45.030> four<00:02:45.269> or

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
me my kale I've eaten probably four or

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.960 
me my kale I've eaten probably four or
five<00:02:45.390> bowls<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:46.080> kale<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:47.519> is<00:02:47.700> probably

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
five bowls of kale and this is probably

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.850 
five bowls of kale and this is probably
the<00:02:48.060> most<00:02:48.209> productive<00:02:48.450> thing<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.379> can<00:02:49.560> plant

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
the most productive thing you can plant

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.910 
the most productive thing you can plant
is<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.459> kale<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:51.900> comes<00:02:52.170> back<00:02:52.230> crazy<00:02:52.739> I

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
is the kale it just comes back crazy I

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.100 
is the kale it just comes back crazy I
actually<00:02:53.370> once<00:02:53.760> again<00:02:54.060> take<00:02:54.660> scissors<00:02:54.900> and

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
actually once again take scissors and

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.540 
actually once again take scissors and
cut<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.349> out<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.650> K<00:02:55.830> out<00:02:55.950> for<00:02:56.220> two<00:02:56.370> or<00:02:56.459> three

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
cut it out of K out for two or three

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.360 
cut it out of K out for two or three
different<00:02:56.819> places<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:58.470> kale<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.860> thick

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
different places and the kale is thick

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.199 
different places and the kale is thick
so<00:02:59.670> if<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.209> want<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.480> eat<00:03:01.519> really<00:03:02.519> good<00:03:02.670> from<00:03:03.120> a
