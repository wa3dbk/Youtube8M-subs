faster<00:02:31.129> pitch<00:02:32.890> for<00:02:33.890> his<00:02:34.010> first<00:02:34.190> time<00:02:34.340> I

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
faster pitch for his first time I

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.640 
faster pitch for his first time I
thought<00:02:34.640> he<00:02:34.730> did<00:02:34.909> really<00:02:35.120> well<00:02:35.390> but<00:02:36.349> he<00:02:36.440> did<00:02:36.620> a

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.680 
which is good it's a good thing the last
segment<00:02:51.170> kind<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:52.030> it's<00:02:53.030> tough<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.390> know<00:02:53.480> what

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690

appreciation<00:02:55.250> for<00:02:55.640> how<00:02:56.000> well<00:02:56.780> bus<00:02:57.440> drivers

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
appreciation for how well bus drivers

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.509 
appreciation for how well bus drivers
can<00:02:58.099> drive<00:02:58.340> because<00:02:58.819> clearly<00:02:59.920> if<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.129> ever<00:03:01.310> need

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519
