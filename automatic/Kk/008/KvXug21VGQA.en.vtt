this one here is small gravel in both of
these<00:00:21.930> trades<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.279> see<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
these trades and you can see that the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.740 
these trades and you can see that the
individual<00:00:24.930> rock<00:00:25.529> sizes<00:00:26.490> are<00:00:26.760> about<00:00:27.720> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
individual rock sizes are about a

rocks all of these pieces are rounded
they<00:00:51.750> are<00:00:51.960> they<00:00:52.800> are<00:00:53.070> river<00:00:53.760> rock<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.600> they

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
they are they are river rock and they

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.330 
they are they are river rock and they
all<00:00:55.020> about<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.510> centimetre<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.780> size<00:00:58.340> river

rock<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.170> crushed<00:01:01.170> rocks<00:01:01.730> now<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
rock and crushed rocks now the

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.550 
rock and crushed rocks now the
importance<00:01:04.769> between<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.820> two<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.330> if<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.350> are

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
importance between the two is if you are

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.130 
importance between the two is if you are
making<00:01:07.830> concrete<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.880> you're<00:01:09.600> pumping

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
making concrete and you're pumping

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.070 
making concrete and you're pumping
concrete<00:01:10.680> through<00:01:11.340> hoses<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.479> crushed<00:01:12.780> rock

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
concrete through hoses the crushed rock

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.160 
concrete through hoses the crushed rock
with<00:01:13.320> its<00:01:13.470> sharp<00:01:13.770> edges<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.970> often<00:01:15.450> clogs<00:01:15.960> up

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
with its sharp edges it often clogs up

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.620 
with its sharp edges it often clogs up
the<00:01:16.350> lines<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.250> doesn't<00:01:17.610> flow<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the lines and it doesn't flow so you

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.890 
the lines and it doesn't flow so you
might<00:01:18.960> want<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.259> specify<00:01:19.619> river<00:01:20.610> rock<00:01:21.000> for

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
might want to specify river rock for

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.740 
might want to specify river rock for
your<00:01:22.080> concrete<00:01:22.770> mixtures<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.210> doesn't

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
your concrete mixtures so it doesn't

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.429 
your concrete mixtures so it doesn't
clog<00:01:24.900> up<00:01:25.080> your<00:01:25.110> concrete<00:01:26.009> pumping<00:01:26.430> system

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
clog up your concrete pumping system

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.440 
clog up your concrete pumping system

also course pebble and the differences

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.460 
also course pebble and the differences
are<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.409> same<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:38.729> know<00:01:39.229> riverwalk<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
are the same you know riverwalk and

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.219 
are the same you know riverwalk and
crushed<00:01:41.250> rock<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.820> see<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.299> jagged

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
crushed rock you can see the jagged

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.980 
crushed rock you can see the jagged
edges<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.250> can<00:01:44.430> specify<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.600> 20

edges and you can specify this one is 20
millimeter<00:01:46.380> gravel<00:01:46.950> or<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:49.280> there<00:01:50.280> as<00:01:50.790> you

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
millimeter gravel or so there as you

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.090 
millimeter gravel or so there as you
have<00:01:51.030> two<00:01:51.149> centimeter<00:01:51.630> gravel<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.979> is

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
have two centimeter gravel so this is

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.429 
coarse gravel crushed and a river and
it's<00:01:59.909> important<00:02:00.450> when<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.960> make<00:02:00.990> concrete

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
it's important when you make concrete

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.850 
it's important when you make concrete
that<00:02:02.159> whatever<00:02:02.939> gravel<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.960> want<00:02:04.200> whether
