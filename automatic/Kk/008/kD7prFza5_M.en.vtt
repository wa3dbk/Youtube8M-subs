00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.510
 and what you pay for I'm sad because I do not 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.490
 could be a mortal to access the bus 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.060
 to know the day you have to put it in 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.850
 practice so that's fine 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.769
 blah 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.870
 the main ones find a part 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.420
 soft where you're going to fall so you do not go 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.949
 To much pain a mattress can be the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.809
 Better option 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.480
 and if we do not have a car anymore, look for some 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.690
 part of how she is who is quite 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.690
 multipoint and it's like the mattress and then 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.370
 then you have to grab momentum when 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.899
 you go 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.899
 the point of jumping 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.530
 you have to let go with your feet 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.210
 A) Yes 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.870
 so is 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.280
 when he has jumped 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:25.060
 you have to during the body towards 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:25.060
 front and the back and then 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.350
 and what happens if I fall head first or what 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.350
 plus 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:44.299
 and what you have to do not be afraid 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.280
 and a lot 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.550
 hello youtube friends this day les 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.380
 we are going to teach that we are going to make a 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.910
 turn forward without hands I do not have 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.620
 idea of ​​how that is done but 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.080
 taking advantage of that I'm on TV in 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.380
 youtube I want to send greetings to jose 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.760
 guzmán is well gómez es bing gómez ya 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.940
 Juan Giraldo thanks to people like 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.349
 you we are sleeping 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.910
 that's right we're not having a coffee 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.760
 you kill coffee in the house but 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.190
 we are here trying to want to teach 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.019
 something and I hope they also learn from 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.040
 it and if you want greetings please 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.040
 ask for more friends 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.100
 so let's start 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.780
 even it hurt me I 'm recording there 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.019
 is for the average visa as in other 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.019
 Attempts 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.750
 they dig low and it would lower a little 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.750
 taxes 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.530
 yes 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.250
 Oh 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.600
 as you can see how they can see I do not 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.200
 I'm still alive but I wanted a lomazo 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.970
 but this way it does not hurt us sincerely 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.130
 how to fall to a mattress in your pocket like 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.930
 You can see I do not have the same ability 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.930
 him but to see him explain to me 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.540
 see what it says wrong not to have seen perfect 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.330
 so that at the beginning when one starts 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.120
 to make laps always make a mistake 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.040
 that looking for when he jumps throws 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.830
 down and in real we have to 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.020
 wait for the jump to reach its point 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.030
 to fold them later we do not have to 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.130
 throw us like that but we have to 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.360
 wait until you accept well to be able to 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.880
 to choose 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.790
 it was the first mistake to want tube 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.410
 then what happens is that one has 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.620
 to go grabbing a little more of the xerez 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.170
 in the turn as it is and rotated a 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.310
 little more then I could have stayed 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.930
 well already compared to spending time 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.410
 one has to practice quite this 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.630
 that jump this trampoline that one uses 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.100
 here 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.560
 in need they have to practice 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.300
 so that one gives more height and 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.710
 also try to practice quite what 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.129
 that in the turn we can 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.870
 to practice 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:18.950
 the turn 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.969
 thus no longer makes 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.979
 to be able and this 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:25.779
 taking more or less like this turn that 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.999
 one has to see in the air always 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:30.429
 we have to give our hands here see 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:33.459
 our previous videos of how to shoot 

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:35.469
 If there is in my channel, we have those 

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:36.749
 videos is like shooting through bercy 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:39.399
 to make a turn forwards 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:41.099
 as long as we do the spring or 

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:46.229
 we have to see our hands here 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:46.229
 because here we are going to take the pulse 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.750
 and there you can see the videos that always 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.230
 always I do this because of 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.350
 here it gives us an extra boost us 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.350
 we go 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.230
 actually 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.330
 I think it's this 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:12.800
 I thought well as vegetables thank you for 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.800
 support us not only the soup the vegetables 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:20.460
 We hope we hope that 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:22.229
 you put all this practice follow 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.360
 watching our videos so they can 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:25.800
 learn little by little a little more like 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.260
 that we try to learn a 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.510
 little more
