now let's just say we've worked in our

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.370 
now let's just say we've worked in our
tree<00:05:01.470> we've<00:05:01.860> we've<00:05:02.400> done<00:05:02.580> our<00:05:02.760> stuff<00:05:03.260> to<00:05:04.260> the

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.530 
tree we've we've done our stuff to the
cambium<00:05:04.710> save<00:05:04.980> us<00:05:05.160> up<00:05:05.280> a<00:05:05.340> tree<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:06.120> as<00:05:06.270> you<00:05:06.390> can

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
cambium save us up a tree and as you can

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.660 
cambium save us up a tree and as you can
see<00:05:06.750> this<00:05:07.020> is<00:05:07.230> this<00:05:07.590> is<00:05:07.710> my<00:05:07.860> configuration<00:05:08.340> I

and<00:05:17.060> no<00:05:17.180> matter<00:05:17.360> what<00:05:17.570> we're<00:05:17.750> not<00:05:17.870> we're<00:05:18.080> not

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
and no matter what we're not we're not

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.470 
and no matter what we're not we're not
finished<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:18.590> tree<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:19.010> know<00:05:19.180> all<00:05:20.180> I<00:05:20.210> do<00:05:20.330> is

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
finished the tree I know all I do is

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.870 
finished the tree I know all I do is
pull<00:05:20.690> it<00:05:20.780> out<00:05:20.900> I<00:05:20.930> do<00:05:21.200> undo<00:05:21.770> that<00:05:22.010> but<00:05:22.670> I'll<00:05:22.730> show

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
pull it out I do undo that but I'll show

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.060 
pull it out I do undo that but I'll show
you<00:05:22.910> how<00:05:23.030> you<00:05:23.150> retrieve<00:05:23.480> these<00:05:23.980> you<00:05:24.980> know

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
you how you retrieve these you know

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.930 
you how you retrieve these you know
there<00:05:25.940> are<00:05:26.060> aluminium<00:05:26.300> ring<00:05:26.780> ones<00:05:27.220> and<00:05:28.220> the

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
there are aluminium ring ones and the

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.150 
there are aluminium ring ones and the
idea<00:05:29.270> is<00:05:29.480> you<00:05:30.440> shouldn't<00:05:30.710> let<00:05:30.800> anything<00:05:31.040> fall

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
idea is you shouldn't let anything fall

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.190 
idea is you shouldn't let anything fall
out<00:05:31.580> of<00:05:31.610> a<00:05:31.760> tree<00:05:31.790> a<00:05:32.210> lot<00:05:32.360> of<00:05:32.480> people<00:05:32.750> just<00:05:33.020> put

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
out of a tree a lot of people just put

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.080 
out of a tree a lot of people just put
our<00:05:33.320> overhand<00:05:33.800> knot<00:05:33.980> in<00:05:34.130> this<00:05:34.280> brief<00:05:34.940> it

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
our overhand knot in this brief it

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.090 
our overhand knot in this brief it

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
straight out and if something goes wrong

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.610 
straight out and if something goes wrong
this<00:05:37.580> stuck<00:05:37.850> I've<00:05:38.660> just<00:05:38.900> learned<00:05:39.140> the<00:05:39.470> easy

this stuck I've just learned the easy

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.100 
this stuck I've just learned the easy
way<00:05:39.890> to<00:05:39.950> do<00:05:40.250> this<00:05:40.750> is<00:05:41.750> just<00:05:42.320> put<00:05:42.800> a<00:05:42.830> simple

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
way to do this is just put a simple

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
use your throw line again this does not

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.300 
use your throw line again this does not
take<00:05:54.800> long

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
take long

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:03.400 
take long
well<00:05:56.060> worth<00:05:56.300> the<00:05:56.540> effort<00:06:02.140> that's<00:06:03.140> tie<00:06:03.380> a
