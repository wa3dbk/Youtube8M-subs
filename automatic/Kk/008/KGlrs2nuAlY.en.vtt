00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.920 
but I modified it a little bit so that
it<00:03:00.370> would<00:03:00.489> work<00:03:00.519> for<00:03:01.299> what<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.480> need<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:01.900> to

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
it would work for what I need it to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.569 
it would work for what I need it to
where<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.290> can<00:03:02.379> sit<00:03:02.739> down<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:03.190> then<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:03.519> can

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
where I can sit down and then I can

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.369 
where I can sit down and then I can
swivel<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.150> in<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.629> out<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:04.959> way<00:03:05.079> we<00:03:05.230> need

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
swivel it in and out of the way we need

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.289 
swivel it in and out of the way we need
to<00:03:05.409> like<00:03:05.560> get<00:03:05.739> up<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:06.069> record<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.519> stuff<00:03:06.730> so

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
to like get up and record and stuff so

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.520 
to like get up and record and stuff so
yeah<00:03:07.390> that's<00:03:07.569> pretty<00:03:07.780> neat<00:03:07.959> and<00:03:08.110> then<00:03:08.260> latched

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
yeah that's pretty neat and then latched

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.970 
yeah that's pretty neat and then latched
on<00:03:08.799> to<00:03:08.829> that<00:03:09.099> I<00:03:09.129> actually<00:03:09.400> have<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.799> pop<00:03:11.799> filter

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
on to that I actually have a pop filter

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.009 
on to that I actually have a pop filter
so<00:03:12.519> that<00:03:12.670> whenever<00:03:12.879> I<00:03:13.030> make<00:03:13.209> like<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.540> P<00:03:13.720> sound

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
so that whenever I make like the P sound

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.140 
so that whenever I make like the P sound
it<00:03:14.500> doesn't<00:03:14.859> pop<00:03:15.069> in<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.459> will<00:03:15.849> hurt<00:03:15.970> the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
it doesn't pop in it will hurt the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.849 
it doesn't pop in it will hurt the
microphone<00:03:16.510> actually<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:17.049> overall<00:03:17.739> it<00:03:17.829> just

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
microphone actually and overall it just

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.080 
microphone actually and overall it just
makes<00:03:18.099> it<00:03:18.190> sound<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.519> lot<00:03:18.609> better<00:03:18.670> so<00:03:18.940> I<00:03:19.000> can

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
makes it sound a lot better so I can

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.910 
makes it sound a lot better so I can
move<00:03:19.299> this<00:03:19.480> in<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.930> out<00:03:20.049> of<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.260> way<00:03:20.410> it's

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
move this in and out of the way it's

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.410 
move this in and out of the way it's
nice<00:03:21.099> and<00:03:21.280> adjustable<00:03:21.730> which<00:03:21.849> is<00:03:21.970> really<00:03:22.239> cool

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
nice and adjustable which is really cool

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.970 
nice and adjustable which is really cool
and<00:03:22.660> if<00:03:23.019> you<00:03:23.109> didn't<00:03:23.290> know<00:03:23.349> my<00:03:23.530> microphone<00:03:23.950> is

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
and if you didn't know my microphone is

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.940 
and if you didn't know my microphone is
actually<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.609> blue<00:03:24.879> Yeti<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:26.019> moving<00:03:26.769> on<00:03:26.920> from

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
actually the blue Yeti so moving on from

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.099 
actually the blue Yeti so moving on from
that<00:03:27.609> let's<00:03:27.879> just<00:03:28.030> push<00:03:28.180> that<00:03:28.359> away<00:03:28.510> it's<00:03:29.019> a

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
that let's just push that away it's a

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.630 
that let's just push that away it's a
little<00:03:29.319> bit<00:03:29.440> cluttered<00:03:29.829> right<00:03:30.250> here<00:03:30.430> because

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
little bit cluttered right here because

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.860 
little bit cluttered right here because
it's<00:03:30.760> like<00:03:30.879> right<00:03:31.060> next<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.359> my<00:03:31.450> bed<00:03:31.480> so<00:03:31.810> I

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
it's like right next to my bed so I

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.960 
it's like right next to my bed so I
don't<00:03:31.989> really<00:03:32.049> have<00:03:32.170> much<00:03:32.829> room<00:03:33.129> to<00:03:33.160> stand<00:03:33.700> and

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
don't really have much room to stand and

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.059 
don't really have much room to stand and
let's<00:03:34.900> just<00:03:35.049> go<00:03:35.170> down<00:03:35.349> here<00:03:35.379> I'll<00:03:35.709> kind<00:03:36.010> of

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
let's just go down here I'll kind of

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.920 
let's just go down here I'll kind of
just<00:03:36.129> kind<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.430> sitting<00:03:36.670> down<00:03:36.700> see<00:03:37.690> ya<00:03:37.780> down

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
just kind of sitting down see ya down

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.210 
just kind of sitting down see ya down
here<00:03:38.200> is<00:03:38.319> we're<00:03:38.470> actually<00:03:38.620> going<00:03:38.889> my<00:03:39.010> power

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
here is we're actually going my power

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.490 
here is we're actually going my power
that's<00:03:39.970> just<00:03:40.239> an<00:03:40.599> external<00:03:41.109> power<00:03:41.230> supply

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
that's just an external power supply

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.490 
that's just an external power supply
that<00:03:42.220> just<00:03:42.549> splits<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.389> power<00:03:43.870> into<00:03:44.260> like<00:03:44.410> I

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
that just splits the power into like I

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.629 
that just splits the power into like I
think<00:03:44.560> that's<00:03:44.829> like<00:03:44.950> eight<00:03:45.160> or<00:03:45.310> ten<00:03:45.489> different

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
think that's like eight or ten different

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:46.830 
think that's like eight or ten different
ones<00:03:45.970> so<00:03:46.090> that's<00:03:46.269> where<00:03:46.359> I<00:03:46.389> get<00:03:46.510> all<00:03:46.569> my<00:03:46.599> power

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
ones so that's where I get all my power

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.460 
ones so that's where I get all my power
from<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:47.639> moving<00:03:48.639> over<00:03:48.880> here<00:03:48.910> this<00:03:49.750> is<00:03:49.810> the

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
from and moving over here this is the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.530 
from and moving over here this is the
clutter<00:03:50.950> of<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.430> wire<00:03:51.639> see<00:03:52.000> how<00:03:52.060> all<00:03:52.209> my<00:03:52.329> wires

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
clutter of the wire see how all my wires

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.110 
clutter of the wire see how all my wires
run<00:03:52.989> underneath<00:03:53.349> here<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:53.829> suck<00:03:54.669> with<00:03:54.700> being

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
run underneath here I suck with being

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.629 
run underneath here I suck with being
organized<00:03:55.630> with<00:03:56.019> wires<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:57.099> yeah<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:57.280> mean<00:03:57.549> I

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
organized with wires so yeah I mean I

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:58.740 
organized with wires so yeah I mean I
don't<00:03:57.790> really<00:03:57.910> mind<00:03:58.180> it<00:03:58.329> that<00:03:58.359> much<00:03:58.450> some

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
instead of showing them on this screen I

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.550 
instead of showing them on this screen I
just<00:06:47.660> decided<00:06:47.930> that<00:06:48.020> I<00:06:48.140> would<00:06:48.260> tell<00:06:48.440> you

just decided that I would tell you

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.469 
just decided that I would tell you
because<00:06:48.710> if<00:06:49.460> you<00:06:49.580> really<00:06:49.850> want<00:06:50.030> to<00:06:50.120> check<00:06:50.300> out

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479
