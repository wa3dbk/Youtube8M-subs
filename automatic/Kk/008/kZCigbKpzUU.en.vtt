00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.589 
that was the inside of the card now what
I<00:03:02.650> decided<00:03:03.099> to<00:03:03.250> do<00:03:03.340> with<00:03:03.459> this<00:03:03.639> one<00:03:03.940> was<00:03:04.569> I

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
I decided to do with this one was I

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.559 
I decided to do with this one was I
painted<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.609> with<00:03:06.609> gold<00:03:06.790> spray<00:03:07.090> paint<00:03:07.120> on<00:03:07.480> the

painted it with gold spray paint on the

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.720 
painted it with gold spray paint on the
other<00:03:07.690> side<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.769> I<00:03:08.799> would<00:03:09.129> have<00:03:09.280> gold<00:03:09.549> on<00:03:09.670> the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
other side so I would have gold on the

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.160 
other side so I would have gold on the
inside<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.359> other<00:03:10.480> different<00:03:10.959> thing<00:03:11.049> I'm

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
inside and the other different thing I'm

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.080 
inside and the other different thing I'm
doing<00:03:11.349> with<00:03:11.379> this<00:03:11.590> one<00:03:11.799> instead<00:03:12.670> of<00:03:12.790> cutting

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
doing with this one instead of cutting

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.240 
doing with this one instead of cutting
the<00:03:13.389> strips<00:03:13.720> from<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.409> long<00:03:14.680> side<00:03:14.980> I'm

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
the strips from the long side I'm

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.789 
the strips from the long side I'm
cutting<00:03:15.549> them<00:03:15.639> from<00:03:15.849> the<00:03:15.939> short<00:03:16.299> side<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:17.620> see

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
cutting them from the short side to see

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.300 
cutting them from the short side to see
what<00:03:17.950> would<00:03:18.040> happen<00:03:19.439> so<00:03:20.439> I<00:03:20.620> cut<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.040> strips

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
what would happen so I cut the strips

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.920 
what would happen so I cut the strips
assembled<00:03:21.909> it<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.150> this<00:03:22.239> is<00:03:22.389> what<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.659> ended

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
assembled it and this is what you ended

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.530 
assembled it and this is what you ended
up<00:03:23.019> with<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.620> end<00:03:24.099> up<00:03:24.159> with<00:03:24.310> fewer<00:03:24.579> strips<00:03:25.359> of

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
up with you end up with fewer strips of

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.599 
up with you end up with fewer strips of
course<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.319> you<00:03:27.010> end<00:03:27.159> up<00:03:27.250> with<00:03:27.310> something

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
course and you end up with something

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.050 
course and you end up with something
that's<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.299> little<00:03:28.450> bit<00:03:28.599> larger<00:03:29.579> so<00:03:30.579> this<00:03:30.819> gold

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
that's a little bit larger so this gold

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.240 
that's a little bit larger so this gold
ball<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:31.599> this<00:03:31.750> little<00:03:31.989> blue<00:03:32.260> ornament<00:03:33.010> were

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
ball and this little blue ornament were

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.860 
ball and this little blue ornament were
maybe<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.639> same<00:03:33.849> size<00:03:34.090> card<00:03:34.449> and<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.599> can<00:03:34.720> see

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
maybe the same size card and you can see

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.319 
maybe the same size card and you can see
the<00:03:34.959> difference<00:03:35.319> in<00:03:35.470> shape<00:03:35.859> and<00:03:36.040> size<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.669> think

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
the difference in shape and size I think

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.580 
the difference in shape and size I think
this<00:03:37.449> one<00:03:37.569> was<00:03:37.690> my<00:03:37.810> favorite<00:03:38.019> one<00:03:38.379> I

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
this one was my favorite one I

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.680 
this one was my favorite one I
spray-painted<00:03:38.889> the<00:03:39.310> inside<00:03:39.669> with<00:03:40.090> gold<00:03:40.359> spray

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
spray-painted the inside with gold spray

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.420 
spray-painted the inside with gold spray
paint<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.169> the<00:03:41.620> outside<00:03:41.889> of<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.040> card<00:03:42.250> was

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
paint and the outside of the card was

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.990 
paint and the outside of the card was
red<00:03:42.699> with<00:03:43.209> gold<00:03:44.609> snowflakes<00:03:45.609> that<00:03:45.849> had

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
that larger one where I painted a golden

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.860 
that larger one where I painted a golden
side<00:03:54.669> and<00:03:54.879> to<00:03:55.030> me<00:03:55.120> it<00:03:55.239> look<00:03:55.359> a<00:03:55.449> little<00:03:55.599> like<00:03:55.840> a

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
side and to me it look a little like a

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.009 
side and to me it look a little like a
birdcage<00:03:56.549> so<00:03:57.549> I<00:03:57.849> just<00:03:58.090> put<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.690> red<00:03:58.840> one

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019

inside the gold one what do you think I
was<00:04:01.299> even<00:04:01.329> thinking<00:04:01.720> you<00:04:01.780> could<00:04:01.900> hang

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
was even thinking you could hang

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.479 
was even thinking you could hang
something<00:04:02.530> on<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.739> inside<00:04:03.040> of<00:04:03.159> that<00:04:03.280> gold

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
something on the inside of that gold

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.550 
something on the inside of that gold
maybe<00:04:03.819> like<00:04:03.970> a<00:04:04.000> little<00:04:04.269> decorative<00:04:04.840> bird<00:04:05.229> or<00:04:05.530> a

little maybe a little bell or something
like<00:04:07.510> that<00:04:07.659> would<00:04:07.780> be<00:04:07.810> cute<00:04:08.139> too<00:04:08.319> here's<00:04:09.310> one

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579

using<00:04:10.090> fewer<00:04:10.510> strips<00:04:10.870> with<00:04:11.079> very<00:04:11.260> wide<00:04:11.500> strips

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
using fewer strips with very wide strips

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.699 
using fewer strips with very wide strips
and<00:04:12.250> if<00:04:12.459> you're<00:04:12.609> doing<00:04:12.729> this<00:04:12.940> with<00:04:13.000> young<00:04:13.389> kids

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.569 
and if you're doing this with young kids
something<00:04:14.709> like<00:04:14.859> this<00:04:14.949> would<00:04:15.129> probably<00:04:15.310> be

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
something like this would probably be

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.670 
something like this would probably be
easier<00:04:15.879> for<00:04:15.940> them<00:04:16.239> nice<00:04:16.720> wide<00:04:16.989> strips<00:04:17.409> would

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
easier for them nice wide strips would

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.469 
easier for them nice wide strips would
take<00:04:17.859> them<00:04:18.010> less<00:04:18.549> time<00:04:18.579> to<00:04:18.940> cut<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:19.299> would<00:04:19.389> be

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
take them less time to cut and would be

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.509 
take them less time to cut and would be
a<00:04:19.510> lot<00:04:19.690> easier<00:04:19.840> to<00:04:20.169> cut<00:04:20.349> you<00:04:20.979> could<00:04:21.159> use<00:04:21.280> very

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
a lot easier to cut you could use very

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.149 
a lot easier to cut you could use very
small<00:04:21.639> cards<00:04:22.389> and<00:04:22.539> make<00:04:22.690> very<00:04:22.930> tiny<00:04:23.260> ones<00:04:23.620> you
