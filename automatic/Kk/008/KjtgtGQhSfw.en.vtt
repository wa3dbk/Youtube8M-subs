in<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:02.429> 1930s<00:00:02.990> teams<00:00:03.990> began<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.650> use<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:04.859> tactic

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
in the 1930s teams began to use a tactic

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.849 
in the 1930s teams began to use a tactic
of<00:00:05.520> wasting<00:00:06.029> time<00:00:06.060> by<00:00:06.839> getting<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.379> puck<00:00:07.589> in

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
of wasting time by getting the puck in

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.860 
of wasting time by getting the puck in
their<00:00:08.040> defensive<00:00:08.550> zone<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:08.970> then<00:00:09.420> shooting

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
their defensive zone and then shooting

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.350 
their defensive zone and then shooting
it<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.110> whole<00:00:10.290> length<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.769> ice<00:00:11.059> in<00:00:12.059> order

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
it the whole length of the ice in order

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.299 
it the whole length of the ice in order
to<00:00:12.420> prevent<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:12.960> because<00:00:13.590> let's<00:00:14.070> face<00:00:14.160> it

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
to prevent this because let's face it

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.799 
to prevent this because let's face it
it's<00:00:14.639> not<00:00:14.940> very<00:00:15.150> fun<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.450> watch

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
it's not very fun to watch

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.500 
it's not very fun to watch
Puckett's<00:00:16.770> shot<00:00:17.010> down<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.369> ice<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:18.090> then<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
Puckett's shot down the ice and then the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.939 
Puckett's shot down the ice and then the
other<00:00:18.630> guys<00:00:18.840> have<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.140> chase<00:00:19.350> after<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.830> and

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
other guys have to chase after it and

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.740 
other guys have to chase after it and
bring<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.189> back<00:00:20.250> up<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.760> then<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.270> defenders

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
bring it back up and then the defenders

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.390 
bring it back up and then the defenders
just<00:00:21.930> steal<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.199> again<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.769> shoot<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.310> back

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
just steal it again and shoot it back

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.230 
just steal it again and shoot it back
down<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> ice<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.830> the<00:00:25.830> icing<00:00:26.400> rule<00:00:26.640> was

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
down the ice so the icing rule was

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.080 
down the ice so the icing rule was
created<00:00:27.900> there<00:00:28.740> are<00:00:28.859> three<00:00:29.160> main<00:00:29.550> things<00:00:29.939> that

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
created there are three main things that

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.569 
created there are three main things that
must<00:00:30.480> happen<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:30.990> an<00:00:31.230> icing<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.710> occur<00:00:32.189> but

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
must happen for an icing to occur but

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.130 
must happen for an icing to occur but
there<00:00:32.759> are<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> bunch<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.510> different<00:00:33.930> little

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
there are a bunch of different little

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.040 
there are a bunch of different little
things<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:35.370> prevent<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.540> first<00:00:36.809> I'm

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
things that can prevent it so first I'm

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.470 
things that can prevent it so first I'm
gonna<00:00:37.110> describe<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.860> simple<00:00:38.280> icing<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.910> then

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
gonna describe a simple icing and then

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.030 
gonna describe a simple icing and then
we'll<00:00:39.870> go<00:00:40.050> back<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.290> we'll<00:00:40.530> take<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.710> look<00:00:40.890> at

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
we'll go back and we'll take a look at

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.530 
we'll go back and we'll take a look at
all<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> things<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.610> would<00:00:41.879> prevent<00:00:42.329> it

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
all the things that would prevent it

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.410 
all the things that would prevent it
from<00:00:42.719> being<00:00:43.140> cold<00:00:43.789> the<00:00:44.789> first<00:00:45.000> thing<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.390> that

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
from being cold the first thing is that

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.290 
from being cold the first thing is that
the<00:00:45.750> guy<00:00:45.930> shooting<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.800> puck<00:00:47.010> must<00:00:47.520> be<00:00:47.789> behind

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
the guy shooting the puck must be behind

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.860 
the guy shooting the puck must be behind
the<00:00:48.809> red<00:00:49.020> line<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.879> then<00:00:50.879> he<00:00:51.120> has<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.449> shoot

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the red line and then he has to shoot

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.610 
the red line and then he has to shoot
the<00:00:52.079> puck<00:00:52.289> down<00:00:52.710> here<00:00:53.070> past<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:54.030> goal<00:00:54.300> line<00:00:54.620> if

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
the puck down here past the goal line if

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.709 
the puck down here past the goal line if
those<00:00:56.010> two<00:00:56.280> things<00:00:56.309> happen<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.539> an

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
those two things happen then an

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.500 
those two things happen then an
imaginary<00:00:58.350> line<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:59.129> formed<00:00:59.579> across<00:01:00.180> these

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
imaginary line is formed across these

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.080 
imaginary line is formed across these
two<00:01:00.840> faceoff<00:01:01.350> circles<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.730> final

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
two faceoff circles and the final

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.329 
two faceoff circles and the final
ingredient<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.780> an<00:01:03.899> icing<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> player

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
ingredient of an icing is that a player

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.850 
ingredient of an icing is that a player
on<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> other<00:01:05.790> team<00:01:06.090> who<00:01:06.990> did<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.439> shoot<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
on the other team who did not shoot the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.580 
on the other team who did not shoot the
puck<00:01:08.040> must<00:01:08.729> cross<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.330> line<00:01:09.630> before<00:01:10.380> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
puck must cross this line before a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.100 
puck must cross this line before a
teammate<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.700> player<00:01:11.970> who<00:01:12.390> did<00:01:12.689> shoot<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
teammate of the player who did shoot the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.149 
teammate of the player who did shoot the
puck<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> behind<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.869> red<00:01:16.020> line<00:01:16.259> passed<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
puck so behind the red line passed the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.280 
puck so behind the red line passed the
goal<00:01:17.369> line<00:01:17.780> opponent<00:01:18.780> must<00:01:18.930> cross<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
goal line opponent must cross the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.060

faceoff<00:01:19.759> spots<00:01:20.759> line<00:01:21.119> first<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.590> happens

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
faceoff spots line first if that happens

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.270 
faceoff spots line first if that happens
the<00:01:23.610> referee<00:01:24.020> blows<00:01:25.020> whistle<00:01:25.049> Colin<00:01:25.920> icing

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
here it's in our best interest to not

here it's in our best interest to not
have<00:01:37.470> an<00:01:37.619> icing<00:01:37.979> call<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.579> something

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
have an icing call this is something

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.780 
have an icing call this is something
that<00:01:39.030> we<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.420> not<00:01:39.600> want<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:40.049> happen<00:01:40.259> because<00:01:41.220> we

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
that we do not want to happen because we

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.819 
that we do not want to happen because we
want<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.150> keep<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> puck<00:01:42.689> as<00:01:42.960> far<00:01:43.439> away<00:01:43.680> from

want to keep the puck as far away from
our<00:01:44.130> goal<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:45.000> get<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
our goal as we can get it so the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.929 
our goal as we can get it so the
simplest<00:01:46.500> thing<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.640> prevent

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
simplest thing that we can do to prevent

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.539 
simplest thing that we can do to prevent
an<00:01:48.149> icing<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.960> something<00:01:49.380> called<00:01:49.590> gaining<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
an icing is something called gaining the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.810 
an icing is something called gaining the
line<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.750> gain<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.229> red<00:01:52.380> line<00:01:52.680> means<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.670> you

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
line to gain the red line means that you

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
line before you shoot it if you shoot it

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.819 
line before you shoot it if you shoot it
from<00:02:01.350> here<00:02:01.740> we<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> potential<00:02:03.210> icing<00:02:03.829> but

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
from here we have a potential icing but

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.219 
from here we have a potential icing but
if<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.670> take<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.909> few<00:02:06.329> steps<00:02:06.420> forward<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
if you just take a few steps forward to

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.290 
if you just take a few steps forward to
gain<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.590> red<00:02:07.740> line<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.369> shoot<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.209> from

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
gain the red line and you shoot it from

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.280 
gain the red line and you shoot it from
here<00:02:09.720> play<00:02:10.649> continues<00:02:11.400> without<00:02:11.879> an<00:02:12.030> icing

here play continues without an icing

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.110 
here play continues without an icing
the<00:02:13.349> second<00:02:13.739> part<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.159> that<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.549> puck<00:02:14.760> must

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
the second part is that the puck must

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.289 
the second part is that the puck must
cross<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.930> goal<00:02:16.110> line<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:17.280> clarify<00:02:17.760> if<00:02:18.090> it

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
cross the goal line to clarify if it

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.330 
cross the goal line to clarify if it
goes<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.959> net<00:02:19.200> no<00:02:19.560> matter<00:02:19.739> where<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.219> was

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
goes in the net no matter where it was

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.729 
goes in the net no matter where it was
shot<00:02:20.489> from<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.450> goal<00:02:21.719> but<00:02:22.319> remember<00:02:22.709> that

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
shot from it is a goal but remember that

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.380 
shot from it is a goal but remember that
the<00:02:22.950> goal<00:02:23.129> line<00:02:23.340> extends<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:23.939> entire<00:02:24.209> way

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
the goal line extends the entire way

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.259 
the goal line extends the entire way
across<00:02:24.689> the<00:02:24.870> ice<00:02:25.129> so<00:02:26.129> this<00:02:26.310> means<00:02:26.549> that<00:02:26.790> if<00:02:27.090> I

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
across the ice so this means that if I

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.270 
across the ice so this means that if I
shoot<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.659> puck<00:02:27.840> from<00:02:28.049> back<00:02:28.290> here<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:29.159> it

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
shoot the puck from back here but it

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.789 
shoot the puck from back here but it
only<00:02:29.370> goes<00:02:29.609> to<00:02:29.760> here<00:02:30.120> it's<00:02:30.659> not<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.900> Nisan<00:02:31.290> it

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
only goes to here it's not a Nisan it

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.679 
only goes to here it's not a Nisan it
must<00:02:32.129> go<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.489> whole<00:02:32.640> way<00:02:32.760> past<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.269> goal<00:02:33.450> line

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
must go the whole way past the goal line

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.830 
must go the whole way past the goal line
finally<00:02:34.680> if<00:02:35.129> we<00:02:35.579> have<00:02:35.849> shot<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.450> puck<00:02:36.629> from

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
finally if we have shot the puck from

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.379 
finally if we have shot the puck from
behind<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.409> red<00:02:37.590> line<00:02:37.859> and<00:02:38.159> it<00:02:38.609> goes<00:02:38.819> past<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
behind the red line and it goes past the

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.110 
behind the red line and it goes past the
goal<00:02:39.629> line<00:02:39.889> we<00:02:40.889> can<00:02:41.099> still<00:02:41.459> stop<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.970> from

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
goal line we can still stop it from

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.119 
goal line we can still stop it from
being<00:02:42.389> an<00:02:42.540> icing<00:02:42.900> by<00:02:43.049> winning<00:02:43.469> a<00:02:43.560> race<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:44.099> the

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
being an icing by winning a race to the

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.149 
being an icing by winning a race to the
faceoff<00:02:44.639> circle<00:02:45.120> line<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:46.500> race<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:47.040> this

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
faceoff circle line the race to this

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.220 
faceoff circle line the race to this
line<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.670> actually<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.060> brand<00:02:48.420> new<00:02:48.720> rule<00:02:48.959> for

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
line is actually a brand new rule for

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.979 
line is actually a brand new rule for
the<00:02:49.290> NHL<00:02:49.799> at<00:02:50.129> least<00:02:50.370> as<00:02:50.579> I<00:02:50.670> record<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.180> in<00:02:51.510> the

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
the NHL at least as I record this in the

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.220 
the NHL at least as I record this in the
October<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.889> 2013<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:53.819> so<00:02:54.810> we'll<00:02:54.989> come<00:02:55.200> back

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
October of 2013 it is so we'll come back

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.890 
October of 2013 it is so we'll come back
to<00:02:55.799> see<00:02:55.980> why<00:02:56.189> this<00:02:56.430> race<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.329> faceoff<00:02:57.659> dot

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
to see why this race to the faceoff dot

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.460 
to see why this race to the faceoff dot
exists<00:02:58.889> in<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.220> second<00:02:59.750> okay<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:00.810> let's<00:03:01.139> look<00:03:01.319> at

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
exists in a second okay so let's look at

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.960 
exists in a second okay so let's look at
all<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.709> those<00:03:01.980> little<00:03:02.250> things<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.730> will

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
all of those little things that will

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.170 
all of those little things that will
prevent<00:03:03.450> an<00:03:03.750> icing<00:03:04.139> from<00:03:04.349> being<00:03:04.590> called<00:03:05.180> first

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
prevent an icing from being called first

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.270 
prevent an icing from being called first
if<00:03:06.389> your<00:03:06.510> team<00:03:06.689> is<00:03:06.720> short-handed<00:03:07.470> or<00:03:07.739> which

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
if your team is short-handed or which

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.069 
if your team is short-handed or which
means<00:03:08.519> you're<00:03:08.669> killing<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.060> penalty<00:03:09.480> you

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
means you're killing a penalty you

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.530 
means you're killing a penalty you
cannot<00:03:10.500> be<00:03:10.799> called<00:03:11.010> for<00:03:11.250> icing<00:03:11.639> so<00:03:12.239> you<00:03:12.299> could

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
cannot be called for icing so you could

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.479 
cannot be called for icing so you could
shoot<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.900> puck<00:03:13.079> down<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.590> ice<00:03:13.739> all<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.280> want

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
shoot the puck down the ice all you want

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.640 
shoot the puck down the ice all you want
in<00:03:14.669> there<00:03:14.819> is<00:03:14.970> no<00:03:15.180> icing<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.659> fact<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.500> is

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
in there is no icing in fact this is

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.589 
in there is no icing in fact this is
probably<00:03:17.129> what<00:03:17.760> most<00:03:17.790> teams<00:03:18.180> will<00:03:18.389> do

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
probably what most teams will do

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.589 
probably what most teams will do
whenever<00:03:19.229> they're<00:03:19.470> killing<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.340> penalty<00:03:20.729> but

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
whenever they're killing a penalty but

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.119 
whenever they're killing a penalty but
they<00:03:21.720> will<00:03:21.870> not<00:03:21.989> be<00:03:22.049> called<00:03:22.379> for<00:03:22.560> icing<00:03:22.829> if<00:03:22.979> you

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
they will not be called for icing if you

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.759 
they will not be called for icing if you
were<00:03:23.250> on<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.639> powerplay<00:03:24.329> however<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:25.379> can

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
were on the powerplay however you can

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.159 
were on the powerplay however you can
still<00:03:26.159> be<00:03:26.310> called<00:03:26.519> horizon<00:03:26.989> next<00:03:27.989> if<00:03:28.139> the

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
still be called horizon next if the

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.039 
still be called horizon next if the
goalie<00:03:28.500> plays<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.310> puck<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.909> icing<00:03:30.599> is<00:03:30.720> taken

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
goalie plays the puck the icing is taken

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.099 
goalie plays the puck the icing is taken
away<00:03:31.169> that<00:03:32.099> one's<00:03:32.280> pretty<00:03:32.430> simple<00:03:32.959> next<00:03:33.959> one

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
away that one's pretty simple next one

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.409 
away that one's pretty simple next one
is<00:03:34.229> that<00:03:34.349> you<00:03:34.500> cannot<00:03:34.859> ice<00:03:35.129> a<00:03:35.489> puck<00:03:35.819> directly

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
is that you cannot ice a puck directly

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.180 
is that you cannot ice a puck directly
off<00:03:36.599> a<00:03:36.629> faceoff<00:03:37.229> so<00:03:37.500> usually<00:03:38.010> whenever

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
off a faceoff so usually whenever

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.289 
off a faceoff so usually whenever
there's<00:03:38.549> a<00:03:38.609> face-off

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
there's a face-off

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
would not be called just because it was

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.240

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.419 
off the icing and play and will continue

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.659 
off the icing and play and will continue
so<00:04:15.419> if<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.629> watch<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:16.079> referee<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:17.190> signal

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
the next slide because that guy is

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.450 
the next slide because that guy is
creeping<00:04:55.980> me<00:04:56.220> out

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
creeping me out

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
creeping me out
the<00:04:57.360> final<00:04:57.870> thing<00:04:58.110> that<00:04:58.140> we'll<00:04:58.410> look<00:04:58.530> at<00:04:58.770> is<00:04:59.480> is

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
the final thing that we'll look at is is

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.350 
the final thing that we'll look at is is
the<00:05:01.170> different<00:05:01.590> types<00:05:01.950> of<00:05:02.190> icings<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:03.180> have

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
the different types of icings that have

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.780 
the different types of icings that have
been<00:05:03.510> adopted<00:05:03.990> by<00:05:04.110> different<00:05:04.140> leagues<00:05:04.790> if

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
been adopted by different leagues if

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.280 
been adopted by different leagues if
you're<00:05:06.000> brand<00:05:06.210> new<00:05:06.330> to<00:05:06.420> hockey<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:07.020> won't

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
you're brand new to hockey you won't

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.260 
you're brand new to hockey you won't
know<00:05:07.530> any<00:05:07.860> different<00:05:08.430> so<00:05:08.670> the<00:05:08.790> part<00:05:09.030> of<00:05:09.150> the

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
know any different so the part of the

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.720 
know any different so the part of the
icing<00:05:09.720> where<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.440> two<00:05:10.620> players<00:05:10.920> race<00:05:11.280> for<00:05:11.580> the

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
icing where the two players race for the

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.180 
icing where the two players race for the
faceoff<00:05:12.150> spot<00:05:12.600> line<00:05:12.840> might<00:05:13.500> not<00:05:13.650> seem<00:05:13.860> strange

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
faceoff spot line might not seem strange

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.580 
faceoff spot line might not seem strange
but<00:05:14.520> as<00:05:14.730> I<00:05:15.120> said<00:05:15.360> this<00:05:15.480> is<00:05:15.660> a<00:05:15.690> brand<00:05:16.050> new<00:05:16.260> rule

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
but as I said this is a brand new rule

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.400 
but as I said this is a brand new rule
the<00:05:17.040> NHL<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.850> this<00:05:18.420> particular<00:05:19.140> type<00:05:19.380> of

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
the NHL and this particular type of

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.550 
the NHL and this particular type of
icing<00:05:19.950> is<00:05:20.340> called<00:05:20.670> a<00:05:20.760> hybrid<00:05:21.090> icing<00:05:21.870> it's

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
icing is called a hybrid icing it's

icing is called a hybrid icing it's
called<00:05:22.920> a<00:05:23.070> hybrid<00:05:23.280> because<00:05:23.850> it's<00:05:24.030> a

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
called a hybrid because it's a

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.930 
called a hybrid because it's a
combination<00:05:24.960> of<00:05:25.440> two<00:05:25.740> other<00:05:26.040> types<00:05:26.340> of<00:05:26.550> icings

combination of two other types of icings

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.990 
combination of two other types of icings
the<00:05:27.180> automatic<00:05:27.900> icing<00:05:28.320> and<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:29.130> touch<00:05:29.460> icing

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
the automatic icing and the touch icing

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.720 
the automatic icing and the touch icing
for<00:05:30.600> the<00:05:30.720> majority<00:05:31.290> of<00:05:31.320> its<00:05:32.040> existence<00:05:32.610> the

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
for the majority of its existence the

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.290 
for the majority of its existence the
NHL<00:05:33.330> used<00:05:33.720> the<00:05:34.200> touch<00:05:34.500> icing<00:05:35.190> system<00:05:35.790> which

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
NHL used the touch icing system which

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.000 
NHL used the touch icing system which
meant<00:05:36.540> that<00:05:36.630> if<00:05:36.900> a<00:05:37.080> puck<00:05:37.260> was<00:05:37.470> shot<00:05:37.680> from

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
meant that if a puck was shot from

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.040 
meant that if a puck was shot from
behind<00:05:38.100> the<00:05:38.430> red<00:05:38.580> line<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:39.030> went<00:05:39.660> past<00:05:39.840> the

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
behind the red line and went past the

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.410 
behind the red line and went past the
goal<00:05:40.230> line<00:05:40.470> a<00:05:40.710> player<00:05:41.700> on<00:05:42.030> the<00:05:42.150> other<00:05:42.180> team

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
goal line a player on the other team

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.630 
goal line a player on the other team
would<00:05:42.840> actually<00:05:43.350> have<00:05:43.470> to<00:05:43.620> skate<00:05:43.980> down<00:05:44.280> and

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
would actually have to skate down and

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.090 
would actually have to skate down and
touch<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:44.970> puck<00:05:45.450> with<00:05:45.690> his<00:05:45.840> stick<00:05:46.110> but<00:05:46.590> if<00:05:46.890> a

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
touch the puck with his stick but if a

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.790 
touch the puck with his stick but if a
player<00:05:47.460> on<00:05:47.850> the<00:05:48.030> team<00:05:48.960> who<00:05:49.170> shot<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.620> puck

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
player on the team who shot the puck

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.100 
player on the team who shot the puck
could<00:05:50.160> get<00:05:50.400> there<00:05:50.610> and<00:05:50.820> touch<00:05:51.030> it<00:05:51.210> first<00:05:51.420> the

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
could get there and touch it first the

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.380 
could get there and touch it first the
icing<00:05:52.530> would<00:05:52.680> be<00:05:52.830> waved<00:05:53.100> off<00:05:53.340> so<00:05:54.030> this<00:05:54.210> meant

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
icing would be waved off so this meant

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.270 
icing would be waved off so this meant
that<00:05:54.450> there<00:05:54.660> was<00:05:54.810> still<00:05:55.020> that<00:05:55.170> race<00:05:55.470> only<00:05:55.830> it

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
that there was still that race only it

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.090 
that there was still that race only it
was<00:05:56.490> to<00:05:56.700> the<00:05:56.820> puck<00:05:57.120> itself<00:05:57.720> rather<00:05:58.560> than<00:05:58.740> to

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
was to the puck itself rather than to

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.000 
was to the puck itself rather than to
the<00:05:59.310> line<00:05:59.550> and<00:05:59.910> because<00:06:00.660> by<00:06:01.380> definition<00:06:01.440> the

the line and because by definition the

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.310 
the line and because by definition the
puck<00:06:02.310> was<00:06:02.490> shot<00:06:02.760> down<00:06:03.090> very<00:06:03.480> close<00:06:03.780> to<00:06:04.140> the

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
puck was shot down very close to the

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.340 
puck was shot down very close to the
board's<00:06:04.850> players<00:06:05.850> would<00:06:06.210> have<00:06:06.450> to<00:06:06.600> skate<00:06:06.870> very

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
board's players would have to skate very

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.830 
board's players would have to skate very
fast<00:06:07.680> and<00:06:07.950> then<00:06:08.370> stop<00:06:08.640> very<00:06:09.060> quickly<00:06:09.360> very

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
fast and then stop very quickly very

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.350 
fast and then stop very quickly very
close<00:06:10.110> to<00:06:10.290> the<00:06:10.410> boards<00:06:10.740> so<00:06:11.700> considering<00:06:12.240> this

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
close to the boards so considering this

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.450 
close to the boards so considering this
happened<00:06:13.140> multiple<00:06:13.350> times<00:06:13.650> each<00:06:14.160> game

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
happened multiple times each game

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.820 
happened multiple times each game
players<00:06:15.210> really<00:06:15.780> didn't<00:06:16.050> get<00:06:16.200> hurt<00:06:16.380> all<00:06:16.620> that

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
players really didn't get hurt all that

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.160 
players really didn't get hurt all that
often<00:06:17.040> this<00:06:17.760> rule<00:06:18.300> was<00:06:18.420> used<00:06:18.660> like<00:06:18.810> this<00:06:18.960> for

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
often this rule was used like this for

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.170 
often this rule was used like this for
decades<00:06:19.320> but<00:06:20.280> they<00:06:20.430> would<00:06:20.640> get<00:06:20.820> hurt<00:06:21.000> on

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
decades but they would get hurt on

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.630 
decades but they would get hurt on
occasion<00:06:21.750> so<00:06:21.960> rather<00:06:22.170> than<00:06:22.500> a<00:06:22.740> race<00:06:23.280> to<00:06:23.550> the

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
occasion so rather than a race to the

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.750 
occasion so rather than a race to the
puck<00:06:23.880> it<00:06:24.150> is<00:06:24.390> now<00:06:24.600> a<00:06:24.840> race<00:06:25.500> to<00:06:25.950> the<00:06:26.190> line<00:06:26.430> which

puck it is now a race to the line which

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.960 
puck it is now a race to the line which
is<00:06:26.790> much<00:06:27.090> further<00:06:27.420> away<00:06:27.840> from<00:06:28.140> the<00:06:28.950> boards<00:06:29.280> and

is much further away from the boards and

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.450 
is much further away from the boards and
a<00:06:30.150> much<00:06:30.300> safer<00:06:30.630> way<00:06:31.020> to<00:06:31.050> call<00:06:31.560> the<00:06:31.770> icing<00:06:32.160> which

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
a much safer way to call the icing which

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.180 
a much safer way to call the icing which
is<00:06:32.640> why<00:06:32.970> they<00:06:33.150> changed<00:06:33.540> the<00:06:34.350> most<00:06:34.560> popular

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
is why they changed the most popular

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.640 
is why they changed the most popular

automatic icing eliminates all races
it's<00:06:56.550> just<00:06:56.940> states<00:06:57.240> that<00:06:57.570> if<00:06:58.380> the<00:06:58.560> puck<00:06:58.770> is

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
it's just states that if the puck is

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.100 
it's just states that if the puck is
shot<00:06:59.130> from<00:06:59.340> behind<00:06:59.550> the<00:06:59.820> red<00:06:59.970> line<00:07:00.180> and<00:07:00.450> it

shot from behind the red line and it

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.409 
shot from behind the red line and it
crosses<00:07:01.590> the<00:07:01.740> goal<00:07:01.950> line<00:07:01.980> the<00:07:02.760> icing<00:07:03.240> the

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 
crosses the goal line the icing the

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.030 
crosses the goal line the icing the
whistle<00:07:03.750> is<00:07:03.840> blown<00:07:03.870> as<00:07:04.410> soon<00:07:04.620> as<00:07:04.800> it<00:07:04.919> crosses

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040 
whistle is blown as soon as it crosses

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.430 
whistle is blown as soon as it crosses
the<00:07:05.490> goal<00:07:05.669> line<00:07:05.700> and<00:07:05.940> it's<00:07:06.270> automatically<00:07:07.200> and

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 
the goal line and it's automatically and

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.550 
the goal line and it's automatically and
icing<00:07:08.220> as<00:07:08.340> soon<00:07:08.550> as<00:07:08.700> it<00:07:08.820> crosses<00:07:09.030> that<00:07:09.330> line<00:07:09.560> so

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
icing as soon as it crosses that line so

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.110 
icing as soon as it crosses that line so
touch<00:07:10.770> icing<00:07:11.220> meant<00:07:11.400> you<00:07:11.550> actually<00:07:11.910> have<00:07:12.030> to

race to the puck automatic icing means

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.510 
race to the puck automatic icing means
