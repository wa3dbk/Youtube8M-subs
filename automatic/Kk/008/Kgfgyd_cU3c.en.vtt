case itself on what nothing's happening
it's<00:00:53.520> not<00:00:53.670> cracking<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.300> completely<00:00:54.719> solid

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
it's not cracking it's completely solid

that it fits the mold perfectly for the
ones<00:02:54.810> i<00:02:54.959> created<00:02:55.500> then<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.340> just<00:02:56.579> pop<00:02:57.030> open

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
ones i created then you just pop open

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.509 
ones i created then you just pop open
your<00:02:57.420> case<00:02:57.659> rip<00:02:58.530> out<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.889> bottom<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.340> top

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
your case rip out the bottom of the top

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.020 
your case rip out the bottom of the top
and<00:02:59.730> slip<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.569> in<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.900> there<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.709> go<00:03:02.030> custom

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
and slip it in and there you go custom

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.030 
and slip it in and there you go custom
custom<00:03:03.329> crystal<00:03:03.900> case<00:03:04.079> and<00:03:04.319> I<00:03:04.680> think<00:03:04.709> they

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
custom crystal case and I think they

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.470 
custom crystal case and I think they
turned<00:03:05.099> out<00:03:05.340> pretty<00:03:05.549> good<00:03:05.819> when<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.120> guys<00:03:06.269> let
