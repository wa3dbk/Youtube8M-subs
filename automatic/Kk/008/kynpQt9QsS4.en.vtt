00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.210
 I do not think everyone is happy with this 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.980
 as the encouragement that we get our 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.810
 points we have to keep adding up 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.840
 we know that against veracruz is a 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.090
 match to death this direct what of 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.770
 decline but I think we 're fine 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.160
 prepared with him I think we did between 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.420
 week and since this part has already finished what 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.719
 we want to play not because we know what it is 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.570
 very important I do not think we have to 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.989
 win not everything we have well and of course not 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.640
 we can stop points this is part 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.160
 very important because he is a rival 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.660
 direct of the descent and the three points 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.060
 are fundamental we have no other 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.290
 thing more than winning what you would expect 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.570
 of the rival to a team that also 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.890
 will be the same are at home they 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.140
 they will also get the points 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.420
 we have to go and propose not 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.800
 because even I know bridge back this 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.020
 a lot of ball with we have to do 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.750
 our party not that what next 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.130
 this last weekend yes it is important 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.040
 I think going to do a good game there 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.620
 we know about the position we are in and 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.520
 we have to add not me what to do 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.520
 important match 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.860
 we know that veracruz also has 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.350
 great players that we have 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.060
 to be careful and hopefully go do 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.880
 a good game over there and I do not think 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.450
 we have to go mentalized more than anything 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.090
 begin what can affect it 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.950
 to play there at sea level I think 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.290
 that we have to think that we are 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.070
 playing the whole for everything and you have to go 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.070
 to leave everything there 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.320
 an opponent who is also in the position 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.630
 of us who is going to look for a 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.580
 result already at home and we also 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.310
 that we are in need of going to 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.450
 make a good game and get a good 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.909
 good result I think this game is 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.700
 fundamental to our aspirations 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.640
 because good is the direct rival of 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.240
 decline I think we could give a good 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.270
 hit of d 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.710
 to them a good blow from us being 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.600
 up on the table upload our 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.300
 quotient I think there are many things 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.160
 and well I said at first not 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.770
 you have to see how how the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.020
 game but but you have to win it you have to 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.310
 win it like with the first game all 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.680
 they gave their lives and that's why the 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.050
 result I think it's the same thing not to put 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.910
 with everything there not to think that if there 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.530
 classics there is no classic what has happened 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.730
 that when we once went and beat them 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.920
 and we sink them there that already happened now is 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.500
 to beat him is to hit them and we 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.160
 be calmer, look, I think it's 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.530
 special because I think it's a 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.200
 party that we will always remember 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.290
 because it is so fundamental that it is not 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.310
 is the direct rival although it was not said 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:09.110
 on day 2 nothing I think then at 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.760
 end of the tournaments you always cry or you 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.470
 The points you earned are very proud 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.700
 at the beginning of the season and this is going to 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.020
 be like that right now I think the team 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.760
 having two wins in a row would be 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.909
 great for 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.880
 and it would give tranquility and demonstrate what 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.800
 simply what we want to do 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.050
 and show that we have a good team and 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.090
 that we can fight more things than the 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.520
 descent look at me the week we worked 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.310
 to improve our system 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.370
 and I think that's good because you have to 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.590
 think about the rival so much 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.260
 of how good they are because many 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.549
 Sometimes you are thinking more about what 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.870
 do they do what we do 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.860
 we then we have 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.650
 defined our style of play what 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.540
 we want to improve and hence the game does not 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.540
 It will be strong local and visiting
