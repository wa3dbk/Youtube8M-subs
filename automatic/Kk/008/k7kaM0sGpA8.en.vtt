00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.110 
I'm going to do is to cut this meat and
trim<00:00:34.680> any<00:00:34.860> battle<00:00:35.280> they<00:00:35.399> just<00:00:35.670> appear<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.090> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
trim any battle they just appear to be a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.420 
trim any battle they just appear to be a
huge<00:00:36.300> amount<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.540> fat<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:37.430> into

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
huge amount of fat on this into

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.209 
huge amount of fat on this into
reasonable<00:00:39.149> bite<00:00:39.329> sized<00:00:39.570> chunk<00:00:39.989> pieces<00:00:40.410> if<00:00:41.070> we

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
reasonable bite sized chunk pieces if we

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.950 
reasonable bite sized chunk pieces if we
make<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.430> too<00:00:41.700> small<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.270> meat<00:00:42.450> will<00:00:42.600> dissolve

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
make it too small the meat will dissolve

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.869 
make it too small the meat will dissolve
away<00:00:43.050> completely<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.399> make<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.610> too

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
away completely and if we make it too

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.970 
away completely and if we make it too
large<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.600> course<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.890> be

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
large then of course it's going to be

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.770 
large then of course it's going to be
too<00:00:47.100> hard<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.340> eat<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.300> trimming<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> fat

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
within it anyway so there's no point in

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.190 
within it anyway so there's no point in
browning<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.189> begin<00:01:23.689> ok<00:01:24.689> we're<00:01:25.110> going

need<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:58.700> stir<00:03:59.700> that<00:03:59.730> around<00:04:00.030> until<00:04:00.569> the

need that stir that around until the

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.120 
need that stir that around until the
spices<00:04:01.109> are<00:04:01.140> well<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:01.470> truly<00:04:01.530> blender<00:04:02.040> then

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
spices are well and truly blender then

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
you'll see it turn a nice rich sort of

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.090 
you'll see it turn a nice rich sort of
golden<00:04:05.040> yellow<00:04:05.819> curry<00:04:06.720> type<00:04:07.230> color<00:04:07.590> now<00:04:08.010> the

golden yellow curry type color now the
interesting<00:04:08.310> thing<00:04:08.519> is<00:04:08.670> at<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:08.850> end<00:04:08.910> of<00:04:09.060> this

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
interesting thing is at the end of this

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.610 
interesting thing is at the end of this
this<00:04:09.359> will<00:04:09.540> be<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.690> completely<00:04:10.230> different

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
this will be a completely different

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.750 
this will be a completely different
color<00:04:10.799> and<00:04:11.040> that's<00:04:11.190> how<00:04:11.310> you'll<00:04:11.489> be<00:04:11.519> able<00:04:11.670> to

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
color and that's how you'll be able to

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.270 
color and that's how you'll be able to
tell<00:04:11.970> when<00:04:12.120> it's<00:04:12.269> actually<00:04:12.420> cooked<00:04:12.840> properly

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
tell when it's actually cooked properly

course I haven't actually put any chili
in<00:04:17.220> this<00:04:17.400> but<00:04:17.669> it<00:04:18.060> doesn't<00:04:18.329> necessarily<00:04:18.359> need

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
in this but it doesn't necessarily need

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.690 
in this but it doesn't necessarily need
it<00:04:19.139> because<00:04:19.229> it's<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:19.500> very<00:04:19.530> flavoursome<00:04:20.159> curry

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700

at
the<00:04:25.710> time<00:04:25.919> of<00:04:26.130> blending<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.820> source<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:28.020> that

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
the time of blending the source and that

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.689 
the time of blending the source and that
will<00:04:28.530> actually<00:04:28.560> cook<00:04:29.009> through<00:04:29.250> very<00:04:29.490> nicely

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
will actually cook through very nicely

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.249 
will actually cook through very nicely
make<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.150> nice<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.360> mellow<00:04:30.690> without<00:04:31.080> that

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
make it nice and mellow without that

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.860 
make it nice and mellow without that
harsh<00:04:31.560> chili<00:04:31.949> flavor<00:04:32.330> but<00:04:33.330> you'll<00:04:33.509> find<00:04:33.690> that

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
harsh chili flavor but you'll find that

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.390 
harsh chili flavor but you'll find that
this<00:04:34.110> without<00:04:34.410> chili<00:04:34.860> itself<00:04:34.919> is<00:04:35.250> actually

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
this without chili itself is actually

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.120 
this without chili itself is actually
hugely<00:04:36.000> flavoursome<00:04:36.690> very<00:04:37.380> warming<00:04:37.919> and<00:04:38.070> the

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
hugely flavoursome very warming and the

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.070 
hugely flavoursome very warming and the
spices<00:04:38.759> themselves<00:04:39.240> will<00:04:39.360> give<00:04:39.509> it<00:04:39.600> a<00:04:39.750> nice

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
spices themselves will give it a nice

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.860 
spices themselves will give it a nice
bite<00:04:40.789> so<00:04:41.789> what<00:04:41.940> I'll<00:04:42.030> do<00:04:42.150> is<00:04:42.180> I<00:04:42.360> add<00:04:42.509> this<00:04:42.660> meat

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
bite so what I'll do is I add this meat

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.390 
bite so what I'll do is I add this meat
I'll<00:04:43.050> just<00:04:43.199> stir<00:04:43.380> it<00:04:43.530> around<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.919> idea<00:04:44.220> is

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
I'll just stir it around the idea is

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.820 
I'll just stir it around the idea is
actually<00:04:44.759> to<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.539> keep<00:04:45.720> it<00:04:45.840> bubbling<00:04:46.169> away<00:04:46.320> to

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
actually to to keep it bubbling away to

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.499 
actually to to keep it bubbling away to
start<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.220> cook<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.550> meat<00:04:47.729> into<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.240> source

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
start to cook the meat into the source

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.029 
start to cook the meat into the source
and<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:49.199> meat<00:04:49.350> will<00:04:49.470> actually<00:04:49.740> start<00:04:49.919> to

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
and the meat will actually start to

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.580 
and the meat will actually start to
absorb<00:04:50.160> this<00:04:50.669> source<00:04:51.000> once<00:04:51.900> we've<00:04:52.110> got<00:04:52.139> it<00:04:52.289> all

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
absorb this source once we've got it all

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.740 
absorb this source once we've got it all
blended<00:04:53.550> through<00:04:53.850> I'm<00:04:54.030> going<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.389> add<00:04:54.509> this

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
blended through I'm going to add this

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.490 
blended through I'm going to add this
curry<00:04:55.050> into<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.620> oven<00:04:57.320> now<00:04:58.320> we've

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
incorporated the meat into the source

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.700 
incorporated the meat into the source
we've<00:05:00.300> got<00:05:00.449> the<00:05:00.539> spices<00:05:01.020> in<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.260> source<00:05:01.470> it's

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
all bubbling away very nicely what I'm

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.390 
all bubbling away very nicely what I'm
going<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.750> do<00:05:03.870> is<00:05:03.960> transfer<00:05:04.560> this<00:05:04.800> to<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:05.070> very

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
going to do is transfer this to a very

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.140 
going to do is transfer this to a very
heavy<00:05:06.289> enamel<00:05:07.289> cast<00:05:07.860> iron<00:05:08.250> dish<00:05:08.520> now<00:05:08.729> any<00:05:08.910> sort

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
heavy enamel cast iron dish now any sort

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.790 
heavy enamel cast iron dish now any sort
of<00:05:09.210> baking<00:05:09.690> dish<00:05:09.870> will<00:05:10.080> work<00:05:10.229> well<00:05:10.470> for<00:05:10.650> this

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
of baking dish will work well for this

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.890 
of baking dish will work well for this
slow<00:05:11.490> cookers<00:05:11.940> will<00:05:12.150> work<00:05:12.330> well<00:05:12.539> for<00:05:12.750> this

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
slow cookers will work well for this

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.570 
slow cookers will work well for this
these<00:05:13.440> are<00:05:13.500> actually<00:05:13.860> very<00:05:13.979> old<00:05:14.220> my<00:05:14.400> mother

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
these are actually very old my mother

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.040 
these are actually very old my mother
had<00:05:14.789> these<00:05:14.970> I<00:05:15.000> think<00:05:15.270> they<00:05:15.360> date<00:05:15.720> back<00:05:15.750> from

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
had these I think they date back from

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.409 
had these I think they date back from
the<00:05:16.169> early<00:05:16.350> 70s<00:05:16.770> they<00:05:17.610> allow<00:05:17.910> you<00:05:17.970> to<00:05:18.240> cook

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
the early 70s they allow you to cook

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.870 
the early 70s they allow you to cook
very<00:05:18.660> slowly<00:05:18.990> at<00:05:19.349> low<00:05:20.039> heat<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.430> it<00:05:20.550> retains

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
very slowly at low heat and it retains

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.820 
very slowly at low heat and it retains
the<00:05:21.180> heat<00:05:21.210> and<00:05:21.510> it<00:05:21.630> doesn't<00:05:21.990> stick<00:05:22.229> or<00:05:22.380> burn<00:05:22.590> so

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
the heat and it doesn't stick or burn so

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.200 
the heat and it doesn't stick or burn so
it's<00:05:22.979> fantastic<00:05:23.520> for<00:05:23.639> that<00:05:23.789> so<00:05:24.000> I'm<00:05:24.060> just

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
it's fantastic for that so I'm just

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.810 
it's fantastic for that so I'm just
going<00:05:24.360> to<00:05:24.449> ladle<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:25.380> curry<00:05:25.650> into<00:05:26.160> our<00:05:26.550> pot

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
going to ladle the curry into our pot

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.570 
going to ladle the curry into our pot
without<00:05:27.300> spilling<00:05:28.050> it<00:05:28.229> everywhere<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.620> hope

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.710 
oven and we're going to cook this at
about<00:05:36.720> 120<00:05:37.620> degrees<00:05:38.180> for<00:05:39.180> as<00:05:39.270> long<00:05:39.479> as<00:05:39.630> you

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.689 
then I would let it settle and reheat it
probably<00:05:45.419> two<00:05:45.599> hours<00:05:45.630> before<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:47.520> dinner
