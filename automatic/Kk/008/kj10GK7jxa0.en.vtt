no disappear for Jessica on babies today
I'm<00:00:13.690> going<00:00:13.870> to<00:00:13.930> demonstrate<00:00:14.110> a<00:00:14.770> manual<00:00:15.370> pump

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
I'm going to demonstrate a manual pump

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.880 
I'm going to demonstrate a manual pump
this<00:00:15.970> says<00:00:16.209> medela<00:00:16.990> pump<00:00:17.439> which<00:00:17.740> they

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
this says medela pump which they

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.269 
this says medela pump which they
actually<00:00:18.160> gave<00:00:18.310> me<00:00:18.430> in<00:00:18.490> the<00:00:18.550> hospital<00:00:18.670> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
actually gave me in the hospital and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.330 
actually gave me in the hospital and
there's<00:00:21.279> basically<00:00:21.369> three<00:00:21.910> parts<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:24.189> is

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
there's basically three parts this is

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.310 
there's basically three parts this is
the<00:00:24.460> horn<00:00:24.640> or<00:00:25.000> the<00:00:25.029> flange<00:00:25.570> and<00:00:25.989> you<00:00:26.079> want<00:00:26.230> to

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
the horn or the flange and you want to

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.190 
the horn or the flange and you want to
make<00:00:26.410> sure<00:00:26.439> the<00:00:26.650> flange<00:00:26.919> on<00:00:27.310> your<00:00:28.150> pump<00:00:28.329> is<00:00:28.570> big

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
make sure the flange on your pump is big

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.580 
make sure the flange on your pump is big
enough<00:00:29.439> that<00:00:30.310> when<00:00:30.640> you<00:00:30.880> put<00:00:31.329> your<00:00:31.410> nipple<00:00:32.410> and

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
enough that when you put your nipple and

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.760 
enough that when you put your nipple and
the<00:00:32.920> nipple<00:00:33.160> does<00:00:33.280> not<00:00:33.430> touch<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.640> sights<00:00:34.770> so

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
the nipple does not touch the sights so

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.710 
the nipple does not touch the sights so
mine<00:00:36.579> are<00:00:36.610> fairly<00:00:36.970> big<00:00:37.149> this<00:00:37.270> is<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:37.450> twenty

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
mine are fairly big this is the twenty

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.770 
mine are fairly big this is the twenty
seven<00:00:38.050> millimeter<00:00:38.710> flange<00:00:39.629> attached<00:00:40.629> the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
seven millimeter flange attached the

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.740 
seven millimeter flange attached the
flange<00:00:41.019> here<00:00:42.269> this<00:00:43.269> is<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.510> part<00:00:43.719> that

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
flange here this is the part that

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.459 
flange here this is the part that
actually<00:00:43.960> does<00:00:44.289> the<00:00:44.440> pumping<00:00:46.260> back<00:00:47.260> in<00:00:47.410> the

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
actually does the pumping back in the

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.759 
actually does the pumping back in the
back<00:00:47.620> up<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.690> then<00:00:49.960> you<00:00:49.989> attach<00:00:50.140> a<00:00:50.379> bottle<00:00:50.649> to

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
back up and then you attach a bottle to

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.259 
back up and then you attach a bottle to
the<00:00:50.800> bottom<00:00:51.129> this<00:00:51.280> is<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.489> little<00:00:51.940> two-ounce

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
the bottom this is a little two-ounce

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:53.400 
the bottom this is a little two-ounce
bottle<00:00:52.390> that<00:00:52.750> they<00:00:52.839> gave<00:00:52.989> me<00:00:53.109> in<00:00:53.199> the<00:00:53.260> hospital

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
bottle that they gave me in the hospital

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.900 
bottle that they gave me in the hospital
obviously<00:00:54.219> if<00:00:54.309> you're<00:00:54.429> pumping<00:00:54.670> more<00:00:54.789> than

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
obviously if you're pumping more than

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.889 
obviously if you're pumping more than
two<00:00:55.000> ounces<00:00:55.120> you<00:00:55.359> could<00:00:55.480> have<00:00:55.570> a<00:00:55.690> bigger

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
two ounces you could have a bigger

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.829 
two ounces you could have a bigger
bottle<00:00:56.190> screw<00:00:57.190> it<00:00:57.280> on<00:00:57.429> the<00:00:58.300> pumping<00:00:58.600> is<00:00:58.660> really

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
bottle screw it on the pumping is really

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.419 
bottle screw it on the pumping is really
basic<00:00:59.410> basically<00:00:59.739> you're<00:00:59.920> just<00:00:59.949> creating<00:01:00.280> a

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
basic basically you're just creating a

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.160 
basic basically you're just creating a
vacuum<00:01:00.609> and<00:01:01.059> sucking<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.690> milk<00:01:01.780> out<00:01:01.989> of<00:01:02.079> your

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
vacuum and sucking the milk out of your

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.880 
vacuum and sucking the milk out of your
breast<00:01:03.750> okay<00:01:04.750> so<00:01:05.140> when<00:01:05.260> you're<00:01:05.379> ready<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.650> pump

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
breast okay so when you're ready to pump

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.000 
breast okay so when you're ready to pump
you<00:01:06.130> want<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.340> be<00:01:06.460> relaxed<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.750> comfortable

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
you want to be relaxed and comfortable

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.960 
you want to be relaxed and comfortable
and<00:01:09.010> I'm<00:01:09.070> gonna<00:01:09.159> start<00:01:09.400> out<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:09.730> want<00:01:09.880> to<00:01:09.910> make

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
and I'm gonna start out you want to make

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.430 
and I'm gonna start out you want to make
me<00:01:10.180> massage<00:01:10.510> the<00:01:10.780> breast<00:01:10.960> a<00:01:11.050> little<00:01:11.290> bit

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
me massage the breast a little bit

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.620 
me massage the breast a little bit
jiggle<00:01:11.800> it<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:11.980> little<00:01:12.010> bit<00:01:12.370> to<00:01:13.030> encourage<00:01:13.480> the

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
jiggle it a little bit to encourage the

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.470 
jiggle it a little bit to encourage the
milk<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:13.930> flow<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.670> then<00:01:15.820> you<00:01:16.120> put<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.540> flange

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
milk to flow and then you put the flange

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.600 
milk to flow and then you put the flange
so<00:01:19.480> that<00:01:19.600> you<00:01:19.660> create<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:20.050> seal<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.550> way

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
so that you create a seal all the way

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.600 
so that you create a seal all the way
around<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:23.020> then<00:01:23.680> it's<00:01:23.860> usually<00:01:23.950> helpful<00:01:24.370> if

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
around and then it's usually helpful if

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.250 
around and then it's usually helpful if
you<00:01:24.790> try<00:01:25.120> to<00:01:25.180> simulate<00:01:25.480> the<00:01:25.870> way<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.110> baby

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
you try to simulate the way the baby

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.050 
you try to simulate the way the baby
would<00:01:26.560> get<00:01:26.710> let<00:01:26.860> down<00:01:26.890> which<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:27.430> some<00:01:27.760> short

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
would get let down which is some short

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.040 
would get let down which is some short
gentle<00:01:29.490> squeezes<00:01:30.490> or<00:01:30.790> in<00:01:31.240> this<00:01:31.300> case<00:01:31.510> pulls

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
gentle squeezes or in this case pulls

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.520 
gentle squeezes or in this case pulls
and<00:01:32.920> then<00:01:33.580> when<00:01:34.390> milk<00:01:34.570> starts<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:34.960> flow<00:01:35.140> you

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
and then when milk starts to flow you

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.090 
and then when milk starts to flow you
can<00:01:36.040> do<00:01:36.310> longer<00:01:36.580> slower<00:01:37.740> movements<00:01:38.740> just<00:01:38.890> like

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
can do longer slower movements just like

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.130 
can do longer slower movements just like
the<00:01:39.340> baby<00:01:39.520> would<00:01:39.760> when<00:01:39.940> he's<00:01:41.430> nursing<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:44.020> you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
the baby would when he's nursing if you

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.060 
the baby would when he's nursing if you
feel<00:01:44.290> like<00:01:44.410> there's<00:01:44.560> not<00:01:44.620> enough<00:01:44.680> suction

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
feel like there's not enough suction

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.620 
feel like there's not enough suction
this<00:01:45.370> particular<00:01:45.820> pump<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:46.090> can<00:01:46.210> adjust<00:01:46.510> the

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
this particular pump you can adjust the

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.410 
this particular pump you can adjust the
suction<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:48.580> don't<00:01:48.730> want<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:48.910> do<00:01:48.970> it<00:01:49.090> so<00:01:49.210> hard

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
suction you don't want to do it so hard

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.760 
suction you don't want to do it so hard
that<00:01:49.480> it<00:01:49.600> hurts<00:01:49.900> but<00:01:50.260> you<00:01:50.350> don't<00:01:50.530> need<00:01:50.620> to<00:01:50.680> get

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
that it hurts but you don't need to get

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.900 
that it hurts but you don't need to get
the<00:01:50.800> milk<00:01:51.010> out<00:01:53.310> there

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.950 

loosen<00:01:57.910> up<00:01:57.970> starts<00:01:58.300> flowing<00:01:58.540> it's<00:01:58.870> usually

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
loosen up starts flowing it's usually

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.710 
loosen up starts flowing it's usually
good<00:01:59.260> not<00:01:59.410> to<00:01:59.530> watch<00:01:59.680> it<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:01.270> can<00:02:01.390> be<00:02:01.480> stressful

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
good not to watch it it can be stressful

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.390 
good not to watch it it can be stressful
to<00:02:01.900> try<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.170> think<00:02:02.740> you're<00:02:02.830> getting<00:02:03.040> a<00:02:03.100> lot<00:02:03.280> and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
look down and see very little in the

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.430
