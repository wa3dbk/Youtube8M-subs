00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:13.939
 disappeared against currently bar with those mini-applications with the budget it 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:17.409
 because service year on Windows Vista was here 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:22.289
 the gadgets are still there you only need what to kill what 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:22.770
 the 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.939
 for a desktop 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.300
 Call gadgets 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.749
 and here are a few preinstalled more tips offer internet 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.190
 and if I want to have this CPU tenant now 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.480
 which are the double 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.609
 and then you can see it on the screen 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:40.719
 position 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.840
 where I would like that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.010
 So the gadgets are still there but annoying before Taskbar or 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.870
 Sidebar has disappeared 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.890
 with the click 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.330
 on slicks 5 also way again 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.470
 and here you see such a small one 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.690
 Tostedt 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.390
 that it is also very useful if you donate 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.489
 you can look at the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.410
 Desktop ebendiese posted notes that can be in the 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.860
 Configure size 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.100
 and if I'm on Klika now 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.610
 in the color 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.930
 if I give them 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.830
 Solms and post would like to click just right here on this posts 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.710
 Symbol Zorc 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.970
 new note 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.790
 Kandemir to create another option I just go to one 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.880
 existing note Click here on the plus symbol and get more 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.810
 Leahy notes opened 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.340
 nice little feature 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.800
 Windows 7 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.420
 Start menu has actually done relatively little on the box look 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.190
 At a second glance, a function has also taken hold here 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.070
 which one knows, among other things of the Mac 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.140
 if I serve down here in this same time 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.840
 the initials of an application a prayer for example 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.550
 here for Photoshop 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.990
 then I get not only files that have anything to do with Photoshop 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.820
 because they 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.890
 the word talking files carry names or carry in the metadata but i 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.199
 also get all applications displayed 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:15.329
 on the 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.349
 this string applies and if I do 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.569
 here 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.310
 WÃ¶rth a give then of course I also get Microsoft Word and 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.430
 evaluates and can be displayed 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.330
 this application right here 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.040
 by clicking on it 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.370
 does not have to be anymore 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.019
 me thereby the complete 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.740
 equipped for a few minutes and choose where is the first 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.760
 but just can this here 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.760
 Use search bar is also very convenient 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.189
 in the Control Panel 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.709
 she is very tidy again 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.199
 if I am here on hardware and sound Klika 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.899
 that will be extended and I have my corresponding settings and 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:55.179
 Options available 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:56.820
 that would be something 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.829
 modernized and tidied up 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.829
 For example, kinetics and printers are interesting here 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:06.309
 that looks very modern now I have all mine here 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.260
 installed 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.459
 printer 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.949
 displayed then all i can t get here connected 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:13.559
 and if I have such a device 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:17.199
 The idea came to me here, the HeartWare attitude 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.939
 of the corresponding device 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.340
 For example, you can update drivers and continue 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.099
 that too is one 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.099
 the one improvement here because Windows 7 otherwise 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:31.609
 "More hurt again 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.230
 Designs with a right click on the big not different from her 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.300
 Select themes and desktop wallpapers 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.170
 The desktop can now also be provided with a kind of slideshow called the 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.269
 Change wallpapers 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.159
 still with time 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:53.120
 it all looks quite similar listener Windows Vista out so also 40 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.509
 Nothing changed, of course, here is the Aero Design 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:01.109
 with a corresponding graphics card the Auer but not synonymous 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.839
 must be the very latest 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:06.909
 you can just here these effects with the shadows and this transparent here 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.469
 above for example 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:10.639
 with these transparent areas 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.449
 realize 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:13.550
 that's close 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.099
 current graphics card casually by the way 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:21.039
 Way that can be so activated from 4 enabled that is not a problem looks nice 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.199
 out 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.880
 and that was already so 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.700
 the most important to the new Windows 7 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.749
 again at the end 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:34.419
 So windows 7 is not based on complete new developments in principle 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:35.330
 Vista 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.580
 but it is much faster than it is 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.330
 Whistler ever was 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.180
 my feeling and my experience 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.110
 at the same level as 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.099
 XP 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.340
 it is running stable so far i had none 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.069
 driver issues 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:56.229
 It bleeds a lot faster than Whistler that's a nice thing 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.840
 clarified the versions you can with Microsoft 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.259
 so look up from 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.490
 because Windows 7 stutter that just here are too old the mac version 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.669
 are there different 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.620
 Versions with different 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.889
 domestic equipments 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.080
 I am satisfied that it is stable 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.930
 the taskbar has done me absolutely so that's one thing it really 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.960
 Top 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.100
 and otherwise I'll give you a try 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.740
 in a few weeks give information again as it is about my now 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.069
 Windows 7 is available 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:27.919
 I highly recommend it 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.689
 who maybe Windows Whistler 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:34.870
 has not installed yet and is still on Windows XP could now 

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:36.540
 think about it for a new one 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.900
 Generation 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.219
 However, it is so if you have installed XP so far 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:45.639
 then the way leads to Windows 7 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:46.969
 only one 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:52.599
 Reinstalling, however, you have Vista installed then the mihrab 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.229
 Great installation and all yours 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.210
 Programs and settings 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.919
 become 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.610
 taken over in Windows 7 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.820
 the Wars of me to Windows 7 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.460
 I hope it was reasonably interesting 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.680
 Jazz until next time Orior Markus
