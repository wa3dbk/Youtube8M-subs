00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
combination with it the job is usually

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.439 
combination with it the job is usually
thrown<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.390> step<00:00:24.890> now<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.039> step<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.580> it's

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
thrown the step now this step in it's

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.970 
thrown the step now this step in it's
important<00:00:27.900> because<00:00:28.019> you're<00:00:28.410> transferring

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
important because you're transferring

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.160 
important because you're transferring
all<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.310> your<00:00:29.460> way<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.880> front<00:00:30.019> so<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.050> can

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
all of your way to the front so you can

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.440 
all of your way to the front so you can
step<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.969> transferring<00:00:32.969> your<00:00:33.090> way<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
step in transferring your way to the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.139 
step in transferring your way to the
front<00:00:33.510> or<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.620> simply<00:00:34.969> transfer<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> way

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
front or you can simply transfer the way

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.459 
front or you can simply transfer the way
through<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.420> front<00:00:36.570> without<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.050> stuffing

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
through the front without the stuffing

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.819 
through the front without the stuffing
so<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.230> transfer<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.559> weight<00:00:42.829> transfer

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
so it's that transfer of weight transfer

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.680 
so it's that transfer of weight transfer
of<00:00:43.980> oil

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.640 

what's<00:00:51.690> really<00:00:51.840> important<00:00:52.200> with<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.320> job<00:00:52.500> is

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
what's really important with a job is

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
what's really important with a job is
that<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.860> don't<00:00:52.950> want<00:00:53.130> to<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.250> giving<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.580> away

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
that you don't want to be giving it away

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.770 
that you don't want to be giving it away
you<00:00:53.760> don't<00:00:53.970> you're<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.570> able<00:00:54.600> to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
you don't you're going to be able to

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.260 
you don't you're going to be able to
read<00:00:54.960> your<00:00:55.140> job<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.770> not<00:00:56.370> elbow<00:00:56.760> out<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.150> your

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
read your job so not elbow out on your

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.460 
read your job so not elbow out on your
job<00:00:57.480> because<00:00:57.809> your<00:00:58.020> phone<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.379> to

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
job because your phone is going to

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.080 
job because your phone is going to
notice<00:00:58.620> okay<00:00:59.100> every<00:00:59.250> time<00:00:59.400> I<00:00:59.430> throws<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.820> jab

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
notice okay every time I throws the jab

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.210 
notice okay every time I throws the jab
this<00:01:00.600> albums<00:01:01.020> coming<00:01:01.230> out<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.620> keep<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> elbow

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
this albums coming out so keep the elbow

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.030 
this albums coming out so keep the elbow
directly<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.809> center<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.410> a<00:01:04.500> lot<00:01:04.769> harder

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
directly in the center it's a lot harder

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.240 
directly in the center it's a lot harder
to<00:01:05.280> read<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.229> think<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> jab<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.070> that

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
to read and I think with the jab is that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.790 
to read and I think with the jab is that
you<00:01:11.759> can<00:01:11.880> also<00:01:12.000> change<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> levels<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.500> when

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
you can also change the levels so when

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.010 
you can also change the levels so when
you<00:01:13.920> throw<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.460> by<00:01:14.790> Jack<00:01:15.210> you're<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.930> to

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
you throw the by Jack you're going to

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.020 
you throw the by Jack you're going to
drop<00:01:16.560> your<00:01:16.800> level<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.220> step<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.670> at<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.820> same

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
drop your level and step in at the same

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:27.500 
drop your level and step in at the same
time

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.040 

those<00:01:28.510> are<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.690> fundamentals<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.560> job

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
those are the fundamentals of the job

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.120 
those are the fundamentals of the job
some<00:01:32.050> other<00:01:32.170> things<00:01:32.410> to<00:01:32.530> keep<00:01:32.680> in<00:01:32.830> mind<00:01:32.890> about

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
some other things to keep in mind about

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.130 
some other things to keep in mind about
the<00:01:33.340> job<00:01:33.580> our<00:01:33.790> men<00:01:34.450> want<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:34.690> change<00:01:34.930> up<00:01:35.050> the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
the job our men want to change up the

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.140 
the job our men want to change up the
timing<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.710> rhythm<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.280> jack<00:01:36.550> so<00:01:36.940> maybe

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
timing the rhythm of the jack so maybe

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.930 
timing the rhythm of the jack so maybe
you'll<00:01:37.330> throw<00:01:37.540> one<00:01:37.800> just<00:01:38.800> slow<00:01:39.490> bit<00:01:39.640> slower

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
you'll throw one just slow bit slower

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.510 
you'll throw one just slow bit slower
okay<00:01:40.420> little<00:01:41.020> slower<00:01:41.320> so<00:01:42.070> your<00:01:42.190> opponent

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
okay little slower so your opponent

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.890 
okay little slower so your opponent
thing<00:01:42.700> so<00:01:42.910> that's<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.240> speed<00:01:43.480> of<00:01:43.570> your<00:01:43.600> jab

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
thing so that's the speed of your jab

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.990 
thing so that's the speed of your jab
and<00:01:44.140> then<00:01:44.290> you<00:01:45.070> hit<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.310> with<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.490> really<00:01:45.760> fast

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
and then you hit it with a really fast

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.580 
and then you hit it with a really fast
one<00:01:46.330> so<00:01:46.510> always<00:01:46.690> be<00:01:46.810> changing<00:01:47.200> up<00:01:47.290> it<00:01:47.380> really<00:01:47.440> a

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
one so always be changing up it really a

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.290 
one so always be changing up it really a
little<00:01:47.860> slow<00:01:48.160> a<00:01:48.490> little<00:01:49.000> slow<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:50.440> fast

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
little slow a little slow and fast

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.250 
little slow a little slow and fast
another<00:01:52.300> thing<00:01:52.480> with<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.660> job<00:01:52.870> is<00:01:53.050> that<00:01:53.080> you

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
another thing with the job is that you

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.590 
another thing with the job is that you
want<00:01:53.410> to<00:01:53.440> make<00:01:53.590> sure<00:01:53.620> that<00:01:54.400> when<00:01:55.300> you<00:01:55.420> bring

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
want to make sure that when you bring

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.560 
want to make sure that when you bring
the<00:01:55.750> jab<00:01:56.020> back<00:01:56.320> as<00:01:56.830> you<00:01:57.670> put<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:57.880> out<00:01:58.090> when<00:01:58.540> you

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
the jab back as you put it out when you

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.630 
the jab back as you put it out when you
were<00:01:58.750> trapped<00:01:59.080> it<00:01:59.470> make<00:02:00.100> sure<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:00.550> you're
