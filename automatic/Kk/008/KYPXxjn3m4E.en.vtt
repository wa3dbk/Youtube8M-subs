00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.660
 Hello, another package from China 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:19.230
 from the site aliexpress I do not know what is here 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:27.790
 we will find out now 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:32.830
 open as usual here already 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:37.330
 it seemed that it could be 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:42.010
 cut some okay che stand for the good 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:47.410
 this packaging her contents this 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:53.820
 us citizens on I 'll tell you a nice thing 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:58.200
 To me 32 days here she will work 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.950
 I ordered it to connect 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.530
 adapter as we see in Mr. hd May to 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.080
 connect to receiver with hdmi output 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.840
 your old monitor with vga output is not 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.850
 I know of course it will work or not 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.049
 but according to 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.110
 Chinese site this thing is not an adapter 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:25.479
 envelopes that is she converts here 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:28.110
 such a signal from the hdmi input signal output 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.330
 in g 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:36.220
 We'll see, I'll tell you later. 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.580
 it or not well, that's pretty 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.240
 nice plump with some 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.240
 inscriptions 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:53.350
 plugged in an adapter like this 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.590
 monitor which has only one input 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.590
 vga input 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.240
 as we see everything works perfectly worked 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.500
 of course not immediately had to change 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.810
 resolution the resolution of this monitor 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.060
 1240 by 700 there with something I don’t remember exactly 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.400
 in general, only at this resolution is it 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.890
 it all worked 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:21.160
 but I’m not working very well 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:28.100
 that is stable so I turn off the rice and 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:31.070
 then including here it is and so this series 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.770
 appears that is how it is treated either 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.120
 re-turn off 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.320
 either here and so click on the button and 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.150
 getting a little bit better but all 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:46.490
 any kind of car apparently loves 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.230
 so happening here now right now 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:53.630
 ok don't like that not very 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.010
 stable connection but it's better than 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.310
 nothing else such adapters with the output 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.630
 there is a hole at the sound 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.519
 a hole under the three and a half plug then 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.350
 there is you can buy such an adapter and 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.150
 connect more and sound but I don't 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.260
 need i have an outlet on the receiver for 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:19.120
 sound so thank you for your attention 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.120
 Comment on your likes for now.
