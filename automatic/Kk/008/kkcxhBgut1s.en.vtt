00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.690
 Hi, this is my new video 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.860
 to accept bracelets 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.019
 stretch this time instead of 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.629
 use the causes we will use 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.519
 various, but a bit classic cultural ones 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.990
 given this shirt I bought it at 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:22.539
 market has made us some tests then 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:25.330
 already cut I did these two tests and 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.259
 no the same procedure as socks 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:32.210
 but with the shirt with fabrics 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.170
 very normal of the various the same part 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.620
 then here 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.780
 we cut only one of 34 strips 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.440
 centimeters 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.989
 I bought this shirt at the market 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.570
 it was crowded because it had some 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:49.010
 small holes here for example there is one e 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.350
 so no euro with my friend just 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.100
 laboratory fantasy laboratory 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.420
 craft and then they went to do it 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.379
 a ride to the market we bought two 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.170
 between shirts the same procedure 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.810
 we pull the two flaps we pull well also 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.790
 in between to bring together our people 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.960
 that assistance by cutting her own 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.759
 part is not thanks to louis and there or 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.799
 dear or three for that embrace 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.530
 very small type kids and girls 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:22.009
 etc. by cutting it on the other side 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.920
 that the longer we will have a bracelet 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.140
 evening yesterday then girl I made a 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.180
 market yesterday I had both made like this 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.009
 what made with the stockings that made that 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.869
 the king sewn lithium nightmare we say that 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:40.100
 not a lady for difference and I have 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:44.329
 sold more than these also because of it 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.310
 I had made a fantasy and you remember 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.070
 T-shirts you can find precisely 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.040
 cheap markets and can 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.030
 to be 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.000
 in short, with leopard-colored tiger flowers 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.780
 different patterns and many many colors 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.450
 that maybe they don't exist in literature 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.610
 I hope to have given you good advice and 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.090
 let me see if you do something nice 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.490
 already seen some girls on various various 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.870
 facebook groups that have already done it 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.790
 also with flowered children's socks 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.750
 etc 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.750
 I would say that this is all 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.370
 try nothing and prepare ciel e 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.980

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.220
 these strings here and this is the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.890
 done with a size of 4 if you want them 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.130
 thinner maybe you make a strip 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.950
 thinner by two three centimeters e 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.080
 You will get the re thinner cord 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.750
 maybe you can weave them together 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.989
 put some charms in med were 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.750
