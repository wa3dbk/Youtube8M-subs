show<00:01:01.900> you<00:01:01.930> if<00:01:02.170> you<00:01:03.420> test<00:01:04.420> out<00:01:05.070> battlefield<00:01:06.070> on

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
show you if you test out battlefield on

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.020 
show you if you test out battlefield on
my<00:01:07.300> graphics<00:01:07.720> card<00:01:07.780> at<00:01:08.260> a<00:01:08.620> UH<00:01:08.760> even<00:01:09.760> higher

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
my graphics card at a UH even higher

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.140 
my graphics card at a UH even higher
frame<00:01:10.740> frame<00:01:11.740> rate<00:01:11.980> now<00:01:12.160> the<00:01:12.370> lowest<00:01:12.970> frame

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
frame frame rate now the lowest frame

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.810 
frame frame rate now the lowest frame
rate<00:01:13.360> so<00:01:13.510> I<00:01:13.570> can<00:01:13.690> possibly<00:01:13.990> get<00:01:14.640> I'll<00:01:15.640> be

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
rate so I can possibly get I'll be

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.950 
rate so I can possibly get I'll be
trying<00:01:16.210> out<00:01:16.390> on<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.660> really<00:01:17.230> really<00:01:18.960> high

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
trying out on a really really high

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.610 
trying out on a really really high
graphic<00:01:20.650> settings<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:22.750> my<00:01:22.930> desk<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.290> ultra

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
graphic settings of my desk I ultra

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.970 
graphic settings of my desk I ultra
really<00:01:24.010> so<00:01:24.460> let's<00:01:25.030> get<00:01:25.240> on<00:01:25.300> it<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:26.170> then<00:01:26.860> I'll

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
really so let's get on it and then I'll

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.640 
really so let's get on it and then I'll
play<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.310> couple<00:01:27.520> of<00:01:27.700> minutes<00:01:28.030> I<00:01:28.120> think<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.409> at

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
play a couple of minutes I think so at

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.469 
play a couple of minutes I think so at
the<00:01:29.710> moment<00:01:29.860> it's<00:01:30.310> all<00:01:30.550> low<00:01:31.180> settings<00:01:31.659> i<00:01:31.930> guess

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
the moment it's all low settings i guess

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.790 
the moment it's all low settings i guess
that's<00:01:34.479> full<00:01:34.750> screen<00:01:35.020> so<00:01:35.170> full<00:01:35.440> terms<00:01:35.650> of

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
that's full screen so full terms of

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.310 
that's full screen so full terms of
stuff<00:01:36.220> that<00:01:36.370> doesn't<00:01:37.000> matter<00:01:37.180> but<00:01:37.750> if<00:01:37.960> I<00:01:38.080> just

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
stuff that doesn't matter but if I just

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.190 
stuff that doesn't matter but if I just
change<00:01:38.620> a<00:01:38.680> few<00:01:38.860> things<00:01:38.890> um<00:01:40.050> you<00:01:41.050> know<00:01:41.110> what

the<00:07:07.590> last<00:07:07.800> time<00:07:08.040> i'll<00:07:08.280> be<00:07:08.340> playing<00:07:09.080> baffled<00:07:10.080> by

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.230 
the last time i'll be playing baffled by

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.670 
the last time i'll be playing baffled by
this<00:07:11.300> in<00:07:12.300> these<00:07:12.540> high<00:07:12.810> settings<00:07:13.260> for<00:07:13.500> a<00:07:13.530> long

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 
this in these high settings for a long

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.700 
this in these high settings for a long
while<00:07:13.860> until<00:07:14.760> i<00:07:14.820> do<00:07:14.880> get<00:07:15.180> a<00:07:15.470> new<00:07:16.470> card

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:16.710 
while until i do get a new card

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:27.380 
while until i do get a new card
hopefully<00:07:17.070> HD<00:07:22.040> 6770<00:07:23.480> i<00:07:24.480> think<00:07:24.690> no<00:07:25.550> 6870<00:07:26.550> might

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:27.390 
hopefully HD 6770 i think no 6870 might

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.050 
hopefully HD 6770 i think no 6870 might
be<00:07:27.510> running<00:07:27.720> it<00:07:28.050> on<00:07:28.200> high<00:07:28.590> settings<00:07:28.650> a<00:07:29.460> decent

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 
be running it on high settings a decent

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:36.170 
be running it on high settings a decent
framerate<00:07:31.010> my<00:07:32.010> trial<00:07:32.280> HD<00:07:33.270> again<00:07:34.670> yeah<00:07:35.670> I<00:07:35.910> think

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180 
framerate my trial HD again yeah I think

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.220 
framerate my trial HD again yeah I think
this<00:07:36.810> is<00:07:36.960> pretty<00:07:37.140> good<00:07:37.320> all<00:07:37.980> right<00:07:38.870> it's<00:07:39.870> just

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:40.230 
this is pretty good all right it's just

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:47.390 
this is pretty good all right it's just
like<00:07:40.620> a<00:07:40.650> double<00:07:41.130> tuned

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.710 

all<00:07:48.400> right<00:07:48.490> well<00:07:48.760> I<00:07:48.820> think<00:07:48.910> this<00:07:49.180> is<00:07:49.240> not<00:07:49.540> to

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720 
all right well I think this is not to

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.910 
all right well I think this is not to
show<00:07:49.900> you<00:07:49.960> but<00:07:52.170> possibly<00:07:53.170> enough<00:07:53.410> to<00:07:53.440> show<00:07:53.860> you

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:53.920 
show you but possibly enough to show you

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.190 
show you but possibly enough to show you
