 fuck you 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.170
 so it takes two lines guard it takes 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.469
 of the stone transmission so it's with 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.290
 silver shit it takes green line 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:13.920

 the aircraft bardot turn and a piston that's 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.030
 simple simple enough good green line that 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.479
 cost a little bit expensive is to spend 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.920
 especially boring to make it a game but 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.149
 how to do it and it's done the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.670
 tesseract frame yes ben moubamba yeah 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.249

 the rise of the net is store 4 here the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.560
 pass that will already serve to make one 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:04.200
 the Ardennes as we already do if it is 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.349

 that it takes 2 of the east where the little 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.230
 enis to a fault of the optician not 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.570
 nice all would be yes we all have 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.050
 many there is way to go harvest 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.050
 not far away 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:35.790
 8 normally all the way down into the sub 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:37.140
 soils or at worst yeah we have to go down 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.400
 while banana under ground in the cellars 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.940
 and try to find a lava lake 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.670
 had had one taken in time 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.020
 little ellipses please like 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.720
 it is called small and the piloquet 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.280
 ellipses so here we are again we have everything 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.470
 that it takes a kraft asset all summer these 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.330
 racks I 'm close to sorry we are 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.180
 led to it is because there we 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.680
 must go Indian cotton 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.680
 goto hours we will install the sentence 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.810
 and that's how we'll have 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:11.610
 Arabic neology data adorns kind the 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.350
 read that's all we are in a hurry because 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.150
 by Andy for two weeks and 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.739
 has only one spare episode 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:23.400
 we would like to have two would 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:25.080
 cut you have to go down tp points 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.269
 please because the flame yes 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:35.459
 I do this to you that I do not have the armor 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:40.709
 to equip in fact again so that's the 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:42.209
 street guy van stalle n dare alone anymore 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.700
 far better it is because it is 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.450
 deeper no actually it's just 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.840
 because suddenly it just access to 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.730
 the ocean is the ground rod for 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.730
 the moment so there are senses and ben 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.720
 Here they say doing us 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.359
 system there it's going to pump sava up 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.370
 so let's go there it's surveyed 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:14.260
 liquid tesseract 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.870
 yes enough simple enough simple hook to 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.370
 kraft to vouzan fill you do that 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.690
 you put it in the listened it is missed 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.919
 with the asses of carry that fills him 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.630
 after you do it's true that's it 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.669
 it's over it's magic 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.520
 so that's it happened again and leucate 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:30.100
 arctic mjp where the quiet see them 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.199
 summer is finally the countries that are already 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:38.800
 filled now we go back to the base 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:46.780
 finally we go in the plan of your 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:51.060
 question maybe that's with her and 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.060
 Safely ottoman chocapic know I judge 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.490
 I love this expression 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.330
 oh damn that's boring wellpoint 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.310
 teleport then that's not cheap and 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.300
 since it is in the world it is from them 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.590
 that it's the same as another portal 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:10.410
 of an error that was created I can for 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:13.229
 excuse me on the hazards of the live 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:16.800
 and then we will put the magmas 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:19.389
 Lemanic Russia waits tomorrow what 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:23.889
 sorry the little one agrees but I 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:26.860
 went the direct hazard of the 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.750
 moms and the same reasons just 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.270
 engines at our quarry a yeah that's it 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.479
 add engines and there we play the 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.860
 tpir act tic here it's simple it takes 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.000
 a lot of the guard against that it's 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.990
 pretty boring 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.210
 tony blair dismount here you are a wave 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.639
 these two tesseract males will be able to see 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:49.570
 the arrival of seduced nickel dust 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:51.220
 with roundup garlic you seem and 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.699
 here and so the energy that will come from 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.720
 the pump 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:06:00.180
 thanks to magmatic home transmitted to the tea 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.180
 act that will transmit it to the frame 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:08.889
 but in the desert the magmatic you 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.539
 connect to the pump is normal blow 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.510
 energy she manages to take away her 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:15.880
 acts careful no there was 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.680
 loyal energies are those to 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.759
 the work you send is like that 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.809
 I'm coming I'll fix the little bug 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:27.569
 team 6 and so that's it's just a 

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:30.419
 little transmission of energy and that's it 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:32.999
 it's good it happens me it happens no 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.589
 this is it's good it's serious 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:39.180
 not to the comice and fill up fast there he is 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:41.279
 full but I did not touch anything 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:45.599
 but I am because we have forgotten the 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:47.460
 hands of a chenchen of a ah yes good on 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.930
 see the toque smell and we will add 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.120
 also magmas that just leave for 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.069
 that it turns out and what suddenly 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.629
 it's all ah no we all win 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:56.699
 still no energy but must we in 

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:59.099
 will add because there are engines that 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.629
 not fall ah yes also yes it goes 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:03.029
 so this is the end of this 

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:05.069
 third episode last which are a 

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:06.870
 little short yet simple is what is 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:08.789
 show you how it will grow with the 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.050
 time do not worry because 

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:11.550
 the further we go in the stuff the better 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.839
 be complicated so short episodes 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.339
 and English and besides that you have it 

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:15.629
 already you already know a little so 

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:16.830
 many will not be much 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:18.779
 of episodes not what I am told does not 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.460
 will not be will not be there for two 

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:23.039
 weeks he will have one episode a week 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.569
 for the beginning here in two weeks and 

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:28.310
 So here we are, thank you for watching 

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:28.310
