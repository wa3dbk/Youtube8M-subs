to<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.450> center<00:01:27.689> exactly<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.820> then<00:01:30.030> I've

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
to be in the center exactly so then I've

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.469 
to be in the center exactly so then I've
made<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.259> hook<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.610> other<00:01:32.759> end<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> head

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
made a hook on the other end of the head

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.810 
made a hook on the other end of the head
pin<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.049> hooked<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.920> through<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.400> middle<00:01:35.640> of

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
pin and hooked it through the middle of

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.240 
pin and hooked it through the middle of
the<00:01:35.880> chain<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:37.079> can<00:01:37.259> see<00:01:37.439> where<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.890> links

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the chain you can see where the links

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.539 
the chain you can see where the links
intersect<00:01:38.909> mm-hmm<00:01:39.740> once<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:41.040> hooked<00:01:41.340> in

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
intersect mm-hmm once it's hooked in

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.190 
intersect mm-hmm once it's hooked in
there<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.240> pick<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> whole<00:01:42.960> thing

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
there you can just pick the whole thing

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.859 
there you can just pick the whole thing
up<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.619> won't<00:01:43.740> lose<00:01:44.009> your<00:01:44.070> place<00:01:44.750> so<00:01:45.750> it

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
makes it easier to work on yes it does

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.280 
makes it easier to work on yes it does
so<00:01:48.689> here<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.439> have<00:01:49.590> I've<00:01:50.390> twisted<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.750> wire

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
so here I have I've twisted the wire

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.380 
so here I have I've twisted the wire
around<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.920> made<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> loop<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.670> some<00:01:54.119> people

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
around and made a loop and some people

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.539 
around and made a loop and some people
might<00:01:54.540> consider<00:01:54.840> themselves<00:01:55.259> finished<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.310> I

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
might consider themselves finished but I

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.789 
might consider themselves finished but I
like<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.240> make<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.420> really<00:01:57.719> secure<00:01:58.049> loop<00:01:58.290> so

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
like to make a really secure loop so

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.990 
like to make a really secure loop so
what<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> do<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.520> I<00:02:00.450> keep<00:02:00.689> turning<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:02.000> at

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
what I do is I keep turning it and at

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.590 
what I do is I keep turning it and at
the<00:02:03.180> point<00:02:03.450> where<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.899> two<00:02:03.930> wires<00:02:04.409> touch<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.600> I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the point where the two wires touch I I

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.020 
the point where the two wires touch I I
position<00:02:07.500> my<00:02:07.649> pliers<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.220> I'm<00:02:08.310> holding<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.789> to

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
position my pliers so I'm holding on to

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.150 
position my pliers so I'm holding on to
the<00:02:09.149> two<00:02:09.360> wires<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.440> keep<00:02:10.860> turning

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
the two wires and I just keep turning

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.010 
the two wires and I just keep turning
that<00:02:11.730> me

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
that me

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.110 
that me
it<00:02:12.140> even<00:02:12.410> more<00:02:12.560> secure<00:02:13.010> yes<00:02:13.430> what<00:02:13.820> I'm<00:02:13.910> making

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
it even more secure yes what I'm making

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.600 
it even more secure yes what I'm making
is<00:02:14.450> really<00:02:14.750> kind<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.140> split<00:02:15.500> key<00:02:15.950> chain<00:02:16.310> ring

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
is really kind of a split key chain ring

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.290 
is really kind of a split key chain ring
and<00:02:17.150> when<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:18.320> finished<00:02:18.590> it's<00:02:19.580> never<00:02:19.970> coming

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
and when it's finished it's never coming

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.990 
and when it's finished it's never coming
off<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.570> there<00:02:20.960> and<00:02:21.560> execute<00:02:21.920> very<00:02:22.460> secure

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
off of there and execute very secure

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.670 
off of there and execute very secure
like<00:02:23.270> this<00:02:23.510> one<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.780> see<00:02:24.110> right<00:02:24.290> here<00:02:24.530> oh

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
like this one you see right here oh

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.190 
like this one you see right here oh
that's<00:02:25.190> terrific<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.630> like<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.810> different

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
that's terrific and I like the different

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.660 
that's terrific and I like the different
sizes<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.890> beads<00:02:28.130> that<00:02:28.250> you're<00:02:28.460> using

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
sizes and the beads that you're using

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.080 
sizes and the beads that you're using
too<00:02:29.000> yes<00:02:29.680> definitely<00:02:30.680> oh<00:02:30.890> pretty<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.550> can<00:02:31.760> see

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
too yes definitely oh pretty you can see

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
too yes definitely oh pretty you can see
here<00:02:33.020> on<00:02:33.290> this<00:02:33.650> board<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.820> I<00:02:35.180> have<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.870> beads

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
here on this board that I have the beads

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.070 
here on this board that I have the beads
in<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.470> small<00:02:36.830> medium<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.610> large<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.390> by

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
in a small medium and large and by

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.990 
in a small medium and large and by
alternating<00:02:39.800> those<00:02:40.130> back<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.550> forth<00:02:40.760> it

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
alternating those back and forth it

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.550 
alternating those back and forth it
gives<00:02:41.180> kind<00:02:41.420> of<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.570> different<00:02:41.780> dimension<00:02:42.050> to

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
gives kind of a different dimension to

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.760 
gives kind of a different dimension to
the<00:02:42.680> phrases<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.700> makes<00:02:43.970> it<00:02:44.120> more<00:02:44.240> fun<00:02:44.300> yes<00:02:45.200> yes

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
the phrases it makes it more fun yes yes

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.240 
the phrases it makes it more fun yes yes
okay<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:46.910> once<00:02:47.540> I've<00:02:47.810> had<00:02:48.290> I've<00:02:48.590> put<00:02:49.010> all<00:02:49.190> of

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
okay so once I've had I've put all of

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.880 
okay so once I've had I've put all of
the<00:02:49.700> pieces<00:02:49.940> in<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.600> middle<00:02:50.900> here<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.680> looks

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
the pieces in the middle here it looks

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.070 
the pieces in the middle here it looks
like<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.550> I<00:02:52.670> flip<00:02:53.090> this<00:02:53.330> one<00:02:53.390> over<00:02:53.570> so

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
like this and I flip this one over so

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.570 
like this and I flip this one over so
that<00:02:54.110> you're<00:02:54.410> looking<00:02:54.530> at<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.950> underside<00:02:55.550> of

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
that you're looking at the underside of

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.960 
that you're looking at the underside of
the<00:02:55.880> chain<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.440> reason<00:02:58.370> for<00:02:58.400> this<00:02:58.730> is

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
the chain and the reason for this is

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.690 
the chain and the reason for this is
that<00:02:59.060> now<00:02:59.690> you're<00:03:00.410> going<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.800> add<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.460> beads

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
that now you're going to add the beads

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.120 
that now you're going to add the beads
on<00:03:02.060> either<00:03:02.930> side<00:03:03.290> of<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.590> chain<00:03:03.770> you're<00:03:03.950> just

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
on either side of the chain you're just

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.220 
on either side of the chain you're just
going<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.310> hook<00:03:04.490> into<00:03:04.700> this<00:03:05.510> side<00:03:06.080> of<00:03:06.170> the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
going to hook into this side of the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.720 
going to hook into this side of the
chain<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.650> side<00:03:06.860> of<00:03:06.890> chain<00:03:07.190> all<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.610> way

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
chain and the side of chain all the way

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.330 
chain and the side of chain all the way
down<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.210> make<00:03:08.390> it<00:03:08.420> even<00:03:08.630> fuller<00:03:09.040> exactly<00:03:10.040> okay

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
down to make it even fuller exactly okay

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.670 
down to make it even fuller exactly okay
so<00:03:11.000> by<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.660> time<00:03:11.870> you've<00:03:12.110> hooked<00:03:12.260> all<00:03:12.530> of

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
so by the time you've hooked all of

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.410 
so by the time you've hooked all of
those<00:03:12.800> on<00:03:13.070> your<00:03:13.580> piece<00:03:13.820> is<00:03:14.030> going<00:03:14.210> to<00:03:14.270> look

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
those on your piece is going to look

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.330 
those on your piece is going to look
like<00:03:14.450> this<00:03:14.660> which<00:03:15.110> is<00:03:15.260> really<00:03:15.740> full<00:03:15.950> now<00:03:16.280> do

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
like this which is really full now do

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.620 
like this which is really full now do
you<00:03:16.490> have<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:16.730> leave<00:03:16.910> some<00:03:17.150> links<00:03:17.270> at<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.540> end

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
you have to leave some links at the end

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.199 
you have to leave some links at the end
for<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.770> taco<00:03:18.980> my<00:03:19.310> car<00:03:19.520> yes<00:03:19.790> you<00:03:20.000> do

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
for the to the taco my car yes you do

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.750 
for the to the taco my car yes you do
you<00:03:20.780> really<00:03:21.080> do<00:03:21.230> because<00:03:21.650> if<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:22.280> just<00:03:22.490> leave<00:03:22.730> a

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
you really do because if it just leave a

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.210 
you really do because if it just leave a
couple<00:03:23.240> here<00:03:23.510> at<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.780> end<00:03:23.959> because<00:03:24.650> that'll

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
couple here at the end because that'll

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.090 
couple here at the end because that'll
make<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.459> easier<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.360> pull<00:03:27.200> your<00:03:27.440> toggle<00:03:27.740> all

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
make it easier to pull your toggle all

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.740 
make it easier to pull your toggle all
the<00:03:28.220> way<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.400> medical<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.000> so<00:03:29.270> commonly

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
the way to medical and so commonly

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.440 
the way to medical and so commonly
forgotten<00:03:30.320> yes<00:03:30.800> and<00:03:31.430> if<00:03:31.610> you<00:03:31.760> do<00:03:31.940> forget<00:03:32.180> you

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
forgotten yes and if you do forget you

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.840 
forgotten yes and if you do forget you
can<00:03:32.570> always<00:03:32.810> just<00:03:33.140> add<00:03:33.350> more<00:03:33.860> you<00:03:34.520> can<00:03:34.670> add

as<00:04:45.370> you<00:04:45.490> pointed<00:04:45.820> out<00:04:45.910> a<00:04:45.970> moment<00:04:46.060> ago<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:46.630> it

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
as you pointed out a moment ago that it

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.020 
as you pointed out a moment ago that it
has<00:04:47.200> a<00:04:47.230> really<00:04:47.530> nice<00:04:47.770> size<00:04:48.130> on<00:04:48.490> bail<00:04:48.790> on<00:04:49.000> that

has a really nice size on bail on that

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.120 
has a really nice size on bail on that
so<00:04:49.600> you<00:04:49.690> can<00:04:49.990> have<00:04:50.140> a<00:04:50.170> nice<00:04:50.410> jump<00:04:50.650> ring<00:04:50.860> with<00:04:51.010> it

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
so you can have a nice jump ring with it

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.160 
so you can have a nice jump ring with it
to<00:04:51.310> write<00:04:51.580> nicely<00:04:51.940> here<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:52.600> there's<00:04:53.110> a

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
to write nicely here and there's a

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.410 
to write nicely here and there's a
finished<00:04:53.560> project<00:04:53.740> yes<00:04:54.430> it's<00:04:54.700> terrific<00:04:54.970> and

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
finished project yes it's terrific and

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.990 
finished project yes it's terrific and
look<00:04:56.170> this<00:04:56.470> is<00:04:56.650> a<00:04:56.680> very<00:04:56.890> similar<00:04:57.430> one<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:57.640> that

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
look this is a very similar one to that

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.910 
look this is a very similar one to that
so<00:04:58.390> you<00:04:58.510> can<00:04:58.660> add<00:04:58.780> color<00:04:59.140> you<00:04:59.500> can<00:04:59.620> do<00:04:59.770> it<00:04:59.860> a

so you can add color you can do it a

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.440 
so you can add color you can do it a
little<00:05:00.040> bit<00:05:00.250> differently<00:05:00.670> and<00:05:00.940> you<00:05:01.300> brought
