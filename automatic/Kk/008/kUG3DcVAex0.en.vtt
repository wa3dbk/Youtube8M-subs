South could be all important in the long

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.730 
South could be all important in the long
run<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.960> where<00:01:19.200> we're<00:01:19.350> looking<00:01:19.619> at

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740

run so that is where we're looking at
folks<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.460> that's<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:20.820> until<00:01:21.240> after<00:01:21.500> next

for now just say you're where there is a
tropical<00:03:07.990> cyclone<00:03:08.320> that<00:03:08.740> we<00:03:08.860> are<00:03:08.980> expecting

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
tropical cyclone that we are expecting

to<00:03:09.580> develop<00:03:09.940> somewhere<00:03:10.300> in<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.450> Northeast

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
to develop somewhere in the Northeast

to develop somewhere in the Northeast
Coral<00:03:11.200> Sea<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.620> whether<00:03:12.220> or<00:03:12.310> not<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.640> comes

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
Coral Sea and whether or not it comes

our<00:03:13.030> way<00:03:13.060> we<00:03:13.630> just<00:03:13.840> don't<00:03:14.050> know<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:15.040> looking<00:03:15.459> at

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
our way we just don't know so looking at

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.699 
our way we just don't know so looking at
the<00:03:15.670> nation<00:03:16.030> for<00:03:16.590> thunderstorms<00:03:17.590> and

possibly looking at a tropical cyclone
in<00:06:47.889> that<00:06:48.070> region<00:06:48.250> remember<00:06:49.090> the<00:06:49.210> initial

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:49.539 
in that region remember the initial

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:51.120 
in that region remember the initial
movement<00:06:49.720> of<00:06:49.960> that<00:06:50.050> is<00:06:50.259> expected<00:06:50.740> to<00:06:50.800> be<00:06:50.919> west

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
movement of that is expected to be west

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.040 
movement of that is expected to be west
and<00:06:51.400> then<00:06:51.610> it's<00:06:52.030> going<00:06:52.210> to<00:06:52.300> track<00:06:52.539> south<00:06:52.810> or

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
and then it's going to track south or

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.900 
and then it's going to track south or
southeast<00:06:55.020> how<00:06:56.020> far<00:06:56.259> west<00:06:56.500> it<00:06:56.650> gets<00:06:56.860> well<00:06:57.400> we

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:57.910 
southeast how far west it gets well we

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.060 
southeast how far west it gets well we
don't<00:06:58.030> know<00:06:58.240> yet<00:06:58.410> the<00:06:59.410> other<00:06:59.560> thing<00:06:59.770> to<00:06:59.889> note

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
don't know yet the other thing to note

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.950 
don't know yet the other thing to note
is<00:07:00.280> that<00:07:00.340> that<00:07:00.639> a<00:07:00.820> really<00:07:01.180> strong<00:07:01.419> surface

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
is that that a really strong surface

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.990 
is that that a really strong surface
trough<00:07:02.169> may<00:07:02.560> create<00:07:02.860> a<00:07:02.979> low-pressure<00:07:03.490> system

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 
trough may create a low-pressure system

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.510 
trough may create a low-pressure system
here<00:07:04.210> near<00:07:04.990> the<00:07:05.139> Pilbara<00:07:05.770> coastline<00:07:06.280> and<00:07:06.430> we

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
here near the Pilbara coastline and we

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.340 
here near the Pilbara coastline and we
will<00:07:06.699> need<00:07:06.850> to<00:07:06.970> watch<00:07:07.150> that<00:07:07.180> not<00:07:07.810> so<00:07:07.990> much<00:07:08.110> by

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.350 
will need to watch that not so much by

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.050 
will need to watch that not so much by
Monday<00:07:08.710> but<00:07:08.770> maybe<00:07:09.130> later<00:07:09.400> on<00:07:09.580> in<00:07:09.820> the<00:07:09.910> week

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060 
Monday but maybe later on in the week

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.879 
Monday but maybe later on in the week
next<00:07:10.300> week<00:07:10.509> we<00:07:10.990> might<00:07:11.229> need<00:07:11.380> to<00:07:11.440> watch<00:07:11.680> a

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:11.889 
next week we might need to watch a

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:13.860 
next week we might need to watch a
surface<00:07:12.639> low<00:07:12.789> that<00:07:13.000> might<00:07:13.150> spin<00:07:13.389> up<00:07:13.509> up<00:07:13.690> here

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
surface low that might spin up up here

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.170 
surface low that might spin up up here
near<00:07:14.110> the<00:07:14.259> Kim<00:07:14.800> near<00:07:15.160> the<00:07:15.310> Pilbara<00:07:15.789> coastline

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180 
near the Kim near the Pilbara coastline

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.330 
near the Kim near the Pilbara coastline
off<00:07:16.300> the<00:07:16.389> Kimberley<00:07:16.720> coastline<00:07:17.110> now<00:07:17.800> if<00:07:18.099> that

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:18.340 
off the Kimberley coastline now if that

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.610 
off the Kimberley coastline now if that
does<00:07:18.580> form<00:07:18.910> offshore<00:07:19.360> well<00:07:19.870> the<00:07:20.139> conditions

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
does form offshore well the conditions

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.740 
does form offshore well the conditions
the<00:07:20.860> environmental<00:07:21.460> conditions<00:07:21.940> suggest

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:22.750 
the environmental conditions suggest

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.450 
the environmental conditions suggest
that<00:07:23.050> there<00:07:23.349> might<00:07:23.560> be<00:07:23.620> some<00:07:23.949> potential<00:07:24.280> of

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:24.460 
that there might be some potential of

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.189 
that there might be some potential of
that<00:07:24.610> deepening<00:07:25.060> but<00:07:25.539> at<00:07:25.660> this<00:07:25.750> stage<00:07:25.810> it's

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 
that deepening but at this stage it's

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:28.320 
that deepening but at this stage it's
expected<00:07:26.620> to<00:07:26.830> be<00:07:27.009> very<00:07:27.220> weak<00:07:27.490> and<00:07:27.699> expected<00:07:28.210> to

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:28.330 
expected to be very weak and expected to

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.180 
expected to be very weak and expected to
form<00:07:28.570> on<00:07:28.780> shore<00:07:29.169> so<00:07:29.410> it's<00:07:29.530> expected<00:07:29.889> to<00:07:29.949> form

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:30.190 
form on shore so it's expected to form

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.060 
form on shore so it's expected to form
near<00:07:30.430> the<00:07:30.550> coast<00:07:30.759> and<00:07:31.509> or<00:07:31.930> just<00:07:32.229> inland<00:07:32.650> of<00:07:32.889> the

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.070 
near the coast and or just inland of the

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.040 
near the coast and or just inland of the
coast<00:07:33.310> and<00:07:33.550> so<00:07:33.729> if<00:07:33.820> that<00:07:33.970> happens<00:07:34.300> obviously

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.050 
coast and so if that happens obviously

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.400 
coast and so if that happens obviously
very<00:07:35.530> limited<00:07:35.919> cyclone<00:07:36.310> potential<00:07:37.410> so

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:38.410 
very limited cyclone potential so

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.200 
very limited cyclone potential so
overall<00:07:38.979> folks<00:07:39.250> other<00:07:39.430> than<00:07:39.550> the<00:07:39.759> showers<00:07:39.970> and

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.210 
overall folks other than the showers and

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.969 
overall folks other than the showers and
storms<00:07:40.389> along<00:07:40.660> trough<00:07:41.020> lines<00:07:41.289> it's<00:07:41.590> a<00:07:41.740> pretty

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:41.979 
storms along trough lines it's a pretty

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:45.870 
storms along trough lines it's a pretty
boring<00:07:42.280> week<00:07:42.970> coming<00:07:43.419> up<00:07:43.889> cyclone<00:07:44.889> wise<00:07:45.099> will

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:45.880 
boring week coming up cyclone wise will

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.399 
boring week coming up cyclone wise will
have<00:07:46.030> another<00:07:46.210> update<00:07:46.599> for<00:07:46.780> you<00:07:46.870> on<00:07:46.900> Tuesday

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:47.409 
have another update for you on Tuesday

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:48.930 
have another update for you on Tuesday
have<00:07:47.590> a<00:07:47.620> great<00:07:47.830> weekend<00:07:48.280> remember<00:07:48.430> in<00:07:48.820> the

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:48.940 
have a great weekend remember in the

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.430 
have a great weekend remember in the
long<00:07:49.120> term<00:07:49.330> we're<00:07:49.570> looking<00:07:49.840> at<00:07:49.930> that<00:07:50.050> Coral

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:50.440 
long term we're looking at that Coral

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.409 
long term we're looking at that Coral
Sea<00:07:50.620> system<00:07:51.010> but<00:07:51.190> that<00:07:51.310> is<00:07:51.460> a<00:07:51.610> long<00:07:52.090> way<00:07:52.270> away

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:52.419 
Sea system but that is a long way away

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:53.760 
Sea system but that is a long way away
and<00:07:52.780> a<00:07:52.810> lot<00:07:52.960> of<00:07:52.990> things<00:07:53.229> can<00:07:53.409> happen<00:07:53.530> between

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:53.770 
and a lot of things can happen between

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:59.099 
and a lot of things can happen between
now<00:07:54.039> and<00:07:54.789> then<00:07:55.060> we'll<00:07:55.930> talk<00:07:56.139> again<00:07:56.260> on<00:07:56.590> Tuesday
