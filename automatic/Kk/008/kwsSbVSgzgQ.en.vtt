00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:10.050
 just how are you what there is carbon film 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:13.830
 essential athlete you work this 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:18.779
 type of part uses the tone and chemistry iq 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.090
 metro will give you precise 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.730
 weight you will put in kilos or 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.160
 you should not stay until then be 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.070
 regulated right 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.059
 I just came back and the chemist here is 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.320
 An example 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:42.930
 the piece there five kilos more because 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.329
 you can crack carbon 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.879
 then it is good is very sensitive to 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.870
 put everything from the game 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.629
 the brakes that is all you have to have a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.390
 country is from the k9 bank also you put 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.739
 even for you to tighten the screw that are 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.229
 titanium screws that are more 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.110
 the news board and uses the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.299
 toquinho hicks tone is an investment one 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.030
 little high, right? Because a piece around 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.100
 of 300 reais 450 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.570
 only worth every penny you fiddle 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 with their equipment has none 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.860
 You 're just holding on to the hand is not over. 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.119
 thus harming 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.850
 use then show operation 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.960
 him when he's going to crack a 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:35.610
 beauty then screw and put that 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.840
 now I 'm just going to finish it he said that 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.869
 You got in here right? 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.140
 for example I pulled it here already there 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:51.270
 it will pop and it is already right on the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:53.290
 torque esop tv pulls only six or six 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:01.860
 pounds 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:05.320
 the right touch 7th ending here 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.470
 tighten the screw that button and kimi 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.820
 So I put it here, see that one. 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.390
 the stage is not 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:18.430
 and then I got here O already given six 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:21.930
 pounds have already done more 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.810
 then this is the advantage of their 12 5ยบ 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.900
 Professional are you bike bikes? 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.330
 mounted with the home the right touch 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.590
 they manufacture ok 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.590
 I liked the hand 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.500
 I was I was 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.840
 it seems that the grip is little but to the touch 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.830
 accurate and makes it necessary to 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.720
 It was fun, my friend was taller. 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.230
 none were negative degrees to 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:01.570
 more aggressive piloting in the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:05.019
 rises facing depending on 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.950
 bicycles and carbon or aluminum 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.690
 people use the fifth author because 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.280
 need the tightening that is accurate 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.360
 So much does a carbon aluminum now I go 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.530
 replace the pavement I'm already here 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.100
 on this bike 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.290
 including the fork 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.430
 It 's okay to get well, you do not have to 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.070
 take a lot of time when you 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:36.760
 put the correct ring so that it does not 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:42.990
 stay the difference, it does not come, it's broken. 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:46.530
 I asked for shades showed to take action 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:53.080
 now finalizing screw that titanium 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:55.180
 dad and will already give the right ring rate 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.550
 had here 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:04.210
 already totti 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:08.080
 the Dalton in another that also the poster 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:13.140
 right the titanium screws here in the 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:17.700
 table everything correct touch without you 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.700
 order to unify the discrete part
