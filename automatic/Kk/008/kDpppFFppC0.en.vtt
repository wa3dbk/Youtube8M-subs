good right now bc cutie has a lot of

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.480 
good right now bc cutie has a lot of
trouble<00:00:25.109> while<00:00:25.199> he<00:00:25.380> went<00:00:25.800> for<00:00:26.010> really<00:00:26.279> greedy

play<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.060> i<00:00:27.359> doubt<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.990> he<00:00:28.080> will<00:00:28.199> do<00:00:28.500> a

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
play and i doubt that he will do a

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.370 
play and i doubt that he will do a
similar<00:00:29.369> build<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.880> time<00:00:30.119> because<00:00:30.380> well

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
similar build this time because well

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.549 
similar build this time because well
once<00:00:32.030> of<00:00:33.030> course<00:00:33.329> because<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> map<00:00:34.170> itself

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
once of course because of the map itself

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.400 
once of course because of the map itself
but<00:00:35.040> also<00:00:35.100> because<00:00:35.640> he<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.719> has<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.930> realize

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
but also because he just has to realize

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.220 
but also because he just has to realize
that<00:00:37.649> Bly<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.790> player<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.510> scouting

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
that Bly is a player that is scouting

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.100 
that Bly is a player that is scouting
quite<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> lot<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.160> will<00:00:41.610> punish<00:00:42.270> greedy

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
quite a lot and that will punish greedy

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.959 
quite a lot and that will punish greedy
builds<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.920> exactly<00:00:44.070> what<00:00:44.730> be

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
builds and this is exactly what be

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.299 
builds and this is exactly what be
