00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:05.231
 In Morocco, it is easy to observe the lack of respect for pedestrians 

00:00:05.489 --> 00:00:08.489
 From the drivers side and also from the Moroccan men 

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:11.734
 Its existence can usually be consonant with the absence of footpaths 

00:00:11.888 --> 00:00:15.888
 The five leaders of Agadir will provide us with more information in this report prepared for the two men in Morocco 

00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:57.843
 What do you think about the scenes you'll see in the following sections 

00:00:58.357 --> 00:01:05.357
 The frankness of my sister, the kind of viewer we have seen in these passages indicates the lack of awareness of the two legs 

00:01:05.673 --> 00:01:11.673
 They leave the footpath and pass through other routes 

00:01:12.068 --> 00:01:24.068
 We also noticed the lack of respect for both men by cars and buses 

00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:29.792
 Due to the lack of a culture of traffic 

00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:35.947
 An example of this culture is to give precedence to the legs when they want to cut the road 

00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:39.431
 This is what we did not notice in the passages we saw 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:50.500
 Another scene that raised me was the sight of a man pushing a cart over the load and not seeing it in front of him 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:56.500
 Another scene that raised me was the sight of a man pushing a cart over the load and not seeing it in front of him 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.960
 May cause a traffic accident 

00:01:53.556 --> 00:02:00.560
 In your opinion, why most educated and educated people do not respect the law of sero do not respect the passage of men 

00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:06.640
 And you always find them in the street passing through the parking lot 

00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:28.020
 The behaviors of the man and the man who also leads and the problem is the culture of the citizen. Where he was not yet aware, just as the drivers respect the pedestrians' pass so that the two men respect the drivers 

00:02:29.717 --> 00:02:38.720
 The State has done its duty by undertaking a series of sensitization campaigns. Also equipped with two-legged corridors and signaling signals 

00:02:48.255 --> 00:02:55.260
 Sometimes the drivers forget that they were one day two men, why does not suffice the right of precedence to the legs? 

00:02:55.145 --> 00:03:07.140
 For bus and car drivers who do not respect the legs and do not stand there is the speed factor 

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:18.650
 Also the early arrival factor, for example the time of the afternoon and the time of Morocco, there is a traffic jam 

00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:27.240
 And when the two men try to pass the car owners do not respect them, and everyone races to arrive early 

00:03:28.657 --> 00:03:40.660
 There is even someone who does not respect the red light if there is no policeman for everyone who arrives at his home or work quickly 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:51.150
 I think one of the reasons for this phenomenon is the lack of awareness throughout the year 

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:57.290
 As well as the lack of awareness of signs as a culture 

00:03:57.586 --> 00:04:02.590
 There is also a lack of respect, as neither the men nor the drivers respect the men 

00:04:02.387 --> 00:04:08.390
 At some point the driver may become a pedestrian. He leaves his car and crosses the road and becomes a foot 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.060
 So here we find two factors, the factor of consciousness and the factor of culture means there is no awareness of this culture 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:27.080
 The media should pay for the dissemination of this culture. First and second radio or via the Internet and also committees and associations 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:53.350
 Dear bikers, if you want to be respected by the men, respect their own paths 

00:05:11.904 --> 00:05:17.900
 Unfortunately, as we observe in our road space, there is confusion among the users of the road 

00:05:17.466 --> 00:05:22.470
 Where the person does not respect the place allocated to him 

00:05:22.066 --> 00:05:33.070
 And many of the men do not respect the legs of the legs that were specially prepared for them to ensure their safety 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:44.520
 And it is completed based on the signaling signs, for example, red light, and to ensure consistency between the drivers on the one hand, and between pedestrians on the other hand 

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:56.440
 Of course, in some cases, in our cities there are no lanes for pedestrians, but with this absence must respect the pedestrian to a set of rules 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:06.210
 First, when the man wants to cross the road, he has to cut it in a straight line so as not to waste time in the crossing 

00:06:05.685 --> 00:06:22.680
 Second, to try as much as possible, but cut off the road from Zig and that it Ajtar area where vision is clear, and so thirsty driver's vision and his reaction is appropriate 

00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:34.070
 When he passes in a reckless manner and a kind of indifference and surprised by the arrival of a car to do something is slow and may be exposed to a traffic accident 

00:06:34.203 --> 00:06:38.200
 Drivers, when the light turns green, I do not know what's happening to you. You will be relaxed and then go quickly as crazy 

00:06:38.528 --> 00:06:41.530
 I remind you that the man is often cold and he does a muscular effort so that he does not pollute the atmosphere 

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:47.770
 And if you notice that one of the feet is hesitant in transit, let him pass, and all will remain happy and the most important will remain alive
