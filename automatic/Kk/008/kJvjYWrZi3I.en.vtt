so the possibilities for the pretty much
endless<00:01:48.329> at<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> moment<00:01:49.560> there's<00:01:49.710> some

is<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:14.090> possibility<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.360> far<00:02:15.870> cry<00:02:16.050> 4<00:02:16.110> may<00:02:16.470> very

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
is a possibility that far cry 4 may very

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.010 
is a possibility that far cry 4 may very
well<00:02:16.830> use<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.550> same<00:02:17.880> engine<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.690> gets<00:02:18.900> bleep

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
well use the same engine and gets bleep

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.590 
well use the same engine and gets bleep
I<00:02:19.350> think<00:02:19.620> it's<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.770> snowdrop<00:02:20.280> engine<00:02:20.600> which

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
I think it's the snowdrop engine which

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.860 
I think it's the snowdrop engine which
the<00:02:22.050> division<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.590> using<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.720> we<00:02:24.720> ought<00:02:24.840> to

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
the division is using so we ought to

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
interesting to see where it goes and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.070 
interesting to see where it goes and
then<00:03:04.440> find<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:05.010> number<00:03:05.670> one<00:03:05.970> we<00:03:06.570> have<00:03:06.810> the
