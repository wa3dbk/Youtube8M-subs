00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:04.240
 comprising five citizens of Grand-Anse 363 7 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.380
 when I made it up to 5 January 20 it's a player on which he has 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.709
 worked in the past he was a little down 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.289
 no need for players like other players do not care too much 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.690
 to expect when I have him out of his match 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.580
 but I'm glad I did it in three sets 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.600
 612 euros everything seemed to roll it is a little complicated not but it is 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.259
 very well started the match 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.660
 itself 85 26% at home 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.909
 I did not even know who it is and sure of its fact 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:34.159
 and for the jo it's a little tense% after 1 hour 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.890
 it's the judgment in connection with the wind that makes this tragic and take 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.880
 a decision 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.150
 here is my chance after the game 2 nd set is very important six years ago 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.840
 passed in the third 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.420
 color what interests us here in this relationship with your new 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.150
 coach 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.910
 and not just any mats wilander how does it go to 1 5% 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.020
 it's a big no more than 25% 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.580
 that it hurts and the friends who let themselves be impressed by sedan 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.150
 were the only ones to worry when there is one but for now has not 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.500
 worked 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.430
 for me 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.720
 when to be kidding now we talk a lot less 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.920
 363 and 1 5% 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.920
 yet in France 5 to 1 561 michel langevin 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.440
 this is one 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.170
 there is nothing extraordinary either with a range of three advises 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.360
 the day the 20% source 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.050
 the players called for a dispute in a few days 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.480
 details that can make a difference in the long run 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.480
 to propel our first victory as another 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.620
 true despite the fact that badly started and I'm scared the 35 hours 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.010
 the day before one of the leaders of the coup the labels 195 magnitude 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.170
 it's fun even though he won the first set 7 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.630
 if the relationship with god and with cards 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.210
 and it started well after I got a little leg 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.860
 according to I was a little cool would be no effect not really dragged to 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.480
 sign I wanted to play 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.410
 I sing at 26 dollars 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.480
 but we do not know very well started to treat 10 and saint-chamond 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.870
 because there was a fantastic episode this winter with him 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.979
 the sound chamber 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.090
 q you are not very well lived goals 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.439
 how can be able to rely 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.539
 for the moment the only Normandy schools still 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:15.759
 there are things much more serious than that 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.249
 their rationing measures of the current you saw how nikkei he lives the 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:23.669
 impressive match n won the seven elected adelaid in edf he has 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.669
 breathed 5 March to 31 May what is profitable 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:32.840
 I am a believer and% -9 5% and sign it's like that 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.139
 staff by the Elysee laces orders in June 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.889
 this sum would be that of all the villages and villages in bloom again 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:40.920
