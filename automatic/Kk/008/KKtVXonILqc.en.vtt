course I'm going to start by marking my

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.169 
course I'm going to start by marking my
spot<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.740> grill<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.189> it's<00:00:29.699> conveniently

here<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.100> from<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.340> different<00:00:35.490> angle<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:36.000> just

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
here it is from a different angle I just

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.160 
here it is from a different angle I just
want<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> put<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.570> opposite<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.800> vent<00:00:39.170> kind

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.350 
want to put it opposite of the vent kind
of<00:00:40.230> make<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.470> symmetrical<00:00:40.890> here<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:42.180> I'm<00:00:42.240> going

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
of make it symmetrical here so I'm going

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.930 
of make it symmetrical here so I'm going
to<00:00:42.390> drill<00:00:42.510> my<00:00:42.630> first<00:00:42.870> hole<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> 3/8<00:00:43.710> inch

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
to drill my first hole with a 3/8 inch

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.200

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
little bit so that way it'll mark where

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.900 
little bit so that way it'll mark where
that<00:00:53.760> little<00:00:54.480> hold<00:00:55.140> tab<00:00:55.350> needs<00:00:55.650> to<00:00:55.800> go<00:00:55.920> there's

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
that little hold tab needs to go there's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.760 
that little hold tab needs to go there's
the<00:00:57.150> mark<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:58.110> kind<00:00:58.290> of<00:00:58.320> twist<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.650> around

the mark just kind of twist it around

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.000 
the mark just kind of twist it around
just<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.130> bit<00:00:59.630> then<00:01:00.630> I<00:01:00.750> will<00:01:00.990> drill<00:01:01.320> the
