before we begin the challenge it's time

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.970 
before we begin the challenge it's time
to<00:02:33.590> measure<00:02:33.890> Tom's<00:02:34.459> vital<00:02:35.060> statistics<00:02:35.980> the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
to measure Tom's vital statistics the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.620 
to measure Tom's vital statistics the
waist<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:38.049> chests<00:02:39.049> ratio<00:02:39.670> definitely<00:02:40.670> can

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
waist and chests ratio definitely can

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.500 
waist and chests ratio definitely can
look<00:02:41.780> at<00:02:41.959> decreasing<00:02:42.920> his<00:02:43.040> waistline<00:02:43.510> and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
look at decreasing his waistline and

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.750 
look at decreasing his waistline and
hopefully<00:02:45.109> maintaining<00:02:45.739> some<00:02:46.340> sort<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.579> level

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
hopefully maintaining some sort of level

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.840 
hopefully maintaining some sort of level
in<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.000> chest<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:48.290> we've<00:02:48.440> become<00:02:48.590> more<00:02:49.069> more

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
in the chest so we've become more more

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.190 
in the chest so we've become more more
v-shaped<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:51.380> obviously<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.160> lot<00:02:52.700> leaner

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.000 

compare<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.040> with<00:02:56.580> Don's<00:02:57.150> numbers

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010

strength training is going to be is
going<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.880> be<00:03:32.000> paramount<00:03:32.350> paramount

going to be paramount paramount

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.970 
going to be paramount paramount
importance<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.850> get<00:03:35.030> in<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.210> results

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
importance to to get in the results

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.470 
importance to to get in the results
obviously<00:03:36.980> if<00:03:37.160> we<00:03:37.310> just<00:03:37.550> did<00:03:37.730> cardiovascular

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
obviously if we just did cardiovascular

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.450 
obviously if we just did cardiovascular
then<00:03:38.960> yes<00:03:39.380> he's<00:03:39.410> going<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.710> lose<00:03:39.920> weight<00:03:40.160> but

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
then yes he's going to lose weight but

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.190 
then yes he's going to lose weight but
he's<00:03:40.610> gonna<00:03:40.730> lose<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.420> wrong<00:03:41.600> type<00:03:41.840> of<00:03:41.870> weight

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
he's gonna lose the wrong type of weight

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.950 
he's gonna lose the wrong type of weight
and<00:03:43.160> we<00:03:43.670> don't<00:03:43.820> want<00:03:43.940> him<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.120> end<00:03:44.270> up<00:03:44.390> skinny

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
and we don't want him to end up skinny

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.250 
and we don't want him to end up skinny
because<00:03:45.490> against<00:03:46.490> Don<00:03:46.730> on<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.240> pitch<00:03:47.420> he's

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
because against Don on the pitch he's

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.840 
because against Don on the pitch he's
not<00:03:48.470> really<00:03:48.680> going<00:03:48.800> to<00:03:48.890> stack<00:03:49.100> up<00:03:49.340> so

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
not really going to stack up so

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.820 
not really going to stack up so
definitely<00:03:50.600> strength<00:03:51.080> training<00:03:51.320> is<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.650> key

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
definitely strength training is the key

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.880 
definitely strength training is the key
a<00:03:52.070> bit<00:03:52.940> of<00:03:53.030> cardio<00:03:53.620> probably<00:03:54.620> a<00:03:54.680> bit<00:03:54.800> of
