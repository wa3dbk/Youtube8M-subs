here and one over here this one is kicks

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.740 
here and one over here this one is kicks
downwards<00:00:47.129> these<00:00:47.579> are<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> two<00:00:48.090> click

upwards<00:00:50.120> this<00:00:51.120> lifts<00:00:51.570> up<00:00:53.000> but<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.360> connected

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
upwards this lifts up but it's connected

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.790 
upwards this lifts up but it's connected
over<00:00:55.050> here<00:00:57.020> one<00:00:58.020> way<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.260> doing<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.649> is

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
over here one way you doing it is

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.560 
over here one way you doing it is
bending<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.399> up<00:00:59.609> but<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.120> wouldn't<00:01:00.420> recommend

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
bending this up but I wouldn't recommend

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.330 
bending this up but I wouldn't recommend
it<00:01:01.050> because<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.770> actually<00:01:01.920> end<00:01:02.250> up

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
it because you can actually end up

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.250 
it because you can actually end up

perishing this house here so the easiest

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.660 
perishing this house here so the easiest
thing<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.450> to<00:01:06.450> actually<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:07.670> unscrew

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
