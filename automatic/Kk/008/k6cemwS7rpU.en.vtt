00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
it's going to give me a very defined

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.720 
it's going to give me a very defined
front<00:02:54.150> tour<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.560> also<00:02:56.099> want<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.519> go<00:02:56.700> back

your nose because you don't want it to
be<00:03:01.200> really<00:03:01.829> harsh<00:03:02.129> because<00:03:02.370> as<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.790> can<00:03:02.939> tell

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
be really harsh because as you can tell

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.179 
be really harsh because as you can tell
that<00:03:03.329> he<00:03:03.629> is<00:03:03.750> really<00:03:03.989> dark<00:03:04.319> so<00:03:04.769> make<00:03:04.950> sure<00:03:04.980> that

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
that he is really dark so make sure that

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.860 
that he is really dark so make sure that
you<00:03:05.489> just<00:03:05.640> take<00:03:05.849> your<00:03:06.030> fingers<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.599> you<00:03:06.659> blend

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
you just take your fingers and you blend

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.199 
you just take your fingers and you blend
it<00:03:07.049> out<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.200> little<00:03:07.500> bit<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:11.150> now<00:03:12.150> I'm

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
it out a little bit so now I'm

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.149 
it out a little bit so now I'm
contouring<00:03:12.719> the<00:03:12.959> hollows<00:03:13.319> of<00:03:13.500> my<00:03:13.530> cheeks<00:03:13.980> and

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
contouring the hollows of my cheeks and

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.970 
contouring the hollows of my cheeks and
I<00:03:14.370> am<00:03:14.609> going<00:03:15.000> for<00:03:15.269> a<00:03:15.329> very<00:03:15.989> defined<00:03:16.530> point

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
I am going for a very defined point

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.729 
I am going for a very defined point
contour<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.060> if<00:03:18.239> he<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.540> really<00:03:18.810> dark<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:19.500> that

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
contour so if he is really dark but that

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.559 
contour so if he is really dark but that
looks<00:03:19.920> good<00:03:20.250> look<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.639> I<00:03:20.669> was<00:03:20.849> going<00:03:21.090> for<00:03:21.209> in

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
looks good look that I was going for in

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.000 
looks good look that I was going for in
this<00:03:21.780> book<00:03:22.049> of<00:03:22.260> course<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.680> can<00:03:22.829> always

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
this book of course you can always

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:31.160 
this book of course you can always
adjust<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:24.000> your<00:03:24.030> liking

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.380 

and<00:03:32.170> for<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.590> cheeks<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:33.099> thought<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.640> very<00:03:34.030> mop

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
and for the cheeks I thought a very mop

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.899 
and for the cheeks I thought a very mop
color<00:03:34.840> would<00:03:35.140> be<00:03:35.170> appropriate<00:03:35.920> so<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.370> decided

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
color would be appropriate so I decided

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:37.830 
color would be appropriate so I decided
to<00:03:37.030> use<00:03:37.180> NARS

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
to use NARS

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:58.920 
to use NARS
they'll<00:03:38.049> say<00:03:38.260> Vita<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:58.239> course<00:03:58.569> for<00:03:58.780> the

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
they'll say Vita and of course for the

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.530 
they'll say Vita and of course for the
lips<00:03:59.170> I'm<00:03:59.409> using<00:03:59.440> Mac's<00:04:00.069> really<00:04:00.640> boy<00:04:00.879> which<00:04:01.269> is

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540

color it's actually a retro matte so

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.309 
color it's actually a retro matte so
it's<00:04:10.030> a<00:04:10.150> little<00:04:10.299> bit<00:04:10.569> different<00:04:10.870> from<00:04:11.230> the

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
it's a little bit different from the

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.640

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
are a little bit more drying so I really

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.710 
are a little bit more drying so I really
love<00:04:17.289> this<00:04:17.530> finish<00:04:18.039> but<00:04:18.760> this<00:04:18.940> lipstick<00:04:19.479> it

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.840 
love this finish but this lipstick it
pretty<00:04:19.959> much<00:04:20.169> reminds<00:04:20.769> me<00:04:20.829> of<00:04:21.010> up<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.669> amp

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850

except<00:04:22.360> for<00:04:22.539> it<00:04:22.660> is<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:23.229> matte<00:04:23.770> finish<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:24.430> I<00:04:24.460> do

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
except for it is a matte finish so I do
