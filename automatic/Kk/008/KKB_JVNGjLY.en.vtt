 Translator: Asar Hashimli Reviewer: Vagif Hansultanov 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.727
 Hello everybody. 

00:00:04.732 --> 00:00:06.568
 I, Amanda D'Annucci, tell you the story, 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.613
 conflict resolution, psychology and neurology. 

00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:12.679
 The way to tell a story to a man 

00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:15.252
 instead of using a pile of ineffective words with it 

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:17.567
 Did you know that you would attract more attention? 

00:00:18.286 --> 00:00:22.780
 The art of painting, the natural tendency of man to the story is scientific 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.536
 in terms of psychological and neurological basis. 

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:29.859
 Human story listened 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.746
 or when a large portion of his brain is activated when he says. 

00:00:33.746 --> 00:00:35.014
 For example, telling the story 

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:36.582
 and relevant listener interaction 

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:38.876
 when they affect one another, 

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:42.358
 episodic and autobiographical memory 

00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:44.587
 execute initial coding 

00:00:44.597 --> 00:00:46.992
 the amigdala hippocampus, 

00:00:46.992 --> 00:00:50.071
 language ability management 

00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:52.506
 the left pericylviyan 

00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:54.465
 the region is relaxing. 

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:56.589
 Quite simple, 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.153
 the story is the whole human brain, 

00:00:59.153 --> 00:01:01.610
 affecting human experience. 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.475
 If just a few words have a serious impact on people, 

00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:08.747
 then how can the art of the story be stronger? 

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:11.564
 Stories can heal, 

00:01:11.564 --> 00:01:14.183
 can teach, they can inspire, 

00:01:14.183 --> 00:01:15.602
 enlighten, encourage. 

00:01:17.732 --> 00:01:19.668
 I, here, is a master's thesis in the Gallatin 

00:01:19.668 --> 00:01:22.665
 the strength of the story and its conflict resolution as well 

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.662
 I'm exploring the relationship with the issues of peace. 

00:01:25.662 --> 00:01:28.779
 The story is the most common cause of the individual's senses 

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:31.631
 It is an effective tool that can change stubborn minds. 

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:34.741
 Story as a means of communication 

00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:38.320
 can be transformed into a hacker-related work. 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.774
 There is plenty of storytelling power in the vast majority of civilizations around Man. 

00:01:43.884 --> 00:01:47.733
 Here, in New York City, she has started writing her own stories to movies, Brodvey plays, 

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:50.578
 oral folklore and print for translators 

00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:54.942
 from hunter-gatherer tribes to numerous story writers 

00:01:54.942 --> 00:01:58.000
 until all the individual and society stories transmit each other. 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.249
 According to the chef, the stories we talk about the lives of ourselves or others 

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:08.676
 are the widespread textual forms we create, share, and share. 

00:02:08.676 --> 00:02:12.854
 In the story we dream, dream, we see in advance, hopefully, 

00:02:12.854 --> 00:02:15.611
 remember, we lose hope 

00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:18.734
 do, learn, hate, and love. 

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:22.303
 We do all this through the story. 

00:02:22.883 --> 00:02:25.173
 In many parts of the world, where conflicts are over 

00:02:25.173 --> 00:02:28.663
 they used it to educate peace. 

00:02:28.663 --> 00:02:31.554
 So why are stories so much to reduce contradictions 

00:02:31.554 --> 00:02:33.251
 can create many opportunities? 

00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:36.262
 The stories are fictional or not, but they are a number of incidents 

00:02:36.262 --> 00:02:37.524
 tells you how it happened. 

00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:41.265
 In addition, the story does not only mention a number of events, 

00:02:41.265 --> 00:02:44.169
 but also explains their interaction. 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:46.219
 According to Van der Rohey, 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.530
 The purpose of understanding the story is its 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.677
 meaningfully interconnected 

00:02:50.677 --> 00:02:53.904
 separate parts of each separate 

00:02:53.904 --> 00:02:55.468
 to create a memory image. 

00:02:57.032 --> 00:02:58.597
 Believe it or not, believe it, 

00:02:58.597 --> 00:03:01.395
 At Copenhagen University, Michael Jackson is a researcher and he claims, 

00:03:04.193 --> 00:03:06.992
 story talk is worth living together in the war, as well as in the peace of mind 

00:03:06.992 --> 00:03:09.449
 to evaluate, discuss, social and ethical strategies 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:13.126
 to allow them to think deeply about their style of negotiation. 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.860
 Especially in Sierra Leone where the conflict is high. 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.837
 Jackson's research is primarily based on Koronko in Sierra Leone 

00:03:18.837 --> 00:03:20.574
 talking to people about the story. 

00:03:20.574 --> 00:03:22.932
 Throughout his sessions, 

00:03:22.932 --> 00:03:27.273
 talked about the great political and social significance of the related people in his stories. 

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:31.174
 And some stories tell the story to the audience 

00:03:31.174 --> 00:03:33.601
 their participation in their stories. 

00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:38.228
 The participant side of this approach is politically charged to listeners 

00:03:38.228 --> 00:03:41.044
 the ethical meanings of the story 

00:03:41.044 --> 00:03:42.960
 to understand. 

00:03:44.138 --> 00:03:46.218
 Jackson claims he does not have to give up 

00:03:46.218 --> 00:03:49.558
 it does not always work towards a single position of the situation. 

00:03:49.558 --> 00:03:53.939
 But, simply, sing, sing, sing, 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.407
 talk, share ideas, hopeless 

00:03:57.407 --> 00:04:01.426
 and is mainly confidential with personal experience short-term 

00:04:01.426 --> 00:04:04.875
 as well as to eliminate them. 

00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:06.905
 Research shows that, 

00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:10.857
 participants share the story in a mutual way 

00:04:10.857 --> 00:04:12.629
 it feels loyal to the community. 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.533
 In addition, many active participation and individual experiences at the partner event 

00:04:16.573 --> 00:04:19.193
 common point-to-point reference 

00:04:19.518 --> 00:04:21.843
 but within the public domain 

00:04:22.104 --> 00:04:24.301
 develops strong relationships. 

00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:27.313
 Story speech is a concept of civil society 

00:04:27.313 --> 00:04:29.881
 and common issues 

00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:32.639
 and provides opportunities for free people to discuss 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.417
 provide individuals with personal expression in the group environment. 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:40.278
 Similarly, Israeli and Palestinian students are among the Israelis 

00:04:40.278 --> 00:04:43.183
 was used to investigate the contradiction. 

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:49.049
 Because both sides view the other as a criminal and self-sacrifice, Baron, 

00:04:49.049 --> 00:04:52.070
 talking about a problem that is more than a conflict. 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.603
 Groups in the first few sessions 

00:04:55.603 --> 00:04:59.136
 the other side of the time during the interview 

00:04:59.136 --> 00:05:02.671
 because they were exposed to more torment. 

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:06.327
 The story based approach used in this application 

00:05:09.035 --> 00:05:11.743
 understanding or accepting both groups 

00:05:11.743 --> 00:05:14.287
 stories related to difficulty 

00:05:14.287 --> 00:05:17.511
 which allowed the parties to approve the aspect. 

00:05:17.511 --> 00:05:19.420
 A Palestinian lady wrote in her diary: 

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:23.240
 The Israelis can not go home with their father 

00:05:23.271 --> 00:05:25.064
 Talk about his feelings 

00:05:25.107 --> 00:05:27.319
 For the first time, I thought, 

00:05:27.364 --> 00:05:30.171
 The Israelites are not just enemies 

00:05:30.472 --> 00:05:33.751
 people with similar feelings. 

00:05:33.775 --> 00:05:35.724
 Their stories 

00:05:36.007 --> 00:05:39.145
 from the victim's / guilty idea of ​​the group 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:40.896
 led to the advancement of the admission phase. 

00:05:44.285 --> 00:05:46.677
 Stories are the values ​​of the individual or society, 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:51.798
 principles, hopes, fears and dreams, and respect for the listener 

00:05:52.025 --> 00:05:55.151
 indicating the connection path that impels the perception of acceptance. 

00:05:55.476 --> 00:05:59.385
 In addition to the intellectual perception of the story, the reader's heart 

00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:02.244
 and the spirit, the listener, the inner thoughts 

00:06:02.244 --> 00:06:04.919
 eye-catching tool. 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.386
 Thanks. 

00:06:06.388 --> 00:06:10.388
 (Applause)
