00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.379
 hello to all I am delighted to you 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.969
 find for this new formation 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.469
 devoted entirely to the output 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.089
 escapes body stretched to the bars 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.800
 asymmetric 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.110
 we will take advantage of the six video sequences 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.680
 separate and 90-minute course 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.119
 to understand technically this gesture 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.309
 what actions are needed in 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.200
 the preparatory impulse to the close of 

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:31.439
 the angle of opening of the hands and in 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.120
 the air before getting us 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.130
 will try to determine which 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.989
 difference there is a momentum for 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.449
 a scarf and one for a grand tour 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.620
 back as we will see in 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.960
 each training 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.239
 the importance of the prerequisites there is 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.469
 little in terms of quantity but according to the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.420
 career plan that you schedule 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.059
 for your gymnasts some can 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.980
 ask for a few years of work we 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.199
 will spend about 35 minutes 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.089
 pedagogical analysis with a range 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.760
 complete work in which you 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.010
 find more than 30 workshops 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.839
 we also chose here 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.850
 to add 20 educational on the range 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.210
 learning the pullover and the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.740
 rear kaboom or trampoline this range 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.230
 should allow those who 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.060
 have one to serenely address his 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.540
 gestures and increase the speed 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.090
 learning the breakaway the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.400
 Specific physical preparation will be 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 broken down into two parts the first 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.840
 resuming the sun exercises with 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.910
 some additional additions and the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.990
 second on own actions let go 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.390
 and or sectoral we will meet again 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.700
 also handling with views 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.710
 general and in-car camera for 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.010
 understand actions at the level of 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.640
 the coach and to close a 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.230
 live sequence with two case studies 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.110
 the goal being to learn to observe 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.080
 to discover the faults understand 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.600
 the probable origin and so build a 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.640
 correction strategy 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.670
 teach is executed does not escape back 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.800
 and often in itself a real adventure 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.350
 with suspenseful emotions and 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.259
 a lot of work but what a pleasure to 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.849
 finish a movement on a beautiful exit 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.650
 I hope this training will help you 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.650
 to take up this challenge with your gymnasts
