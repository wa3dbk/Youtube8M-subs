00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.840 

I'm<00:00:05.940> Natasha<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.779> I'm<00:00:06.899> here<00:00:07.140> from<00:00:07.290> p2i

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:07.850 
I'm Natasha and I'm here from p2i

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.160 
I'm Natasha and I'm here from p2i
demonstrating<00:00:08.850> our<00:00:09.000> hydrophobic<00:00:09.900> nano

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
demonstrating our hydrophobic nano

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.200 
demonstrating our hydrophobic nano
coating<00:00:10.590> technology<00:00:11.219> so

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.340 

well<00:00:15.210> I'm<00:00:15.389> going<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.599> start<00:00:15.840> with<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.110> tissue

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
well I'm going to start with the tissue

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.070 
well I'm going to start with the tissue
this<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.860> a<00:00:16.890> bit<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.220> party<00:00:17.430> trick<00:00:17.730> for<00:00:18.000> us

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
this is a bit of a party trick for us

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.359 
this is a bit of a party trick for us
one<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.110> these<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.560> treated<00:00:19.890> with<00:00:19.920> our<00:00:20.189> nano

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
one of these is treated with our nano

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.100 
one of these is treated with our nano
coating<00:00:20.789> technology<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.599> the<00:00:21.720> other<00:00:21.869> one

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
coating technology and the other one

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.769 
coating technology and the other one
isn't<00:00:22.439> now<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.669> coating<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> thousand

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
isn't now the coating is a thousand

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.120 
isn't now the coating is a thousand
times<00:00:24.990> thinner<00:00:25.259> than<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.590> human<00:00:25.740> hair<00:00:25.950> so

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
times thinner than a human hair so

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.220 
times thinner than a human hair so
actually<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.000> can't<00:00:27.240> see<00:00:27.509> a<00:00:27.539> difference<00:00:27.779> you

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
actually you can't see a difference you

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.769 
actually you can't see a difference you
can't<00:00:28.439> feel<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.950> difference<00:00:29.369> but<00:00:29.970> if<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.510> put

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
can't feel the difference but if I put

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.600 
can't feel the difference but if I put
these<00:00:30.900> into<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.289> water<00:00:31.590> you're<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.430> see

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
these into the water you're going to see

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.130 
these into the water you're going to see
a<00:00:32.640> very<00:00:32.940> big<00:00:33.620> difference

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.730 

normal<00:00:38.950> tissues<00:00:39.340> are<00:00:39.520> wet<00:00:39.880> like<00:00:40.090> you'd<00:00:40.240> expect

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
normal tissues are wet like you'd expect

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.950 
normal tissues are wet like you'd expect
but<00:00:41.740> on<00:00:41.860> our<00:00:42.060> hydrophobic<00:00:43.060> tissue<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.750> water

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
but on our hydrophobic tissue the water

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.360 
but on our hydrophobic tissue the water
simply<00:00:44.290> beads<00:00:44.650> up<00:00:44.890> and<00:00:45.100> rolls<00:00:45.310> up<00:00:47.370> your

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
simply beads up and rolls up your

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.940 
simply beads up and rolls up your
company<00:00:48.760> to<00:00:48.850> make<00:00:49.000> a<00:00:49.030> tissue

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
company to make a tissue

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.770 
company to make a tissue
we<00:00:50.950> don't<00:00:51.160> make<00:00:51.340> tissues<00:00:51.730> we<00:00:52.000> make<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.390> coding

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
we don't make tissues we make the coding

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.920 
we don't make tissues we make the coding
so<00:00:53.500> working<00:00:54.460> with<00:00:54.610> electronic<00:00:55.270> manufacturers

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
so working with electronic manufacturers

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.560 
so working with electronic manufacturers
like<00:00:56.290> Motorola<00:00:56.650> and<00:00:57.130> TCL<00:00:57.700> we<00:00:58.210> apply<00:00:58.510> this

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
like Motorola and TCL we apply this

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.799 
like Motorola and TCL we apply this
technology<00:00:59.020> onto<00:00:59.940> electronic<00:01:00.940> devices<00:01:01.270> and

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
technology onto electronic devices and

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.410 
technology onto electronic devices and
I'm<00:01:01.960> going<00:01:02.110> to<00:01:02.170> show<00:01:02.350> you<00:01:02.379> why<00:01:02.680> here<00:01:03.420> so

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
I'm going to show you why here so

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.420 
I'm going to show you why here so
normally<00:01:04.900> when<00:01:05.080> you<00:01:05.140> get<00:01:05.379> your<00:01:05.620> components

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
normally when you get your components

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.300 
normally when you get your components
wet<00:01:06.760> you<00:01:07.630> can<00:01:07.810> see<00:01:08.020> that<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.320> water<00:01:08.530> spreads

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
wet you can see that the water spreads

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.940 
wet you can see that the water spreads
out<00:01:09.640> on<00:01:09.910> the<00:01:10.060> surface<00:01:10.540> and<00:01:11.200> in<00:01:11.380> fact<00:01:11.619> in<00:01:11.830> this

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
out on the surface and in fact in this

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.820 
out on the surface and in fact in this
point<00:01:12.250> right<00:01:12.550> in<00:01:12.759> here<00:01:13.320> capillary<00:01:14.320> action<00:01:14.530> is

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
point right in here capillary action is

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.780 
point right in here capillary action is
pulling<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:15.430> water<00:01:15.729> into<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.420> phone<00:01:17.100> now<00:01:18.100> on

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
pulling that water into the phone now on

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.290 
pulling that water into the phone now on
our<00:01:19.180> hydrophobic<00:01:20.170> phone<00:01:20.670> instead<00:01:21.670> of<00:01:21.729> being

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
our hydrophobic phone instead of being

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.170 
our hydrophobic phone instead of being
pulled<00:01:22.630> into<00:01:22.899> the<00:01:23.140> device<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:24.340> water<00:01:24.580> beads

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
pulled into the device the water beads

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.410 
pulled into the device the water beads
up<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.040> water<00:01:27.280> molecules<00:01:27.820> are<00:01:28.000> now<00:01:28.149> more

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
up so the water molecules are now more

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.109 
up so the water molecules are now more
interested<00:01:28.960> in<00:01:29.080> themselves<00:01:29.610> than<00:01:30.610> that<00:01:30.850> and

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
interested in themselves than that and

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.080 
interested in themselves than that and
if<00:01:31.479> I<00:01:31.630> give<00:01:31.899> it<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.050> little<00:01:32.200> tip<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:33.090> water

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
if I give it a little tip that water

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.340 
if I give it a little tip that water
will<00:01:34.300> come<00:01:34.479> straight<00:01:34.690> off

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.560 

we<00:01:38.920> would<00:01:39.070> work<00:01:39.280> with<00:01:39.310> brands<00:01:39.790> like<00:01:40.150> Motorola

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
we would work with brands like Motorola

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.929 
we would work with brands like Motorola
and<00:01:41.080> right<00:01:41.409> at<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.710> end<00:01:41.860> of<00:01:42.070> their<00:01:42.220> processing

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
and right at the end of their processing

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.510 
and right at the end of their processing
we<00:01:43.360> would<00:01:43.540> go<00:01:43.689> on<00:01:43.930> just<00:01:44.560> pry<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.830> packaging

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
we would go on just pry the packaging

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.940 
we would go on just pry the packaging
and<00:01:46.240> supplied<00:01:46.600> in<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.869> plasma<00:01:47.080> chamber<00:01:47.470> which

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
and supplied in a plasma chamber which

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.859 
and supplied in a plasma chamber which
looked<00:01:48.220> similar<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:48.790> fridge<00:01:49.150> and<00:01:49.600> we'll<00:01:49.690> put

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
looked similar to a fridge and we'll put

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.810 
looked similar to a fridge and we'll put
about<00:01:50.080> 800<00:01:50.619> bones<00:01:50.830> in<00:01:51.100> there<00:01:51.280> at<00:01:51.460> once

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
about 800 bones in there at once

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.570 
about 800 bones in there at once
and<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:53.200> process<00:01:53.680> goes<00:01:53.950> down<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.430> a<00:01:54.460> low

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
and the process goes down to a low

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.840 
and the process goes down to a low
pressure<00:01:55.210> and<00:01:56.049> a<00:01:56.200> gas<00:01:56.409> is<00:01:56.649> applied<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.580> that

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
pressure and a gas is applied and that

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.490 
pressure and a gas is applied and that
goes<00:01:58.060> both<00:01:58.420> on<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.690> externals<00:01:59.259> and<00:01:59.440> the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
goes both on the externals and the

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.020 
goes both on the externals and the
internals<00:02:00.070> of<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.310> device

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.279 

absolutely<00:02:05.020> we<00:02:05.320> lost<00:02:05.560> in<00:02:05.820> October<00:02:06.820> 2011<00:02:07.630> with

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
absolutely we lost in October 2011 with

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.700 
absolutely we lost in October 2011 with
Motorola<00:02:08.830> and<00:02:09.610> in<00:02:09.759> October<00:02:10.300> 2012<00:02:11.020> we<00:02:11.410> launched

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
Motorola and in October 2012 we launched

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.870 
Motorola and in October 2012 we launched
with<00:02:11.830> TCL<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:12.640> Alcatel<00:02:13.120> OneTouch<00:02:14.550> now<00:02:15.550> this

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
with TCL so Alcatel OneTouch now this

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.760 
with TCL so Alcatel OneTouch now this
we're<00:02:16.210> very<00:02:16.480> excited<00:02:16.690> about<00:02:17.140> because<00:02:17.470> this<00:02:17.710> is

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
we're very excited about because this is

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.980 
we're very excited about because this is
almost<00:02:18.340> our<00:02:18.460> next-generation<00:02:18.990> technology

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
almost our next-generation technology

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.410 
almost our next-generation technology
it's<00:02:20.560> got<00:02:20.800> similar<00:02:21.100> hydrophobic<00:02:21.970> benefits

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
it's got similar hydrophobic benefits

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.630 
it's got similar hydrophobic benefits
with<00:02:22.660> flash<00:02:22.930> proof<00:02:23.200> but<00:02:23.770> it's<00:02:23.950> got<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.130> barrier

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
with flash proof but it's got a barrier

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.420 
with flash proof but it's got a barrier
technology<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.959> it's<00:02:26.290> actually<00:02:26.560> physically

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
technology so it's actually physically

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.980 
technology so it's actually physically
stopping<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.000> water<00:02:28.209> molecules<00:02:28.750> from

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
stopping the water molecules from

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.520 
stopping the water molecules from
interacting<00:02:29.890> with<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.130> electronics

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.860 

that<00:02:34.130> enables<00:02:34.550> us<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.760> have<00:02:35.060> had<00:02:35.300> this<00:02:35.480> phone

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
that enables us to have had this phone

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.890 
that enables us to have had this phone
under<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.470> water<00:02:36.680> for<00:02:37.610> an<00:02:37.700> hour<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.390> fifty

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
under the water for an hour and fifty

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.270 
under the water for an hour and fifty
five<00:02:39.080> minutes<00:02:39.560> now

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.890 

why<00:02:44.910> just<00:02:45.060> gonna<00:02:45.240> leave<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.570> there<00:02:45.750> all

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
why just gonna leave it in there all

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.590 
why just gonna leave it in there all
night

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
night

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.600 
night
and<00:02:48.600> it's<00:02:48.900> packed<00:02:49.110> on<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.470> preset<00:02:49.950> up<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.460> go

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
and it's packed on a preset up that go

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.910 
and it's packed on a preset up that go
standeth<00:02:51.120> some<00:02:51.750> sort<00:02:51.960> of<00:02:51.990> action<00:02:52.290> stream<00:02:52.650> this

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
standeth some sort of action stream this

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.000 
standeth some sort of action stream this
is<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.100> standing<00:02:53.580> Samsung<00:02:54.060> Galaxy<00:02:54.570> s3

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
is the standing Samsung Galaxy s3

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.630 
is the standing Samsung Galaxy s3
well<00:02:56.970> we've<00:02:57.180> applied<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.570> and

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.490 

well<00:03:02.060> it's<00:03:02.210> a<00:03:02.330> nano-coating<00:03:02.990> which<00:03:03.140> is<00:03:03.290> about

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
well it's a nano-coating which is about

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.990 
well it's a nano-coating which is about
a<00:03:03.560> thousand<00:03:04.070> times<00:03:04.100> thinner<00:03:04.520> than<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.760> human

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
a thousand times thinner than a human

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.120 
a thousand times thinner than a human
hair<00:03:05.210> so<00:03:05.900> actually<00:03:06.320> the<00:03:06.500> coating<00:03:06.890> is<00:03:07.070> applied

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
hair so actually the coating is applied

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.180 
hair so actually the coating is applied
at<00:03:07.640> that<00:03:07.820> low<00:03:08.060> volume<00:03:08.540> low<00:03:08.900> pressure<00:03:08.930> as<00:03:09.770> a<00:03:09.830> gas

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
at that low volume low pressure as a gas

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.730 
at that low volume low pressure as a gas
so<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:11.030> doesn't<00:03:11.330> necessarily<00:03:12.260> need<00:03:12.380> to<00:03:12.440> get

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
so it doesn't necessarily need to get

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.790 
so it doesn't necessarily need to get
opened<00:03:13.070> up<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:13.910> can<00:03:14.090> go<00:03:14.180> in<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.600> throughout

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
opened up you can go in and throughout

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.260 
opened up you can go in and throughout
yeah<00:03:15.800> we're<00:03:16.220> talking<00:03:16.310> about<00:03:16.550> gas<00:03:16.760> now

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
yeah we're talking about gas now

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.620 
yeah we're talking about gas now
well<00:03:17.990> if<00:03:18.730> nobody's<00:03:19.730> find<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.300> me<00:03:20.420> recently

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
well if nobody's find it to me recently

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.090 
well if nobody's find it to me recently
which<00:03:20.990> I<00:03:21.140> thought<00:03:21.290> was<00:03:21.440> very<00:03:21.500> good<00:03:21.950> it's

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
which I thought was very good it's

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.160 
which I thought was very good it's
almost<00:03:22.310> like<00:03:22.700> it's<00:03:22.910> growing<00:03:23.150> on<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.960> surface

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
almost like it's growing on the surface

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.590 
almost like it's growing on the surface
so<00:03:24.920> we're<00:03:25.070> forming<00:03:25.460> these<00:03:25.610> very<00:03:26.000> very<00:03:26.360> very

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
so we're forming these very very very

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.930 
so we're forming these very very very
tiny<00:03:26.960> polymer<00:03:27.590> chains<00:03:27.890> on<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.310> surface<00:03:28.700> of

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
tiny polymer chains on the surface of

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.930 
tiny polymer chains on the surface of
the<00:03:29.120> product<00:03:29.470> but<00:03:30.470> right<00:03:31.100> there<00:03:31.310> you<00:03:31.459> kind<00:03:31.790> of

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
the product but right there you kind of

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.280 
the product but right there you kind of
like<00:03:32.120> straight<00:03:32.780> on<00:03:33.020> to<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.230> phone

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
like straight on to the phone

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.770 
like straight on to the phone
no<00:03:34.890> we<00:03:35.159> put<00:03:35.189> it<00:03:35.459> into<00:03:35.819> one<00:03:35.969> of<00:03:36.090> these<00:03:36.209> plasma

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
no we put it into one of these plasma

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.809 
no we put it into one of these plasma
chamber<00:03:36.959> machines<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:38.159> we'll<00:03:38.310> put<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.609> phone

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
chamber machines so we'll put the phone

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.420 
chamber machines so we'll put the phone
in<00:03:39.060> there<00:03:39.299> and<00:03:39.599> lower<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.260> air<00:03:40.739> pressure<00:03:41.069> so

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
in there and lower the air pressure so

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.149 
in there and lower the air pressure so
when<00:03:41.909> you<00:03:42.030> apply<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.450> gas<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.439> put<00:03:43.799> it<00:03:43.920> under

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
when you apply the gas and put it under

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.610 
when you apply the gas and put it under
a<00:03:44.189> plasma<00:03:44.670> it's<00:03:45.150> going<00:03:45.359> to<00:03:45.420> grow<00:03:45.719> all<00:03:46.349> those

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
a plasma it's going to grow all those

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.729 
a plasma it's going to grow all those
molecules<00:03:47.549> together<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.870> form<00:03:49.109> these<00:03:49.290> polymer

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
molecules together to form these polymer

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.900 
molecules together to form these polymer
chains

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.080 

yes

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.550 

we<00:03:58.090> can<00:03:58.330> do<00:03:58.480> yes<00:03:58.690> so<00:03:58.930> when<00:03:59.110> we<00:03:59.230> work<00:03:59.410> with

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
we can do yes so when we work with

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.740 
we can do yes so when we work with
Motorola<00:04:00.069> on<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.550> splash-proof<00:04:00.819> technology

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
Motorola on the splash-proof technology

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.479 
Motorola on the splash-proof technology
then<00:04:02.140> that's<00:04:02.319> actually<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.739> really<00:04:02.950> important

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
then that's actually a really important

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.250 
then that's actually a really important
part<00:04:03.640> of<00:04:03.849> us<00:04:04.060> being<00:04:04.300> able<00:04:04.450> to<00:04:04.599> commercialize

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
part of us being able to commercialize

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.890 
part of us being able to commercialize
the<00:04:05.470> technology<00:04:05.819> because<00:04:06.819> that<00:04:07.360> way<00:04:07.540> we<00:04:07.750> can

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
the technology because that way we can

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.600 
the technology because that way we can
be<00:04:07.989> right<00:04:08.230> at<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:08.410> end<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:08.770> processing<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.489> we

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
be right at the end of processing and we

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.250 
be right at the end of processing and we
don't<00:04:09.819> interfere<00:04:10.209> with<00:04:10.870> their<00:04:11.050> production

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
don't interfere with their production

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.780 
don't interfere with their production
line<00:04:11.709> making<00:04:12.459> us<00:04:12.580> very<00:04:12.850> cost<00:04:13.330> effective

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
line making us very cost effective

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.180 
line making us very cost effective
yeah<00:04:15.390> so<00:04:15.659> dump<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:16.049> ball<00:04:16.199> for<00:04:16.410> us<00:04:16.500> is<00:04:16.709> still<00:04:16.979> just

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
yeah so dump a ball for us is still just

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.650 
yeah so dump a ball for us is still just
the<00:04:17.310> technology<00:04:17.639> we're<00:04:18.180> working<00:04:18.540> with

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
the technology we're working with

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.539 
the technology we're working with
pioneering<00:04:19.169> brands<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.769> commercialize<00:04:20.370> the

well<00:04:41.479> this<00:04:41.599> is<00:04:41.749> actually<00:04:42.169> a<00:04:42.199> water<00:04:42.469> repellent

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:42.739 
well this is actually a water repellent

00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:45.579 
well this is actually a water repellent

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
water is getting into the device and

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.029 
water is getting into the device and
actually<00:04:52.879> here<00:04:53.389> this<00:04:53.929> phone<00:04:54.259> has<00:04:54.739> water

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
actually here this phone has water

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.789 
actually here this phone has water
inside<00:04:55.610> of<00:04:55.669> it<00:04:55.909> it's<00:04:56.389> full<00:04:56.719> of<00:04:56.809> water<00:04:56.959> is<00:04:57.529> full

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:57.799 
inside of it it's full of water is full

00:04:57.799 --> 00:04:59.709 
inside of it it's full of water is full
of<00:04:57.919> water<00:04:58.069> right<00:04:58.339> now<00:04:58.519> but<00:04:59.360> it's<00:04:59.509> still

00:04:59.709 --> 00:04:59.719 
of water right now but it's still

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:03.219 
of water right now but it's still
working

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.469 

okay<00:05:04.229> so<00:05:04.289> it's

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
okay so it's

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.950 
okay so it's
yeah

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
yeah

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.900 
yeah
a<00:05:09.020> certain<00:05:09.590> amount<00:05:09.710> of<00:05:09.800> time<00:05:09.979> to<00:05:10.130> get<00:05:10.250> it

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
a certain amount of time to get it

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.670 
a certain amount of time to get it
well<00:05:11.450> actually<00:05:11.780> what's<00:05:12.200> going<00:05:12.380> to<00:05:12.410> happen

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
well actually what's going to happen

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.560 
well actually what's going to happen
fast<00:05:12.920> is<00:05:13.100> that<00:05:13.250> the<00:05:13.370> phone<00:05:13.610> battery<00:05:14.330> will<00:05:14.540> run

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
fast is that the phone battery will run

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.480 
fast is that the phone battery will run
out<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.170> we'll<00:05:15.410> need<00:05:15.560> to<00:05:15.740> take<00:05:15.890> it<00:05:16.100> out

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.860 

well<00:05:21.490> one<00:05:21.639> of<00:05:21.759> the<00:05:21.849> reasons<00:05:22.210> why<00:05:22.300> we<00:05:22.509> apply<00:05:22.810> it

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
well one of the reasons why we apply it

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.020 
well one of the reasons why we apply it
in<00:05:23.169> this<00:05:23.289> plasma<00:05:23.740> chamber<00:05:24.129> is<00:05:24.370> to<00:05:24.580> get<00:05:24.789> that

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
in this plasma chamber is to get that

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.999 
in this plasma chamber is to get that
bond<00:05:25.360> with<00:05:25.659> the<00:05:25.780> surface<00:05:26.229> so<00:05:26.409> it<00:05:26.500> forms<00:05:26.919> a

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
bond with the surface so it forms a

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.520 
bond with the surface so it forms a
covalent<00:05:27.370> bond<00:05:27.879> so<00:05:28.330> permanently<00:05:28.960> applied<00:05:29.289> to

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
covalent bond so permanently applied to

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.850 
covalent bond so permanently applied to
the<00:05:29.650> server

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.880
