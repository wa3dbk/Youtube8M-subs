00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.120
 hello manfred flavio simonetti here 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.339
 today it's about alcohol on 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.960
 weekend as it looks so from a 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:21.259
 very important topic and I want to go there 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.570
 on a cornerstone comes the very 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:28.789
 important if you like football for example 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:31.699
 play handball basketball golf was 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.219
 there are hardly any 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.579
 sport seen so holistically 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.609
 must be like fitness because you can 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:44.980
 at football very high in the league 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.980
 For example, it could even play 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.269
 third second maybe even first 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.329
 play bad and the guys have the 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.609
 a minimal idea what it's all about 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.500
 why diet with them at all 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.469
 important is that they focus 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.210
 Very much on training but 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.250
 The diet is actually complete 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.680
 break and you could of course 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.119
 now in fitness say yes training is 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.820
 the a and o ne you can see that many 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.570
 actually so common in the gym 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.520
 inside are 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.360
 but once you get them outside of 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.560
 Gyms sees you thinking young 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.170
 somehow it looks like nutrition 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.850
 no that is unfortunately not respected so 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.079
 What I mean by that and it has it 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.130
 briefly distracted by the theme is the fitness 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.040
 successful only possible if 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.899
 training and nutrition is combined 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.450
 in a matter then you can 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.579
 build successful muscles and it is 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.140
 in many other sports there can 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.750
 you just do that training enough 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.820
 completely from athletics and and 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.380
 and since many can successfully 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.159
 a zero idea of ​​nutrition 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.680
 That's what I want to say with it means 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.100
 actually fitness is a full time job 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.060
 that means you start from the training 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.219
 Training made her less than 5 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.250
 percent off in the week from the deployment 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.420
 you bring because I'll tell you if 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.609
 three quarters of an hour trains 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.450
 three times a week which is enough then 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:10.580
 you have to spend the rest of the time around you 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.940
 regeneration recovery and also around the 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.460
 take care of nutrition and if 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.910
 these two additional components not 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.520
 then you have a problem because you 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.530
 you will unsuccessfully build muscle and 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.130
 that's the topic where we go 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.780
 Alcohol on the weekend yes you can 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.000
 alcohol beverage on the weekend 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.770
 Friday evening for example, I would 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.810
 say yes I am always his opinion 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.750
 maybe two maybe three 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.120
 also a cockpit the problem with the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.310
 thing is but if you of course the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.430
 go through the whole night and walk 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.030
 at five o'clock what maybe nothing 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.920
 eaten 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.310
 that means you have to last times 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.800
 makes you eat at 5 o'clock 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.530
 and sleeps until 12 o'clock 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.190
 then you have two meals 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.530
 missed that means in the morning and 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.330
 between meal exactly and the two 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.320
 can already at a person is 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.400
 to build up the difficulties of the muscles 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.770
 Make up 1000 calories 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.230
 if now on saturday the same again 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.550
 Do you have 1000 calories again? 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.220
 that means that over that 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.650
 weekend 2000 calories too little 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.100
 Eat and that can eventually 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.540
 when muscle build also express that is 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.739
 You 're going to party twice a week 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.030
 little sleep prolonged regeneration 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.980
 drinks now then even alcohol to the 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.420
 delay the whole thing again and then 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.130
 maybe you have during the week 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.450
 Maybe it was gas 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.880
 even four or five times during training 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.220
 but the problem with the whole is that 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.540
 you the other components have workout 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.239
 and actually that much 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.290
 then you have nutrition 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.420
 underestimated and of course the 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.180
 regeneration especially on the weekend and 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.680
 the two important components 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.230
 that is the alcohol of the 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.530
 regeneration extended as you need 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.820
 longer until you recover and sleep 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.530
 maybe you made up for it somewhere? 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.780
 But the diet is important 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.610
 to recover the nutrients that is 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.230
 if you train then you build first 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.030
 Let's have dinner and help 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.720
 to rebuild your food 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.090
 actually the most important component 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.600
 otherwise you are after the training 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.940
 actually only muscles off and that's why 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.930
 important egg white carbohydrates fat it 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.030
 everything has to be right 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.450
 and then you can say okay I drink 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:33.110
 now two to three beer but the 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.960
 question that generally arises is how 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.510
 you will come far if you have more 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.710
 drinking alcohol on the weekend and it 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.150
 of course, comes on the target to the 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.010
 means if you say yes I want 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.010
 of course muscles on bombs right 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.910
 stark body i want to look like 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:53.240
 i want to have 6 percent body fat and 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.580
 80 kilos dry, yes, then it is natural 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.620
 hard or if you say I have since 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.690
 weeks and months no muscles anymore 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.460
 and I do not know what it is 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.650
 Maybe that's because 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.210
 you the nutrition and training on 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.210
 weekend just not right 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.830
 heeded and just too much party 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.480
 Do and too little on your diet 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.350
 Eighth is what you can do in football 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.870
 maybe allow 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.370
 Of course, this can be done on the weekend 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.830
 maybe drink two three beer 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.110
 and once a two meals fail 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.120
 let that do not matter so much 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.340
 as if you want to build muscle 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.750
 if you have difficulties anyway 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.140
 gain weight 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.729
 then that's exactly where you are 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.830
 then you do not need to start 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.990
 question of the alcohol to ask but the 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.669
 I'm ready to pay in price 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.680
 to have a good body and then 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.740
 I have to adjust my diet 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.870
 then I just have to go on the weekend 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.340
 Pay the price and say hey I 'll do it 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.720
 not too long party I drink 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.790
 too lacking because I just notice 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.620
 no muscles on or otherwise 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.790
 say I continue exactly like that but 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.890
 Resident I do not why you 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.610
 You can have problems with muscles 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.400
 build 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.140
 So that's the key question 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.100
 are you ready to pay the price yes 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.310
 or no 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.960
