00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.619
 hello friends from the grill with the day of 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.200
 today we are going to make some bananas and 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.450
 grilled apples 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.210
 good what we are going to do with the 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.940
 apples is that we're going to take out the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.720
 center can be with some out every 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.410
 two 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:44.490
 so we take out in this way the 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.950
 center to the block and we already have our 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.850
 our game ready 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:55.360
 then we are going to put it on a paper 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.290
 aluminum and we are going to put them 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.850
 granny chocolate 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:05.600
 that then it's going to look really 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:09.490
 inside the grill then the 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.490
 we fill with chocolate and we push 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.020
 and with this we are going to have our 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.420
 apples 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.470
 ready to take them 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.470
 we wrap them 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.000
 now we are going to put our 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.490
 apples and our bananas taiwan to 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.060
 our bananas we are going to use a 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.060
 Mascabado and cream sugar dressing 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.820
 it is very easy to prepare the dressing 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.520
 for our bananas and that we put the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.649
 Brown sugar 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.649
 and we put cream on her 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.390
 already with this nothing else regulating 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:15.300
 let's see how cream 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.300
 it takes a lot of color 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.700
 and ready this cream we keep it so that 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.700
 be cold 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.110
 in this case we are going to use our 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.459
 extension to put the apples there and 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.900
 the bananas we put them in this way 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.900
 and we close our egg 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.330
 and there in a few moments more we will come 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.090
 here and we are seeing how our 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.599
 bananas go darkening 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.180
 and as they go forward we're going to 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.080
 out until the black skin and put 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.270
 open up a little 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.770
 let's check our banana and 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.770
 our apples 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.569
 and that's how they are doing well 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.390
 they are a little darker 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.859
 As you can see the skin starts to 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.859
 open some of the bananas 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.300
 they should not be 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.689
 well it goes to our bananas in our 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.310
 apples and as we already are 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:48.390
 opening the bananas 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.390
 same this other 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.530
 it's getting dark we're going to wait 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.010
 good friends as we see already 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.220
 darkened bananas 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.069
 the shell has already opened 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.489
 and we're going to take it out 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.950
 like our apples also already 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.430
 are ready to know if our 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:17.440
 apples have already been roasted what we can 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.720
 to do is we touch them and they feel soft 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.220
 already at that moment we can already take them out 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.650
 what are we going to do with our banana is 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.320
 remove the shell 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.840
 very carefully since the banana like 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.020
 you can see it is quite 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.720
 pretty soft then we're going to 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.270
 remove the shell there and we removed the 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.139
 shell then what we are going to do is 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.840
 split it 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.780
 or they can trade it in fact like that 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.400
 that can be served 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.400
 then we are going to leave 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.440
 and this is where we are going to add 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.440
 our cream 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.790
 how it looks 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.680
 our apple what we are going to do is 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.840
 that we remove the aluminum foil and 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.670
 we can put some cream also to 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.930
 our our apple 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:21.360
 and our dessert is ready a dessert 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.360
 the grill good profit united
