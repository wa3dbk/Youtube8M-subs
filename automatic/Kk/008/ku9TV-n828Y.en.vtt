00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.590 
well done as far as the sculpt goes are

her shoes now I do want to point out

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.260 
her shoes now I do want to point out
that<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.049> statue<00:01:55.500> comes<00:01:56.100> out<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.640> box<00:01:56.909> on

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that the statue comes out of the box on

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.469 
that the statue comes out of the box on
the<00:01:58.049> stand<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.560> she<00:01:59.040> does<00:01:59.189> detach<00:01:59.549> rather

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the stand but she does detach rather

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.850 
the stand but she does detach rather
easily<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.500> they<00:02:01.680> have<00:02:01.829> a

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
easily and I like that they have a

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.230 
easily and I like that they have a
little<00:02:02.040> support<00:02:02.969> there<00:02:03.450> for<00:02:03.659> her<00:02:05.240> foot

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
little support there for her foot

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.609 
little support there for her foot
lifting<00:02:06.570> off<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.719> ground<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.170> even<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.439> little

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
lifting off the ground but even a little

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.520 
lifting off the ground but even a little
wrinkle<00:02:07.920> at<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.039> back<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.190> her<00:02:08.399> chucks<00:02:09.530> the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
wrinkle at the back of her chucks the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.750 
wrinkle at the back of her chucks the
wrinkle<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> sides<00:02:11.220> looks<00:02:11.400> really<00:02:11.640> good

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
wrinkle on the sides looks really good

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.740 
wrinkle on the sides looks really good
it's<00:02:11.940> appropriate<00:02:12.330> considering<00:02:12.629> they're

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
it's appropriate considering they're

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.080 
it's appropriate considering they're
kind<00:02:12.959> of<00:02:13.020> loose<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.410> not<00:02:13.530> least<00:02:13.800> the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
kind of loose and not least the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.839 
kind of loose and not least the
top<00:02:14.239> but<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:14.870> did<00:02:15.019> a<00:02:15.170> good<00:02:15.319> job<00:02:15.730> sculpting<00:02:16.730> the

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
top but it did a good job sculpting the

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.790 
top but it did a good job sculpting the
laces<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.510> painting<00:02:17.959> these<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.349> paint<00:02:18.590> is

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
laces and painting these the paint is

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.350 
laces and painting these the paint is
really<00:02:19.129> strong<00:02:19.430> even<00:02:19.910> just<00:02:20.060> on<00:02:20.150> something

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
really strong even just on something

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.320 
really strong even just on something
like<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.569> shoes<00:02:20.810> but<00:02:21.590> as<00:02:21.739> usual<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.879> paint<00:02:23.150> is

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
like the shoes but as usual the paint is

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.300 
like the shoes but as usual the paint is
really<00:02:23.360> strong<00:02:23.900> on<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.319> skin<00:02:24.650> for<00:02:24.680> Kotobukiya

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
really strong on the skin for Kotobukiya

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.460 
really strong on the skin for Kotobukiya
you<00:02:26.000> know<00:02:26.090> they've<00:02:26.300> always<00:02:26.450> used<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:27.050> secondary

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
you know they've always used a secondary

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.830 
you know they've always used a secondary
color<00:02:27.830> tone<00:02:28.129> to<00:02:28.550> kind<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.730> highlight<00:02:29.000> contours

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
color tone to kind of highlight contours

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.100 
color tone to kind of highlight contours
and<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.379> is<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.620> no<00:02:31.220> different<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.670> could<00:02:31.790> see

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
and this is a no different you could see

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.170 
and this is a no different you could see
that<00:02:33.110> they<00:02:33.290> use<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:33.890> little<00:02:34.610> color<00:02:34.790> here<00:02:34.849> to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
that they use this little color here to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.940 
that they use this little color here to
highlight<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.930> shading<00:02:36.319> around<00:02:36.440> her<00:02:36.680> knees

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.270 
highlight the shading around her knees
and<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.810> way<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.410> kind<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.709> muscle<00:02:39.950> leads

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
and the way the the kind of muscle leads

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.509 
and the way the the kind of muscle leads
right<00:02:40.489> up<00:02:40.549> to<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.849> bottom<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.269> her<00:02:41.420> thigh<00:02:42.519> they

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
right up to the bottom of her thigh they

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.210 
right up to the bottom of her thigh they
also<00:02:43.700> do<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.569> little<00:02:45.470> bit<00:02:45.650> on<00:02:45.739> her<00:02:45.890> stomach

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220

also do it a little bit on her stomach
and<00:02:46.579> a<00:02:47.180> little<00:02:47.540> bit<00:02:47.690> on<00:02:47.930> her<00:02:48.319> lower<00:02:48.560> back<00:02:48.860> it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
and a little bit on her lower back it

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.400 
and a little bit on her lower back it
might<00:02:49.160> be<00:02:49.280> hard<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.489> see<00:02:49.610> in<00:02:49.760> this<00:02:49.970> lighting

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
might be hard to see in this lighting

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.630 
might be hard to see in this lighting
but<00:02:51.799> you<00:02:51.890> definitely<00:02:52.010> see<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.489> in<00:02:52.549> the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
but you definitely see it in the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.800 
but you definitely see it in the
contours<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.180> her<00:02:53.299> hands<00:02:53.829> and<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:56.420> really

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
contours of her hands and you really

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.600 
contours of her hands and you really
noticed<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.319> think<00:02:57.560> on<00:02:57.799> her<00:02:58.069> her<00:02:58.340> knees

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
noticed that I think on her her knees

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.350 
noticed that I think on her her knees
and<00:02:59.090> lower<00:02:59.930> thigh<00:03:00.260> area<00:03:01.120> there's<00:03:02.120> also<00:03:02.239> a

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
and lower thigh area there's also a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.670 
and lower thigh area there's also a
little<00:03:02.450> bit<00:03:02.569> done<00:03:02.870> around<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:03.200> collarbone

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
little bit done around the collarbone

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.900 
little bit done around the collarbone
area<00:03:04.900> just<00:03:05.900> below<00:03:06.049> her<00:03:06.290> neck<00:03:06.560> but<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.670> paint

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
area just below her neck but the paint

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.479 
area just below her neck but the paint
of<00:03:08.209> her<00:03:08.390> jacket<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.680> paint<00:03:09.920> they<00:03:10.099> used<00:03:10.280> on<00:03:10.400> her

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
of her jacket the paint they used on her

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.860 
of her jacket the paint they used on her
shirt<00:03:10.760> it's<00:03:11.000> all<00:03:11.120> really<00:03:11.269> clean<00:03:11.540> paint<00:03:11.780> the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
shirt it's all really clean paint the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.350 
shirt it's all really clean paint the
jeans<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.430> between<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.610> jacket<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.120> shirt

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
jeans and between the jacket the shirt

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.789 
jeans and between the jacket the shirt
and<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.540> belt<00:03:14.780> you<00:03:14.900> could<00:03:15.049> get<00:03:15.379> a<00:03:15.410> sense<00:03:15.709> of

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
and the belt you could get a sense of

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.259 
and the belt you could get a sense of
different<00:03:16.069> fabrics<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:16.640> I<00:03:16.700> think<00:03:16.790> the

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
different fabrics so I think the

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.699 
different fabrics so I think the
different<00:03:17.599> surface<00:03:18.049> levels<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.440> paint<00:03:18.590> that

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
different surface levels of paint that

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.009 
different surface levels of paint that
they<00:03:18.769> chose<00:03:19.010> are<00:03:19.250> really<00:03:19.579> strong<00:03:20.019> also

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
they chose are really strong also

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.539 
they chose are really strong also
stronger<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:21.440> little<00:03:21.620> details<00:03:22.010> on<00:03:22.250> her

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
stronger the little details on her

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.340 
stronger the little details on her
gloves<00:03:22.940> right<00:03:23.720> there<00:03:23.870> at<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:23.989> bottom<00:03:24.139> a
