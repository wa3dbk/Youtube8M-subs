00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.300
 the rifle ar 

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.060
 elizabeth huato varela 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.530
 with the testimonies of this first grand slam of the year 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.459
 Chilean who took advantage 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.859
 the serbian in front of Maria Sharapova is closing her chest 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.739
 takes two minutes but it already exists owns everything started does 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.659
 a few moments ago 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:22.109
 while 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.599
 this case a little the lines 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.089
 It can not be dangerous 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.410
 iker and pensioners a little chili in the beech 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.150
 a revealing fact here for me in the player who best move those myths 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.020
 female 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.170
 Awesome 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.170
 The skill that this player has with her body is already going to see her 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.530
 what knows her, I'm sure to steal what I'm saying 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.380
 a dangerous player that in a good right best setback according to the 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.460
 fantastic but I think the power concentration and what has improved 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.460
 and that was the summary 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.610
 papa pacellÃ­ allows it 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.680
 respect for bancaribe shortening distances with ayacucho and / or is looking for 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.010
 make it 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.010
 make the first end of his country in a grand slam 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.610
 and sharapova for their second consecutive final 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.660
 in this same contest found well losing with being queen 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.660
 and here I 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.590
 is looking to be the first in genoa k 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.590
 grand slam 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.399
 alloco saperas 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.870
 stand out really want to po 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.870
 that has impressed me in this tournament 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.650
 surely people who know the wake have seen him play 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.190
 will agree with him 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.480
 Mobility 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.890
 and above all his service 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.700
 for me it is putting the right foot further back more by the side forgiveness 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.730
 the ball the box office 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.970
 high as long as you are making the break the necessary break that is needed 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.360
 to hit powerful 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.280
 request made by the service 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.880
 much more marked has to be both the right and the reverse of the background 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.799
 and one will be little to how good to have won in the way that won 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.660
 dustin hallett unspeakable then 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.709
 4 and 6 0 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:13.849
 I think that 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.169
 set the clear pattern 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.579
 pinky state is found 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:20.729
 we have said it 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:23.879
 since the beginning of the tournament that was approved was playing well 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.019
 that there were changes 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.099
 hits 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.099
 but the face is player 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:33.809
 it is clear that old age 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:36.579
 needs to 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.579
 and here we are 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.959
 the last 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.609
 waiting for it to close definitively 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:47.769
 ceiling 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.359
 great tournament great games I think this one this australian 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:56.899
 no i would not go 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:00.269
 better tournament than me that but yes 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.620
 with better shared results but they were awesome remember those 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.539
 15 hours he was and spit 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.169
 in the air in live air 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.089
 the match 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:12.749
 it should be right 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:16.509
 and then the party read distribute hahahahaha 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:19.220
 service 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.529
 we do not get into the first semifinal 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:23.619
 this first grand slam 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:25.019
 sharapova 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.599
 advantage of 3 1 in the confrontations against chilean chanco
