00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.110
 big hello to all today i want you 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.360
 tell about the next news in 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.599
 nail industry and it will be 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.250
 permanent nail polishes 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.640
 in simple terms, it's something mean 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.240
 between gel polishes and ordinary polishes for 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.510
 nails 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.700
 they are more benign a lot easier in 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.280
 applied to me unlike lacquer length 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.340
 there is already a gel varnish video about how 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.440
 apply as they rush and generally need 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.990
 0 and do not need anyone who has not seen go 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.290
 here and be sure to see if you have 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.820
 there are more questions about this 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.240
 I remind you that I was unhappy 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.650
 I have this whole gel polish system gel polish 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.570
 slightly hurt my nail plate 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.180
 all this was filmed terribly hard but 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.810
 I liked permanent varnishes and even 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.489
 highly 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.010
 if you are a little familiar with 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.530
 gel polishes maybe some video 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.930
 looked or self applied gel polish 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.090
 you know how much is needed for 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.670
 for putting it on 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.100
 permanent varnishes enough to have 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.490
 lamp primer and yourself these 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.619
 permanent varnishes nothing else 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.899
 I have 6 permanent lacquers and they 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.639
 they are all slightly different from one 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.469
 trademarks of these large 

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:25.740
 I liked the bottles a lot 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:27.990
 less than these small fields with 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.600
 these permanent paws I passed 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.549
 about a week and a half and everything was 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.579
 great beautiful and really me 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.109
 just already tired and I started shooting them 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.389
 because a large number of varnishes 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.609
 interesting houses lie and dry 

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:43.289
 I've been with me for a week and a half with one 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.359
 it does not suit therefore I have already begun 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.849
 all shoot but a week and a half they 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:50.340
 held out just fine and I tell you 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:52.139
 I will definitely show how they looked at 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.479
 my leg points or insertion here 

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:56.880
 do or separate video insert for 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.099
 to permanently lacquer you 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.619
 need to gash nail plate very 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:02.819
 very weak very very easy then you 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.759
 apply primer 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.560
 right now I show here it looks like this 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.050
 primer just like small 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.959
 bottles with permanent varnish primer 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.410
 colorless and does not need to be dried in the lamp 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.920
 and then you're on 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.680
 net thin layer base layer of this 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.950
 permanent lacquer means drying it 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.360
 in the lamp for 1 minute one 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.730
 minutes in my lamp 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.060
 in the usual uv lamp was plenty 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.520
 then you apply a second layer to 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.550
 brighter rich dense color and 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.600
 also dry it in api and more 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.050
 do not need anything 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.250
 only this is a huge plus 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.620
 permanent lacquers compared to 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.770
 gel polishes are these permanent varnishes 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.810
 which in a larger package they are not 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.520
 so well respected i will show you on 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.520
 chamomile absolutely all the colors that 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.650
 I have I just loosened a little 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.540
 plastic daisy and just like 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.880
 on a little nail it didn't carry all that 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.130
 keeps it up so that's it 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.250
 these were big bottles fall down 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.380
 so good and not so smooth and more difficult 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.840
 put them on the nail than the little ones 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.390
 small bottles permanent varnishes in small 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.730
 packs I just conquered and colors 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.790
 amazing i chose the colors there myself 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.620
 huge huge just choice and i 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.160
 absolutely satisfied with 7 three 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.020
 again show you the shades on chamomile and 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.450
 these permanent varnishes are simply respected 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:32.110
 perfect but don't expect them perfect 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.690
 will lay down from the first layer no first layer 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.940
 put just thin as a base 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.459
 and the second layer will block everything 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.340
 disadvantages I did not see that they were 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.950
 it is indicated that they are self-leveling but 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.500
 in practice, it is awesome all 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.959
 lay on foot points and exactly beautiful and 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.120
 so beautiful gloss so he 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.870
 stunning without any top 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.450
 cover 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.810
 I am very very pleased and if you 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.840
 gel polish fans try it like this 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:06.220
 look permanent varnishes near here 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.620
 these three shades from left to right are in 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.600
 large packages and were not that me 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.180
 not really liked you can see 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.540
 how they shimmer beautifully but to 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.830
 put these three shades exactly 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.049
 it took a lot of work 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.110
 they rinse a little and not exactly 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.510
 lie and here are these three shades of more 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.180
 small packages and they just 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.949
 amazing i fell in love with them 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.949
 was led you just see what 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:35.400
 beautiful overflowing my mother burns wow you and 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.919
 your nails like a foreign car shimmers and 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.380
 glitters like new on little 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.780
 beautiful colors are very beautiful 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.389
 second layer whatever uneven 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.479
 the first second layer is perfectly simple 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.120
 overrides any errors and looks 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.020
 it's all very very beautiful so if 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.199
 you decide 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.229
 it is this brand blyusky 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.070
 then choose exactly small 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.080
 wrappers 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.320
 and now here's a picture for you 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.620
 these are my little fingers after i immediately 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.250
 same foil removed look what 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.759
 almost all 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:14.880
 Well, 99 percent probably permanent 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:17.460
 nail polish gone and left there on 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.370
 sponzhiki then I took the usual don't care 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.009
 the most common and also show you here 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.240
 in the photo and walked a little bit 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.729
 on foot. 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.520
 to remove these small things 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.530
 remnants of permanent lacquer I would even 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.300
 said it was just such a raid 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.580
 permanent lacquer remained on the nails 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.919
 then she just took the polisher by the railing 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.080
 my little finger and everything is fine and everything 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.870
 fine and no problems nail 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.870
 the plate was damaged it was not thinner 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.479
 Nor did permanent lacquer 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.849
 colored the nail plate so my 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.010
 opinion if you choose gel varnishes 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.620
 or permanent varnishes then i choose 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.360
 permanent trays again want you 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.310
 say that I tried 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.710
 permanent varnishes only from this 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.360
 trademark no other i'm 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.080
 I did not try so I can not tell you 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.060
 that all permanent varnishes are so good 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.310
 if you know about other brands 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.229

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.810

 I love these permanent varnishes to me

 want to try other trading
