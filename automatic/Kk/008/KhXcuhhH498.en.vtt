once that happened and the and you
notice<00:01:51.599> I'm<00:01:51.719> checked<00:01:52.319> the<00:01:52.469> map<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.859> mean<00:01:53.009> when

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
notice I'm checked the map I mean when

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.010 
notice I'm checked the map I mean when
it's<00:01:53.279> scanning<00:01:53.609> it's<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.090> smart<00:01:54.359> idea<00:01:54.539> to<00:01:54.749> check

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
it's scanning it's a smart idea to check

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.219 
it's scanning it's a smart idea to check
your<00:01:55.200> map<00:01:55.349> to<00:01:55.859> see<00:01:56.130> actually<00:01:56.520> worthy<00:01:56.729> oh<00:01:57.229> I

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
your map to see actually worthy oh I

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
probably why I choose the mp5 is very

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.690 
probably why I choose the mp5 is very
powerful<00:02:06.829> excellent<00:02:07.829> spraying<00:02:08.220> weapon

that's where they're going to be coming
from<00:03:34.109> that's<00:03:34.379> where<00:03:34.500> they're<00:03:34.620> going<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.799> be

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
from that's where they're going to be

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.119 
from that's where they're going to be
spawning<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:36.750> don't<00:03:37.109> you<00:03:37.500> know<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.650> know<00:03:37.889> you

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
spawning so don't you know I know you

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.520 
spawning so don't you know I know you
want<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:38.609> comment<00:03:38.819> on<00:03:39.180> how<00:03:39.750> much<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.049> spray<00:03:40.349> and

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
want to comment on how much I spray and

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.599 
want to comment on how much I spray and
everything<00:03:40.769> like<00:03:40.859> that<00:03:40.919> but<00:03:41.189> you<00:03:41.250> notice<00:03:41.519> i

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
everything like that but you notice i

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.699 
everything like that but you notice i
also<00:03:41.790> use<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.030> lot<00:03:42.299> of<00:03:42.329> evasion<00:03:42.720> techniques<00:03:43.290> you

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
also use a lot of evasion techniques you

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.699 
also use a lot of evasion techniques you
know<00:03:43.829> out<00:03:44.180> draw<00:03:45.180> them<00:03:45.389> in<00:03:45.569> make<00:03:46.049> them<00:03:46.290> draw

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
know out draw them in make them draw

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.379 
know out draw them in make them draw
their<00:03:46.889> fire<00:03:46.919> and<00:03:47.459> then<00:03:47.609> dart<00:03:47.849> away<00:03:48.000> and

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
their fire and then dart away and

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.449 
their fire and then dart away and
usually<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.019> takes<00:03:49.290> away<00:03:49.500> their<00:03:49.829> only<00:03:50.310> this

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
usually that takes away their only this

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.189 
usually that takes away their only this
I'm<00:03:50.609> just<00:03:50.819> blind<00:03:51.060> spring<00:03:51.479> I<00:03:51.720> knew<00:03:51.930> he<00:03:52.079> was

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
I'm just blind spring I knew he was

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.869 
I'm just blind spring I knew he was
there<00:03:52.500> but<00:03:53.159> I<00:03:53.220> was<00:03:53.370> like<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.579> know<00:03:53.669> what<00:03:53.699> I'm

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
there but I was like you know what I'm

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.099 
there but I was like you know what I'm
not<00:03:54.000> going<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.180> take<00:03:54.359> the<00:03:54.540> chance<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.930> him

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
not going to take the chance of him

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.960 
not going to take the chance of him
having<00:03:55.349> a<00:03:55.530> faster<00:03:55.889> trigger<00:03:56.099> finger<00:03:56.430> I'm<00:03:56.639> just

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
having a faster trigger finger I'm just

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.030 
having a faster trigger finger I'm just
going<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.180> start<00:03:57.689> spraying<00:03:58.079> as<00:03:58.319> I<00:03:58.409> walk<00:03:58.709> around

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
going to start spraying as I walk around

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.349 
going to start spraying as I walk around
the<00:03:59.129> corner<00:03:59.280> there<00:03:59.549> and<00:03:59.699> that's<00:04:00.180> actually

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
the corner there and that's actually

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.030 
the corner there and that's actually
very<00:04:00.540> effective<00:04:01.019> I<00:04:01.109> do<00:04:01.169> that<00:04:01.349> actually<00:04:01.470> quite

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
very effective I do that actually quite

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.349 
very effective I do that actually quite
a<00:04:02.069> bit<00:04:02.359> dirty<00:04:03.359> technique<00:04:03.719> but<00:04:03.930> it's<00:04:04.049> effective

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
a bit dirty technique but it's effective

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.479 
a bit dirty technique but it's effective
okay<00:04:06.359> so<00:04:06.419> same<00:04:06.989> thing<00:04:07.019> I<00:04:07.379> mean<00:04:07.650> we<00:04:07.889> pushed<00:04:08.159> and

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
okay so same thing I mean we pushed and

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.830 
okay so same thing I mean we pushed and
the<00:04:08.579> team's<00:04:08.879> starting<00:04:09.150> spawning<00:04:09.599> the<00:04:09.689> other

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
the team's starting spawning the other

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.860 
the team's starting spawning the other
side<00:04:10.019> remember<00:04:10.319> don't<00:04:10.859> worry<00:04:11.639> about<00:04:11.969> where

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
side remember don't worry about where

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.409 
side remember don't worry about where
you're<00:04:13.049> seeing<00:04:13.379> red<00:04:13.709> dots<00:04:14.069> ignore<00:04:14.969> the<00:04:15.209> red

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
you're seeing red dots ignore the red

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.719 
you're seeing red dots ignore the red
dots<00:04:15.689> concentrate<00:04:16.620> on<00:04:16.739> where<00:04:16.919> all<00:04:17.159> the<00:04:17.370> green

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.839 
dots concentrate on where all the green
your<00:04:18.690> teammates<00:04:19.079> are<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.349> green<00:04:19.849> triangles

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
your teammates are the green triangles

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.240 
your teammates are the green triangles
or<00:04:20.909> whatever<00:04:21.209> because<00:04:21.539> that<00:04:21.930> will<00:04:22.770> tell<00:04:23.039> you

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
or whatever because that will tell you

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.939 
or whatever because that will tell you
exactly<00:04:23.490> where<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.240> enemy<00:04:24.539> is<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.900> red<00:04:25.740> dot

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
exactly where the enemy is a red dot

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.649 
exactly where the enemy is a red dot
will<00:04:26.099> tell<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:26.370> where<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.610> enemy<00:04:27.210> is<00:04:27.360> and

will tell you where a enemy is and

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.830 
will tell you where a enemy is and
sometimes<00:04:28.020> some<00:04:28.949> temporarily<00:04:29.610> but<00:04:30.570> if<00:04:30.719> your
