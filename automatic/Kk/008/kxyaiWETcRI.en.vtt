side made by LC industries now we're

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.200 
side made by LC industries now we're
looking<00:01:08.830> at<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.220> bottom<00:01:09.369> of<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.700> water<00:01:09.939> can

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
looking at the bottom of the water can

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.999 
looking at the bottom of the water can
and<00:01:10.450> you<00:01:10.810> can<00:01:10.930> see<00:01:11.080> these<00:01:11.229> little<00:01:11.650> plastic

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
and you can see these little plastic

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.719 
and you can see these little plastic
nubs<00:01:12.520> or<00:01:12.790> nodes<00:01:13.060> on<00:01:13.360> here<00:01:13.630> and<00:01:13.780> I<00:01:14.710> am<00:01:15.070> guessing

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
nubs or nodes on here and I am guessing

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.640 
nubs or nodes on here and I am guessing
that's<00:01:16.030> utilized<00:01:16.540> to<00:01:16.750> help<00:01:16.780> strap<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.439> water

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
that's utilized to help strap the water

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.770 
that's utilized to help strap the water
container<00:01:18.009> down<00:01:18.280> in<00:01:18.460> some<00:01:18.640> capacity<00:01:18.790> perhaps

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
container down in some capacity perhaps

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.039 
container down in some capacity perhaps
what<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:20.670> cordage<00:01:21.670> or<00:01:21.970> a<00:01:22.000> nylon<00:01:22.329> strap<00:01:22.810> is

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
what a cordage or a nylon strap is

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.719 
what a cordage or a nylon strap is
placed<00:01:23.530> over<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.890> can<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.369> then<00:01:24.460> it<00:01:24.579> just

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
placed over the can and then it just

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.219 
placed over the can and then it just
runs<00:01:25.000> through<00:01:25.060> here<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:25.600> that<00:01:25.689> prevents<00:01:26.110> the

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
runs through here and that prevents the

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.440 
runs through here and that prevents the
cordage<00:01:26.590> from<00:01:26.799> slipping<00:01:27.220> that's<00:01:27.970> my<00:01:28.180> guess

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
cordage from slipping that's my guess

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.149 
cordage from slipping that's my guess
I'm<00:01:28.659> not<00:01:28.810> exactly<00:01:29.170> sure<00:01:29.350> if<00:01:29.590> that's<00:01:29.740> correct

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
I'm not exactly sure if that's correct

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.670 
I'm not exactly sure if that's correct
but<00:01:31.060> over<00:01:31.360> in<00:01:31.390> here<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:33.130> can<00:01:33.280> see<00:01:33.360> number<00:01:34.360> two

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
but over in here you can see number two

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.469 
but over in here you can see number two
HDPE<00:01:35.680> that's<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.250> type<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:36.549> plastic<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:37.149> is<00:01:37.210> so

uh<00:04:23.419> you<00:04:24.080> know<00:04:24.110> pretty<00:04:24.440> flimsy<00:04:25.389> you<00:04:26.389> can<00:04:26.510> see<00:04:26.690> I

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
uh you know pretty flimsy you can see I

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.680 
uh you know pretty flimsy you can see I
can<00:04:27.200> actually<00:04:27.610> dent<00:04:28.610> this<00:04:28.760> just<00:04:29.030> by<00:04:29.180> my<00:04:29.419> hand

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
can actually dent this just by my hand

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.129 
can actually dent this just by my hand
let<00:04:30.139> alone<00:04:30.350> if<00:04:30.530> I<00:04:30.620> stand<00:04:30.979> on<00:04:31.130> it<00:04:31.370> and<00:04:32.020> you<00:04:33.020> can

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
let alone if I stand on it and you can

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.909 
let alone if I stand on it and you can
see<00:04:34.210> it's<00:04:35.210> probably<00:04:36.020> not<00:04:36.200> going<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.500> hold<00:04:36.710> up

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
see it's probably not going to hold up

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.360 
see it's probably not going to hold up
to<00:04:36.979> long-term<00:04:37.370> use<00:04:38.740> you<00:04:39.740> can<00:04:39.860> see<00:04:40.040> how<00:04:40.160> well

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
to long-term use you can see how well

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.250 
to long-term use you can see how well
that<00:04:40.400> dense<00:04:41.120> compared<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:44.229> compared<00:04:45.229> to

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
that dense compared to compared to

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.840 
that dense compared to compared to
something<00:04:45.500> like<00:04:45.620> this<00:04:45.950> where<00:04:46.370> there's

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
something like this where there's

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.450 
something like this where there's
actually<00:04:47.270> no<00:04:47.419> dents<00:04:47.750> on<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:48.110> at<00:04:48.229> all<00:04:48.410> so<00:04:49.100> that's

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
actually no dents on it at all so that's

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.159 
actually no dents on it at all so that's
