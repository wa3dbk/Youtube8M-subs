00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.139
 And I 'm Xavier, this is the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.389
 daniel sings the Brazilian champion of 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.400
 marketing in 2014 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.740
 we came to do a tutorial passing 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.150
 What do we know about Norwich one? 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.550
 of the largest of the staff has had enough 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.250
 there and the people who will help a lot 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.330
 hang five the base maneuver of any 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.490
 another rl 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.340
 so it is important that you know in 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.109
 somewhere on the screen a link to the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.989
 directional all that we did in 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.559
 five or you can see in the description of this 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.180
 video 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.920
 you will need a factory 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.860
 aluminum as we have always said 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.809
 which is the frei that the boarding staff uses 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.879
 need not necessarily be a 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.590
 bulldog horseshoe can be any 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.480
 aluminum frame making it clear 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.590
 who have only had enough doubt in 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.570
 relation to this 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.199
 else you will need are 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.670
 two supports in the front as night 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.230
 you support both feet 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.629
 one of the most important things to 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.850
 to exercise rubber that is rubber that 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.460
 People use an air camera that you can 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.650
 learn to do there by staying here in 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.689
 somewhere you're going to be targeted 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.150
 for a video that explains only how you can 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.130
 this or the video description will also 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.220
 contain something very important to 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.689
 to do in the ranking is to 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.280
 support that we teach you to 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.710
 make your shorts shorts your shorts 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.509
 that you have more adherence to rubber 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.430
 because the clothes make them slide 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.630
 much more that makes it difficult to 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.250
 team execution 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.770
 contrary to what everyone thinks 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.479
 support to learn the leg in the ranking 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.130
 stands in front of your leg you learn 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.710
 the leg on the frame just before the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.020
 because the bracket creates a step 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.880
 relief and a grip on the front 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.369
 your leg so that it does not 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.369
 them something very peculiar is 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.670
 the position of the feet supporting us integers 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.100
 some use the middle of both feet in the support 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.680
 others prefer to use the tip 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.149
 from the fingers you will training and 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.119
 during the training you will get 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.890
 adapt to your best way of doing rl 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.129
 after doubling your shorts you will go up 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.780
 five to stabilize at five place the 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.970
 leg in which you paddle in support 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.060
 front with both legs in the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.160
 support 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.470
 but this will hold your 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.900
 cheeks on the frame where it is located 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.520
 hengqin support will stabilize 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.760
 thus giving the two supporting legs 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.040
 drop the right hand to the handlebar 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.150
 keeping using the brake when you 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.069
 feels that the bay is in the degree 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.200
 enough to ride without brake as already 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.980
 was said in the rifai cure 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.080
 You're just on the left hand. 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.830
 consequently without brake and 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.830
 running on team 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.989
 the only way you have to 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.150
 balancing on the network had 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.610
 trunk and your arms 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.260
 therefore when the rear will lower 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.390
 you do the opposite where fÃ¡bio while 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.250
 the back low you lift the maximum 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.709
 can your spending where in your 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.380
 trunk back and when the bicycle 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.680
 will pass from Brazil will turn over 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.690
 you lower your arms almost touching 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.849
 on the handlebar causing the bicycle 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.890
 back to normal stabilizing 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.019
 again the function is totally 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.880
 hang five counter when the rear 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.930
 that the lowdown where you do you put your 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.549
 Legs forward. 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.830
 already in the environment the rear will not 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.450
 to lower you throw all your trunk and the 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.380
 arms to the top to the back 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.000
 bike 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.829
 when the bike wants to turn and 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.660
 You have to play your 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.390
 arms and tilt your body when to 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.340
 front is very important that you see 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.900
 the video of I threw it with attention to you 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.760
 understand the way in which it balances 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.100
 in the bay throwing his arms forward 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.100
 and back next to your ready 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.879
 usually when you 're from randy tim 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.890
 and the low back 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.439
 the bike down so hard that generates a 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.819
 and is easy to understand at the time 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.769
 so we advise you to walk 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.480
 with the rear tire a little on the chu 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.480
 thus generating a certain damping 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.829
 in Zedong hand we hope that the program 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.510
 has helped enroll in the channel to speak 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.290
 that ordinance that shows that it is 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.950
 This is already learning left there and 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.440
 share where he neither shares with 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.940
 Facebook page on social networks and is 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.789
 It's very important that you do 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.740
 this and do not forget body fanning 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.419
 page of the champion and whether to discuss 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.970
 my most important the champion's 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.970
 look at my one dollar hero 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.479
 is
