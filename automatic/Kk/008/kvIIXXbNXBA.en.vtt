computer doesn't have one built in and

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.330 
computer doesn't have one built in and
sometimes<00:03:50.290> like<00:03:50.410> before<00:03:50.680> that<00:03:50.739> because<00:03:51.190> it's

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
sometimes like before that because it's

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.250 
sometimes like before that because it's
a<00:03:51.370> lot<00:03:51.489> easier<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:52.000> download<00:03:52.389> your<00:03:52.510> images<00:03:52.630> and

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
you don't have to constantly plug in and

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.490 
you don't have to constantly plug in and
out<00:03:54.850> from<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.329> camera<00:03:55.720> sometimes<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:56.260> you

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
out from the camera sometimes you you

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.050 
out from the camera sometimes you you
kind<00:03:56.769> of<00:03:56.829> damage<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.340> port<00:03:57.579> if<00:03:57.670> you<00:03:57.730> do<00:03:57.849> that

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
kind of damage the port if you do that

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.080 
kind of damage the port if you do that
quite<00:03:58.630> too<00:03:58.780> often<00:03:59.260> right<00:03:59.440> and<00:03:59.680> okay<00:04:00.579> so<00:04:00.940> that's

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
quite too often right and okay so that's

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.129 
quite too often right and okay so that's
a<00:04:01.180> USB<00:04:01.540> cable<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.209> using<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:04.780> lithium

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
a USB cable it is using a lithium

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.319 
a USB cable it is using a lithium
battery<00:04:05.170> so<00:04:05.709> this<00:04:05.889> is<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.069> one<00:04:06.670> of<00:04:06.700> a<00:04:06.849> first<00:04:07.060> cams

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
battery so this is a one of a first cams

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.240 
battery so this is a one of a first cams
that<00:04:07.449> does<00:04:07.690> offer<00:04:07.870> lithium<00:04:08.410> battery<00:04:08.739> on<00:04:09.190> a

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
that does offer lithium battery on a

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.809 
that does offer lithium battery on a
sort<00:04:09.639> of<00:04:09.669> a<00:04:09.759> hybrid<00:04:09.940> style<00:04:10.359> camera<00:04:11.139> like<00:04:11.259> this

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
sort of a hybrid style camera like this

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.239 
sort of a hybrid style camera like this
des<00:04:12.180> allies<00:04:12.450> have<00:04:12.749> that<00:04:12.989> about<00:04:13.709> ability<00:04:14.129> and

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:14.249 
des allies have that about ability and

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:16.999 
des allies have that about ability and
so<00:04:14.400> does<00:04:14.579> this<00:04:14.879> cameras<00:04:15.299> well<00:04:15.569> the<00:04:16.560> values<00:04:16.859> are

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
so does this cameras well the values are

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.650 
so does this cameras well the values are
slightly<00:04:17.310> charged<00:04:17.850> out<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.120> factory<00:04:18.539> but

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.950 
other words we have a slightly different
variations<00:05:08.310> of<00:05:08.430> that<00:05:08.580> plug<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:09.479> charger<00:05:09.690> is

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
variations of that plug the charger is

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.460 
variations of that plug the charger is
dual<00:05:10.229> voltage<00:05:10.440> one<00:05:10.860> one<00:05:11.479> 100<00:05:12.479> to<00:05:12.539> 240<00:05:12.870> volts<00:05:13.020> so

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
dual voltage one one 100 to 240 volts so

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.710 
dual voltage one one 100 to 240 volts so
it's<00:05:13.590> variable<00:05:13.919> and<00:05:14.220> depending<00:05:15.090> on<00:05:15.180> where<00:05:15.599> you

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
it's variable and depending on where you

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.629 
it's variable and depending on where you
go<00:05:15.930> you<00:05:16.380> can<00:05:16.530> take<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.800> same<00:05:17.039> plug<00:05:17.280> in<00:05:17.430> this<00:05:17.490> is

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
go you can take the same plug in this is

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.800 
go you can take the same plug in this is
a<00:05:17.960> wrong<00:05:18.960> adapter<00:05:19.470> to<00:05:19.770> charge<00:05:20.220> that<00:05:20.940> whatever
