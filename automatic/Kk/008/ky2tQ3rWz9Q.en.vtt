00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.230 
except the roll cage and chassis
upgrades<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.689> then<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.710> wheels<00:01:38.369> are<00:01:38.820> set<00:01:39.150> in

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
upgrades and then the wheels are set in

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.090 
upgrades and then the wheels are set in
named<00:01:39.450> chicane<00:01:39.990> which<00:01:40.320> are<00:01:40.439> found<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
named chicane which are found in the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.980 
named chicane which are found in the
tuner<00:01:41.759> category<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.659> they'd<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:42.869> been

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
tuner category and they'd have been

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.590 
tuner category and they'd have been
recolored<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.799> stone<00:01:44.220> silver<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:45.479> worth

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
recolored in stone silver it's worth

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.660 
recolored in stone silver it's worth
noting<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:45.990> there<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.649> hardtop<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
noting that there is a hardtop and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.969 
noting that there is a hardtop and
roadster<00:01:48.270> version<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.899> car<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.710> think

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
roadster version of this car but I think

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.560 
roadster version of this car but I think
the<00:01:50.189> hardtop<00:01:50.520> does<00:01:50.850> look<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> better<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
the hardtop does look the better of the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.050 
the hardtop does look the better of the
two<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:52.079> might<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.920> grab<00:01:53.340> myself<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
two I might have to grab myself the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.209 
two I might have to grab myself the
Roadster<00:01:54.540> Varian<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.530> same<00:01:55.710> mods<00:01:55.979> but

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
Roadster Varian and do the same mods but

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.709 
Roadster Varian and do the same mods but
with<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> red<00:01:56.759> color<00:01:56.969> scheme<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.420> think<00:01:57.600> that

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
with the red color scheme I think that

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.959 
with the red color scheme I think that
would<00:01:57.810> make<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> nice<00:01:58.290> pair<00:01:58.680> but<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.790> pretty

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
would make a nice pair but that pretty

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.819 
would make a nice pair but that pretty
much<00:02:00.090> finishes<00:02:00.270> off<00:02:00.600> my<00:02:00.780> presentation<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.649> my

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
much finishes off my presentation of my

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.130 
much finishes off my presentation of my
invetory<00:02:02.280> Coquette<00:02:02.939> classic<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.630> think<00:02:03.840> next

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
invetory Coquette classic I think next

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.539
