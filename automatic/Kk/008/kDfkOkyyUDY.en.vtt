00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.200
 you're an osteopathic veterinarian next door 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.160
 of the forest of Fontainebleau and we 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.760
 let's see a very important thing 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.410
 today there are many hunters 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.530
 whose dogs can on the hunt 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.680
 have problems with wild boars 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.879
 problems of wounds problems of 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.890
 attack we will say various 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.290
 could we look together 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.199
 what to do about 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.690
 different would you like that to there 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.479
 to undergo a dog on a zombie quite 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.750
 then start with the head 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:57.769
 so the first keys can happen 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.799
 at the level of the chops there usually 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:04.280
 it's not so much the wild boar 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.630
 but especially badgers and fox 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.700
 or else bites of other dogs 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.510
 when there are fights between dogs of 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.149
 hunting there usually it takes already 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.930
 start by thoroughly disinfecting hockey at 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:20.860
 the dance help have based on 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.119
 chlorhexidine or betadine 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.950
 generally this requires setting 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.810
 under antibiotics so we will go 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.000
 see the veterinarian and in some cases 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.289
 a few stitches okay then 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.539
 then he may have sores around 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.090
 eyes the plains around the eyes 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.280
 can be dangerous to an eye 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.250
 can be punched or often there is also 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.049
 ulcerations of the cordée which is the 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.789
 upper part of the eye okay and 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.070
 upper layers of the eye and in this 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.250
 case there is a need for treatment 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.880
 appropriate medical sometimes even in 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.399
 some cases an intervention 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.070
 surgery to prevent the dog from 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.050
 lose has agreed the care of 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.570
 the first aid we can do is 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.950
 anyway to go rinse the eye 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.800
 well with serum type serum 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.390
 physiological or special products 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.070
 to clean the dog's eyes it takes 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.170
 avoid going to put all kinds of 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.630
 disinfectant around the eye amazed that 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.850
 if there is a wound on the cornea it can 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.450
 go burn the cornea even more and 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.110
 the lower layers of their hero 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.590
 make things worse 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.540
 okay then there may be some 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.459
 thoracic wounds wounds 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.560
 at the thoracic level are often 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.870
 especially with small boars 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.209
 size but small size outside 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.320
 but it can go up quite high to 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:45.200
 the interior is so generally we have 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:50.870
 a small wound to progress this 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.670
 size of a phase i ii 3 euros but the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.760
 defense will go up and usually goes 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.150
 open the field indoors on 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:03.470
 often a depth must after 10 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.560
 cm knowing that at the level of the thorax we 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.720
 have the skin directly on the ribs 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.260
 and then they went there pleura and 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.150
 lung 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:17.959
 so in almost 50% of the cases we have 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.590
 an attack of the pleura and sometimes 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.780
 lung if we do not support its 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.910
 wounds there surgically 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.709
 it can make pneumonia very, very 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.010
 serious okay he would have said also 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.870
 very serious and 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.610
 some may die of it so it is 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.010
 important in first intention of 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.349
 cut the hair around to see a little 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.090
 at the size of the plain and if it's a 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.930
 small planet do not forget 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.430
 to go see a veterinarian for 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.930
 potentially reopen the wound of 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.470
 bigger way in order to go 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.360
 explore the entire cavity created by this 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.989
 sore and not to forget germs 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.030
 hairs 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.709
 especially since some dogs of 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.840
 long-haired hunt as soon as there is a 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.420
 wound the hair back into the wound and 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.069
 robin gore so the hunter can in 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.230
 first place to disinfect well the 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.250
 sore trying to go out if they see any 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.780
 hair coming out and so on 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.910
 put a bandage either using 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.510
 compresses slightly impregnated with 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.600
 diluted disinfectant ok and that's a 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.919
 band not too compressive or so if 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.880
 it's a big dog and it's 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.460
 a little complicated to bandage 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.080
 our system of the cloth which we have 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.169
 talked last month 1 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.479
 the dish towel moisten with 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.900
 potentially a little disinfectant and 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.430
 a little band around the dog for 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.349
 to close well the wound avoid advice 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.150
 multi subsequent decontamination 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.110
 okay then I find myself at 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.120
 middle of the hunt my giant dog 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.470
 open by a wild boar 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.300
 what do i have to do i'm finishing 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.260
 my beaten I take my dog ​​with me 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.940
 I'm going to the vet 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.669
 how do I take it is this 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.590
 that we take a dog we bring it back to the 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:04.490
 little car because already where we have to be at 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.410
 help ok we already clear the wound 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.020
 okay so on the hairy dogs 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.970
 long cuts well a bit all around 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.720
 the agreement wound disinfects a small 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:17.389
 little ok we squeak with another hot 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.590
 with a little disinfectant diluted or with 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.630
 a little soapy water 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.620
 we squeak well to have a little bit 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:30.530
 clearer yeah so really we are sure 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.100
 at 100% it is only skin is left 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.170
 the 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:38.140
 it can stop there it can wait and 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:40.970
 if the wound is deeper 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.290
 veterinarian directly okay he's 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.880
 con presto okay that's it 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:48.050
 the more we intervene quickly on these dishes 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.690
 the more we will limit the contamination 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.570
 bacterial the risk of complications 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:57.410
 pulmonary and others are important ok 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:59.150
 okay so paul is full of honey he 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.100
 the same is often unpleasant 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.740
 small in size with a lot of respect 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.870
 internal agree with he's fine 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.480
 important to clear was calling 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:11.360
 check the depth of the wound and 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.250
 laure should exist ration what 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.140
 happens to the time where it really the 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.810
 abdominal wall very differed one can 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:21.680
 have the intestines so or leaving 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.510
 and so that's where it is important 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.380
 to intervene very quickly if you want 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.610
 save the dog's life from a the first 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.940
 so it's bringing back the cats the 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:34.340
 car there we can already reims and all 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.210
 the organs that come out with water 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.610
 lukewarm 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.870
 okay it may have helped a little bit already 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.760
 and there for once the cloth is 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:46.280
 really essential we humidified well 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.230
 ok wipe on the dog 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.640
 in it we put a little band around and 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.250
 directly to the veterinarian 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:57.590
 moistening a little every 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:59.410
 organs etc will still allow us to go 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.390
 say better recovery okay 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.370
 for for the dog for the dog ok 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:07.220
 that's all that's pleading 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.980
 legs it obviously still depends on 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.650
 the size of the wound if we have a 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:15.470
 wound that goes from the the the the future will be 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.360
 necessary first gestures 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.550
 intention always make the same one 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.070
 good infections we can do when 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.020
 these are wounds that intervene in 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.240
 under the dough footbaths 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:30.290
 are very useful 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:31.940
 it helps with a small basin of 

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.540
 disinfect well and I have 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:38.030
 german wounds between the pads 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:41.690
 resorbs well with bankers well 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:44.660
 daily betadine diluted or 

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:47.360
 dilute chlorhexidine ok very well and 

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:50.960
 well perfect I think we have pretty much 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.360
 almost everything seen on laughing all 

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.580
 cats that hunt wild boar 

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.660
 thank you very much and then we hope that the 

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:03.040
 hunting hunters with points like 

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:03.040
 you good understanding of his instructions
