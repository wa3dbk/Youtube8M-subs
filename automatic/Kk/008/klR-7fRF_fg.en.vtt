00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
2 we talked about shutter speed we

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.670 
2 we talked about shutter speed we
talked<00:00:33.210> about<00:00:33.329> freeze<00:00:33.750> into<00:00:34.079> action<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.620> we

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
talked about freeze into action and we

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.979 
talked about freeze into action and we
talked<00:00:34.920> about<00:00:35.040> how<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.370> relates<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.989> actual

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
talked about how that relates to actual

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.660 
talked about how that relates to actual
aperture<00:00:37.500> when<00:00:37.739> using<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.280> shutter<00:00:38.489> speed

now<00:00:39.600> you're<00:00:39.989> one<00:00:40.379> step<00:00:40.860> away<00:00:41.070> from<00:00:41.280> being<00:00:41.670> able

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
now you're one step away from being able

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.630 
now you're one step away from being able
to<00:00:42.000> use<00:00:42.210> your<00:00:42.390> camera<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.930> fully<00:00:43.399> manual<00:00:44.399> mode

to use your camera and fully manual mode
stepping<00:00:45.180> out<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.570> automatic<00:00:46.110> mode<00:00:46.140> and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
stepping out of the automatic mode and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.850 
stepping out of the automatic mode and
into<00:00:47.090> creative<00:00:48.090> control<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.750> manual<00:00:49.230> let's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
into creative control with manual let's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.670 
into creative control with manual let's
talk<00:00:50.070> about<00:00:50.219> ISO<00:00:51.079> inside<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.199> your<00:00:52.320> digital

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
talk about ISO inside of your digital

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.250 
talk about ISO inside of your digital
camera<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.309> an<00:00:53.399> image<00:00:53.670> sensor<00:00:53.930> as<00:00:54.930> your

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
camera you have an image sensor as your

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.529 
camera you have an image sensor as your
available<00:00:55.770> light<00:00:55.949> lessens<00:00:56.489> increasing<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
available light lessens increasing the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.049 
available light lessens increasing the
ISO<00:00:57.690> number<00:00:58.460> multiplies<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.699> sensor

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
ISO number multiplies the sensor

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.540 
ISO number multiplies the sensor
sensitivity<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> light<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:02.010> allows<00:01:02.340> you

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
sensitivity to the light this allows you

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.429 
sensitivity to the light this allows you
to<00:01:02.640> bring<00:01:02.820> up<00:01:03.090> light<00:01:03.390> levels<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.019> order<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
to bring up light levels in order to

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.399 
to bring up light levels in order to
achieve<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> proper<00:01:05.159> exposure<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:06.060> will<00:01:06.990> warn

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
achieve a proper exposure I will warn

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.399 
achieve a proper exposure I will warn
you<00:01:07.530> high<00:01:08.430> ISO<00:01:09.150> values<00:01:09.630> will<00:01:09.900> start<00:01:10.260> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
you high ISO values will start to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.679 
you high ISO values will start to
degrade<00:01:10.560> your<00:01:10.950> image<00:01:11.280> quality<00:01:11.689> because

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
degrade your image quality because

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.510 
degrade your image quality because
you're<00:01:12.900> amplifying<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.710> light<00:01:13.920> available<00:01:14.400> to

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you're amplifying the light available to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.789 
you're amplifying the light available to
the<00:01:14.610> camera<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.570> sensor<00:01:15.990> starts<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.439> create

the camera the sensor starts to create

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.310 
the camera the sensor starts to create
what's<00:01:17.100> called<00:01:17.159> digital<00:01:17.939> noise<00:01:18.150> or<00:01:18.630> grain<00:01:19.020> as

what's called digital noise or grain as

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.670 
what's called digital noise or grain as
you<00:01:20.100> see<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.549> example<00:01:20.750> with<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> low<00:01:22.049> ISO

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
you see in this example with the low ISO

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.039 
you see in this example with the low ISO
setting<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.729> see<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> meter<00:01:24.299> tucked<00:01:24.600> away<00:01:24.780> in

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
setting you see the meter tucked away in

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.100 
setting you see the meter tucked away in
the<00:01:25.170> shadows<00:01:25.560> not<00:01:25.770> showing<00:01:26.100> much<00:01:26.250> detail

increasing the ISO too much it creates

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.870 
increasing the ISO too much it creates
some<00:01:30.630> more<00:01:30.810> light<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.650> also<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.220> unwanted
