00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.030
 while today we have a very project 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.309
 pretty easy the little faces of the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.660
 teddy bears or the appointments here were placed 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.299
 very close so you can 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.140
 detail a very nice project what 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:24.730
 it is in buttons here what is the little mouth 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.640
 and the mouth is placed or is armed 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.000
 with a thread is a long stitch the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.680
 little eyes are also stitches with thread 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.989
 here the nose and is that we have here is 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.239
 painted with special paint for fabric 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.070
 here you can see that I 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.320
 I move what is the mouth if you 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.659
 they want to make it with needle and thread a 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.829
 dark brown color they are very 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.129
 pretty 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.360
 this is a different design than this one 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.879
 if you can use it in 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.010
 any craft or even the 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.140
 Can use to decorate accessories 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.260
 as we have it here is an accessory 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.239
 little one decorated with teddy bears 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.089
 materials for that we're going to need 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.640
 colored lined buttons white color 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.730
 beige or brown color cited what you 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.520
 want 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:16.520
 We are going to use 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:20.250
 nice miniature makeup for dolls 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.610
 what is the flush and these bollards that is 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.750
 a stick with some pretty ones on the tip 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.509
 to apply what is the blush are going to 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.280
 make two felt ears 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.009
 depending on the size the buttons that 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.829
 you have covered, you have achieved and 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.170
 a little triangle for the nose and that's it 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.230
 would be all the materials that we are going to 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.650
 use today 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.540
 and then we go quickly to make up 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.270
 what is one of the faces so that 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.360
 you can observe it simply 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.290
 with the bollard 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.980
 apply 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.120
 silicone in the cheeks of those of the 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.910
 quotes 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.680

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:11.770
 of liquid silicone we will use a 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.070
 stick to apply on the nose 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.530
 in this way you are going to prevent 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.900
 they are stained what is the button and 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.700
 they simply apply the amount 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.310
 necessary that you are going to use 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.070

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.690

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.510
 using needle and thread and give the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.040

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.670
 pen 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.670
 the mouth is a fast hairline 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.010
 and the eyes are two lines that you 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.730
 let's do 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.600
