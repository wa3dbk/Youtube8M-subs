00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 high risk allocation loud meanwhile 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.910
 have at all probably again the school 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.770
 started 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.500
 and i stopped attending school 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.139
 I have to go to my school time 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.389
 thought back to the following 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.470
 The problem with school is that simple 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.510
 it exists so the school starts 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.609
 one of the first things you do 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.410
 His school things actually go shopping 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.220
 like it even every school supplies shop 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.410
 that somehow makes fun just go 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.480
 that's the problem i can do now 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.190
 but tell about my school days 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.600
 I always started with that 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.110
 first came five minutes late 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.110
 am 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.160
 sorry that I'm late because 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.040
 I have a black can you the way 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.340
 crossed and I have to go another way 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.660
 take that 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.520
 I'm five minutes late in the 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.210
 come see me please 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.990
 as if I had killed five people 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.180
 The next disaster was already when 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.520
 i saw that my bank neighbor / 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.590
 best friend in the school is not there 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.200
 When the best school I found there 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.540
 Let's hope that you will be five 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.850
 I hope you can do it or you better 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.310
 yes , nothing bad and 95 percent 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:29.240
 you think how could you just me 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:31.280
 some you just sit next to the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:39.560
 streber as you can at least at home 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:42.800
 I can write write on yes 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.710
 The results are wrong, however 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.850
 no matter 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.100
 Thank you, the teacher finally starts 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.160
 with substandard turns to the blackboard 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:03.369
 I want to start drawing and I quietly 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:05.479
 I use the greatest artist out 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.850
 because you can only hope that you 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.100
 someday makes a trip to the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.959
 At the end of the day you found that 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.090
 the bus ride was the best 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.100
 yes you could of course now on 10 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.140
 many important and life relevant 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.670
 you things at school I learned my 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.560
 Who cares what the school one 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.799
 not teaching you how to keep your family 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.540
 properly educating or how to find job 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.630
 At least you can the cut angle 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.880
 between two levels 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.290
 i mean hello how should i live 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.060
 insist if I still have that 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.420
 I have to sing alphabet so I know 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.070
 which letter will come up 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.020
 Nevertheless, there are three things I have in it 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.090
 The school has learned to sleep without 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.640
 to be caught writing news 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.640
 without looking on the phone and teamworx 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.550
 schoolwork 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.560
 moreover, it is in every right back 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.750
 I think they come to school 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.620
 Everyone has problems, you really are not 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.540
 alone 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.540
 you have conflicts with yourself 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.400
 of course where there is conflict with teachers 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.720
 your homework so I have 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.580
 lost when I fought with the weapons 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.360
 who said she was not the one 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.360
 best of the world 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:24.100
 and where is your book my book at home 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.640
 aha and what does it do at home me 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.510
 suspect to have more fun than me and 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.940
 Conflicts with parents mom dad of course 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.680
 No worries everyone has in my class 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.550
 a bad note in the school assignment 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.550
 really 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.750
 and died even before we got the whole thing 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.080
 bring me up because I'm pretty 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.500
 I am sure that many, at least 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:54.160
 after universe poly will ask 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.480
 I have the stuff from this page and 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.760
 the whole left are also in again 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.640
 that is, describe the video that is 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.470
 description means feel free 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.180

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.180
