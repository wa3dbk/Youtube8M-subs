a<00:00:33.000> new<00:00:33.300> quad-core<00:00:33.739> CPU<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.910> be

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
a new quad-core CPU and it can be

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.360 
a new quad-core CPU and it can be
rumored<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.420> be<00:00:36.480> called<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> apple<00:00:37.440> a6<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
iphone users if the iphone 5 is launched

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.190 
iphone users if the iphone 5 is launched
with<00:00:42.930> anything<00:00:43.320> less<00:00:43.559> than<00:00:43.739> quad-core<00:00:44.280> cpu

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
with anything less than quad-core cpu

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.990 
with anything less than quad-core cpu
especially<00:00:46.200> since<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:47.039> see<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.610> are<00:00:47.700> seeing<00:00:47.910> a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
especially since we see we are seeing a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.439 
especially since we see we are seeing a
new<00:00:48.120> trend<00:00:48.450> with<00:00:48.960> mobile<00:00:49.289> devices<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:50.180> 2012<00:00:51.180> it

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
new trend with mobile devices in 2012 it

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.900 
new trend with mobile devices in 2012 it
everything's<00:00:52.230> been<00:00:52.550> announced<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.730> not

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
everything's been announced and not

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.080 
everything's been announced and not
released<00:00:54.390> with<00:00:54.660> at<00:00:54.870> least<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.410> dual-core<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:57.059> i

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
released with at least a dual-core so i

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.819 
released with at least a dual-core so i
think<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.449> very<00:00:57.570> least<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.440> will<00:00:58.649> see<00:00:58.800> a

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
think it's very least we will see a

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.180 
think it's very least we will see a
dual-core<00:00:59.640> iphone<00:01:00.420> 5<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.559> also<00:01:01.710> expect

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
dual-core iphone 5 we can also expect

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.320 
dual-core iphone 5 we can also expect
you<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.409> see<00:01:04.409> an<00:01:04.530> increase<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:04.920> memory<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:05.640> not

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
you and see an increase in memory if not

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.260 
you and see an increase in memory if not
there<00:01:06.659> would<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.900> huge<00:01:07.260> disappointment<00:01:08.270> now

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
there would be a huge disappointment now

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.359 
there would be a huge disappointment now
we<00:01:09.330> should<00:01:09.689> also<00:01:09.990> expect<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.770> see<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
we should also expect to see that the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.480 
we should also expect to see that the
iphone<00:01:12.090> five<00:01:12.330> will<00:01:12.360> be<00:01:12.570> LTE<00:01:13.110> ready<00:01:13.470> with<00:01:13.979> 4G

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
iphone five will be LTE ready with 4G

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.179 
iphone five will be LTE ready with 4G
speeds<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.259> expect<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:17.009> sure

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
speeds and we can expect this for sure

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.969 
speeds and we can expect this for sure
because<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.759> new<00:01:17.880> ipad<00:01:18.330> 3rd<00:01:18.869> generation<00:01:19.110> has

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
because the new ipad 3rd generation has

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.820 
because the new ipad 3rd generation has
this<00:01:20.310> already<00:01:20.610> installed<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.960> we

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
this already installed in it and we

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.670 
this already installed in it and we
could<00:01:23.070> also<00:01:23.189> see<00:01:23.610> an<00:01:23.869> increase<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:24.900> screen

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
could also see an increase in screen

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.940 
could also see an increase in screen
size<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.729> 3.5<00:01:27.450> inch<00:01:27.780> screen<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.320> currently

size the 3.5 inch screen that currently
the<00:01:29.130> iphones<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:30.060> right<00:01:30.270> now<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:31.020> looks<00:01:31.049> very

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the iphones have right now it looks very

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.130 
the iphones have right now it looks very
small<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.159> especially<00:01:33.150> compared<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.689> every

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
small and especially compared to every

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.020 
small and especially compared to every
other<00:01:34.170> device<00:01:34.530> that's<00:01:34.950> being<00:01:35.250> announced<00:01:35.520> and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
other device that's being announced and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.819 
other device that's being announced and
released<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> market<00:01:37.200> right<00:01:37.229> now<00:01:37.350> like

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
released on the market right now like

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.999 
released on the market right now like
the<00:01:38.009> galaxy<00:01:38.549> s2<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.659> note<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.350> iphone

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the galaxy s2 and the note the iphone

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.999 
the galaxy s2 and the note the iphone
looks<00:01:41.159> very<00:01:41.759> very<00:01:41.939> small<00:01:42.540> compared<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.229> so

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
looks very very small compared to it so

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.740 
looks very very small compared to it so
we<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.490> expect<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.880> see<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.509> with<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
we can expect to see that and with the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.889 
we can expect to see that and with the
new<00:01:45.780> iphone<00:01:46.470> screen<00:01:47.310> size<00:01:47.640> being<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.720> lot

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
new iphone screen size being a lot

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.639 
new iphone screen size being a lot
bigger<00:01:48.930> they<00:01:49.590> could<00:01:49.860> also<00:01:50.040> create<00:01:50.600> more<00:01:51.649> space

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
bigger they could also create more space

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.880 
bigger they could also create more space
inside<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.579> phone<00:01:53.790> which<00:01:54.479> will<00:01:54.930> increase<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
inside the phone which will increase the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.249 
inside the phone which will increase the
battery<00:01:56.070> size<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.299> can<00:01:57.360> maybe<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.750> fit<00:01:58.110> in

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
battery size and you can maybe in fit in

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.550 
battery size and you can maybe in fit in
an<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:59.130> 5x<00:01:59.850> chip<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.810> new<00:02:00.960> ipad<00:02:01.350> 3rd

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
an a 5x chip that the new ipad 3rd

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.459 
an a 5x chip that the new ipad 3rd
generation<00:02:01.770> has<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.670> right<00:02:02.939> now<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:04.350> can

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
generation has and right now you can

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.920 
generation has and right now you can
expect<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.920> get<00:02:05.579> about<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.939> same<00:02:05.969> battery

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
expect to get about the same battery

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.600 
expect to get about the same battery
percent<00:02:07.409> maybe<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.009> little<00:02:08.220> bit<00:02:08.429> less

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
percent maybe in a little bit less

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.940 
percent maybe in a little bit less
because<00:02:09.270> with<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.720> bigger<00:02:09.929> screen<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.619> LTE

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
because with the bigger screen and LTE

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.360 
because with the bigger screen and LTE
it's<00:02:11.250> really<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.879> eat<00:02:12.030> up<00:02:12.150> your

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
it's really going to eat up your

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.270 
it's really going to eat up your
battery<00:02:12.879> so<00:02:13.180> in<00:02:13.900> hopefully<00:02:14.590> we<00:02:14.830> get<00:02:14.920> about<00:02:15.069> the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
battery so in hopefully we get about the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.979 
battery so in hopefully we get about the
same<00:02:15.310> time<00:02:15.580> frame<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.299> like<00:02:16.569> what<00:02:16.780> they<00:02:16.870> do

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
same time frame is like what they do

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.860 
same time frame is like what they do
with<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.170> ipad<00:02:17.470> 3<00:02:17.799> i<00:02:18.060> think<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.269> new<00:02:19.390> iphone

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
with the ipad 3 i think the new iphone

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.610 
with the ipad 3 i think the new iphone
will<00:02:20.440> have<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:21.010> curved<00:02:21.459> back<00:02:21.760> we<00:02:22.269> we<00:02:23.140> should<00:02:23.409> see

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
will have a curved back we we should see

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.920 
will have a curved back we we should see
a<00:02:23.650> new<00:02:23.860> redesign<00:02:24.400> since<00:02:24.780> usually<00:02:25.780> with<00:02:25.870> the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
a new redesign since usually with the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.080 
a new redesign since usually with the
iphones<00:02:26.319> they<00:02:26.680> only<00:02:26.799> have<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.430> like<00:02:27.790> what<00:02:27.940> they

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
iphones they only have to like what they

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.720 
iphones they only have to like what they
did<00:02:28.150> with<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:28.450> 3g<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.079> 3gs<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.099> 4<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.489> 4s

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
did with the 3g and 3gs and the 4 and 4s

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.789 
did with the 3g and 3gs and the 4 and 4s
they<00:02:31.480> only<00:02:31.569> had<00:02:31.810> two<00:02:32.049> about<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.260> same<00:02:32.500> design

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
they only had two about the same design

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.030 
they only had two about the same design
and<00:02:33.040> then<00:02:33.129> they<00:02:33.310> tend<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.760> switch<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.239> up<00:02:34.329> so<00:02:35.040> we

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
and then they tend to switch it up so we

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.979 
and then they tend to switch it up so we
can<00:02:36.190> see<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.370> totally<00:02:37.060> different<00:02:37.420> design<00:02:37.690> now<00:02:37.840> I

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
can see a totally different design now I

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.420 
can see a totally different design now I
think<00:02:38.049> they're<00:02:38.769> going<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.950> try<00:02:39.099> to<00:02:39.129> keep<00:02:39.310> it

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
think they're going to try to keep it

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.309 
think they're going to try to keep it
the<00:02:39.519> same<00:02:39.549> maybe<00:02:40.090> bigger<00:02:40.390> screen<00:02:40.810> but<00:02:41.200> then

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
the same maybe bigger screen but then

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.610 
the same maybe bigger screen but then
they're<00:02:41.409> gonna<00:02:41.470> have<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:42.390> curved<00:02:43.390> back<00:02:43.750> but

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
they're gonna have a curved back but

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.020 
they're gonna have a curved back but
many<00:02:45.220> people<00:02:45.310> are<00:02:45.609> saying<00:02:45.819> they're<00:02:45.940> gonna

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
many people are saying they're gonna

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.410 
many people are saying they're gonna
have<00:02:46.209> a<00:02:46.450> mirrored<00:02:47.140> back<00:02:47.319> like<00:02:47.560> how<00:02:47.709> an<00:02:47.950> ipad

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
have a mirrored back like how an ipad

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.180 
have a mirrored back like how an ipad
iPods<00:02:49.420> I<00:02:49.720> don't<00:02:50.170> think<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.769> don't<00:02:50.920> believe

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
iPods I don't think that I don't believe

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.440 
iPods I don't think that I don't believe
that<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.459> be<00:02:51.489> true<00:02:51.609> I<00:02:51.849> think<00:02:52.180> they're<00:02:52.359> gonna

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
that to be true I think they're gonna

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.720 
that to be true I think they're gonna
have<00:02:53.049> occurred<00:02:53.410> back<00:02:53.680> like<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.099> ipods<00:02:54.430> but

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
have occurred back like the ipods but

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.099 
have occurred back like the ipods but
that<00:02:54.879> like<00:02:55.060> i<00:02:55.150> have<00:02:55.299> in<00:02:55.480> black<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:55.930> white

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
that like i have in black and white

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.069 
that like i have in black and white
since<00:02:56.709> many<00:02:56.890> people<00:02:57.280> really<00:02:57.940> do<00:02:58.090> like<00:02:58.299> how<00:02:59.019> you

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
since many people really do like how you

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.110 
since many people really do like how you
can<00:02:59.260> customize<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.709> black<00:03:00.159> white<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:00.700> pick

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
different colors and especially with the

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.670 
different colors and especially with the
mirrored<00:03:03.310> back<00:03:03.519> it<00:03:04.120> really<00:03:04.930> gets<00:03:05.109> scratches

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
mirrored back it really gets scratches
