put it in your closet that when you take

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
it back out you're not going to have

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.200 
it back out you're not going to have
those<00:00:24.960> wrinkles<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.310> know<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:27.000> some

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
those wrinkles so I know that some

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.000 
those wrinkles so I know that some
people<00:00:27.330> recommend<00:00:27.660> actually<00:00:28.500> hanging<00:00:28.769> them

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
people recommend actually hanging them

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.009 
people recommend actually hanging them
and<00:00:29.189> folding<00:00:29.490> them<00:00:29.640> over<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.359> don't<00:00:30.660> advise

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
and folding them over but I don't advise

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.110 
and folding them over but I don't advise
that<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.529> really<00:00:32.070> love<00:00:32.279> these<00:00:32.460> hangers<00:00:32.880> because

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
that I really love these hangers because

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.350 
that I really love these hangers because
they<00:00:33.960> give<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.670> pants<00:00:35.969> are<00:00:36.059> able<00:00:36.329> to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
they give you the the pants are able to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.350 
they give you the the pants are able to
hang<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.920> really<00:00:38.250> reduces<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.149> risk

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
hang and so it really reduces the risk

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.930 
hang and so it really reduces the risk
of<00:00:39.510> any<00:00:39.690> wrinkles<00:00:40.170> or<00:00:40.320> any<00:00:40.500> creases<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.610> if<00:00:41.850> I'm

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
of any wrinkles or any creases so if I'm

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.220 
of any wrinkles or any creases so if I'm
not<00:00:42.059> going<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> be<00:00:42.329> wearing<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.719> pants<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.200> a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
not going to be wearing the pants for a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.319
