first thing we're gonna click is recover

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.130 
first thing we're gonna click is recover
data<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.220> that's<00:01:39.119> gonna<00:01:39.299> bring<00:01:39.540> up<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.960> whole

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
data and that's gonna bring up a whole

bunch<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.470> different<00:01:40.590> options<00:01:41.010> now<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.850> is

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
bunch of different options now this is

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.260 
bunch of different options now this is
really<00:01:42.150> going<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:42.390> depend<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:43.940> what<00:01:44.940> you<00:01:45.090> need

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
to recover and how you're doing it I

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.300 
to recover and how you're doing it I
usually<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.229> quick<00:01:49.470> recovery<00:01:49.770> first

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
usually like to do quick recovery first

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.780 
usually like to do quick recovery first
it's<00:01:50.670> by<00:01:50.880> far<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.330> fastest<00:01:51.900> and<00:01:52.460> you<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.610> see

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
it's by far the fastest and you can see

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.719 
it's by far the fastest and you can see
if<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.060> gonna<00:01:54.150> recover<00:01:54.570> your<00:01:54.750> data<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.290> way

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
if it's gonna recover your data that way

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.640 
if it's gonna recover your data that way
you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.880> change<00:01:57.150> this<00:01:57.540> based<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.409> want

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
you can change this based on if you want

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.920 
you can change this based on if you want
to<00:01:58.740> do<00:01:58.830> photo<00:01:59.100> recovery<00:01:59.729> or<00:01:59.909> iPod<00:02:00.390> recovery

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
to do photo recovery or iPod recovery

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.770 
to do photo recovery or iPod recovery
raw<00:02:01.710> recovery<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.610> more<00:02:03.299> or<00:02:03.360> less<00:02:03.509> like<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
raw recovery is more or less like a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.260 
raw recovery is more or less like a
last-ditch<00:02:04.380> effort<00:02:04.619> if<00:02:05.189> none<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.030> these<00:02:06.090> other

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
last-ditch effort if none of these other

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.410 
last-ditch effort if none of these other
recovery<00:02:06.659> options<00:02:07.320> work<00:02:07.909> also<00:02:08.909> I<00:02:09.090> want<00:02:09.330> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
recovery options work also I want to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.229 
recovery options work also I want to
