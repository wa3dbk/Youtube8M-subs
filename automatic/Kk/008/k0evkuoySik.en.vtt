00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.389
 the new power matrixx is a 5 out of 5 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.520
 matrix 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:20.930
 composed with all RGB amount 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:25.340
 beelitz 30 watts each for each piece and that 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:28.580
 can be fully targeted so means 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.369
 in the bridge organs is delivered together 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.370
 with and 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.559
 brackets that hang it in the bridge 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.960
 makes it easy or you can just do that 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.760
 and you can make it shine 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.710
 places and you will also see the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.760
 special points to put them against each other 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.760
 to pull 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.579
 at the back you have the here than the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.789
 we see the locking piece behind it 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.660
 park in power come from to agree to 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.050
 linking 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.239
 then have the dmx in out 3 pin and the dmx 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.649
 in old 5 pin 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.840
 we have three times sixteen here 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.759
 characters menu on which we all kinds 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.950
 different channel notes can 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.560
 setting that is possible from a very simple one 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.310
 4-channel required at rgb plus maester 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.340
 dimmer 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.369
 but you can also use every pixel every 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.330
 we every pixel out of 25 in total 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.959
 know you manage separately in rgb 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.250
 RGB for each pixel or RGB maester dim 

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:30.649
 for every pixel 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.950
 you can also have a minus of 25 channels 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:37.250
 which you then apply to each pixel 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.520
 cold white or for every pixel 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.970
 you can also choose warm white 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.679
 there built-in 6 dmx channels with which you 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.470
 a whole battery 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.160
 built-in programs and chase is possible 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.130
 calling 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.739
 including the alphabet numbers 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.370
 letters can do the review quite 

00:01:54.739 --> 00:02:00.780
 pass easily 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:03.510
 he is also software and fragile and 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.920
 rdm compatible profile say that you like 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.510
 on your dmx 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:13.680
 the table him they can start address 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:16.190
 set the bmx channel mode 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.930
 and sets itself too 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.150
 present at the demix table as 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.560
 being the ld power 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.560
 matrixx from bright act
