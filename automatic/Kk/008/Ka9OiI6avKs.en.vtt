00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
shot the last bit of video and we've

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.810 
shot the last bit of video and we've
spent<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:20.989> time<00:03:21.019> looking<00:03:21.980> at<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.459> device

aware<00:05:01.590> there<00:05:02.130> does<00:05:02.310> appear<00:05:02.430> that<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:03.090> mac

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
aware there does appear that the mac

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.920 
aware there does appear that the mac
drivers<00:05:03.690> are<00:05:04.200> extremely<00:05:04.860> limited<00:05:05.750> so<00:05:06.750> let's

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
drivers are extremely limited so let's

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.810 
drivers are extremely limited so let's
now<00:05:07.110> switch<00:05:07.470> to<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:08.340> logitech<00:05:08.970> camera<00:05:10.669> so<00:05:11.669> now

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.490 
now switch to the logitech camera so now
we're<00:05:12.060> on<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.300> logitech<00:05:12.750> you<00:05:12.840> can<00:05:13.020> see<00:05:13.290> i

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
we're on the logitech you can see i

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.800 
we're on the logitech you can see i
think<00:05:13.950> first<00:05:14.100> of<00:05:14.250> all<00:05:14.370> that<00:05:14.550> my<00:05:14.669> face<00:05:14.970> is<00:05:15.000> is

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
think first of all that my face is is

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.110 
think first of all that my face is is
it's<00:05:16.140> blown<00:05:16.530> out<00:05:16.740> with<00:05:17.040> the<00:05:17.280> with<00:05:17.790> the<00:05:17.880> lights

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
it's blown out with the with the lights

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.570 
it's blown out with the with the lights
as<00:05:18.270> we<00:05:18.390> have<00:05:18.510> no<00:05:18.660> ability<00:05:19.500> to<00:05:19.710> control<00:05:20.400> the

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
as we have no ability to control the

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.740 
as we have no ability to control the
camera<00:05:20.900> also<00:05:21.900> you'll<00:05:22.140> see<00:05:22.410> that<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:23.750> colors

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
camera also you'll see that the colors

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.780 
camera also you'll see that the colors
that<00:05:24.900> color<00:05:25.140> balance<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:25.919> white<00:05:26.160> balance<00:05:26.370> is

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
that color balance the white balance is

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.719 
that color balance the white balance is
is<00:05:27.600> very<00:05:27.720> different<00:05:28.350> and<00:05:28.590> especially<00:05:29.460> on<00:05:29.640> the

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
is very different and especially on the

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.490 
is very different and especially on the
desktop<00:05:30.120> seems<00:05:30.960> a<00:05:31.410> lot<00:05:32.419> richer<00:05:33.419> I<00:05:33.810> think<00:05:34.320> but

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
desktop seems a lot richer I think but

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.170 
desktop seems a lot richer I think but
but<00:05:34.710> artificial<00:05:35.340> I<00:05:35.400> don't<00:05:35.580> think<00:05:35.850> it<00:05:36.000> is

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
but artificial I don't think it is

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.960 
but artificial I don't think it is
correct<00:05:36.780> at<00:05:37.200> all<00:05:37.440> at<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.550> other<00:05:38.669> thing<00:05:38.940> that

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
correct at all at the other thing that

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.940 
correct at all at the other thing that
you<00:05:39.150> obviously<00:05:39.930> have<00:05:40.020> noticed<00:05:40.410> is<00:05:40.650> that<00:05:40.680> it's

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
you obviously have noticed is that it's

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.730 
you obviously have noticed is that it's
got<00:05:41.010> a<00:05:41.130> very<00:05:41.280> wide<00:05:41.580> angle<00:05:41.970> lens<00:05:42.180> and<00:05:42.740> you're

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
got a very wide angle lens and you're

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.010 
got a very wide angle lens and you're
seeing<00:05:44.040> a<00:05:44.100> lot<00:05:44.280> more<00:05:44.310> of<00:05:44.760> the<00:05:45.300> studio<00:05:45.690> here

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
seeing a lot more of the studio here

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.680 
seeing a lot more of the studio here
then<00:05:46.590> you<00:05:47.220> would<00:05:47.370> normally<00:05:47.550> see<00:05:47.880> or<00:05:48.330> you<00:05:48.360> see

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
then you would normally see or you see

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.890 
then you would normally see or you see
using<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.350> sony<00:05:49.740> camera<00:05:50.250> and<00:05:50.610> a<00:05:51.479> wide<00:05:51.720> angle

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
using the sony camera and a wide angle

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.260 
using the sony camera and a wide angle
lens<00:05:52.260> can<00:05:52.620> be<00:05:52.770> a<00:05:52.800> real<00:05:53.040> advantage<00:05:53.310> for<00:05:53.910> a<00:05:53.940> lot

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
lens can be a real advantage for a lot

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.880 
lens can be a real advantage for a lot
of<00:05:54.390> things<00:05:54.630> especially<00:05:55.260> if<00:05:55.500> you<00:05:55.560> haven't<00:05:55.770> got

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
of things especially if you haven't got

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.040 
of things especially if you haven't got
much<00:05:56.040> space<00:05:56.370> but<00:05:56.640> at<00:05:56.729> the<00:05:56.790> moment<00:05:56.910> the<00:05:57.690> camera

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
much space but at the moment the camera

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.810 
much space but at the moment the camera
is<00:05:58.140> about<00:05:58.410> four<00:05:58.860> four<00:05:59.130> and<00:05:59.160> a<00:05:59.250> half<00:05:59.280> feet<00:05:59.580> about

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
is about four four and a half feet about

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.089 
is about four four and a half feet about
a<00:05:59.850> meter<00:06:00.090> and<00:06:00.180> a<00:06:00.240> half<00:06:00.270> away<00:06:00.720> from<00:06:00.750> me<00:06:01.080> and<00:06:01.289> if

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
a meter and a half away from me and if

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:05.119 
a meter and a half away from me and if
we<00:06:02.130> wanted<00:06:02.729> to<00:06:02.789> cut<00:06:03.720> the

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 
we wanted to cut the

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.070 
we wanted to cut the
angle<00:06:05.459> that<00:06:05.789> you<00:06:05.849> can<00:06:06.149> see<00:06:06.360> down<00:06:06.629> a<00:06:06.659> bit<00:06:06.929> we'd

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
angle that you can see down a bit we'd

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.260 
angle that you can see down a bit we'd
have<00:06:07.259> to<00:06:07.379> move<00:06:07.559> it<00:06:07.709> quite<00:06:07.919> a<00:06:07.949> little<00:06:08.159> a<00:06:08.279> lot

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
have to move it quite a little a lot

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.499 
have to move it quite a little a lot
closer<00:06:09.679> which<00:06:10.679> might<00:06:10.919> cause<00:06:10.949> problems<00:06:11.580> in<00:06:12.360> a

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:12.509 
closer which might cause problems in a

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.820 
closer which might cause problems in a
studio<00:06:12.929> type<00:06:13.199> environment<00:06:14.869> so<00:06:15.869> it<00:06:16.319> is<00:06:16.529> an

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
studio type environment so it is an

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.129 
studio type environment so it is an
interesting<00:06:17.459> camera<00:06:17.999> but<00:06:18.179> the<00:06:18.300> price<00:06:18.539> point<00:06:18.899> I
