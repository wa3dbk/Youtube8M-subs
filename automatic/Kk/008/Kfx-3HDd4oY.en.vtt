00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
middle of doing it once I realized I

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.410

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
take the hub bolt off so I had to go

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.080 
take the hub bolt off so I had to go
somewhere<00:02:02.110> and<00:02:02.290> get<00:02:02.650> it<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.040> you<00:02:03.580> know<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:03.729> just

somewhere and get it and you know I just
didn't<00:02:04.299> really<00:02:04.479> care<00:02:04.689> at<00:02:04.780> that<00:02:04.930> point<00:02:05.170> just

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
didn't really care at that point just

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.170 
didn't really care at that point just
want<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.560> put<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.770> steering<00:02:05.979> wheel<00:02:06.159> on<00:02:06.340> but

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.859 
once I had the right tool this swap
literally<00:02:09.369> took<00:02:09.519> me<00:02:09.640> fifteen<00:02:10.030> minutes<00:02:10.360> at<00:02:10.539> the
