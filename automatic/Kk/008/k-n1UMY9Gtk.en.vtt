before<00:00:00.599> we<00:00:00.719> get<00:00:00.840> started<00:00:01.140> knitting<00:00:01.620> the<00:00:01.829> brim

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
before we get started knitting the brim

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.760 
before we get started knitting the brim
I'm<00:00:02.310> just<00:00:02.490> going<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.669> talk<00:00:02.879> about<00:00:03.030> different

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:03.770 
I'm just going to talk about different

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.320 
I'm just going to talk about different
rims<00:00:04.770> that<00:00:04.920> can<00:00:05.190> be<00:00:05.310> on<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.730> bottom<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.150> your

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
rims that can be on the bottom of your

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.259 
rims that can be on the bottom of your
hat<00:00:06.540> so<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.350> can<00:00:07.770> have<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.540> knit<00:00:09.540> one<00:00:09.719> purl<00:00:10.019> one

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
hat so you can have a knit one purl one

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.490 
hat so you can have a knit one purl one
again<00:00:12.269> we<00:00:12.450> do<00:00:12.599> these<00:00:12.809> because<00:00:13.019> they're<00:00:13.349> more

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
again we do these because they're more

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.799 
again we do these because they're more
elastic<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.610> knit<00:00:14.880> one<00:00:15.089> purl<00:00:15.389> one<00:00:15.450> and

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
elastic so this is knit one purl one and

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.300 
elastic so this is knit one purl one and
I'm<00:00:15.870> going<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.080> show<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.289> how<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.590> do<00:00:16.830> that

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
I'm going to show you how to do that

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.939 
I'm going to show you how to do that
then<00:00:18.029> there<00:00:18.240> can<00:00:18.420> be<00:00:18.449> knit<00:00:19.350> two<00:00:19.619> purl<00:00:19.890> two

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
then there can be knit two purl two

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.710 
then there can be knit two purl two
which<00:00:20.550> these<00:00:20.939> are<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.180> same<00:00:21.390> number<00:00:21.689> of

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
which these are the same number of

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.189 
which these are the same number of
stitches<00:00:21.960> cast<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.800> can<00:00:22.949> see<00:00:23.130> that's<00:00:23.369> even

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
stitches cast on you can see that's even

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.960 
stitches cast on you can see that's even
tighter<00:00:25.199> than<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.560> first<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.430> if<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.609> stretch

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
tighter than the first so if you stretch

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.000 
tighter than the first so if you stretch
that<00:00:27.269> out<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.689> see<00:00:27.900> it's<00:00:28.019> knit<00:00:28.320> two<00:00:28.590> purl<00:00:28.920> two

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
that out you see it's knit two purl two

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.269 
that out you see it's knit two purl two
knit<00:00:29.220> two<00:00:29.609> purl<00:00:29.910> two<00:00:30.000> but<00:00:30.570> when<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.840> lies<00:00:31.050> flat

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
knit two purl two but when it lies flat

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.310 
knit two purl two but when it lies flat
its<00:00:32.279> tighter<00:00:32.610> than<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.329> then<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.290> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
its tighter than that and then this is a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.350 
its tighter than that and then this is a
roll<00:00:34.590> brim<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.640> where<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.850> knit<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> row

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
roll brim so this is where I knit a row

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.350 
roll brim so this is where I knit a row
purl<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.989> row<00:00:37.020> which<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.410> stockinette<00:00:38.100> and

stockinette<00:00:39.360> left<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.750> its<00:00:39.899> own<00:00:40.020> devices<00:00:40.410> is

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
stockinette left to its own devices is

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.619 
stockinette left to its own devices is
just<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> curl<00:00:41.399> up<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.450> with

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
just going to curl up like that so with

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
would end up growing up to be like this

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.330 
would end up growing up to be like this
if<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:27.299> were<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.570> do<00:01:27.689> knit<00:01:27.960> two<00:01:28.229> purl<00:01:28.650> two<00:01:28.710> it

those<00:01:35.340> stitches<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.270> then<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.229> would<00:01:37.350> be

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
those stitches in and then it would be

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.770 
those stitches in and then it would be
purl<00:01:37.740> two<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.860> again<00:01:41.700> knit<00:01:41.939> two<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.600> RIP

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
purl two and again knit two and the RIP

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.149 
won't start to pull together for a few
rows<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:46.110> would<00:01:46.229> continue<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.860> do<00:01:46.950> that

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
rows and you would continue and do that

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.440 
rows and you would continue and do that
across<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.909> row<00:01:49.939> okay<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.090> we're<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.210> going

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
