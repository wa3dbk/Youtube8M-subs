this<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.949> really<00:00:29.670> strong<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:30.869> very

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
this is really strong I like this very

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.889 
this is really strong I like this very
very<00:00:31.410> much<00:00:31.590> because<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.279> allows<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:33.660> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
very much because it allows you if you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.470 
very much because it allows you if you
get<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.860> later<00:00:35.070> game<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.700> recast<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.329> for

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
get to later game you can recast it for

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.270 
get to later game you can recast it for
one<00:00:36.719> right<00:00:37.260> before<00:00:37.410> combat<00:00:37.739> remember<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.190> as

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
one right before combat remember it as

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040 
one right before combat remember it as
haste<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.090> makes<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.450> very<00:00:39.480> powerful

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
haste so this makes it a very powerful

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.720 
haste so this makes it a very powerful
aggressive<00:00:40.770> creature<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.219> nice<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
aggressive creature it's nice on the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.580 
aggressive creature it's nice on the
carbon<00:00:42.059> three<00:00:42.239> men<00:00:42.390> again<00:00:42.660> if<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:43.020> find<00:00:43.260> a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
carbon three men again if you can find a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.760 
carbon three men again if you can find a
comfortable<00:00:44.370> three<00:00:44.910> spot<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.780> definitely<00:00:46.469> I

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
comfortable three spot it's definitely I

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.770 
comfortable three spot it's definitely I
think<00:00:47.219> standard<00:00:47.910> playable<00:00:48.300> because<00:00:48.570> if<00:00:48.660> it's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
think standard playable because if it's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.869 
think standard playable because if it's
recursion<00:00:49.260> ability<00:00:49.620> which<00:00:50.160> gives<00:00:50.399> aggressive

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
recursion ability which gives aggressive

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.990 
recursion ability which gives aggressive
decks<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.300> very<00:00:51.780> cheap<00:00:52.079> way<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.260> getting<00:00:52.860> back

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
decks a very cheap way of getting back

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000 
decks a very cheap way of getting back
continuous<00:00:54.000> continuous<00:00:54.600> damage<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
continuous continuous damage it's a

continuous continuous damage it's a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
removal and copying and the fact that

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.749 
removal and copying and the fact that
you<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.500> do<00:01:40.590> at<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> end<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.040> their<00:01:41.220> turn<00:01:41.520> is

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
you can do at the end of their turn is

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.749 
you can do at the end of their turn is

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
very powerful is it standard playable I

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.600 
very powerful is it standard playable I
don't<00:01:45.479> think<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.290> think<00:01:46.799> they'd<00:01:47.220> rather<00:01:47.430> be

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
don't think so I think they'd rather be

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.660 
don't think so I think they'd rather be
doing<00:01:47.729> other<00:01:47.909> things<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.600> turn<00:01:48.990> 5<00:01:49.229> or<00:01:49.439> 6<00:01:49.670> but

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
doing other things on turn 5 or 6 but

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.940 
doing other things on turn 5 or 6 but
for<00:01:51.420> commander<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.079> card<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.409> very<00:01:52.680> powerful

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
for commander this card is very powerful

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.569 
for commander this card is very powerful
I<00:01:53.460> think<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:55.020> think<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.409> really<00:01:55.890> cool<00:01:56.280> I

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
I think and I think it's really cool I

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.130 
I think and I think it's really cool I
think<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:56.850> well<00:01:57.030> designed<00:01:57.390> for<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> clone

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
think it's well designed for a clone

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.959 
think it's well designed for a clone
effect<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.799> think<00:01:58.979> Wizards<00:01:59.310> being<00:01:59.579> careful

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
effect and I think Wizards being careful

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.490 
effect and I think Wizards being careful
not<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.299> under<00:02:00.719> cost<00:02:00.990> something<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.320> this

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
not to under cost something like this

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.380 
not to under cost something like this
because<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.829> think<00:02:01.890> at<00:02:02.130> five<00:02:02.310> mana<00:02:02.610> honestly

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
because I think at five mana honestly

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.469 
because I think at five mana honestly
this<00:02:03.479> would<00:02:03.659> be<00:02:03.780> ridiculous<00:02:05.360> formatted<00:02:06.360> for

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
this would be ridiculous formatted for

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.749 
this would be ridiculous formatted for
clone<00:02:06.689> +1<00:02:07.290> for<00:02:07.469> none<00:02:07.590> summon<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:08.340> equal<00:02:08.700> to

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
clone +1 for none summon is not equal to

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.700 
clone +1 for none summon is not equal to

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
I think it's a little bit I don't know

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.380 
I think it's a little bit I don't know
if<00:02:55.950> it's<00:02:56.040> quite<00:02:56.280> there<00:02:56.490> for<00:02:56.760> standard<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.180> think

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
if it's quite there for standard I think

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.940 
if it's quite there for standard I think
I<00:02:57.480> turn<00:02:57.660> for<00:02:58.020> you'd<00:02:58.230> rather<00:02:58.470> be<00:02:58.770> doing

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
I turn for you'd rather be doing

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.550 
I turn for you'd rather be doing
something<00:02:59.130> else<00:02:59.550> then<00:03:00.540> playing<00:03:00.960> this<00:03:01.140> waiting

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
something else then playing this waiting

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.720 
something else then playing this waiting
for<00:03:01.800> its<00:03:02.580> effect<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:03.150> mean<00:03:04.080> yeah<00:03:04.620> sure<00:03:05.070> it's

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
for its effect I mean yeah sure it's

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.040 
for its effect I mean yeah sure it's
going<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.030> be<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.180> little<00:03:06.390> more<00:03:06.630> effective<00:03:06.990> I

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
going to be a little more effective I

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.900 
going to be a little more effective I
think<00:03:07.230> then<00:03:07.470> some<00:03:08.070> of<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.220> other<00:03:08.340> sieges<00:03:08.790> in

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
think then some of the other sieges in

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.490 
think then some of the other sieges in
terms<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.180> immediacy<00:03:09.600> but<00:03:10.050> i<00:03:10.080> don't<00:03:10.380> think

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
terms of immediacy but i don't think

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.640 
terms of immediacy but i don't think
that<00:03:10.920> dex<00:03:11.790> running<00:03:12.090> white<00:03:12.270> in<00:03:12.480> these<00:03:12.780> in<00:03:13.050> this
