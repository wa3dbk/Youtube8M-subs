00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 this is the revelation of the challenge of 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.099
 ghost paper if you are born the challenge 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:14.719
 still watch the challenge before 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.719
 regulation ready 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.140
 Good, I said it was for you to do. 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.460
 school that this challenge can do with 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.289
 school supplies then you can 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.359
 solve the challenge 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.399
 using school materials and is well 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.020
 simple and does not need basically 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.440
 a pen or anything from 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.120
 plastic and it is important for me to have a clean 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.309
 your car is dirty the chance to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.590
 hit is smaller but is well able to give 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.100
 sure because it 's easy you wipe 30 in the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.930
 hair and you come close to the paper 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.760
 Look at the subject is going to happen when 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.760
 arrive with the pen near 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.930
 Now that we've seen the magic, we'll understand. 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.840
 Why is not it more than this here? 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.180
 Physics is not magic when the scrub 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.310
 40 in the hair a few electrons in my 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.560
 hair pass through the pen then 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.310
 the pen gets filled with leftover electron 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.750
 We said that the pen has energy. 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.670
 and this energy that it has 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.520
 negative that electrons are negative 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.410
 was loaded with negative charges 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.090
 When I get close to the role that goes 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.450
 these negative charges of the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.270
 pen will remove the negative charges 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.310
 I do not want paper because I do not want 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.210
 stay close to each other but she will 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.060
 attract positive charges paper yes 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.440
 because the opposites attract then 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.540
 exactly this is going to happen 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.280
 it will end up attracting the role as if 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.509
 it was good but you can complain that only 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.819
 you can solve this challenge with a 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.440
 pen then it is not fair if 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.380
 spoken that did not start to solve with 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.540
 a pro pen does not have several materials 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.280
 different you can use you can 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.190
 search the internet for a flame business 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.780
 electric tribe series that shows which 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.720
 materials that when you preach a 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.410
 another one ends up ripping electrons out of the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.410
 other 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.390
 electric grandstand series so I make the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.640
 experience with something else around here 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.959
 my cell phone and I'm going to use this part 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.459
 my phone to try 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.420
 do the same thing will catch on my 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:40.130
 hair and let's see if I can attract 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.130
 paper with the cell phone 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.530
 the op 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.790
 In other words, there are several materials you 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.010
 can use to rub on the hair or 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.740
 rub or rub on several 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.200
 other parts to get started 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.310
 electrons from one of the two and make 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.370
 you type 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.080
 without putting the hand without the winds only 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.670
 using static electricity but 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.640
 challenges you can do at home as 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.000
 this one you can find in the 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.000
 world 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.459
 if you are willing to try several 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.290
 materials to see which one gets better 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.269
 home runs the electrons of the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.609
 other do not forget to give a show 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.409
 my here below the video I go 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.530
 then let two videos have to do with 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.420
 static stagnant energy that the cable 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.659
 electric war is a game you can 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.220
 make using a can of soda 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.439
 two moves and you can bet with your 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.389
 friends who can better attract the 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:59.450
 had and on the other side left a video 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:01.790
 very cool that it's the flying ring that 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.810
 Can make things fly using 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.810
 static electricity
