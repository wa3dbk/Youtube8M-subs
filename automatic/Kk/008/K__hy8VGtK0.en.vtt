hi and welcome back to my channel today
we<00:00:06.000> are<00:00:06.089> going<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.270> show<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.660> engine

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.280 
we are going to show you the engine

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.930 
we are going to show you the engine
dissection<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:11.030> 2002-2005<00:00:12.030> eclipse<00:00:13.940> this

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
dissection of the 2002-2005 eclipse this

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.230 
dissection of the 2002-2005 eclipse this
right<00:00:15.150> here<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.690> fuel<00:00:16.350> injector<00:00:16.680> room<00:00:17.240> as

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
right here is the fuel injector room as

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.070 
right here is the fuel injector room as
you<00:00:18.359> can<00:00:18.480> see<00:00:18.600> there<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> fuel<00:00:19.529> injector

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
you can see there is a fuel injector

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.080 
you can see there is a fuel injector
they<00:00:22.400> got<00:00:23.400> four<00:00:23.580> little<00:00:23.820> nozzle<00:00:25.970> connected<00:00:26.970> to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
they got four little nozzle connected to

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.459 
they got four little nozzle connected to
a<00:00:27.119> fuel<00:00:27.930> row<00:00:28.970> right<00:00:29.970> then

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.529 

here<00:00:34.430> is<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:34.789> lower<00:00:35.269> intake<00:00:35.690> manifold<00:00:37.539> seems

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
here is the lower intake manifold seems

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:39.310 
here is the lower intake manifold seems
a<00:00:38.660> dirty

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
a dirty

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:54.890 
a dirty
I'll<00:00:39.590> need<00:00:40.690> wire<00:00:41.690> brush<00:00:41.930> tags<00:00:42.370> clean<00:00:43.370> of<00:00:43.489> Mecca

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
to the car there instead of tool our air

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.980 
to the car there instead of tool our air
intake<00:01:01.810> manifolds<00:01:02.590> then<00:01:03.089> have<00:01:04.800> to<00:01:05.800> gap<00:01:05.980> get

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
intake manifolds then have to gap get

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.750 
intake manifolds then have to gap get
one<00:01:07.990> of<00:01:08.080> their<00:01:08.200> one<00:01:09.160> right<00:01:09.400> there

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
one of their one right there

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.880 
one of their one right there
don't<00:01:10.660> need<00:01:11.110> to<00:01:11.200> be<00:01:11.320> replaced<00:01:11.620> and<00:01:13.890> there's

right<00:01:25.720> there<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:29.430> engineer<00:01:30.430> pipe

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
right there and the engineer pipe

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.240 
right there and the engineer pipe
yes

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
yes

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.149

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
from inside and outside of the cars

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.460 
from inside and outside of the cars
quite<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> bit<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.370> work<00:01:51.710> get<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:53.010> lower<00:01:53.729> intake

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
quite a bit of work get to lower intake

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.890 
quite a bit of work get to lower intake
upper<00:01:55.470> intake<00:01:55.740> manifold

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.740
