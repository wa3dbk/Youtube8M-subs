00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
your money and that's a bit of a problem

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.709 
your money and that's a bit of a problem
but<00:00:40.770> as<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.129> put<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.730> annotations<00:00:42.149> earlier<00:00:42.690> I

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
but as I put in annotations earlier I

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.970 
but as I put in annotations earlier I
was<00:00:42.960> incorrect<00:00:43.700> if<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.850> run<00:00:45.000> out<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.180> coins

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
was incorrect if you run out of coins

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.200 
was incorrect if you run out of coins
you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.129> actually<00:00:47.340> go<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> casino<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
you can actually go to the casino and

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.529 
you can actually go to the casino and
examine<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.289> slot<00:00:49.770> machines<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.449> one<00:00:51.449> of

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
examine the slot machines and one of

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.540 
examine the slot machines and one of
them<00:00:51.719> will<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.050> spare<00:00:52.590> coins<00:00:52.800> sit<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.340> so

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
them will have spare coins sit in it so

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.959 
them will have spare coins sit in it so
that's<00:00:54.270> good<00:00:54.860> anyways<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.370> way<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.550> end<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that's good anyways the way you end the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.090 
that's good anyways the way you end the
game<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.870> try<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.289> move<00:00:58.559> into<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> police

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100

department if if you have any of the
evidence<00:01:03.739> that<00:01:04.739> they<00:01:04.920> planted<00:01:05.400> against<00:01:05.760> you

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
evidence that they planted against you

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.969 
evidence that they planted against you
you<00:01:06.659> will<00:01:06.840> get<00:01:06.960> arrested<00:01:07.140> instead<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.799> them

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
it's kind of but that's just

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.410 
it's kind of but that's just
how<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.700> game<00:01:12.060> works<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:14.060> anyways<00:01:15.060> since

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
how the game works and the anyways since

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.469

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
all we have is evidence against them and

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.219 
all we have is evidence against them and
being<00:01:19.049> true<00:01:20.330> defenders<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.450> justice<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.200> the

being true defenders of justice and the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.520 
being true defenders of justice and the
code<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.950> law<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:24.000> decided<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.479> dispose<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.200> all

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
code of law we decided to dispose of all

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.370 
code of law we decided to dispose of all
evidence<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.159> put<00:01:26.340> us<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.090> bad<00:01:27.240> light

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
evidence that put us in a in a bad light

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.280
