00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:09.707
 Skoda Yiti is a compact and quite successful recreational vehicle. 

00:00:09.707 --> 00:00:14.577
 Recently, it is surrounded by new competitors, such as the Chevrolet Trax, Peugeot 2008 

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:17.297
 And Suzuki Crossover. The facelift he underwent, 

00:00:17.297 --> 00:00:20.187
 Is supposed to help him cope with market competition. 

00:00:23.197 --> 00:00:28.087
 The exterior design, playing it tough. And the facelift made him more square. 

00:00:28.087 --> 00:00:32.367
 The bumpers and the roof, give the looks of a serious SUV. 

00:00:33.727 --> 00:00:37.787
 The passenger compartment is simply decorated. With dark colors and fairly conservative lines. 

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:42.107
 The sitting position here is excellent, even when the chair is in the lowest position, 

00:00:42.107 --> 00:00:44.537
 You can see the front end of the vehicle. 

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:47.597
 In addition, the two front seats are adjustable to height. 

00:00:47.597 --> 00:00:53.757
 In the vicinity of the driver, there are quite a few storage cells, and you will find a place here for anything you want to take to the sea. 

00:00:56.897 --> 00:00:59.747
 After the facelift, Hitti comes with quite a few accessories. 

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:05.177
 In the basic Embition version, you will find 7 airbags, tire pressure sensors, 

00:01:05.177 --> 00:01:10.987
 Climate control, a multimedia screen that includes an audio system with steering wheel control and a Bluetooth headset, 

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:16.917
 Connect Aux and Changer to six discs. In fact, we would replace it with a USB connection. 

00:01:17.047 --> 00:01:18.197
 More useful. 

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:22.077
 Outside, there are fog lights and light hoops. 

00:01:22.077 --> 00:01:27.367
 In the version of the Elegance, you will find two additional airbags and a total of 9 airbags 

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:32.337
 And there is also cruise control, panoramic sunroof, slightly larger hoops, 

00:01:32.337 --> 00:01:36.557
 And the SS, automatic parking system, pay attention to how it works. 

00:01:56.797 --> 00:01:59.847
 Hatty's doors are very large, and the seats are high, 

00:01:59.847 --> 00:02:02.837
 So it was easy to get into the car and bring in the children. 

00:02:02.837 --> 00:02:06.157
 The two extreme seats are individually adjustable. 

00:02:06.937 --> 00:02:13.017
 The spacing for both legs and back, excellent. For a third passenger, it would be a bit hard to get in here, 

00:02:13.017 --> 00:02:17.777
 Because the middle seat is small, and there is a high-speed channel on the floor that will disturb his legs. 

00:02:17.777 --> 00:02:22.307
 Although the volume of the trunk, is not very large, 321 liters total, 

00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:27.587
 It is very useful, because of the square structure and because of all the hooks and handles that are here. 

00:02:27.587 --> 00:02:30.247
 In addition, there is even a removable flashlight. 

00:02:33.017 --> 00:02:37.437
 As you travel through the city, Hitti's high sitting position provides an excellent field of vision. 

00:02:37.437 --> 00:02:44.027
 The field of hindsight is also remarkable. On the other hand, the gearbox is a bit hesitant and stuttering, 

00:02:44.027 --> 00:02:46.817
 So it makes the city trip at least smooth. 

00:02:46.817 --> 00:02:51.707
 Small jeeps, like Hitti, tend to be uncomfortable in the city. 

00:02:51.707 --> 00:02:56.657
 Heaty is better than most of his competitors in this aspect, and he absorbs most of the disruptions. 

00:02:56.657 --> 00:03:01.497
 On the other hand, there are many family cars, which offer better comfort. 

00:03:04.287 --> 00:03:09.137
 Out of town, travel comfort is improving. Vitti feels solid and almost does not rock. 

00:03:09.897 --> 00:03:15.227
 Isolating the noises, much less successful. Already at a hundred miles per hour, you hear a lot of wind noise 

00:03:15.577 --> 00:03:20.767
 And on poor asphalt, what you can find in Israel, you hear a lot of road noise. 

00:03:20.957 --> 00:03:22.727
 It was the engine, very quiet. 

00:03:23.137 --> 00:03:27.937
 And if it's already powered, you can get it with three engines, all gasoline engines, 

00:03:27.937 --> 00:03:30.557
 With turbochargers. The small, 

00:03:30.557 --> 00:03:34.297
 It is a 1200 cc engine with a capacity of 105 hp. 

00:03:34.387 --> 00:03:39.707
 It may not sound much, but the car feels very quick and once the turbo enters, 

00:03:39.707 --> 00:03:41.587
 The acceleration is very fast. 

00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:45.277
 Anyone who wants a little more than that can take the second engine, 

00:03:45.277 --> 00:03:48.417
 With a capacity of 1400 cc, with 122 hp. 

00:03:49.247 --> 00:03:55.317
 And above it, there is the large engine, the volume of 1800 cc, with a capacity of 153 hp, 

00:03:55.717 --> 00:03:57.267
 And it also comes with 4x4. 

00:04:01.187 --> 00:04:04.557
 The gearbox we have here is a double-clutch robot, 

00:04:04.557 --> 00:04:09.147
 You might know, as a DSG. This box, with 7 gears, 

00:04:09.147 --> 00:04:12.187
 Taking good advantage of the power of the engine, quickly replacing gears, 

00:04:12.187 --> 00:04:15.187
 And only inside the city, is a bit slow and a little stammer. 

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:18.787
 The small engine can also be taken with a manual transmission. 

00:04:19.487 --> 00:04:22.327
 The manufacturer's data assure us a very good fuel consumption. 

00:04:23.087 --> 00:04:27.257
 But as is often the case with turbo engines, in practice, the data are less good. 

00:04:27.257 --> 00:04:31.497
 We, with the small engine, measured about 10 kilometers per liter. 

00:04:32.487 --> 00:04:35.207
 Hatty's road behavior is good overall. 

00:04:35.207 --> 00:04:39.337
 The high road grip, the steering wheel is accurate, even if it is not communicating, 

00:04:40.217 --> 00:04:42.707
 And despite the height, Hitty does not feel clumsy. 

00:04:43.797 --> 00:04:47.777
 Despite the combat look, Skoda Yti is not a real SUV. 

00:04:47.777 --> 00:04:51.177
 And precisely because of this, we were surprised to find that it is quite comfortable on trails, 

00:04:51.177 --> 00:04:53.147
 And he gets on well with ignorance. 

00:04:53.707 --> 00:04:59.047
 Anyone who wants a little more will be able to take the 4x4 version, which shows better fouls, 

00:04:59.047 --> 00:05:00.517
 Like most of the small jeeps. 

00:05:01.937 --> 00:05:05.157
 So at the end of the day, a facelift did not change the conclusions. 

00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:09.157
 Skoda Yeti, he's an excellent iPhone. Is spacious, is comfortable, 

00:05:09.157 --> 00:05:13.537
 It is agile, and is very useful. It can also compete easily with jeeps, 

00:05:13.537 --> 00:05:15.827
 And even, in family cars. 

00:05:16.997 --> 00:05:19.487
