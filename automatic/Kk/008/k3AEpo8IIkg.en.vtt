00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.699
 it's delicious 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.800
 we started our recipe action of the 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.960
 base we will place in the processor 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.980
 food 300 grams of these cookies 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.570
 super-well-known, I take away half 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.400
 of the cookies the creampie and it leaves you 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.050
 side also to criticism because to me 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.149
 I do not like it very much 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.550
 now I'm going to place 50 grams of 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.040
 member and 2 tablespoons coconut 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.050
 let's grind this very very well up 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.760
 that the almonds are no longer visible in the 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.620
 mix then we will place 100 grams 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.199
 of butter melted butter without 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.530
 salt and let's mix so that it 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.259
 integrate well and now we are going to extend the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.310
 mix in a mold that I 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.470
 previously covered with cocoa 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.060
 and I'm using a tall mold but you 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.220
 you can use the one you want if you have 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.930
 a removable mold then very much 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.659
 better me because I do not have molds 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.630
 moldable small then what I'm 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.670
 doing is covering well all the background 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.000
 I use a little glass so that it stays with me 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.640
 and now I'm going to start going up the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.549
 edges of the cake I 'm putting it 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.759
 a little bit of cocoa at the base of the cup 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.149
 so that I can do well with the scab and 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.640
 pressures do not hit me from the glass now 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:49.350
 is that it seems good to you well 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.920
 refrigerate for a while so that the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.080
 things are harder 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.900
 Meanwhile, I'm going to make the filling 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.760
 I'm going to add the cheeses in the blender 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.860

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.160
 next and do this I'm going to add 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.070
 the red coloring all a spoonful of 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.860
 red dye can incorporate the 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.260
 eggs 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.230
 went to land and in this so that everything 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.940
 mix ras suffer when the sides of the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.100
 bowl so that if everything is incorporated bile 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.010
 now added 50 grams of chocolate 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:30.050
 melted I'm visiting chocolate 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.760
 bitter so 80 percent is like a 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.520
 70 percent so it's fine 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:43.790
 loving now I'm going to place on my base 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:46.280
 all the stuffing I'm going to take out the air and 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.550
 I'm going to bake it at 160 degrees 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.130
 for 45 minutes to an hour or until 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.310
 I'm going to refrigerate it then 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.730
 for 12 hours so that I stay well 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.730

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.019

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.019
 little bit of cocoa 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.880
