00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
tracks feel mechanical calculated but

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.860 
tracks feel mechanical calculated but
both<00:04:01.459> of<00:04:01.639> these<00:04:01.729> songs<00:04:02.000> are<00:04:02.209> still<00:04:02.510> incredibly

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
both of these songs are still incredibly

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.670

I<00:04:06.829> signal<00:04:07.400> with<00:04:07.849> its<00:04:08.180> constant<00:04:08.959> beat<00:04:09.379> change

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
I signal with its constant beat change

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.189 
I signal with its constant beat change
ups<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.220> it's<00:04:10.340> bass<00:04:10.609> line<00:04:10.940> which<00:04:11.239> I<00:04:11.479> cannot

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
ups and it's bass line which I cannot

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:14.860 
ups and it's bass line which I cannot
even<00:04:12.500> explain<00:04:13.280> I<00:04:13.639> mean<00:04:13.790> not<00:04:14.030> melodically

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
even explain I mean not melodically

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.960 
even explain I mean not melodically
melodically<00:04:15.739> it's<00:04:15.949> actually<00:04:16.370> pretty<00:04:16.549> simple

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
melodically it's actually pretty simple

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.800 
melodically it's actually pretty simple
but<00:04:17.090> what<00:04:17.299> he<00:04:17.479> does<00:04:17.780> with<00:04:18.019> it<00:04:18.130> texturally<00:04:19.810> it

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
but what he does with it texturally it

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.420 
but what he does with it texturally it
feels<00:04:20.989> like<00:04:21.169> he<00:04:21.320> wrote<00:04:21.500> this<00:04:21.680> really<00:04:21.949> smooth

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
feels like he wrote this really smooth

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.940 
feels like he wrote this really smooth
bouncy<00:04:23.330> bass<00:04:23.659> line<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:24.289> he's<00:04:24.620> just<00:04:24.800> like

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
bouncy bass line and he's just like

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.590 
bouncy bass line and he's just like
choking<00:04:25.849> it<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.060> shaking

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
choking it and shaking

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.720 
choking it and shaking
just<00:04:26.950> there<00:04:27.950> are<00:04:28.070> moments<00:04:28.370> where<00:04:28.490> it's<00:04:28.610> really

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
just there are moments where it's really

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.420 
just there are moments where it's really
deep<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:29.360> resonant<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.260> thick<00:04:30.890> and<00:04:31.130> then

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
deep and resonant and thick and then

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.470 
deep and resonant and thick and then
there<00:04:31.580> are<00:04:31.610> other<00:04:31.790> spots<00:04:32.090> where<00:04:32.240> it<00:04:32.330> feels

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
there are other spots where it feels

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.230 
there are other spots where it feels
like<00:04:32.600> he's<00:04:32.780> just<00:04:33.070> crushing<00:04:34.070> in<00:04:34.220> squeezing<00:04:34.970> it

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
like he's just crushing in squeezing it

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.940 
like he's just crushing in squeezing it
to<00:04:35.330> get<00:04:35.450> these<00:04:35.570> very<00:04:35.750> strange<00:04:36.290> melodic

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
to get these very strange melodic

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.670 
to get these very strange melodic
undertones<00:04:37.640> and<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.240> song<00:04:38.450> Collider<00:04:38.870> takes<00:04:39.410> a

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
undertones and the song Collider takes a

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.170 
undertones and the song Collider takes a
little<00:04:40.010> bit<00:04:40.160> of<00:04:40.250> a<00:04:40.310> different<00:04:40.640> approach<00:04:40.730> with

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
little bit of a different approach with

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.330 
little bit of a different approach with
its<00:04:41.420> beat<00:04:41.720> it's<00:04:41.960> not<00:04:42.170> always<00:04:42.470> changing<00:04:43.220> up

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
its beat it's not always changing up

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.910 
its beat it's not always changing up
it's<00:04:43.490> actually<00:04:43.820> pretty<00:04:44.030> hypnotic<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:44.920> very

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
it's actually pretty hypnotic and very

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.910 
it's actually pretty hypnotic and very
very<00:04:46.370> repetitive<00:04:47.030> but<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:48.080> sounds<00:04:48.590> that<00:04:48.710> John

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
very repetitive but the sounds that John

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.520 
very repetitive but the sounds that John
arranges<00:04:49.880> around<00:04:50.270> this<00:04:50.450> track<00:04:50.870> especially

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
arranges around this track especially

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.160 
arranges around this track especially
the<00:04:51.920> really<00:04:52.130> atmospheric<00:04:52.760> sense<00:04:53.030> it's<00:04:53.750> almost

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
the really atmospheric sense it's almost

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.100 
the really atmospheric sense it's almost
deafening<00:04:54.890> how<00:04:55.040> thick<00:04:55.640> this<00:04:56.030> track<00:04:56.420> gets<00:04:56.750> the

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
deafening how thick this track gets the

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.480 
deafening how thick this track gets the
more<00:04:57.260> piano-driven<00:04:57.770> pieces<00:04:58.580> are<00:04:58.850> beautiful

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
more piano-driven pieces are beautiful

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.810 
more piano-driven pieces are beautiful
beauty-full

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
beauty-full

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.600 
beauty-full
and<00:05:02.150> had<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.960> fantastic<00:05:03.400> counterpoint<00:05:04.400> to<00:05:04.460> the

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
and had a fantastic counterpoint to the

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.520 
and had a fantastic counterpoint to the
more<00:05:04.790> electronic<00:05:05.330> tracks<00:05:05.600> on<00:05:05.840> this<00:05:06.020> LP<00:05:06.350> I

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
more electronic tracks on this LP I

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.200 
more electronic tracks on this LP I
think<00:05:06.800> the<00:05:06.890> only<00:05:07.190> song<00:05:07.460> that<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:07.670> didn't<00:05:08.060> really

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
think the only song that I didn't really

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.390 
think the only song that I didn't really
care<00:05:08.570> for<00:05:08.630> was<00:05:09.200> the<00:05:09.440> track<00:05:09.830> formed<00:05:10.310> by

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
care for was the track formed by

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.720 
care for was the track formed by
firelight<00:05:10.700> with<00:05:11.210> this<00:05:11.480> really<00:05:12.320> slow<00:05:12.830> kind<00:05:13.580> of

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
firelight with this really slow kind of

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.540 
firelight with this really slow kind of
distorted<00:05:14.500> shuffling<00:05:15.500> beat<00:05:15.770> that<00:05:16.100> didn't

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
distorted shuffling beat that didn't

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.940 
distorted shuffling beat that didn't
really<00:05:17.030> appeal<00:05:17.630> to<00:05:17.690> me<00:05:17.960> all<00:05:18.080> that<00:05:18.110> much<00:05:18.440> a<00:05:18.740> lot

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
really appeal to me all that much a lot

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.830 
really appeal to me all that much a lot
of<00:05:19.070> John's<00:05:19.310> piano<00:05:19.700> playing<00:05:20.060> around<00:05:20.360> this<00:05:20.540> beat

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
of John's piano playing around this beat

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.530 
of John's piano playing around this beat
is<00:05:21.080> is<00:05:21.380> very<00:05:21.650> pretty<00:05:22.040> as<00:05:22.280> it<00:05:22.850> is<00:05:22.970> on<00:05:23.120> previous

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
is is very pretty as it is on previous

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.110 
is is very pretty as it is on previous
tracks<00:05:23.900> but<00:05:24.620> with<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:24.920> relief<00:05:25.250> arty-farty

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
tracks but with the relief arty-farty

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.600 
tracks but with the relief arty-farty
bass<00:05:26.600> line<00:05:26.900> on<00:05:27.200> this<00:05:27.830> thing<00:05:28.130> that<00:05:28.160> just<00:05:28.430> felt

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
bass line on this thing that just felt

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.300 
bass line on this thing that just felt
really<00:05:28.850> flat<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.360> just<00:05:29.780> kind<00:05:30.200> of<00:05:30.310> bodyless

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
really flat and just kind of bodyless

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.220 
really flat and just kind of bodyless
there<00:05:32.180> were<00:05:32.270> a<00:05:32.300> lot<00:05:32.480> of<00:05:32.510> reasons<00:05:32.960> I<00:05:33.050> just

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
there were a lot of reasons I just

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.750 
there were a lot of reasons I just
wasn't<00:05:33.530> digging<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.830> sounds<00:05:34.250> on<00:05:34.370> this<00:05:34.550> thing

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
wasn't digging the sounds on this thing

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.820 
wasn't digging the sounds on this thing
because<00:05:35.150> of<00:05:35.270> that<00:05:35.390> track<00:05:35.750> and<00:05:35.780> and<00:05:36.380> the<00:05:36.530> closer

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
because of that track and and the closer

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.340 
because of that track and and the closer
like<00:05:37.160> I<00:05:37.340> said<00:05:37.640> whose<00:05:38.330> sound<00:05:38.600> really<00:05:39.020> kind<00:05:39.260> of

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
like I said whose sound really kind of

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.830 
like I said whose sound really kind of
comes<00:05:39.710> out<00:05:39.830> of<00:05:39.980> nowhere<00:05:40.190> for<00:05:40.550> me<00:05:40.610> this<00:05:41.300> LP<00:05:41.600> does

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
comes out of nowhere for me this LP does

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.350 
comes out of nowhere for me this LP does
fall<00:05:42.110> apart<00:05:42.380> a<00:05:42.500> little<00:05:42.530> bit<00:05:42.830> at<00:05:43.040> the<00:05:43.220> end<00:05:43.370> but<00:05:44.090> a

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
fall apart a little bit at the end but a

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.630 
fall apart a little bit at the end but a
majority<00:05:45.110> of<00:05:45.140> this<00:05:45.350> album<00:05:45.590> I'm<00:05:46.130> telling<00:05:46.550> you

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
majority of this album I'm telling you

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.540
