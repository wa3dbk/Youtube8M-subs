00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.490
 the chocolate the chocolate but the sun 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.590
 that already comes in fill 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.109
 of the place 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:26.689
 of the two states 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:31.559
 the bits that we have here and that 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:34.530
 we are going to come in bathroom mary together and 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.870
 following you're putting the bathroom is 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.379
 that we already have boiling water 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.379
 We are going to learn 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.220
 important 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.220
 the sofa 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.620
 I think for you 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.690
 and it's kind of like apples are 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.690
 as very fashionable there are not like enchiladas 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.690
 why 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.990
 and it may be a good idea to 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.010
 your parties in a good idea for what 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.410
 maybe so so 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.410
 but they can also take it from them 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.619
 Well yes, good to take 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.619
 poor dear 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.729
 and well let's have 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.640
 or there are other saints 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.640
 the hotel is not 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.670
 and we are going to 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.640
 the tip we are going to join with a little 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.070
 of lemon 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.420
 for 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.420
 this is so that the apple 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.640
 where is the Apple 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.670
 to fit in 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.660
 very good 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.979
 would be washed disinfected 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.290
 and well let's have it is not chopped 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.020
 peanuts ice cream and chopped 2 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.930
 that they do not like then 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.350
 Both granola cereals 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:50.080
 the chocolate does not 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.080
 well now we're going to but we can also 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.590
 for this from below because if 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:08.590
 we put from here up we have the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.590
 Apple 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.890
 sprinkle quickly 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.320
 lp I do it on a container so that 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.320
 what falls is easy 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.640
 and more with more speed 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.640
 We can decorate with all kinds of 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.640
 Colorful stripes 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:04.460
