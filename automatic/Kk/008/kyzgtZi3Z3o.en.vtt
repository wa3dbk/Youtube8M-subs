making<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.150> lot<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.329> doors<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.549> we'll<00:01:41.549> be

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
making a lot of doors and we'll be

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.380 
making a lot of doors and we'll be
putting<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.350> right<00:01:43.560> now<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:45.090> I

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
putting this one up right now and I

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.560 
putting this one up right now and I
don't<00:01:45.420> know<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.780> want<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.049> make<00:01:46.140> another<00:01:46.439> one

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
don't know if I want to make another one

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.660 
don't know if I want to make another one
I<00:01:47.630> might<00:01:48.409> as<00:01:48.500> well<00:01:48.530> I've<00:01:48.980> got<00:01:49.010> the<00:01:49.280> recovery

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
I might as well I've got the recovery

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.630 
I might as well I've got the recovery
aids<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:50.000> know<00:01:50.500> mix<00:01:53.320> with<00:01:54.320> recovery<00:01:54.740> a<00:01:54.770> and

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
aids you know mix with recovery a and

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.300 
aids you know mix with recovery a and
now<00:01:56.240> we've<00:01:56.390> got<00:01:56.570> more<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:56.900> these<00:01:57.050> great<00:01:57.680> i<00:01:58.010> love

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
now we've got more of these great i love

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.780 
now we've got more of these great i love
those<00:01:59.890> resuscitations<00:02:00.890> might<00:02:01.100> be<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.520> best

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
those resuscitations might be the best

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.420 
those resuscitations might be the best
healing<00:02:02.060> item<00:02:02.420> in<00:02:02.570> terms<00:02:02.780> of<00:02:02.869> effect<00:02:03.229> but<00:02:03.590> we

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
healing item in terms of effect but we

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.250 
healing item in terms of effect but we
won't<00:02:04.610> be<00:02:04.670> using<00:02:04.729> them<00:02:05.030> very<00:02:05.300> much<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.780> when

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
won't be using them very much and when

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.600 
won't be using them very much and when
we<00:02:06.380> do<00:02:06.500> use<00:02:06.710> them<00:02:06.890> will<00:02:07.040> be<00:02:07.130> mixing<00:02:07.400> them<00:02:07.580> with

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
we do use them will be mixing them with

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.699 
we do use them will be mixing them with
other<00:02:07.820> things<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.330> make<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.750> best<00:02:09.110> ammunition

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
other things to make the best ammunition

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.580 
other things to make the best ammunition
in<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.920> game<00:02:10.150> yes<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.390> give<00:02:11.570> me<00:02:11.810> use<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.440> best

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
in the game yes you give me use the best

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.870 
in the game yes you give me use the best
healing<00:02:12.830> item<00:02:13.160> in<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.340> game<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.640> make<00:02:13.730> the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
healing item in the game to make the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.550 
healing item in the game to make the
best<00:02:14.000> ammunition<00:02:14.660> that<00:02:14.990> makes<00:02:15.170> sense<00:02:15.380> right

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
best ammunition that makes sense right

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.290 
best ammunition that makes sense right
oh<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:16.400> should<00:02:16.610> probably<00:02:16.700> be<00:02:16.940> carrying<00:02:17.180> some

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
oh I should probably be carrying some

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.610 
oh I should probably be carrying some
ammo<00:02:17.600> yeah<00:02:17.870> that'd<00:02:18.080> be<00:02:18.170> helpful<00:02:20.470> what<00:02:21.470> else

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
ammo yeah that'd be helpful what else

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.160 
ammo yeah that'd be helpful what else
needs<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.890> be<00:02:21.950> done<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:22.580> suppose<00:02:23.540> that's<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.959> I

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
needs to be done I suppose that's it I

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.400 
needs to be done I suppose that's it I
used<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.160> know<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.120> mixing<00:02:26.450> system<00:02:26.630> very<00:02:27.140> well

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
used to know the mixing system very well

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.870 
used to know the mixing system very well
but<00:02:27.620> now<00:02:27.800> I've<00:02:27.890> kind<00:02:28.070> of<00:02:28.130> forgotten<00:02:28.250> there's

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
but now I've kind of forgotten there's

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.510 
but now I've kind of forgotten there's
nothing<00:02:29.030> there<00:02:31.150> let's<00:02:32.150> go<00:02:32.360> see<00:02:32.570> Rick<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:34.430> the

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
nothing there let's go see Rick so the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.740 
nothing there let's go see Rick so the
he<00:02:34.640> can<00:02:34.790> be<00:02:34.850> like<00:02:34.910> oh<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.239> didn't<00:02:35.600> see<00:02:35.720> a

he can be like oh you didn't see a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:46.000 
he can be like oh you didn't see a
dinosaur<00:02:43.360> what's<00:02:44.360> up<00:02:44.480> her<00:02:44.570> status<00:02:45.080> this<00:02:45.620> bad

dinosaur what's up her status this bad
this<00:02:46.730> security<00:02:47.269> system<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:47.989> snap<00:02:48.410> for<00:02:48.830> me

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
this security system is a snap for me

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.940 
this security system is a snap for me
real<00:02:49.580> amateur<00:02:49.850> stuff<00:02:50.540> nice<00:02:51.350> audio<00:02:51.709> slowed

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
real amateur stuff nice audio slowed

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.190 
real amateur stuff nice audio slowed
down<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:53.060> what<00:02:53.690> exactly<00:02:54.220> happened<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.370> give<00:02:56.200> he

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
down so what exactly happened to give he

was attacked by a dinosaur yeah I

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.210 
was attacked by a dinosaur yeah I
couldn't<00:03:01.940> believe<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.799> just<00:03:03.799> hope<00:03:03.980> he's

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
couldn't believe it I just hope he's

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.940 
couldn't believe it I just hope he's
still<00:03:04.370> alive<00:03:04.549> and<00:03:05.500> anyway<00:03:06.500> our<00:03:06.620> first

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
still alive and anyway our first

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.259 
still alive and anyway our first
priority<00:03:07.220> is<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.760> complete<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.450> mission<00:03:08.840> what

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
priority is to complete the mission what

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.479 
priority is to complete the mission what
what<00:03:11.269> we<00:03:11.390> ought<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.630> do<00:03:12.170> is<00:03:12.500> just<00:03:12.560> calling<00:03:13.340> the

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
what we ought to do is just calling the

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.000 
what we ought to do is just calling the
chopper<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.120> get<00:03:14.420> off<00:03:14.780> this<00:03:15.140> damn<00:03:15.200> track<00:03:15.799> but

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
chopper and get off this damn track but

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.069 
chopper and get off this damn track but
Cooper's<00:03:16.459> dead<00:03:16.700> that's<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.150> great<00:03:17.299> idea<00:03:17.540> but

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
Cooper's dead that's a great idea but

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:25.680 
Cooper's dead that's a great idea but
Cooper<00:03:18.440> has<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.739> radio<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:19.370> he's<00:03:19.790> missing

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.160 

hey<00:03:26.320> what's<00:03:26.650> with<00:03:26.890> this<00:03:26.920> monitor<00:03:27.520> that<00:03:28.480> that's

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
hey what's with this monitor that that's

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.560 
hey what's with this monitor that that's
the<00:03:29.410> security<00:03:30.070> monitor<00:03:30.610> for<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.880> under<00:03:31.300> audio

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
the security monitor for the under audio

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.410 
the security monitor for the under audio
slow<00:03:32.530> loss<00:03:33.070> of<00:03:33.520> life<00:03:35.820> so<00:03:36.820> I<00:03:36.850> take<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.180> that

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
slow loss of life so I take it that

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.720 
slow loss of life so I take it that
means<00:03:37.480> power<00:03:38.110> still<00:03:38.680> hasn't<00:03:39.070> been<00:03:39.160> restored

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
means power still hasn't been restored

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.200 
means power still hasn't been restored
to<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.060> area<00:03:40.360> it's<00:03:40.960> exactly<00:03:41.760> they<00:03:42.760> must<00:03:43.030> have

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
to the area it's exactly they must have

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.570 
to the area it's exactly they must have
that<00:03:43.420> area<00:03:43.870> wire<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.590> a<00:03:44.620> different<00:03:45.310> power

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
that area wire to a different power

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.880 
that area wire to a different power
system<00:03:46.300> than<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.480> ground<00:03:46.840> level<00:03:47.110> just<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.770> be

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
system than the ground level just to be

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.710 
system than the ground level just to be
inconvenient<00:03:48.580> you<00:03:48.640> can<00:03:48.820> investigate<00:03:49.480> that

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
inconvenient you can investigate that

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.530 
inconvenient you can investigate that
area<00:03:50.130> after<00:03:51.130> we<00:03:51.310> finished<00:03:51.670> our<00:03:51.820> sweep<00:03:52.030> of<00:03:52.360> the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540

area after we finished our sweep of the
ground<00:03:52.870> level<00:03:53.850> ok<00:03:54.850> then<00:03:55.570> I'll<00:03:55.870> take<00:03:56.200> care<00:03:56.440> of

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
ground level ok then I'll take care of

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.400 
ground level ok then I'll take care of
the<00:03:56.650> shutters<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.190> are<00:03:57.340> blocking<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:57.820> way

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
the shutters that are blocking the way
