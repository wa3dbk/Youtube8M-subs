00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi youtube today i'm going to you 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.140
 present our tutorial videos of 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.960
 plates m we say bad but not seen well 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.809
 long to resume the play and I 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.790
 will try to make them take enough 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.960
 fast but because the red sea to 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.240
 left hand and there it is simple we will 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:27.920
 to play I do not know by heart but 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:27.920
 now I know that weird so it's 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.890
 23 starts so I make you 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.890
 hand too c 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.570
 m 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.530
 and that's ok 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.869
 it 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.869
 all that 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.909
 then we come back 6 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.909
 so how's that 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.090
 same agreement then deputy is closing the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.550
 song is yes 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.620
 before you my number led that 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.900
 looks difficult but it's too much 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.540
 agreement had just seen in these same 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.619
 through all the songs all the 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.640
 song I like music but they go 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.070
 same time it's easier for us 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.550
 to play any good 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.940
 I have a veyron vervins version to me 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.940
 that's it 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.909
 1 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.840
 Here it continues like this basically is 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.840
 camped played the first set to end 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.800
 okay but that 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.790
 for the shenanigans that's it and I'm 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.470
 focused on the right hand 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.120
 the right hand that is well interim like 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:52.510
 have scored without help but it looks like 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:55.409
 it's important this week 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.409
 give the lead 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.490
 no 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.490
 my 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.220
 m 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.730
 so I just agree so 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.730
 senna 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.920
 Oh 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.990
 1 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.290
 and if you ever do not have your fingers 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:04:01.379
 next why that also this finally a 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.379
 different time field medoc 6 1 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.220
 that's the first part I 'm going 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.070
 continue to listen to them the trouble of 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.190
 listen to it what is it once and go 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.960
 fast if the notes are readable or not 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.440
 I made sure that there is a zone 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.640
 sure but its but on what I play and 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.940
 ben me I have a technique hulten 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.590
 universal that of procap alas the 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.080
 tutorial died too playing the notes 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.680
 these works we all go through that I'm 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.590
 gone through there 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.230
 you will go through the ap so these ways the 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.880
 common you have to suffer for for 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.870
 learn to tangier then play there 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:58.550
 and if you want a d1 parties go 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:01.270
 who actually saw stupidly 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.140
 I hope you have 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.350
 you to the rails in a way or a 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.500
 other and to a next video 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.500
