just charge your equipment to pieces not
to<00:01:20.040> mention<00:01:20.250> their<00:01:20.580> teeth<00:01:20.790> out<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.090> your<00:01:21.210> head

when you try to bush or ammo over it we

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.640 
when you try to bush or ammo over it we
probably<00:01:26.910> put<00:01:27.120> a<00:01:27.180> food<00:01:27.840> plot<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.560> they

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
probably put a food plot in and they

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.190 
probably put a food plot in and they
destroy<00:01:29.040> those<00:01:29.330> you<00:01:30.330> can<00:01:30.480> plant<00:01:30.720> wheat<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
destroy those you can plant wheat and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.570 
destroy those you can plant wheat and
they'll<00:01:31.920> dig<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> all<00:01:32.340> up<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.350> disc<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
they'll dig it all up and disc it up to

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.720 
they'll dig it all up and disc it up to
ace<00:01:35.760> three<00:01:36.240> days<00:01:36.390> later<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.460> it's<00:01:38.460> pretty

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
ace three days later and it's pretty

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.990 
ace three days later and it's pretty
hard<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.990> get<00:01:40.140> something<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.980> grow<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.880> you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
hard to get something to grow that you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.660 
hard to get something to grow that you
really<00:01:42.270> want<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.870> guess<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.620> any<00:01:44.280> kind<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.580> a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
really want I guess if you any kind of a

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.260 
really want I guess if you any kind of a
crop<00:01:45.800> well<00:01:46.800> the<00:01:47.010> corn<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.670> really<00:01:47.970> had<00:01:48.120> trouble

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
crop well the corn we really had trouble

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.330 
crop well the corn we really had trouble
with<00:01:48.540> because<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.930> had<00:01:49.050> 18<00:01:49.380> acres<00:01:49.650> of<00:01:49.770> corn<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
with because I had 18 acres of corn and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.710 
with because I had 18 acres of corn and
we<00:01:50.760> figured<00:01:51.120> they<00:01:51.300> ate<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:52.070> probably<00:01:53.210> 14<00:01:54.210> or<00:01:54.360> 15

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720

rows all the way around which really

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.350 
rows all the way around which really
significant<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.890> there<00:01:59.070> was<00:01:59.160> no<00:01:59.430> corn<00:01:59.760> but

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
significant like there was no corn but

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.660 
significant like there was no corn but
the<00:02:00.390> outside<00:02:00.690> rows<00:02:01.290> were<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.980> like<00:02:02.280> totally

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the outside rows were just like totally

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.560 
the outside rows were just like totally
