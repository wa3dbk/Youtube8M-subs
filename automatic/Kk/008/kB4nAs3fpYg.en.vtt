00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.880
 hello everyone here amazing avengers 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.620
 the trunk era finally comes out into the open 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.049
 and I know that many of us 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.509
 was expecting a lot a lot from 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.670
 this film was my case and I was 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.410
 partially above it not frankly the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.220
 movie well but this time it is 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.990
 different from the first 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.269
 that may be the general problem 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.590
 reminds lomu of the first film he does 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.880
 do not tell a difficult story and 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.380
 complex it was the story of 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.880
 the dead assembly of superheroes who 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.830
 until then had all had one or 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.300
 several solo films the directors 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.040
 had a problem blick and to solve 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.809
 to make a blockbuster with 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.760
 cult characters who each have a 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.379
 broad universe a low country which he had 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.020
 make sure that no superheroes 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.579
 whether it's iron man or black widow the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.649
 take on too much importance in my opinion 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.120
 they managed any of the heroes of any 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.629
 very serious sense which character 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.840
 main 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.730
 the first movie is a mechanism 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.740
 do not use rage comes as a 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.130
 tight and total team where I come plays 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.840
 his role 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.220
 this scene we see the team getting 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.910
 gather to prepare for 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.440
 the clash 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.970
 it's etched in everyone's memory 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.770
 forever everything is not perfect 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.489
 but it was not to start but to 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.440
 what we are talking about 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.210
 the agencies of here we are so back 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.890
 in a new adventure with the team 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.570
 super hero par excellence the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.280
 avengers guide since their first in 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.600
 against know each other well and it centers 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.700
 and black widow hawkeye 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.110
 hulk iron man team american states 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.150
 face a new threat 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.740
 have artificial intelligence 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.259
 created by tony stark and bruce banner 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.520
 Art ultra movie you were supposed to 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.649
 protect the earth against any threat 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.030
 indoor or outdoor but as 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.740
 a lot of girls to invent in the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.720
 science fiction before he sees a 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.910
 threatens humanity itself and decides 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.590
 so to exterminate him hudon himself considers himself 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.330
 himself as a human being but on 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.220
 a new scale of evolution as 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.229
 I already said in the movie his father 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.970
 and tony stark and we do not often notice 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.509
 in his behavior that he inherited from 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.160
 its creator 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.770
 whether in his little crises of 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.690
 angry or ironic black but the gym 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.310
 has a serious problem that does not 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.170
 give no opportunity to take the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.729
 total pleasure watching this feature 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.530
 but we'll talk about it later 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.119
 first I'll talk about the points 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.289
 positive the film the first two 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.630
 points are of course the action and 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.950
 humor the strong of marvel the passage of 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.539
 the evening featuring the heroes 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.369
 in their attempt to get up the better 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.110
 coming was particularly good all 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.890
 a year later he has succeeded in addition to our 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.330
 favorite passages 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.520
 make three new signings 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.140
 repair to get their johnson back into 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.640
 the quiksilver role that did not me 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.980
 as much as x-men's 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.900
 future past elizabeth hudson in the role 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.000
 of red witch and paul bettany in 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.110
 the vision role the child dutronc in 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.120
 the action scenes I think we are 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.860
 all agree fighting hulk opponent and 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.170
 gloucester hugues is gorgeous that's 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.099
 just giant this is the moment for which 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.099
 you have to go see the movie 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.870
 we also see the appearance of 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.550
 characters when war machine the hawk 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.180
 and nick fury that I find otherwise 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.310
 useless 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.620
 they are there just to tell us and we 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.510
 we are arrangers avengers 2 is 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.820
 filled with vivid action moments 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.560
 funny unexpected events but 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.420
 all that is at the same time the point 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.720
 weak and the film everything goes too much 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.730
 quick 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.650
 everything is too spontaneous too much things 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.760
 take place because of that movie 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.620
 falls apart that we would have mixed 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.390
 in a large period of three one 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.040
 example there are several storyline 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.780
 during all the film that does not happen 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.130
 all to capture the author storylines 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.080
 especially the moment in the caves 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.000
 is not developed enough and cuts itself 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.990
 quite spontaneously the stars storyline 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.400
 which is to play the excavations 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.410
 scientists go too fast 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.180
 the romance between natacha's banner and the 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.190
 site turn around the bush but I him 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.530
 settle his account later the storyline 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.110
 of hydra was the worst the organization 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.360
 the basic hÃ©rault 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.460
 damage to the 20h of the league and 1 5 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.310
 minutes we could have made a movie 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.440
 whole with hydra oh sorry and already 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.240
 american capita winter soldier but his 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.280
 subject lost much of its meaning 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.380
 just because of these five minutes the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.940
 st finesse of winter soldiers by a 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.380
 streaker appears with the center of 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.840
 required and we see the two twins 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.790
 behind him the beginning 2,012 the baron 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.600
 structure is murdered by a too no 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.370
 but it's a joke 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.230
 good to put a mouthful 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.950
 that's another positive thing 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.660
 unexpected 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.640
 the hockey characters and his 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.870
 history is put forward while he has 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.620
 been almost invisible there would be a cost 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.110
 deputy first 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.940
 we find out more about him 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.780
 family his feelings what helps us 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.730
 to appreciate it better 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.530
 even though the clouds units in three 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.900
 green colors to the royal army yesterday a 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.210
 super soldier is a tough the rest of the long 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.800
 footage el sakka peace seems to listen 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.510
 which may seem normal because our 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.490
 basic footage from 3:30 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.320
 but of course they know how to count 

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.600
 have removed an hour from the film and again 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.100
 I am the universe 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.750
 marvel and everything that goes in there 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.010
 imagine then someone who comes from 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.780
 see the movies in a thin 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.460
 basic knowledge but there is especially 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.100
 a thing that really pissed me off 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.870
 the writers have just spit on 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.670
 the origins of hulk and the fact 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.470
 that he already has his launcher that he likes from 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.400
 all his heart and who suffers because he does not 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.560
 can not be with her 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.030
 betty ross what then we'll all do 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.860
 pretending that the movie the incredible hulk 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.750
 never existed that the whole story 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.210
 decided udc is half a lie 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.470
 but yes who needs betty ross because 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.960
 the magnificent and trustworthy services 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.340
 from some scarlett johnasson issued 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.890
 in 3d on the big screens 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.480
 in short, I could not take advantage of 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.460
 the entire film is from India to 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.200
 main bonus of the trunk of the story 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.670
 which was to develop little by little 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.740
 to help us understand any 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.660
 mental and physical evolution as well as 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.650
 it's my estimate was trampled all 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.200
 like that of the other bad guys from 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.150
 marvel five minutes for a second 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.220
 times in the movie they have curled his 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.290
 appearance in just five minutes 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.090
 there he is there he is in a wreck 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.380
 making a bad ass speech and a 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.850
 minute later he's already in a 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.780
 new agreement is getting fucked 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.490
 the tony stark mouth 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.260
 twins and visions appear very 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.940
 quickly them too even though the first 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.410
 movie was very strong this second opus 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.210
 did not meet our expectations 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.710
 can be too much place and he gives me 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.750
 the impression of being a second episode 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.200
 of a series or how movie of 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.840
 passage 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.040
 you know like thor iron man 2 like 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.750
 if they were there to tell us that 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.160
 here are going to be soon 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.930
 confront the stone of infinity and 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.490
 reached back because yes thanks to 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.080
 author hallucinations and thanks to the 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.910
 creation of vision we will have understood 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.260
 that the arrangers finally take a 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.390
 further knowledge of existence 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.410
 of these worse is that movies predicts the 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.880
 way of the cinematic universe 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.470
 of marvel 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.120
 by the way the final scene also does not 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.810
 did not give that shining desire to see 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.940
 the next movie 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.590
 despite the disadvantages it remains a 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.760
 very nice action and super movie 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.500
 hero that I advise you to go see 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.210
 and to review if you do not have any 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.370
 patience to wait for the original version 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.990
 I will surely do a second video on 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.910
 this movie for a more observation 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.210
 detailed and you what do you think of the 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.010
