00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.940
 well let's get started quickly 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:56.270
 first take your picture into dust 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:02.629
 take your pencil and draw one 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:05.189
 circle with a dot on the back then 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.340
 draw you 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.810
 semicircle that I know from a quarter 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.320
 not what it is 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:22.830
 and then another and then a slightly larger 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:25.229
 piece of the intermediate as they begin 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.650
 the eye 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:36.390
 a roll a dash 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:42.680
 two balls than the full of me 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:45.680
 max with small doggy tulip and then the 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.680
 wings 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:56.240
 with something in it well then we start 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:01.070
 with black 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.860
 first pull all about except that 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.840
 of the wings because you don't want that 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.410
 chip blue wings yes 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.410
 turn black 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.099
 she everything is circled and I have it 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.650
 needle already 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.860

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.860
 eye 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.659
 they then continue with the stripes 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.610
 they are now 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.530
 had stripes and colored and then go 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.049
 we continue with the wings with the 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.329
 light blue 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.439
 you can also use dark where I find 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.010
 close 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:51.670
 yes more a color for wings 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:55.870
 so you first circle the wings 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:59.200
 yes the shape on the inside 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.159
 color your thing i think it's a real one 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.629
 wing 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:08.560

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:16.409
 highlighter then color your first 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:16.409

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.110

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:34.240
 highlighter and has a very large one 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:36.610
 point different cake then you have to 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.270
 watch out that it is not quite an eye 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.349
 from 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:48.880
