shotgun your level of proficiency will

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.469 
shotgun your level of proficiency will
increase<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.280> therefore<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:14.060> will<00:01:14.299> your

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
confidence so what I thought we'd do is

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.880 
confidence so what I thought we'd do is
show<00:01:17.210> you<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.390> couple<00:01:17.750> of<00:01:17.960> different<00:01:18.410> stocks

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
and then talk about their length and how

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.480 
and then talk about their length and how
that<00:01:23.030> might<00:01:23.390> impact<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:24.530> way<00:01:24.740> in<00:01:25.040> which<00:01:25.310> it

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
that might impact the way in which it

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.660 
that might impact the way in which it

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
that you see on a lot of guns now is

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.890 
that you see on a lot of guns now is
this<00:01:50.950> mag<00:01:51.950> pol<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.580> in<00:01:53.060> my<00:01:53.300> mind<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.750> big

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
this mag pol and in my mind a big

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.530 
this mag pol and in my mind a big
improvement<00:01:54.560> over<00:01:54.650> the<00:01:55.010> a2<00:01:55.190> it's<00:01:55.970> got<00:01:56.270> an

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
improvement over the a2 it's got an

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.190 
improvement over the a2 it's got an
additional<00:01:57.049> pad<00:01:57.710> right<00:01:58.040> here<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:59.299> locks<00:01:59.690> in<00:02:00.020> in

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
additional pad right here it locks in in

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.460 
additional pad right here it locks in in
my<00:02:00.350> mind<00:02:00.620> a<00:02:00.770> little<00:02:00.890> bit<00:02:01.040> better<00:02:01.370> with<00:02:01.729> this

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
my mind a little bit better with this

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.380 
my mind a little bit better with this
clip<00:02:03.470> here<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:03.979> can<00:02:04.250> push<00:02:04.490> this<00:02:04.700> up<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.180> move

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
clip here so I can push this up to move

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.390 
clip here so I can push this up to move
it<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:05.720> then<00:02:05.840> once<00:02:06.110> I'm<00:02:06.290> in<00:02:06.409> position<00:02:07.010> I<00:02:07.190> can

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
it and then once I'm in position I can

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.100 
it and then once I'm in position I can
lock<00:02:07.610> it<00:02:07.820> down<00:02:08.000> which<00:02:08.269> just<00:02:08.629> feels<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:09.080> little

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
lock it down which just feels a little

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.930 
lock it down which just feels a little
tighter<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:10.280> it's<00:02:11.000> lightweight<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:12.110> allows

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
tighter so it's lightweight it allows

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.490 
tighter so it's lightweight it allows

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
like about it it's it's a little more

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.830 
like about it it's it's a little more
comfortable<00:02:49.520> forming<00:02:50.090> again<00:02:50.390> we've<00:02:50.630> got<00:02:50.810> a

comfortable forming again we've got a

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.130 
comfortable forming again we've got a
slight<00:02:51.640> bit<00:02:52.640> more<00:02:52.940> padding<00:02:53.390> here<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:54.110> just

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
slight bit more padding here and it just

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.040 
slight bit more padding here and it just
seems<00:02:54.740> to<00:02:55.010> work<00:02:55.280> better<00:02:55.940> for<00:02:56.390> me<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.660> for<00:02:56.960> many

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
seems to work better for me and for many

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.660 
seems to work better for me and for many
other<00:02:57.350> people<00:02:57.560> that's<00:02:57.860> one<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.310> reasons

a DPMS 16-inch upper and what I've done

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.050 
a DPMS 16-inch upper and what I've done
is<00:03:18.800> I've<00:03:19.040> gone<00:03:19.250> with<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:20.110> STR<00:03:21.640> Magpul<00:03:22.640> stock

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.200 
is I've gone with the STR Magpul stock
here<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:23.630> this<00:03:24.290> adds<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:25.040> couple<00:03:25.220> of<00:03:25.520> features

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
here and this adds a couple of features

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.340 
here and this adds a couple of features
to<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.750> first<00:03:26.990> of<00:03:27.200> all<00:03:27.320> is<00:03:27.590> its<00:03:28.990> has<00:03:29.990> the

ability to put in batteries in these
tubes<00:03:35.300> right<00:03:35.630> here<00:03:36.190> because<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.730> shape<00:03:38.480> of

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
tubes right here because the shape of

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.830 
tubes right here because the shape of
that<00:03:38.930> tube<00:03:39.610> extends<00:03:40.610> just<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:41.090> little<00:03:41.330> bit<00:03:41.570> you

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
that tube extends just a little bit you

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.890 
that tube extends just a little bit you
have<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:42.140> really<00:03:42.890> defined<00:03:43.400> cheap<00:03:43.940> bail<00:03:44.210> I'll

weld<00:03:53.840> every<00:03:54.290> time<00:03:54.560> which<00:03:54.920> for<00:03:55.160> me<00:03:55.550> allows<00:03:56.060> a

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
weld every time which for me allows a

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.360 
weld every time which for me allows a
more<00:03:56.540> consistent<00:03:57.020> placement<00:03:57.680> particularly

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
more consistent placement particularly

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.360 
more consistent placement particularly
with<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:58.820> red<00:03:59.030> dot<00:03:59.240> optics<00:03:59.450> that<00:03:59.780> I<00:03:59.960> run<00:04:00.370> and

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
with the red dot optics that I run and

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.540 
with the red dot optics that I run and
so<00:04:01.700> that<00:04:02.360> is<00:04:02.630> a<00:04:02.660> really<00:04:03.020> nice<00:04:03.320> set<00:04:03.710> up<00:04:03.860> so<00:04:04.280> both

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
so that is a really nice set up so both

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.420 
so that is a really nice set up so both
of<00:04:04.580> those<00:04:04.910> are<00:04:05.120> Magpul<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.440> I<00:04:06.740> think<00:04:07.280> they're

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
of those are Magpul and I think they're

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.410 
of those are Magpul and I think they're
great<00:04:07.670> and<00:04:07.850> I<00:04:07.940> think<00:04:08.150> they're<00:04:08.270> really

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
great and I think they're really

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.500 
great and I think they're really

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
right here what you notice with the eye

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.390 
right here what you notice with the eye
mod<00:04:21.920> stocks<00:04:22.480> or<00:04:23.480> at<00:04:23.720> least<00:04:23.960> I<00:04:24.140> have<00:04:24.470> is<00:04:24.770> there's

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
mod stocks or at least I have is there's

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.720 
mod stocks or at least I have is there's
just<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.850> lot<00:04:26.270> in<00:04:26.900> fit<00:04:27.470> when<00:04:27.770> once<00:04:28.100> you<00:04:28.190> adjust

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
just a lot in fit when once you adjust

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.580 
just a lot in fit when once you adjust
it<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:29.060> mean<00:04:29.210> if<00:04:29.330> they're<00:04:29.600> tight<00:04:29.930> against<00:04:30.470> the

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
it I mean if they're tight against the

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.980 
it I mean if they're tight against the
buffer<00:04:30.919> -<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:31.310> once<00:04:31.880> you<00:04:32.000> lock<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.360> in<00:04:32.750> they

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
buffer - and once you lock that in they

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.100 
buffer - and once you lock that in they
just<00:04:33.169> don't<00:04:33.560> move<00:04:34.180> incredibly<00:04:35.180> stay

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
just don't move incredibly stay

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.930 
just don't move incredibly stay
so<00:04:36.350> again<00:04:36.620> this<00:04:36.800> is<00:04:36.920> a<00:04:36.950> personal<00:04:37.220> preference

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
so again this is a personal preference

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.050 
so again this is a personal preference
but<00:04:38.090> for<00:04:38.690> me<00:04:38.870> I<00:04:39.140> feel<00:04:39.680> there<00:04:40.010> is<00:04:40.160> a<00:04:40.190> big

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
but for me I feel there is a big

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.680 
but for me I feel there is a big
advantage<00:04:41.420> of<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.320> way<00:04:42.500> in<00:04:42.560> which<00:04:42.740> this<00:04:43.040> stock

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
advantage of the way in which this stock

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.270 
advantage of the way in which this stock
runs<00:04:44.690> on<00:04:45.020> this<00:04:45.200> gun<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.800> way<00:04:45.890> it's<00:04:46.070> set<00:04:46.250> up

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
runs on this gun and the way it's set up

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.380 
runs on this gun and the way it's set up
for<00:04:46.430> me<00:04:46.790> so<00:04:46.940> this<00:04:47.270> is<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.600> eye<00:04:47.630> mod<00:04:48.170> stock

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
for me so this is the eye mod stock

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.630 
for me so this is the eye mod stock
battery<00:04:50.390> compartments<00:04:51.320> right<00:04:51.920> up<00:04:52.130> here<00:04:52.400> so

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
got battery compartments both along the

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.460 
got battery compartments both along the
tubes<00:05:52.610> here<00:05:52.970> so<00:05:53.180> on<00:05:53.300> either<00:05:53.540> side<00:05:53.900> of<00:05:54.140> the<00:05:54.230> gun

that the stock is known for and we've

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.570 
that the stock is known for and we've
got<00:05:59.870> an<00:06:00.020> additional<00:06:00.530> compartment<00:06:01.100> right<00:06:01.280> down

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
got an additional compartment right down

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.390 
got an additional compartment right down
here<00:06:02.060> where<00:06:02.300> we<00:06:02.450> can<00:06:02.630> put<00:06:02.900> double-a<00:06:03.830> batteries

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
here where we can put double-a batteries

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.510 
here where we can put double-a batteries
so<00:06:04.940> a<00:06:05.330> little<00:06:05.720> more<00:06:05.870> storage<00:06:06.170> the<00:06:06.920> length<00:06:07.280> of

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
so a little more storage the length of

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.210 
so a little more storage the length of
this<00:06:07.670> stock<00:06:08.000> is<00:06:08.300> longer<00:06:09.230> in<00:06:09.410> what<00:06:09.770> that<00:06:09.950> is

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
this stock is longer in what that is

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.750 
this stock is longer in what that is
designed<00:06:11.150> for<00:06:11.570> is<00:06:11.900> if<00:06:12.380> you're<00:06:12.800> running<00:06:13.100> optics

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
designed for is if you're running optics

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.760 
designed for is if you're running optics
in<00:06:13.940> particular<00:06:14.420> scope<00:06:14.840> and<00:06:15.110> you<00:06:15.320> want<00:06:15.530> to<00:06:15.620> have

in particular scope and you want to have

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.430 
in particular scope and you want to have
a<00:06:15.800> little<00:06:16.070> bit<00:06:16.250> more<00:06:16.580> length<00:06:17.200> justing<00:06:18.200> for<00:06:18.380> the

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
a little bit more length justing for the

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.860 
a little bit more length justing for the
eye<00:06:18.470> relief<00:06:18.980> and<00:06:19.250> just<00:06:19.430> to<00:06:19.550> get<00:06:19.820> that<00:06:20.150> gun<00:06:20.720> away

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
eye relief and just to get that gun away

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.010 
eye relief and just to get that gun away
a<00:06:21.080> little<00:06:21.290> bit<00:06:21.530> um<00:06:21.740> that<00:06:22.730> is<00:06:23.090> it<00:06:23.420> set<00:06:23.810> up<00:06:23.990> for

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
a little bit um that is it set up for

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.000 
a little bit um that is it set up for
that<00:06:24.290> so<00:06:24.650> in<00:06:24.950> this<00:06:25.610> gun<00:06:25.880> just<00:06:26.180> M&amp;P<00:06:27.140> what<00:06:27.890> I've

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
that so in this gun just M&amp;P what I've

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.280 
that so in this gun just M&amp;P what I've
done<00:06:28.190> is<00:06:28.430> added<00:06:30.790> some<00:06:31.790> optics<00:06:32.210> some<00:06:32.690> glass<00:06:32.960> up

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
done is added some optics some glass up

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.660 
done is added some optics some glass up
here<00:06:33.320> and<00:06:33.710> so<00:06:34.640> this<00:06:35.060> stock<00:06:35.450> being<00:06:35.990> longer<00:06:36.670> just

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:37.670 
here and so this stock being longer just

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.110 
here and so this stock being longer just
feels<00:06:38.110> like<00:06:39.110> the<00:06:39.290> setup<00:06:39.730> that<00:06:40.730> it's<00:06:40.910> most

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
feels like the setup that it's most

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.320 
feels like the setup that it's most
comfortable<00:06:41.600> for<00:06:41.720> me<00:06:41.900> so<00:06:42.500> the<00:06:42.980> e<00:06:43.010> mod<00:06:43.550> is<00:06:43.880> 7<00:06:44.210> and

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
comfortable for me so the e mod is 7 and

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.380 
comfortable for me so the e mod is 7 and
7/8<00:06:44.780> in<00:06:45.080> length<00:06:45.110> so<00:06:45.650> that's<00:06:46.220> the<00:06:46.490> longest<00:06:47.150> of

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
7/8 in length so that's the longest of

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.090 
7/8 in length so that's the longest of
the<00:06:47.420> but<00:06:47.690> stocks<00:06:48.020> that<00:06:48.380> we

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
the but stocks that we

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.430 
the but stocks that we
yet<00:06:49.310> and<00:06:51.220> just<00:06:52.220> slightly<00:06:52.640> longer<00:06:53.210> than<00:06:53.750> the

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 
yet and just slightly longer than the

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.930 
yet and just slightly longer than the
STR<00:06:55.400> and<00:06:56.090> again<00:06:57.050> for<00:06:57.440> me<00:06:57.590> personally<00:06:58.520> it's<00:06:58.760> a

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
STR and again for me personally it's a

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.940 
STR and again for me personally it's a
little<00:06:59.360> more<00:06:59.540> comfortable<00:06:59.990> totally

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:00.950 
little more comfortable totally

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.760 
little more comfortable totally
subjective<00:07:01.240> totally<00:07:02.240> subjective<00:07:02.590> but<00:07:03.590> I<00:07:03.650> do
