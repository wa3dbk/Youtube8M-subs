00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.720
 waterfalls off the coast of turkey in this case the vacationers from it 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.069
 the netherlands taken on monday 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:17.630
 then it was bad weather today and more bad weather 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.929
 water temperature more than 25 degrees elsewhere 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.169
 buy whole cold air 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.619
 and then you can observe these kinds of phenomena 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.329
 today it was very bad in turkey and you can find it on 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.900
 this satellite photo 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.470
 it's a seven o'clock picture tonight 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.609
 Turkey is completely back under a big white package with the population 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:40.720
 further to arrange thunderstorms 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.280
 and barely twelve hours in particular last night and this morning is in the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.800
 environment of antal jet dropped 200 millimeters of water 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.030
 must imagine 17 against in the street on a square meter and someone 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.940
 gives me is that we have to click on the link in a short time then you will absolutely die 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.460
 worth a lot 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.160
 and that has also become very wet in the first part of europe 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.660
 spain and large parts of southeast france large white spots 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.340
 there are very spicy thunderstorms in the middle with perhaps the local 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.140
 flooding 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.580
 at our harderwijk tonight a top tomorrow after red for big water in the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.550
 closed 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.750
 it was a little drizzle which I ended up with a lot of places 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.970
 it stays dry 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.980
 only in the west of the country there were already a little bothered this morning 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.939
 afterwards these people were well against 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:29.840
 prepared 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.050
 in the coming days it will not continue to run but not as intense 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.510
 scenes such as in turkey or spain 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.370
 or the first car of two o'clock this afternoon there are some vague white spots 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.960
 not all very active 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.220
 the temperature rose to 17 degrees but I have to say 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.490
 it was especially when the clouds were a bit too thick from I have seen myself from 14 15 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.140
 during drizzle 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.250
 farther south low-pressure area is located all southwest 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.050
 covered under a vast 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.070
 who we all get to do with low pressure and that German comes around each other for days 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.180
 which means we get what they have in the first place 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.030
 Occasionally some rain on not counting much on the computer yet 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.750
 not much 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.060
 but there could be some spicy showers later this week 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.959
 to sit 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.159
 for tomorrow well still put a lot of rain commission at especially south and 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.749
 west of us 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:23.199
 turkey and greece the corpses can get a little drier, kretek can still 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.289
 a number of showers also fall along the south coast of Turkey 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.859
 but after the real apple it seems to be cautious 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.060
 and of course 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.770
 well on the southwest side of europe very moderate there is only a few degrees 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.069
 warmer than sales 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.869
 anp us especially turn up days not much at a maximum temperature is possible 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.869
 means alternative sawing advocates the time of year 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.419
 i looked there is a bear symbol for weather forecasts around the world 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:52.180
 if it is used because it seems that it is getting wet outside, it will come 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.739
 and you know that you can get more rain areas 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.109
 this time was right 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.260
 it gets a bit more humid in the atmosphere 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.289
 it is not only cloud fields also in the supply direction 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:05.459
 a little bit of rain or drizzle today what you could do today 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.430
 translated into the coming hours 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.129
 These are prognoses of the perpetrators starting at a quarter to eight 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.399
 especially along the edges site is a small yellow spot 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:17.399
 sparta can fall a little bit of rain but it is not yet 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:19.179
 last night 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.869
 the occasional rain is not that cold last night due to the many 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:23.899
 cloud cover 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:27.109
 11 to 13 degrees along the eastern border 14 degrees to the sea 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.859
 what is going to be then 16 to 19 degrees 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.239
 very occasionally then when you dominate the clouds and just like today one can 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.259
 drop of rain 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:40.639
 the united states expect that it will be windy but it looks normal 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.469
 it is about 13 degrees 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:45.109
 thereby did not continue to show off 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:45.589
 good evening
