 me and within each procedure 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.190
 there are also other options for example 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.260
 we enter directly into the camera this 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.690
 is a way to eliminate suddenly the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.950
 last photos we have made in the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.750
 Saturday with the camera 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.120
 we click here below to observe 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.170
 the latest photos and here we can you 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.670
 observe the photos individually 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.469
 it's a process a little bit longer 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.269
 and in this way select the one 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.489
 we want to suddenly eliminate let's say 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.579
 we are seeing this we want to eliminate it 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.830
 we select the one that we want to eliminate it 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.920
 macchi click on the jar remove 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.990
 accept and ready this is like the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.940
 long way to eliminate it suddenly in 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.610
 the last photos we have taken if 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.979
 we want to delete the photos by set 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.020
 or several anal photos we enter the 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.939
 gallery here is the gallery option 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.369
 we enter it 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.649
 here we have several options taking into 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.580
 mind that we can also observe all 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:35.020
 our gallery either by albums by 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.110
 location or by date according to how we are 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.090
 observing the photos we can eliminate them 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.690
 suppose we have this seeing the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.280
 photos per album if we want to delete by 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.670
 example all the photos of an album 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.289
 we just click on it just in the 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.030
 three hairlines 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.520
 here he tells me to select groups the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.899
 select group and here you selected a 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.770
 album anyone 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.770
 for example let's select 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.290
 where are you doing some catches of 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.690
 screen selected this option 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.220
 so he selected that this album and then he 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.890
 click here in these three little lines of 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.430
 up and what and eliminate that way 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.560
 Well obviously I can delete that album 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.240
 I'll accept it and it automatically goes away 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.300
 if I wanted to remove all 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.370
 one-time albums taking the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.230
 click albums option below 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.110
 again 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.239
 I give him select group and then I'll go 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.580
 up here where it says selected 0 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.560
 I give you select everything and be 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.299
 selected everything quickly I'm going to another 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.610
 I'll go up here three times 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.069
 to eliminate and I'll accept it like that 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.930
 Quickly removed all albums 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.890
 and all the photos you have inside 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.120
 all the albums we go to the gate 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.830
 then another way also to eliminate 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.160
 by date would be instead of having it in 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.480
 some give it by date and so eliminate 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.519
 the votes we have taken to 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.930
 certain date 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.569
 we just select again 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.760
 down in the three lines select 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.549
 album and we select any of the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.370
 that we want we select here this 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.920
 we click on the three dashes remove 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.530
 and accept and have removed all 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.600
 photos we took on that day 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.250
 another how to delete the photos that 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.040
 leaving here not through the gallery 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.590
 as by the video manager as by the 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.180
 file manager we enter him here 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.600
 we have two options but all 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.690
 folders that are on our phone and 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.340
 see the folders that come out in our sd 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.470
 if we have that of our 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.530
 phone all the photos are going to be in 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.930
 the s so I entered chords then 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.260
 we enter with the option called ds 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.110
 dsi m here usually all the 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.269
 photos the last photos we have taken 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.580
 we enter the folder that we want and 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.489
 it is simply a matter of giving click the 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.080
 mind ends the three lines and because 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.350
 they have to give a choice to select 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.560
 all what there is not then we can 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.200
 go selecting one at a time our 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.870
 which is the most tedious and then click 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.060
 here above to erase the best in the 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.730
 fastest way to delete photos is 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.110
