want to be going up all you do is you go

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.060 
want to be going up all you do is you go
up<00:01:34.979> by<00:01:35.159> one<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.970> now<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.810> only<00:01:36.990> works<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.409> 1.4

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
up by one and now this only works in 1.4

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.480 
up by one and now this only works in 1.4
and<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.310> put<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.960> put<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> hatch<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
and you put it you put a hatch on the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.230 
and you put it you put a hatch on the
upper<00:01:41.880> part<00:01:42.150> that's<00:01:42.479> new<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.140> 1.4<00:01:44.180> putting<00:01:45.180> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
upper part that's new to 1.4 putting a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.760 
upper part that's new to 1.4 putting a
hatch<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.630> lower<00:01:45.780> part<00:01:46.020> doesn't<00:01:46.290> work<00:01:46.560> so

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
hatch on the lower part doesn't work so

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.520 
hatch on the lower part doesn't work so
well<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.420> do<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.600> specific<00:01:49.380> in

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
well for this so to do this specific in

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.109 
well for this so to do this specific in
your<00:01:49.560> portal<00:01:50.009> design<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.490> are<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.000> need

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
your portal design you are going to need

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.730 
your portal design you are going to need
one<00:01:51.180> point<00:01:51.600> forward<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.049> put<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> hatch<00:01:52.470> up

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
one point forward to put the hatch up

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.679 
one point forward to put the hatch up
top<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.570> then<00:01:55.340> two<00:01:56.340> blocks<00:01:56.670> lower<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.479> need

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
top and then two blocks lower you need

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.050 
top and then two blocks lower you need
to<00:01:57.810> put<00:01:58.020> ladders<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.520> reason<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.880> have

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
to put ladders the reason you have

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.200 
to put ladders the reason you have
ladders<00:02:00.299> there's<00:02:00.689> because<00:02:00.960> sometimes<00:02:02.210> when

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
ladders there's because sometimes when

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.230 
ladders there's because sometimes when
the<00:02:03.420> ender<00:02:03.780> pearl<00:02:04.079> fails<00:02:04.619> as<00:02:05.040> long<00:02:05.850> as<00:02:05.880> you

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the ender pearl fails as long as you

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.609 
the ender pearl fails as long as you
have<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.450> ladders<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.409> hold

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
have the ladders there and you hold

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.650 
have the ladders there and you hold
shift<00:02:07.979> when<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.280> throw<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.520> ender<00:02:08.910> pearl<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
shift when you throw the ender pearl the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.619 
shift when you throw the ender pearl the
ladders<00:02:09.989> will<00:02:10.170> catch<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.030> then<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.360> you

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
ladders will catch you and then all you

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.809 
ladders will catch you and then all you
need<00:02:12.870> is

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
ender pearls down of course I'm in

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.339 
ender pearls down of course I'm in
creative<00:02:31.430> so<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.090> can't<00:02:32.480> throw<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.900> ender

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
creative so I can't throw the ender

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.459 
creative so I can't throw the ender
pearls<00:02:34.239> pretty<00:02:35.239> simple<00:02:35.420> pretty<00:02:35.750> elegant<00:02:36.079> and

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.469 
pearls pretty simple pretty elegant and

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.580 
pearls pretty simple pretty elegant and
highly<00:02:37.129> reliable<00:02:37.489> on<00:02:38.000> this<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:39.019> tested<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.560> bunch

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
highly reliable on this I tested a bunch

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.770 
highly reliable on this I tested a bunch
of<00:02:39.919> designs<00:02:40.310> in<00:02:40.639> fact<00:02:40.819> I<00:02:41.000> actually<00:02:41.209> I've

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
of designs in fact I actually I've

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.009 
of designs in fact I actually I've
actually<00:02:42.319> filmed<00:02:43.010> three<00:02:43.549> different<00:02:44.299> designs

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
actually filmed three different designs

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.199 
actually filmed three different designs
i<00:02:45.439> filmed<00:02:45.980> three<00:02:46.219> different<00:02:46.519> designs<00:02:46.819> and

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
i filmed three different designs and

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.479 
i filmed three different designs and
then<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:47.989> just<00:02:48.169> decided<00:02:48.319> those<00:02:48.829> three<00:02:49.099> designs

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
then I just decided those three designs

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.909 
then I just decided those three designs
weren't<00:02:49.879> reliable<00:02:50.510> enough<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.109> I<00:02:51.469> went<00:02:51.739> back

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:51.919 
weren't reliable enough and I went back

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.099 
weren't reliable enough and I went back
to<00:02:51.949> testing<00:02:52.669> and<00:02:52.879> testing<00:02:53.150> some<00:02:53.599> more<00:02:53.810> and

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
to testing and testing some more and

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.159 
to testing and testing some more and
this<00:02:54.620> is<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.859> final<00:02:55.189> design<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.519> ended<00:02:55.909> up<00:02:56.000> with

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.169 
this is the final design I ended up with

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.979 
this is the final design I ended up with
um<00:02:57.169> I<00:02:57.709> do<00:02:57.829> hope<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.400> guys<00:02:58.579> enjoy<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.209> I<00:02:59.359> kind<00:02:59.900> of

enjoyed making it it wasn't something

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.599 
enjoyed making it it wasn't something
completely<00:03:02.449> complicated<00:03:03.349> but<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.219> was<00:03:04.340> kind

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
completely complicated but it was kind

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.670 
completely complicated but it was kind
of<00:03:04.669> one<00:03:04.760> of<00:03:04.819> those<00:03:04.909> challenges<00:03:05.569> of<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:06.049> need<00:03:06.560> to

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
of one of those challenges of I need to

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.159 
of one of those challenges of I need to
make<00:03:06.829> this<00:03:07.040> thing<00:03:07.370> with<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:08.209> few<00:03:08.540> blocks<00:03:08.900> as

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.169 
make this thing with this few blocks as

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:12.970 
make this thing with this few blocks as
possible<00:03:09.829> so<00:03:10.340> this<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:12.230> thing<00:03:12.530> doesn't

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
possible so this this thing doesn't

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.649 
possible so this this thing doesn't
require<00:03:13.189> that<00:03:13.489> much<00:03:13.549> it<00:03:13.909> requires<00:03:14.389> a<00:03:16.060> 7<00:03:17.060> sticks

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659
