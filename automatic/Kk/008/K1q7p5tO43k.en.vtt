Bears are faster bears are fast but it
takes<00:02:16.260> them<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.500> lot<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.830> get<00:02:16.950> up<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.190> speeds<00:02:17.490> and

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
takes them a lot of get up to speeds and

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.640 
takes them a lot of get up to speeds and
they<00:02:17.880> got<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> total<00:02:18.750> all<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.990> weight<00:02:19.200> all
