writing with a finger or stylus it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.100 
writing with a finger or stylus it
doesn't<00:01:29.820> work<00:01:29.910> very<00:01:29.940> well<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.780> iPad

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
doesn't work very well on the iPad

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.360 
doesn't work very well on the iPad
because<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.740> know<00:01:31.830> it's<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.010> multi-touch

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
because you know it's a multi-touch

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.940 
because you know it's a multi-touch
screen<00:01:32.730> so<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.900> almost<00:01:34.050> needs<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.500> enable<00:01:34.800> just

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
screen so it almost needs to enable just

screen so it almost needs to enable just
a<00:01:35.010> single<00:01:35.190> touch<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.670> mean<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.540> particular

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
a single touch I mean this particular
