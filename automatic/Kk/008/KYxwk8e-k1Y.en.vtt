00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
union of numbers okay

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.490 
union of numbers okay
so<00:00:19.949> anytime<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:21.240> can<00:00:21.420> just<00:00:21.599> refer<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.019> that

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
side okay let's look at the right hand

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.769 
side okay let's look at the right hand
side<00:00:25.320> now<00:00:25.349> and<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.970> first<00:00:27.210> three<00:00:27.630> numbers

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
side now and the first three numbers

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.400 
side now and the first three numbers
quite<00:00:28.769> easy<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:30.349> 110<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.759> 100<00:00:32.759> k<00:00:33.570> now

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
quite easy we have 110 and 100 k now

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.990 
quite easy we have 110 and 100 k now
here's<00:00:35.039> where<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.370> gets<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.700> little<00:00:35.789> bit

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
here's where it gets a little bit

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.510 
here's where it gets a little bit
different<00:00:36.390> from<00:00:36.539> Japanese<00:00:37.219> we<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.370> this

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
different from Japanese we have this

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.200 
different from Japanese we have this
unit<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.750> one<00:00:40.590> two<00:00:40.860> three<00:00:41.219> zeros<00:00:41.610> one

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
unit it's one one two three zeros one

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.959 
unit it's one one two three zeros one
something<00:00:43.129> okay<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.730> ten<00:00:45.590> something<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.309> 100

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
something okay and ten something and 100

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.639 
something okay and ten something and 100
something<00:00:48.840> okay

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
something okay

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.799 
something okay
can<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.520> guess<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:51.030> something<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:53.809> if

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
can you guess what something is and if

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.939 
can you guess what something is and if
you<00:00:55.019> guessed<00:00:56.300> thousand<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.629> are<00:00:57.870> correct<00:00:58.289> so

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
you guessed thousand you are correct so

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.060 
you guessed thousand you are correct so
this<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.399> one<00:01:00.090> thousand<00:01:02.000> 10,000<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:04.070> 100,000

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
this is one thousand 10,000 and 100,000

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.499 
this is one thousand 10,000 and 100,000
yeah<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.509> we<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.140> not<00:01:07.350> add<00:01:07.650> s<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:09.150> one

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
yeah and we do not add s it's just one

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.480 
yeah and we do not add s it's just one
thousand<00:01:10.290> ten<00:01:10.500> thousand<00:01:11.189> one<00:01:11.220> hundred

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
thousand ten thousand one hundred

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.640 
thousand ten thousand one hundred
thousand<00:01:12.890> next<00:01:15.590> six<00:01:16.590> zeros<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.240> one

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
thousand next six zeros so we have one

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.569 
thousand next six zeros so we have one
something<00:01:20.030> ten<00:01:21.030> something<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:23.100> hundred

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
something ten something and one hundred

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.050 
something ten something and one hundred
something<00:01:24.470> okay<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.890> guess<00:01:26.100> what<00:01:26.549> this

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
something okay and you guess what this

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.600 
something okay and you guess what this
is

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
is

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.380 
is
if<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.820> guessed<00:01:31.310> million<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.670> are<00:01:32.850> correct

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
if you guessed million you are correct

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.850 
if you guessed million you are correct
this<00:01:33.899> is<00:01:34.140> 1<00:01:34.530> million<00:01:35.100> ten<00:01:35.909> million<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.860> 100

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
this is 1 million ten million and 100

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.050 
this is 1 million ten million and 100
million<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:39.829> finally<00:01:40.829> maybe<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.369> check<00:01:41.640> in

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
million and finally maybe just check in

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.249 
million and finally maybe just check in
Japanese<00:01:42.570> first<00:01:43.070> big<00:01:44.070> number<00:01:44.540> nine<00:01:45.540> zeroes

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
Japanese first big number nine zeroes

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.539 
Japanese first big number nine zeroes
it's<00:01:47.250> one<00:01:47.610> something<00:01:49.070> can<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.159> guess<00:01:50.340> this

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
it's one something can you guess this

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.789 
it's one something can you guess this
number<00:01:51.680> all<00:01:52.680> right<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.790> guess

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
number all right and if you guess

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.859 
number all right and if you guess
billion<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.310> are<00:01:56.490> correct<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.420> 1

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
billion you are correct this is 1

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.310 
billion you are correct this is 1
billion<00:01:58.649> all<00:01:59.520> right<00:01:59.869> all<00:02:00.869> right<00:02:00.899> let's

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
billion all right all right let's

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.209 
billion all right all right let's
quickly<00:02:01.500> review<00:02:01.710> these<00:02:02.130> numbers<00:02:02.460> starting<00:02:02.969> at

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
quickly review these numbers starting at

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:12.520 
quickly review these numbers starting at
110<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.659> 100<00:02:07.250> then<00:02:08.750> 1,000<00:02:09.750> 10,000<00:02:10.910> 100,000
