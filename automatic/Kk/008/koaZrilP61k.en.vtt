00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:23.170
 the naples 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.150
 why 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:31.970
 javier disguise 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:34.970
 and then we take in this case the 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.500
 fake finger where I put the photo there 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.629
 reconstruction with criticism a bit like that 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.239
 and we take the white angel of nailin 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.260
 that is white, then black always 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.760
 of the nail in what is called black and not 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.610
 you see here I didn't show it well 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.309
 the pinca suite suite here it pink 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.100
 precisely of the nail that is always in love 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.280
 in fact very very candid 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.850
 confetto and began to spread ours 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.580
 base or rose all over the nail 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.380
 I always stick with the spot for or if 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.000
 favorite you can do even with 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.830
 the brush as you go better 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.310
 we cover everything we do 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.080
 catalyze the 320 seconds or just the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.810
 right timing of how much you have 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.850
 written on your bottles of colors 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:26.780
 9 untold we go other laurels with a little 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.900
 of the clean air la the pressure e 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.790
 taking black and a brush up with 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.230
 the medium-long tip let's go to 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.230
 draw our butterfly 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.500
 just remember to dye the 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.550
 brush and crush it then sides for 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.440
 don't miss taking too much product 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.659
 let's start with more or less 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:56.690
 center of our nail to go 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:59.030
 just to draw our wings too 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.159
 if black it is not too covering immediately 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.840
 it's not a problem because so much then too 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.810
 once dry to dry 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.649
 once done at least at the base of the 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.049
 drawing you can go to 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.209
 so to better settle here with one 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.280
 line cross stitch on the nail 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.720
 there so on the right side 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.180
 precisely we have designed the body of the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.980
 hurry from the head and the antennas and after 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.739
 what are we going to create the wings around 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.090
 first draw the upper wings and then to the 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.299
 lower 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.980
 obviously I made a butterfly 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.870
 big enough because it was long 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.849
 quite long obviously then it depends 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.129
 by the length of the nail you have or 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.790
 who have your customers notes 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.530
 we will have to adapt it to the need of 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.920
 adapt the butterfly precisely to 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.260
 size of the nail obviously I do 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.090
 always the double that one long 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.290
 of three-dimensional of the butterfly I do 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.530
 also the wing of course 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.120
 left even if you don't see a lot 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.959
 but at least to give you the idea 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.709
 of the thriller of the 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.209
 three-dimensionality how much hanlon you see 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.459
 as you have done now I have reviewed 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.409
 after which I start to catalyze the white 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.079
 what you see sweating at the bottom one 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.030
 I had tried putting it for say 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.409
 try to make it even colored then ho 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.389
 changed his mind and decided to do it all 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.769
 with glitter so don't put the 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.180
 white part like I did under that 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.120
 sucks 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.030
 start to apply the gel you can put 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.099
 or the basic one for those who use triphasic 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.739
 or directly a gel base 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.269
 monophasic and will be precisely inside 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.519
 of the wings where then we will go to put 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.970
 all our bellini glitter 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:37.810
 mine and they took some chinese 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:41.169
 I paid one euro after having just said 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.510
 spread the gel inside the loyal ones 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.729
 let's take the shovel let's use it 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.329
 that of steel that I also use as 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:50.889
 push cuticles so that to go 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.919
 just to do the reconstruction there 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:56.049
 I find it by god and began to spread mine 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.109
 glitter over the leak is 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.220
 fundamental that after the black you have 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:04.379
 degreased because otherwise they shine 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.379
 was expensive everywhere therefore also on black 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.459
 then tap it on the nail 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:13.000
 so that the glitter falls into 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.669
 excess and catalyze practices 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.669
 colors these glittering ie work 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:21.219
 they are silver and then shines well known 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.810
 do it all colors 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:24.639
 after catalyzing they take one 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.950
 vat brush to remove all 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.870
 glitter on access or those that 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.300
 they leaned a little attached where 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.190
 there was no gel to better delineate the 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.070
 my butterfly I always take the spot from 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.349
 part of the tip the finest e 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.760
 step the major liga where there is black 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:42.099
 I hope this nail art is there 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.279
 liked it you can obviously do it with 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:48.130
 so many different colors and I have many qualities 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:52.029
 raco also different maybe the glitter of 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.529
 different color for each wing and nothing 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.029
 I hope you enjoyed sending you a 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:57.219
 bacione I leave you the photo of the 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:58.960
 reconstruction that I made a friend of mine 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:00.310
 forget about the tip that does not 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.440
 colored well but it doesn't matter 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.940
 I leave you the picture of mine anyway 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.919
 friend who did nail art with 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.370
 butterfly a big kiss hello beautiful 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.370
 soon 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.450
 Hello
