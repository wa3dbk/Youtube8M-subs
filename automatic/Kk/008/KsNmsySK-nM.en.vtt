00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.490
 this time of an interest or curiosities 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.990
 this speed is already known by many 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.990
 people but good I wanted to 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.370

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.610
 well why not go up the channel 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.190
 well this consists of the cnooc map 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.810
 town you have to shoot at the head 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.090
 all the mannequins on the map 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.920
 absolutely everyone in a while 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.990
 about a minute and a half two 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.079
 minutes we're going to put on music from 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.739

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.739

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.960
 I have always told you how many are 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.030
 but there are a lot and there are always some 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.019
 that is in some hidden corner 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.750
 out there that you lose so if you 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:06.580
 it's time to repeat because you're going on time 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.200

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.710

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.240
