00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.889
 hello today I'm going to teach you to solve 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.620
 combined operations taking into 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.870
 has some steps sizes 30 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.630
 combined operations we should have in 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.000
 Note that the numbers are linked by 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.820
 the different operations in this case 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.550
 we have division where 56 is 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.800
 dividing with all this parentheses and 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.640
 start here ends here 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.600
 At the same time, we observe that you are subtracting 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.909
 minus 4 and in turn multiplied with everything 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.580
 this parenthesis then what should we 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:44.280
 do us to be able to solve these 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.720
 operations we must take into account the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.129
 first of the steps that is very 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.979
 important and the one that will determine us 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.050
 to us how will you continue how to continue 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:53.000
 working 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.670
 separate in terms would be one of the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.100
 first steps for this can be 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.020
 separate in terms in the plus signs and 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.449
 less that is to say in the cooperation of sum 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.250
 and sect in this case that I'm out of 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.040
 the parentheses inside of this 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.479
 parenthesis there is a line but not what 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.740
 let's consider why they are between 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.310
 parenthesis 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.100
 let's take from 56 where we see 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.240
 the next we are king in this case here 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.049
 we have a line 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.750
 we separated there we continue and we observe that 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.720
 in this less we can separate because 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.640
 is inside the wall 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.580
 so I have not been separated in 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.410
 terms now let's see how to solve the 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.800
 say that I have to solve everything 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.680
 this before and then I stable with what 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.900
 give me throughout this term but as 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.100
 this is all too big a term 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.160
 and we must believe if these operations 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.450
 we will also try to see what 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:53.120
 operation to do first you have to solve 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.070
 56 divided in all the parentheses as 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.770
 in the parenthesis I have this 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.420
 multiplication also to know what 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.810
 do first operation 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.630
 andÃºjar visualize a separation in 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.460
 mental terms if we observe if I 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.780
 they separate the term from this here inside 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:15.410
 from the parentheses I can see that less 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.780
 3 is separated from the product of these two is 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.130
 say that 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.709
 before October apparent to 56 then 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.310
 we are going to lower it down here we are going to 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.310
 copy here 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.540
 we copied the division operation and 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.840
 let's solve something in the parenthesis 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.930
 I open the parenthesis at least 30 alone 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.909
 is separated from this multiplication 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.780
 we also change it but if we resolve 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:45.000
 the multiplication is to say that minus two 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.310
 for two 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.620
 multiplied by two and less by more than 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:56.200
 two we have less by plus minus 2 by 24 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.980
 Close parenthesis is already solved first 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.980
 The multiplication 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:08.150
 I do the same in this parenthesis let's see 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.070
 now in this parenthesis we are going to do 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.170
 the same we will separate the term from 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.260
 so that it tells me what operation 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.570
 do we always observe that always 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.100
 do multiplication first then 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.790
 let's open parentheses and copy 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:27.470
 all how is the 3 stroke and work 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:30.170
 under the sect and multiplied 5 by 3 15 if 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.450
 that wall is uneven as we observe already 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.240
 I'm leaving the whole parenthesis 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.930
 something smaller the result more 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.079
 let's see what's next 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.269
 as we see to be resolved by 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.849
 complete then let's solve that 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.540
 parentheses in the parentheses 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:52.480
 minus 3 and 4 when we have the same sign 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.780
 what we have to do is add the 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.210
 numbers in their absolute value that is 3 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.490
 and 4 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:05.190
 34 would give me 7 as I'm adding numbers 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.050
 that are negative are these numbers 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.400
 are gathering the result will be in 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.269
 Reality minus 7 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.370
 now we have this is this so 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.910
 So much is still number I have to 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.120
 forget to 56 divided the result and 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.850
 half minus 7 we go here 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.090
 the same thing happens I will also solve 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.400
 this says that when there is the same sign it 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.800
 summed the absolute values and it gets 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.100
 a sign of what I'm adding now 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.949
 well here I have the 3 as it has no 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.160
 forward sign is adding up actually 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:45.639
 that is to say that I have more 3 minus 15 when 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.810
 there are different signs plus 3 minus 15 what 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.370
 what should I do is a sect therefore 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.729
 as piety for four direct 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.880
 parentheses will keep me like this I am this 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:00.580
 15 minus 3 will keep me 12 and then 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.830
 to make the list I'm going to determine who 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.650
 It is the greatest number in value 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.400
 absolute is to say the greatest value 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.979
 absolute is 15 as 15 has a sign 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.930
 less is negative is subtracting your 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.180
 results of the nap will also be 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.650
 negative after we make the dates 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.010
 we always use it who the shtick 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.840
 larger 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.600
 we continue solving in such a way that 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.449
 as we observe if I continue and giving myself 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.060
 separation in terms I have left now 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:34.690
 to be resolved and to which parentheses the 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.030
 result is minus 7 56 divided the 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.010
 minus seven for the term let's look 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.500
 the operation that it is not the 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:45.160
 division just as it is divided to 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.889
 minus 7 we make that division the 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.820
 result of the Navy 's carrying out that 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:53.490
 is going to give us 8 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.170
 but we must bear in mind that we are 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.110
 working with whole numbers 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:00.030
 that is to say that 56 as we closed I told you 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.070
 that there is nothing you do not have ingredients 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.130
 and yes it has is positive is 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.680
 adding yes we have more 56 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:10.680
 divided by minus 7 if we apply the 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.380
 rule of the signs we say more / less 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.930
 the result will give me less when 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:19.040
 multiply we divide different sign 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:22.030
 the result is always negative 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:27.169
 now yes multiply an equal sign 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:30.379
 would be positive we see in this case now 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.610
 under the line and I will solve in this 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:35.270
 finished 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.340
 that is 4 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:42.590
 for less 2 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:46.729
 4 by means of 24 by 2 684 by 14 we have 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:49.580
 48 the result and less for less 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:52.220
 we multiply would be more in reality the 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.990
 result is positive average of 4 per 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.660
 least because we are multiplying with 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.550
 a vintage street the multiplication 4 is 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.699
 pegadito are multiplying with less 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:07.960
 two minus four for less 2 - retail 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:07.960
 plus four times 12 would then be 48 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:15.120
 now let's see the end is not staying 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:17.460
 the numbers minus 8 48 when there 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.370
 different signs we said that what is 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:25.260
 ago is a line that is the result 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:28.229
 if I 148 minus eight 40 looks like 48 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.180
 has symptoms and in the largest so 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:32.760
 so much also his final result goes to 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:35.810
 being positive is going to be adding up at the end 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.810
 that is all
