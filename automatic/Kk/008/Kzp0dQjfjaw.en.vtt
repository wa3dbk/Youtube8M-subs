 hello here are the necessary elements 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.560
 to make small tarts 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.889
 with apples first of all you're going to have 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:15.450
 need small tart molds 3rd 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.020
 vahinÃ© sugar but also a paste 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.180
 puff 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.949
 so you can do it yourself or 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.810
 then you can do like me 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.500
 buy puff pastry all 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:31.320
 ready that is just as good 70 g of 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.980
 fine sugar four beautiful apples and 35 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.559
 liters of cream 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.910
 now I have talma pie dough 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:46.489
 I put my mold on and around 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.489
 using a small knife I cut 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.270
 the dough 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.140
 I repeat the operation 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:06.650
 you can do in a paste like 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.650
 this one up to 6 tarts 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.060
 I get my baking paper in 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.210
 which I'm going to cut out a small square 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.760
 which will allow me to recover my 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.260
 pie pan to prevent dough 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:34.550
 glue I recover my circle of dough I 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:40.430
 drop it on and I fit my 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:42.880
 upstream paw pie molds like 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.880
 this 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:02:02.619
 with a fork I sting my 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:02:02.619
 tarte paw like this 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.400
 now I wash and I peel my 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.650
 apples then I will cut them into thin 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:18.320
 strips in small slats like those 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:31.730
 not too big or too small for 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:33.320
 prevent it from breaking like this then 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.130
 I will drop all the little ones 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.610
 slices of apples in my tarts 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.610
 like this 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.420
 without too much stuff, because you do not have to 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.830
 forget that there will be flank to eggs 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.830
 Above 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:09.200
 that's the way it is if you ever 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.969
 miss a little good environment do not hesitate 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.950
 to cut a small piece of apple and to 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:18.650
 their added here I begin to prepare 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.170
 the preheating of vaud oven on 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.510
 thermostat 6 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.959
 once it's done I start my 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:38.870
 flank in a salad bowl I drop my 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:46.519
 cream but 3rd my fine sugar and my sugar 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:50.510
 vanilla then using a whip I 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:53.739
 mix it all up for it to make a 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.739
 homogeneous cream 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.580
 I mix about two minutes my 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.830
 flank is so finished I'm going to 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.390

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:22.930
 tartlets so using a spoon 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:25.810
 I take cream and I fill 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:35.170
 like this so as to cover my 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:37.770
 apples and not too overflowing and 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:44.020
 here is your little apple tart 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:46.930
 who has more than to be baked you 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.310
 cram preheated jean present fourme 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.410
 but if small tarts halfway up 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:57.370
 in my oven for about 40 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.950
 minutes after 40 minutes I 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.050
 assure me that my little tarts have 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.440
 well cooked so as you can 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:09.460
 see they are all golden so 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.840
 I'll be able to get them out of the oven and 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.530
 Here is the result 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.340
 I let them cool well before 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.390
 unmold them 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:22.360
 then I use them with either a 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.210
 little scoop of vanilla ice cream by 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:29.169
 example or just a tiny 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:33.510
 little icing sugar on the top 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.510
