one of the main reasons why I am selling
them<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.200> way<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.100> can't<00:01:23.369> help<00:01:23.580> it

because<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.090> accidentally<00:01:24.750> miscalculated<00:01:25.650> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
because I accidentally miscalculated and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.190 
because I accidentally miscalculated and
I<00:01:26.340> bought<00:01:26.520> had<00:01:26.700> nine<00:01:26.970> instead<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.630> ten<00:01:27.840> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
I bought had nine instead of ten and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.319 
I bought had nine instead of ten and
there<00:01:28.409> wasn't<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.770> tenth<00:01:29.009> one<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.790> I'll<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.180> go

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
there wasn't a tenth one so I'll just go

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.630 
there wasn't a tenth one so I'll just go
ahead<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.720> list<00:01:30.930> nine<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.380> them<00:01:31.500> instead<00:01:31.950> now

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
ahead and list nine of them instead now

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.039 
ahead and list nine of them instead now
I've<00:01:32.759> already<00:01:32.909> ran<00:01:33.180> out<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.390> gold<00:01:33.600> once<00:01:33.930> I

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
I've already ran out of gold once I

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.350 
I've already ran out of gold once I
tried<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.530> get<00:01:34.680> some<00:01:34.979> volatile<00:01:35.369> earth<00:01:35.610> because

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.210 
tried to get some volatile earth because
it's<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.840> dirt<00:01:37.110> cheap<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.650> totally<00:01:38.040> worth

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
it's so dirt cheap it's totally worth

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.580 
it's so dirt cheap it's totally worth
buying<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.820> now<00:01:39.420> because<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.990> can't<00:01:40.170> list<00:01:40.470> them

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
buying it now because it can't list them

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
it's kind of funny but if you listen

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.990 
it's kind of funny but if you listen
stacks<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.269> ten<00:03:03.540> don't<00:03:04.319> ask<00:03:04.530> me<00:03:04.709> why<00:03:04.890> I'm<00:03:05.790> gonna

guess<00:03:06.209> it's<00:03:06.239> because<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:07.080> stack<00:03:07.319> of<00:03:07.350> ten<00:03:07.739> is

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
guess it's because the stack of ten is

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.440 
guess it's because the stack of ten is
what's<00:03:08.100> used<00:03:08.340> for<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.700> transmutes<00:03:09.209> and

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
stacks of ten then people seem to just

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.250 
stacks of ten then people seem to just
kind<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.610> forget<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.480> there's<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.780> whole

bunch<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.859> cheaper<00:03:17.400> ones<00:03:17.609> lower<00:03:17.940> than<00:03:18.209> that

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
bunch of cheaper ones lower than that

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.090 
bunch of cheaper ones lower than that
and<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:18.959> pretty<00:03:19.230> much<00:03:19.320> goes<00:03:19.680> for<00:03:19.920> any<00:03:20.040> other

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100

people are going to buy it one thing

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.250 
people are going to buy it one thing
that's<00:03:26.850> good<00:03:27.060> for<00:03:27.299> volatile<00:03:27.630> is<00:03:27.750> of<00:03:27.870> course<00:03:28.079> is

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
that's good for volatile is of course is

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.039 
that's good for volatile is of course is
singles<00:03:28.769> but<00:03:29.070> if<00:03:29.370> singles<00:03:30.209> are<00:03:30.420> really<00:03:30.810> cheap

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
singles but if singles are really cheap

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.680 
singles but if singles are really cheap
at<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.380> time<00:03:31.620> then<00:03:32.340> check<00:03:32.640> stocks<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.239> ten

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
at the time then check stocks of ten

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.960 
at the time then check stocks of ten
sometimes<00:03:34.440> stocks<00:03:34.829> of<00:03:35.040> twenty<00:03:35.400> are<00:03:35.549> okay

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
sometimes stocks of twenty are okay

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.530 
sometimes stocks of twenty are okay
sometimes<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:37.170> know<00:03:37.290> thirty<00:03:37.680> but<00:03:38.040> ten<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:39.090> the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
sometimes you know thirty but ten is the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.640 
sometimes you know thirty but ten is the
magic<00:03:39.959> number

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
magic number

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.830 
magic number
so<00:03:41.070> I<00:03:41.100> get<00:03:41.400> my<00:03:41.549> stocks<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:42.090> ten<00:03:42.299> up<00:03:42.450> for<00:03:42.720> $8.99

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
so I get my stocks of ten up for $8.99

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.580 
so I get my stocks of ten up for $8.99
and<00:03:43.769> then<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:44.010> throw<00:03:44.489> my<00:03:45.049> singles<00:03:46.049> my<00:03:46.320> last

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
and then I throw my singles my last

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.340 
and then I throw my singles my last
three<00:03:46.890> singles<00:03:47.250> up<00:03:47.430> for<00:03:47.640> 585<00:03:48.329> after<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:49.320> I

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
three singles up for 585 after that I

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.190 
three singles up for 585 after that I
check<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.920> see<00:03:50.130> if<00:03:50.280> anything's<00:03:50.670> sold<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.390> if<00:03:52.079> I

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
check to see if anything's sold and if I

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.319 
check to see if anything's sold and if I
got<00:03:52.350> any<00:03:52.560> other<00:03:52.680> undercuts<00:03:53.250> which<00:03:53.850> is<00:03:54.000> really
