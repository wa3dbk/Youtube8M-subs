wasn't<00:02:21.680> sure<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:22.130> was<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:23.830> throttle<00:02:24.830> cable

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
wasn't sure of was the throttle cable

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.170 
wasn't sure of was the throttle cable
and<00:02:25.489> it's<00:02:26.299> this<00:02:26.769> right<00:02:27.769> here<00:02:28.040> this<00:02:28.220> knotch<00:02:28.549> it

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
and it's this right here this knotch it

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.810 
and it's this right here this knotch it

anybody who never disconnected one of
these<00:03:26.870> fuel<00:03:27.170> rails<00:03:27.410> before<00:03:27.950> I<00:03:27.980> didn't<00:03:28.400> either

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
these fuel rails before I didn't either

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.900 
these fuel rails before I didn't either
this<00:03:29.450> is<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.750> tool<00:03:29.960> or<00:03:30.140> plastic<00:03:30.680> tool<00:03:30.910> there's

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
this is the tool or plastic tool there's

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.390 
this is the tool or plastic tool there's
a<00:03:31.970> lip<00:03:32.210> on<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.480> one<00:03:32.660> side<00:03:32.930> all<00:03:33.380> you<00:03:33.500> do<00:03:33.830> is<00:03:34.010> take

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
a lip on the one side all you do is take

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.980 
a lip on the one side all you do is take
the<00:03:34.580> safety<00:03:34.970> clip<00:03:35.120> off<00:03:35.470> you<00:03:36.470> snap<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:37.750> over<00:03:38.750> the

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
the safety clip off you snap it over the

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.050 
the safety clip off you snap it over the
unit<00:03:39.320> like<00:03:39.440> that<00:03:39.740> and<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.160> pull<00:03:40.490> it<00:03:40.640> towards

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
unit like that and you pull it towards

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.570 
unit like that and you pull it towards
you<00:03:41.150> you<00:03:41.270> can<00:03:41.450> feel<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:41.900> spring<00:03:42.320> lock<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:42.950> then

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
you you can feel it spring lock and then

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.990 
you you can feel it spring lock and then
you<00:03:43.730> just<00:03:44.030> pull<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.480> hose<00:03:44.690> out<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:46.040> that's<00:03:46.460> it

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.020 

now<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.210> release<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.200> pressure<00:03:51.440> in<00:03:51.770> there

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
now I release the pressure in there

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.510 
now I release the pressure in there
through<00:03:53.030> this<00:03:53.150> Schrader<00:03:53.750> valve<00:03:54.110> and<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:55.280> car

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
through this Schrader valve and the car

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.670 
through this Schrader valve and the car
set<00:03:55.820> for<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.120> whole<00:03:56.180> day<00:03:56.570> and<00:03:56.870> all<00:03:57.230> I<00:03:57.290> did<00:03:57.530> was

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
set for a whole day and all I did was

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.130 
set for a whole day and all I did was
took<00:03:57.830> a<00:03:57.910> toothpick<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.150> just<00:03:59.750> kind<00:04:00.020> of

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
took a toothpick and just kind of

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.070 
took a toothpick and just kind of
depress<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:01.340> Schrader<00:04:01.580> valve<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.660> little<00:04:02.690> bit

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
depress the Schrader valve a little bit

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.490 
depress the Schrader valve a little bit
of<00:04:03.200> fuel<00:04:03.320> came<00:04:03.590> out<00:04:03.770> but<00:04:04.190> anyway<00:04:04.310> that's<00:04:05.150> it

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
of fuel came out but anyway that's it

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.630 
of fuel came out but anyway that's it
that<00:04:06.500> was<00:04:06.650> easier<00:04:06.950> than<00:04:07.100> I<00:04:07.220> thought<00:04:07.250> there's

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
that was easier than I thought there's

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.790 
that was easier than I thought there's
no<00:04:07.760> instructions<00:04:08.360> with<00:04:08.510> these<00:04:08.690> so<00:04:09.200> anyway<00:04:09.770> I

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
no instructions with these so anyway I

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.729 
no instructions with these so anyway I
got<00:04:10.130> four<00:04:10.450> bolts<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.600> take<00:04:11.810> off<00:04:12.020> and<00:04:12.320> then<00:04:12.440> I

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
got four bolts to take off and then I

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.350 
got four bolts to take off and then I
could<00:04:13.220> take<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.489> fuel<00:04:13.730> rail<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.239> the

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
could take the fuel rail and the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.570 
could take the fuel rail and the
injectors<00:04:14.840> off<00:04:15.050> okay<00:04:15.770> I<00:04:15.800> put<00:04:16.070> a<00:04:16.100> rag<00:04:16.310> down

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
injectors off okay I put a rag down

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.010 
injectors off okay I put a rag down
because<00:04:16.820> I<00:04:16.910> didn't<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.209> didn't<00:04:17.510> know<00:04:17.600> how<00:04:17.810> much

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
because I didn't I didn't know how much

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.420 
because I didn't I didn't know how much
fuel<00:04:18.260> was<00:04:18.440> going<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.680> come<00:04:18.830> out<00:04:18.919> very<00:04:18.950> little

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430

fuel was going to come out very little
so<00:04:20.030> okay<00:04:20.480> okay<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:24.320> fuel<00:04:24.530> rail<00:04:24.770> came<00:04:25.100> out<00:04:25.250> not

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
so okay okay the fuel rail came out not

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.220 
so okay okay the fuel rail came out not
too<00:04:25.910> much<00:04:26.090> problems

intake I guess I'm ready okay next step

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.360 
intake I guess I'm ready okay next step
well<00:04:53.419> about<00:04:55.150> hour<00:04:56.150> 45<00:04:57.020> in<00:04:57.380> I'm<00:04:57.680> ready<00:04:57.740> to<00:04:58.160> take
