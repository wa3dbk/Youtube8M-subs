fricking die but yeah well it's a crazy

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.250 
fricking die but yeah well it's a crazy
kind<00:02:38.770> of<00:02:38.920> thing<00:02:39.130> where<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:40.200> think<00:02:41.200> the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
kind of thing where I think the

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.780 
kind of thing where I think the
Republicans<00:02:41.770> have<00:02:41.830> a<00:02:41.920> real<00:02:42.100> issue<00:02:42.280> with<00:02:42.459> the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
Republicans have a real issue with the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.820 
Republicans have a real issue with the
the<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.270> know<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.780> state<00:02:44.319> paying<00:02:44.620> for

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
the you know the state paying for

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.110 
the you know the state paying for
everything<00:02:45.010> but<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.459> think<00:02:45.520> that<00:02:45.790> there's<00:02:45.970> some

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
everything but I think that there's some

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.520 
everything but I think that there's some
things<00:02:46.330> you<00:02:46.510> have<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.660> pay<00:02:46.870> for<00:02:46.930> like<00:02:47.230> roads

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
things you have to pay for like roads

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.800 
things you have to pay for like roads
and<00:02:48.370> like<00:02:48.490> education<00:02:49.390> I<00:02:49.540> mean<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.780> just

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
and like education I mean that just

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.690 
and like education I mean that just
makes<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.260> society<00:02:50.410> better<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.130> health<00:02:51.459> you

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
makes a society better and health you

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.280 
makes a society better and health you
should<00:02:51.790> be<00:02:52.030> able<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.270> do<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:52.810> that

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
should be able to do that and that that

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.720 
should be able to do that and that that
hopefully<00:02:53.650> will<00:02:53.740> be<00:02:53.770> taken<00:02:54.160> care<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.490> little

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
hopefully will be taken care of a little

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.970 
hopefully will be taken care of a little
bit<00:02:54.850> but<00:02:55.240> you<00:02:55.330> know<00:02:55.450> Obama<00:02:55.810> is<00:02:56.020> kind<00:02:56.290> of<00:02:56.410> he's

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
bit but you know Obama is kind of he's

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.710 
bit but you know Obama is kind of he's
I'm<00:02:57.280> not<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.459> huge<00:02:57.790> Obama<00:02:58.090> fan<00:02:58.330> because<00:02:58.480> he

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
I'm not a huge Obama fan because he

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.270 
I'm not a huge Obama fan because he
could<00:02:58.870> have<00:02:58.900> just<00:02:59.080> insisted<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.860> made<00:03:00.190> it

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
could have just insisted and made it

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.680 
could have just insisted and made it
single-payer<00:03:00.819> so<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.150> everybody<00:03:01.569> would

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
single-payer so that everybody would

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.270 
single-payer so that everybody would
have<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:02.020> get<00:03:02.170> health<00:03:02.379> insurance<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:03.040> that

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
have to get health insurance and that

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.289 
have to get health insurance and that
would<00:03:03.370> have<00:03:03.459> been<00:03:03.489> good<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:03.939> I<00:03:04.030> think<00:03:04.209> the

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
would have been good and I think the

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.640 
would have been good and I think the
government<00:03:04.569> could<00:03:04.750> have<00:03:04.810> absorbed<00:03:05.140> that<00:03:05.290> but

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
government could have absorbed that but

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.220 
government could have absorbed that but
it<00:03:05.739> also<00:03:05.890> takes<00:03:06.159> people<00:03:06.939> to<00:03:07.180> be<00:03:07.900> healthy

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
it also takes people to be healthy

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.960 
it also takes people to be healthy
themselves<00:03:08.739> I<00:03:08.799> mean<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:09.010> can't<00:03:09.220> have<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.670> mean
