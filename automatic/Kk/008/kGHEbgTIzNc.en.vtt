00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.629 
competing incident I'm in women's
physique<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:12.139> I<00:00:13.139> hear<00:00:13.830> that<00:00:14.070> last<00:00:14.340> year<00:00:14.610> you

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
physique and I hear that last year you

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.129 
physique and I hear that last year you
were<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.059> at<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.360> show<00:00:15.540> competing<00:00:16.020> in

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
were here at this show competing in

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.890 
were here at this show competing in
Figure<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.680> not<00:00:17.160> yes<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:17.850> was<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.539> now<00:00:18.720> you're

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
Figure and not yes it was and now you're

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.269 
Figure and not yes it was and now you're
in<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.109> physique<00:00:19.380> class<00:00:19.650> what<00:00:19.920> made<00:00:20.070> you

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
in the physique class what made you

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.620 
in the physique class what made you
switch<00:00:20.460> into<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.880> physique<00:00:21.119> club

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
switch into the physique club

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.689 
switch into the physique club
well<00:00:21.810> probably<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.529> about<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.310> last<00:00:23.340> two

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
well probably for about the last two

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.509 
well probably for about the last two
years<00:00:23.880> judges<00:00:24.779> have<00:00:25.019> told<00:00:25.230> me<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.650> go<00:00:26.369> into

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
years judges have told me to go into

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.310 
years judges have told me to go into
women's<00:00:26.849> physique<00:00:27.000> because<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.449> guess<00:00:27.689> figure

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
women's physique because I guess figure

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.750 
women's physique because I guess figure
has<00:00:28.410> got<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.590> little<00:00:28.650> bit<00:00:28.769> more<00:00:28.890> softer<00:00:29.490> and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
has got a little bit more softer and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.880 
has got a little bit more softer and
just<00:00:30.480> with<00:00:30.599> my<00:00:30.750> physique<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.349> can't<00:00:31.590> afford

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
just with my physique so I can't afford

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.350 
just with my physique so I can't afford
it<00:00:32.040> for<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.219> while<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.610> then<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.820> did<00:00:33.030> my<00:00:33.149> first

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
it for a while but then I did my first

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.930 
it for a while but then I did my first
show<00:00:33.540> at<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.380> West<00:00:34.590> Coast<00:00:34.770> Classic<00:00:35.070> last<00:00:35.640> June

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
show at the West Coast Classic last June

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.260 
show at the West Coast Classic last June
and<00:00:36.270> then<00:00:36.420> did<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.590> USA's<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.340> July

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and then did the the USA's in July

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.600 
and then did the the USA's in July
very<00:00:39.870> good<00:00:40.110> very<00:00:40.140> nice<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.890> here<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.340> seems

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
very good very nice and here it seems

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.040 
very good very nice and here it seems
like<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.910> look<00:00:42.090> great<00:00:42.329> you've<00:00:42.570> done<00:00:42.840> very

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
like you look great you've done very

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.100 
like you look great you've done very
well<00:00:43.879> how's<00:00:44.879> your<00:00:44.910> training<00:00:45.360> different<00:00:45.719> for

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
well how's your training different for

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.470 
well how's your training different for
physique<00:00:46.410> than<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:47.070> figure<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:48.239> would

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
physique than it was for figure I would

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.889 
physique than it was for figure I would
say<00:00:48.780> probably<00:00:49.250> a<00:00:50.250> little<00:00:51.120> bit<00:00:51.329> more<00:00:51.570> sort<00:00:51.870> of

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
say probably a little bit more sort of

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.979 
say probably a little bit more sort of
repetitions<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.620> training<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.989> certainly

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
repetitions and training and certainly

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.720 
repetitions and training and certainly
the<00:00:55.170> diet<00:00:55.440> was<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> little<00:00:56.160> bit<00:00:56.250> more<00:00:56.370> tighter<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the diet was a little bit more tighter a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.160 
the diet was a little bit more tighter a
lot<00:00:56.879> more<00:00:57.030> cardio<00:00:57.420> more<00:00:57.960> high<00:00:58.140> intensity

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
lot more cardio more high intensity

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.979 
lot more cardio more high intensity
cardio<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:59.640> wasn't<00:00:59.969> too<00:01:00.180> much<00:01:00.329> different<00:01:00.809> but

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
cardio it wasn't too much different but

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.420 
cardio it wasn't too much different but
I<00:01:01.230> think<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.770> me<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.039> bringing<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
I think just me just bringing in a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.100 
I think just me just bringing in a
tighter<00:01:02.670> package<00:01:03.180> there<00:01:03.510> were<00:01:03.570> some<00:01:03.719> areas<00:01:04.019> I

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
tighter package there were some areas I

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.080 
tighter package there were some areas I
wanted<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.439> bring<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.890> improve<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.939> my

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
wanted to bring up and improve like my

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.140 
wanted to bring up and improve like my
back<00:01:06.299> bring<00:01:06.930> my<00:01:07.049> waist<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.500> smaller<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.189> and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
back bring my waist and smaller and and

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.730 
back bring my waist and smaller and and
bring<00:01:09.360> up<00:01:09.479> my<00:01:09.510> legs<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.080> managed<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:10.560> all

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
bring up my legs and I managed to do all

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.370 
bring up my legs and I managed to do all
of<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.310> very<00:01:11.939> nice<00:01:12.210> very<00:01:12.540> good<00:01:12.659> what

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
of that so very nice very good what

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.750 
of that so very nice very good what
would<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.650> say<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.860> your<00:01:14.010> favorite<00:01:14.040> body<00:01:14.490> part

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
would you say is your favorite body part

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.510 
would you say is your favorite body part
to<00:01:14.880> train<00:01:15.119> my<00:01:15.960> favorite<00:01:16.350> has<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.619> be<00:01:16.710> legs<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
to train my favorite has to be legs and

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.109 
to train my favorite has to be legs and
they<00:01:18.270> look<00:01:18.479> great<00:01:18.630> obviously<00:01:19.850> is<00:01:20.850> there
