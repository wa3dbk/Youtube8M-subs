00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.080
 Also Kedomo is a very good book There are book Tteyuu professional conditions of Drucker 

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:06.910
 that 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.260
 Hey there 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.430
 It is written 5 I am Schumpeter Nee With a very famous economist 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.250
 It is a memory 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:21.550
 Father of Drucker'm apparently relationship was good and say that Schumpeter Nen 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:23.140
 While talking with him while drinking together, even the pro-American , he told the economist 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.900
 Even now I say 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.430
 Sometimes I think of who I want to learn as who I want to leave my name as 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.730
 Because there is a story that I heard to Schumpeter 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.120
 In ultra-talented economists from the time he is young also say or why 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.550
 so 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.719
 When it's about 30 years old , it's a very long time long enough to make him famous. 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.760
 I have already written many books 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:48.290
 In I say You went telling this kind of wind and I was the mistress of my nose Europe one of the beautiful woman 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.329
 Europe City Equestrian 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.739
 I'm a human rider, and maybe I want to be known as the world's best economist 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.140
 The wind that say I want to leave 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.320
 30 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.170
 I think it 's a bad guy that I liked what I liked 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.170
 It's because I'm already getting older 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:11.440
 Asked once more this morning to my friends Even now I knew how I wanted to leave my name 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.790
 I wonder if I can think angry 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.620
 It 's because I think I 'm thinking I 'm saying - Schumpeter gold is quite different from that at that time 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.150
 It seems to mean 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.510
 I do n't 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:28.060
 Really great for many talented students alone 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:30.110
 Tteyuu was driven by the Fu say that want to remember you want to keep the name as a teacher you have to economists 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.980
 I 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.210
 We also talk about Hilton as to who we want to go 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.590
 That's right 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:43.940
 In we buy will you leave the name as would selfishly who do Who our Carry 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:48.160
 I that the in thing I mean I wonder to what we in the carrier 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.160
 I want us thinking 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.540
 That's because I want to work towards that, so I'm not talking about eating rice 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.650
 Something to a little not a story to say When you learn also something coach 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.979
 Because we want to do this as a part of our life, it is our life 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.130
 I want to think about something in the past, so I want to make it to the clan too 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.170
 Claire is, of course, able to perform well in the near future 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.330
 It would be good if gold-human relations get better as economic conditions improve 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.830
 But we want to see in a wider view 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:22.110
 Coach of the brush that much repeated mention yesterday is seen in the wider field of view than the client 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:25.140
 It is that I want to go through the entire life of the custodian, who is a clan or something beyond the entire life of the client 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.520
 It's because I want to think about something, so it happens that breaks occur 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.690
 is 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.030
 Hey all-or 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:36.470
 I might have talked about that four levels but 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:40.819
 From a world that has nothing to do with its career, life, or anything beyond one 's own life 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.670
 Firmly pull out that you really want to live and from there 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:48.140
 So what do you do in the company right now while pulling out the motivation 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.770
 It now everyone modern people if you are not me to do projects are too busy do too much in the confusion 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.020
 you know 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:56.250
 In clear guidelines in the distance I our more and more 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.200
 Even if there are many things nearby, the gamer degree is not really headed anywhere 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.730
 If there Shi is in the selfish far the go 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.810
 It does not even before shake in the short term 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:10.610
 Why does the flight arrive at the destination ? 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.060
 Sometimes it is shifted left and right ne Some that are out of it height to it that up and down the various circumstances 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.170
 You 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:19.230
 It is because continue to modify toward the bottom have found wood stop aware but not deviated 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:23.310
 It flies from the airport to such a pinpoint from the airport and it is a arrival at the airport 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.209
 Crap continue to not a same as the sound turned off or are you shift this is in most of the process 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.569
 I'm not be there 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:31.280
 Life is not right, but we head for it if the end point is clear 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.280
 I can keep on going 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:42.040
 It is something that is a high school girl in a tavern It is about who I am 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:44.250
 And I do not blur I will do what I can do at this place, so I will go ahead 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.250
 so 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:53.860
 Something really over sleep my life in and want is I thing it 's such a so 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:58.810
 Really high in I say just a professional level without coach also do it as a profession 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:02.740
 It means that you want to have a coach with your own value standard too 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:07.300
 That I'd had become to feel Do not too excited 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.220
 I say jumbo another one Hey really important without the Te This is also my a favorite of 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:14.560
 I There are coaches that graduates 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:17.410
 In him is the story of I'm me posted on Facebook that the Statue of Liberty Statue of Liberty 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.310
 The creator who made 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.210
 a 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.690
 Also it Tteyuu is crowded to make hard at fine-hair it to the top of the other head 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.440
 I'm say Tatte not even anyone something human viewed from above at that time separately was no of the airplane 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:33.190
 But after all he does not mean that he is professional 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.750
 I remembered that I remember drug talk again I think that maybe the same professional 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.330
 I I in it I'm conditions 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.620
 In Greece, which is called Feria, what is the story of a Greek sculpting mother ? 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.800
 Yes to have 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:48.510
 Will Is there reason supranational So temple asked the sculpture 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.280
 I'm asked a strong country that stick at the Greek Temple this hut after in It is a cat 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.760
 In is why we have to make hard 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.820
 I will deliver at the reason why one of the new issue or one of them gets angry 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.610
 It is carved something portion of such ne back and say why selfish 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.800
 The reason why people are told not to pay such money because no one sees it digging over time 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.580
 I will 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.689
 It is said that the gods are looking even if no one sees it 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:12.999
 That's why you need to dig 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:15.189
 Re properly But I'm talking to has got the money that I wrote Well then anymore 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:19.120
 Standing I remembered it in divided 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:23.460
 Then I 'm going to hang on this time and I 'm right. 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:29.770
 Not Tteyuu anyone we own it looked Kaiserslautern than to and everyone has seen the gods without seeing 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:32.530
 In either said something about the point that our own does not compromise with our own does not lower the standard of value where such of 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:36.460
 After all we do not compromise 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:39.139
 We can do it without lowering our value standard We will try to grow a little 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:44.180
 The attitude is still cloud to try to contribute a little, even 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:59.129
 I think that I work on my heart, and that's what I really wanted to say 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:06:03.209
 A wildebeest defense trisilicate Kaasan not in but now Tsu Oh tentatively have gathered 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:05.129
 Further, it is because I think also that there is a place that I think a little ne various Toka story I heard now a professional 

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:08.789

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:11.719
