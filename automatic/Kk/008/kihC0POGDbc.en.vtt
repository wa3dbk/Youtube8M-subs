00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 on the literary cap site I wrote a 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.379
 text on how not only literature 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.050
 realistic but also popular is able to 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.719
 to make the reader empathize with 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.400
 put yourself in the shoes of others and develop 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.389
 this same feeling that not so 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.910
 deep 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.279
 the problem is that in some works this 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.279
 prejudice makes all the sense of the world 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.059
 the good side of life is narrated by the point 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.489
 of pet.pe sticks that way 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.770
 none is the main character of this 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.170
 story because at no time did he 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.960
 make decisions that will affect the course of 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.390
 story the pet mother who decides that he 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.010
 will leave the mental health institution 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.559
 in which he finds himself 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.660
 yes at the beginning it is clear that the pet 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.879
 suffered some kind of trauma that left 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.260
 mentally unbalanced but not 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.719
 we know why 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.729
 and as the narrative develops 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:09.060
 but we understand that everything happens 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.640
 around the pet's mother and not his 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.740
 then as much as he is the hero to 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.630
 main character of this book she 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.150
 from there the book passes the time I am 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.880
 trying to create situations to prove that 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.900
 a children's patch 2 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.310
 he is paranoid and 3 he is god fearing 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.860
 gradually we understand that the two 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.509
 first items are sequelae of trauma and 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.729
 the third just will not to 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.970
 even a romantic couple lived by the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.310
 schifani knows only to show type looks 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.710
 someone who has been through the same thing 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.600
 that he is there to tell the story 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.640
 which within the context led to the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.460
 conclusion that this is a very 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.540
 more about losses than about diseases 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.399
 mental 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.829
 Why do we spend the whole night? 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.930
 wondering what the problem is. 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.040
 central characters until everything is 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.530
 revealed on the last ten pages 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.119
 only that it no longer matters more native and has 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.290
 many classics of American literature 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.140
 as the silvio plech gm and objective 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.900
 here as explained is that the large 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.440
 works of these authors served for the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.200
 people 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.330
 learn to be in solidarity with people 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.400
 who are experiencing problems and also 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.180
 show that life is not always everything 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.460
 end well 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.950
 but the good side of life instead of 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.870
 to teach solidarity with people with 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.300
 mental illnesses and presents the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.790
 consistent that is never satisfied with 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.240
 nothing I do for him any message 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.300
 here I did not hit that boy not mental 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.320
 tries to please he does not know why're right 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.750
 easy on anyone 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.270
 the very subject of the book that is only loss 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.280
 will actually be developed there pras 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.350
 ten pages of the book together with 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.980
 the revelations that I've mentioned this 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.500
 not to mention the bow of the pet's mother who is the 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.380
 the main character of the book and who 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.170
 neder is developed so the leaves 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.590
 the reader complete grandson three dots 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.870
 not really important and also leaving 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.770
 the father of the pet completely disposable 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.660
 for negative 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.160
 the book has good are some games of 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.920
 words but metaphors that are creative 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.350
 but if it were not for the suspense that the author 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.270
 that I doubt he would have done 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.520
 both successful and successful 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.959
 Too bad it's that old man 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.190
 suspense for nothing 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.140
 the good side of life will take two trulli 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.810
 I must say that I was happier. 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.170
 When I only knew the movie, it's bradley. 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.580
 cooper and ed heroes miss but only 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.920
