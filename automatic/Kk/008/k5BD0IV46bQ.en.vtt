ok<00:00:00.810> I<00:00:00.840> played<00:00:00.960> with<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.469> little<00:00:01.620> bit<00:00:01.829> more

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
ok I played with this a little bit more

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.940 
ok I played with this a little bit more
and<00:00:02.040> got<00:00:02.340> it<00:00:02.460> to<00:00:02.490> this<00:00:02.730> stage<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.629> i'll<00:00:04.560> let

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
and got it to this stage and i'll let

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.829 
and got it to this stage and i'll let
you<00:00:05.100> take<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.339> look<00:00:05.580> at<00:00:05.700> what<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.940> final<00:00:06.210> color

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
you take a look at what the final color

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.870 
you take a look at what the final color
flow<00:00:07.140> looked<00:00:07.410> like<00:00:07.589> on<00:00:07.770> my<00:00:07.950> color<00:00:08.490> mixer

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
flow looked like on my color mixer

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.060 
flow looked like on my color mixer
there's<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.660> gradient<00:00:10.139> I've<00:00:10.290> got<00:00:10.590> kind<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:10.950> an

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
there's the gradient I've got kind of an

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.900 
there's the gradient I've got kind of an
orange-red<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:12.690> brown<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.950> then<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.309> red<00:00:14.549> and

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
orange-red a brown and then a red and

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.570 
orange-red a brown and then a red and
then<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.870> result<00:00:16.289> was<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.279> then<00:00:17.430> also

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
then the result was this and then also

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.970 
then the result was this and then also
i've<00:00:18.390> got<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> gradient<00:00:19.230> transform<00:00:19.710> tool

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
i've got the gradient transform tool

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.890 
i've got the gradient transform tool
which<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.609> pinched<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.060> little<00:00:21.300> bit<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.720> then

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
which I pinched a little bit and then

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.660 
which I pinched a little bit and then
shrunk<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.350> little<00:00:22.380> bit<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:23.010> moved<00:00:23.310> around<00:00:23.490> now

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
shrunk a little bit it moved around now

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
that is I'm going to make a new layer ok

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.080 
that is I'm going to make a new layer ok
and<00:00:51.230> I'm<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.770> get<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> gradient<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.910> what

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and I'm going to get a gradient so what

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.110 
and I'm going to get a gradient so what
I'll<00:00:54.180> do<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.449> I'll<00:00:54.920> get<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.219> white<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.910> black

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
I'll do is I'll get the white to black

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.840 
I'll do is I'll get the white to black
gradient<00:00:57.840> alright<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.890> then<00:00:59.370> I'll<00:00:59.489> open<00:00:59.760> up

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
gradient alright and then I'll open up

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.819 
gradient alright and then I'll open up
my<00:01:00.000> color<00:01:00.300> mixer<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.930> you'll<00:01:01.320> see<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
my color mixer and you'll see I have the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.470 
my color mixer and you'll see I have the
white<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.190> black<00:01:02.340> gradient<00:01:02.850> right<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.270> right

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
white to black gradient right here right

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.030 
white to black gradient right here right
so<00:01:04.229> what<00:01:04.350> I'm<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.769> I'm<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.070 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
change<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.339> chip<00:01:06.030> double-click<00:01:06.900> on<00:01:06.930> that

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
change this chip double-click on that

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.700 
change this chip double-click on that
one<00:01:07.439> change<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> white<00:01:08.430> right<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.710> then

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
one change that to white right and then

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.980 
one change that to white right and then
I've<00:01:11.130> got<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.490> chip<00:01:11.880> selected<00:01:12.450> I'm<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:12.810> to

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
I've got this chip selected I'm going to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.060 
I've got this chip selected I'm going to
change<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.590> Alpha<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.360> pur<00:01:15.869> 0<00:01:16.070> that'll

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
change the Alpha on it to pur 0 that'll

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.789 
change the Alpha on it to pur 0 that'll
make<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.250> purely<00:01:18.240> transparent<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.259> when<00:01:19.710> you

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
make it purely transparent and when you

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.710 
make it purely transparent and when you
do<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.189> see<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.460> now<00:01:20.580> goes<00:01:20.790> from<00:01:21.030> white

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
do that you see it now goes from white

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.230 
do that you see it now goes from white
one<00:01:22.200> hundred<00:01:22.439> percent<00:01:22.520> transparency<00:01:23.520> to

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
one hundred percent transparency to

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.090 
one hundred percent transparency to
white<00:01:24.890> zero<00:01:25.909> percent<00:01:26.909> opacity<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:28.080> mean<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.530> so

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
white zero percent opacity I mean and so

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.679 
white zero percent opacity I mean and so
since<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.240> zero<00:01:30.479> percent<00:01:30.900> opacity<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:32.689> it's

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
since it's zero percent opacity the it's

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.780 
since it's zero percent opacity the it's
see-through<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:34.920> see<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> checkerboard

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
see-through so we see the checkerboard

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.910 
see-through so we see the checkerboard
or<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.450> grid<00:01:36.689> underneath<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.290> indicating

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
or the grid underneath it indicating

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.100 
or the grid underneath it indicating
that<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.369> see-through<00:01:38.850> now<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.869> new

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
that it's see-through now on this new

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.109 
that it's see-through now on this new
layer<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.650> i<00:01:40.710> have<00:01:41.009> i<00:01:41.250> clicked<00:01:41.520> right<00:01:41.700> here

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
layer that i have i clicked right here

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.810 
layer that i have i clicked right here
to<00:01:42.570> get<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.869> new<00:01:43.079> layer<00:01:43.320> i'm<00:01:43.740> going<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.460> get

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
to get that new layer i'm going to get

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.940 
to get that new layer i'm going to get
my<00:01:46.280> paint<00:01:47.280> bucket<00:01:47.700> or<00:01:47.850> I'll<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:49.140> my<00:01:49.409> instead

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.149 
my paint bucket or I'll get my instead
of<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.100> paint<00:01:50.310> pocket<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.759> will<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:52.560> hold

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
of a paint pocket I will get the hold

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.249 
of a paint pocket I will get the hold
down<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.549> rectangle<00:01:54.060> tool<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.540> get<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.840> Oval

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
down the rectangle tool and get the Oval

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.600 
down the rectangle tool and get the Oval
tool<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:56.329> I'm<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.509> turn<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.899> stroke<00:01:58.610> to

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
tool and I'm going to turn the stroke to

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.810 
tool and I'm going to turn the stroke to
know<00:01:59.909> stroke<00:02:00.270> no<00:02:00.719> outline<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.320> then<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.640> will

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
know stroke no outline and then I will

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.170 
know stroke no outline and then I will
just<00:02:02.969> create<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.630> circle<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:05.490> I'll<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.729> click

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
just create a circle so I'll just click

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.690 
just create a circle so I'll just click
and<00:02:06.360> drag<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.630> circle<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.459> you'll<00:02:08.459> see<00:02:08.670> that

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
and drag a circle and you'll see that

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.969 
and drag a circle and you'll see that
circle<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.780> a

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
circle is a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.750 
circle is a
a<00:02:11.209> gradient<00:02:12.209> from<00:02:12.840> white<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:14.629> see<00:02:15.629> through<00:02:15.930> to

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
a gradient from white to see through to

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.110 
a gradient from white to see through to
peer<00:02:17.760> transparency<00:02:18.420> right<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.909> it's<00:02:20.909> on<00:02:21.090> a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
peer transparency right and it's on a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.199 
peer transparency right and it's on a
separate<00:02:21.480> layer<00:02:21.659> so<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.140> does<00:02:22.349> not<00:02:22.379> ruin<00:02:23.209> the

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
separate layer so it does not ruin the

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.240 
separate layer so it does not ruin the
Apple<00:02:24.720> if<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.049> had<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.379> on<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.680> same<00:02:25.950> layer

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
Apple if I had this on the same layer

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.520 
Apple if I had this on the same layer
I'll<00:02:26.819> just<00:02:27.030> put<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.299> over<00:02:27.480> here<00:02:27.599> so<00:02:27.930> weak<00:02:28.049> for

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
I'll just put this over here so weak for

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.930 
I'll just put this over here so weak for
now<00:02:28.700> if<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:29.879> drew<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.330> same<00:02:30.569> layer<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
now if I drew it on the same layer and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.809 
now if I drew it on the same layer and
deselect<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.319> I<00:02:34.319> drew<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.560> same<00:02:35.040> circle<00:02:35.610> on

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
deselect and I drew that same circle on

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.990 
deselect and I drew that same circle on
the<00:02:35.910> same<00:02:36.150> layer<00:02:36.420> as<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.930> Apple<00:02:37.349> then<00:02:38.129> when<00:02:38.970> i

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
the same layer as the Apple then when i

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.509 
the same layer as the Apple then when i
go<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.239> click<00:02:39.540> on<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.079> move<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.340> see

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
go to click on it and move it you see

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.970 
go to click on it and move it you see
that<00:02:41.700> cut<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> hole<00:02:42.209> right<00:02:42.239> through<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.780> apple

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
that cut a hole right through the apple

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.449 
that cut a hole right through the apple
so<00:02:43.980> i<00:02:44.010> did<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.459> on<00:02:45.470> control-z<00:02:46.470> control<00:02:47.069> Z<00:02:47.280> to

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
so i did this on control-z control Z to

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.839 
so i did this on control-z control Z to
undo<00:02:47.579> on<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.150> separate<00:02:48.930> layer<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:50.069> that<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.670> can

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
undo on a separate layer so that it can

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.030 
undo on a separate layer so that it can
float<00:02:51.150> above<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.870> allow<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.200> transparency

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
float above and allow the transparency

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.680 
float above and allow the transparency
to<00:02:53.129> work<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.700> then<00:02:54.090> I'm<00:02:54.209> going<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.359> change<00:02:54.599> it

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
to work and then I'm going to change it

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.199 
to work and then I'm going to change it
one<00:02:54.810> more<00:02:54.930> time<00:02:55.109> I'm<00:02:55.290> going<00:02:55.379> to<00:02:55.470> select<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:56.209> go

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
one more time I'm going to select it go

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.360 
one more time I'm going to select it go

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.800 
to my color mixer and instead of having
this<00:02:59.549> pure<00:02:59.849> white<00:03:00.090> I'm<00:03:00.269> going<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.450> click<00:03:00.599> on

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
this pure white I'm going to click on

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.509 
this pure white I'm going to click on
the<00:03:00.930> white<00:03:01.109> and<00:03:01.440> I'm<00:03:01.920> going<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.099> change<00:03:02.370> the

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
the white and I'm going to change the

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.880 
the white and I'm going to change the
Alpha<00:03:03.000> down<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.930> 50<00:03:05.840> okay<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:06.900> 50<00:03:07.379> so<00:03:07.560> now<00:03:07.709> it's

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
Alpha down to 50 okay so 50 so now it's

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.740 
Alpha down to 50 okay so 50 so now it's
fifty<00:03:08.310> percent<00:03:08.640> transparent<00:03:09.269> so<00:03:09.599> when<00:03:09.690> I

it looks right but essentially what it
what<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:37.829> is<00:03:38.609> then<00:03:39.239> it's<00:03:39.389> a<00:03:39.510> shine<00:03:39.919> the<00:03:40.919> last

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
what it is then it's a shine the last

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.309 
what it is then it's a shine the last
but<00:03:41.340> not<00:03:41.430> least<00:03:41.489> this<00:03:42.000> blue<00:03:42.359> outlines<00:03:42.900> got<00:03:43.200> to

but not least this blue outlines got to

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.110 
but not least this blue outlines got to
go<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:44.130> I'm<00:03:44.220> going<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.370> double<00:03:44.519> click<00:03:44.700> on<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
will go over to my stroke tool and i'll

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.089 
will go over to my stroke tool and i'll
pick<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.519> maybe<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:56.609> brownish<00:03:57.209> red<00:03:57.530> right<00:03:58.530> color

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
pick a maybe a brownish red right color

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.470 
pick a maybe a brownish red right color
for<00:03:59.400> the<00:04:00.060> line<00:04:00.329> then<00:04:01.319> I'll<00:04:01.500> get<00:04:01.739> my<00:04:02.000> ink<00:04:03.000> bottle

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
for the line then I'll get my ink bottle

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.729 
for the line then I'll get my ink bottle
and<00:04:03.889> on<00:04:04.889> layer<00:04:05.280> 1<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.730> will<00:04:05.910> click<00:04:06.150> here<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.739> put

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
and on layer 1 I will click here and put

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.970 
and on layer 1 I will click here and put
a<00:04:07.980> line<00:04:08.340> around<00:04:08.639> the<00:04:09.030> Apple<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.079> line

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
a line around the Apple and the line

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.150 
a line around the Apple and the line
right<00:04:11.190> there<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.459> too<00:04:11.639> big<00:04:11.879> so<00:04:12.949> undo<00:04:13.949> that

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
right there is too big so undo that

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.270 
right there is too big so undo that
control<00:04:14.669> Z<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.209> I'll<00:04:15.989> change<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.590> size<00:04:17.070> of

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
control Z and I'll change the size of

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.000 
control Z and I'll change the size of
this<00:04:17.370> line<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:18.720> one<00:04:19.409> pixel

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
this line to one pixel

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.190 
this line to one pixel
or<00:04:21.160> I<00:04:21.670> could<00:04:21.880> do<00:04:22.030> a<00:04:22.060> percentage<00:04:22.870> of<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:22.990> pixel

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
or I could do a percentage of a pixel

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.680 
or I could do a percentage of a pixel
let's<00:04:23.560> just<00:04:23.710> do<00:04:23.800> one<00:04:24.040> pixel<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:24.640> then<00:04:25.480> try

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
let's just do one pixel and then try

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.560 
let's just do one pixel and then try
that<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.670> you'll<00:04:27.670> see<00:04:27.850> that<00:04:28.000> that<00:04:28.180> line<00:04:28.420> is

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
that and you'll see that that line is

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.140 
that and you'll see that that line is
light<00:04:29.470> nicer<00:04:29.950> and<00:04:30.160> if<00:04:30.580> i<00:04:30.670> wanted<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:30.970> i<00:04:31.060> could

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
light nicer and if i wanted to i could

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.640 
light nicer and if i wanted to i could
pick<00:04:31.420> a<00:04:31.480> slightly<00:04:32.250> deeper<00:04:33.250> color<00:04:33.810> by<00:04:34.810> double

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
pick a slightly deeper color by double

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.120 
pick a slightly deeper color by double
clicking<00:04:35.680> here<00:04:36.400> click<00:04:37.000> on<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.210> color<00:04:37.390> wheel

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
clicking here click on the color wheel

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.730 
clicking here click on the color wheel
take<00:04:39.130> that<00:04:39.340> darker<00:04:40.200> lots<00:04:41.200> of<00:04:41.350> ways<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:41.500> work

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
take that darker lots of ways to work

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.690 
take that darker lots of ways to work
with<00:04:41.890> color<00:04:42.130> here<00:04:42.990> click<00:04:43.990> OK<00:04:44.140> and<00:04:44.650> then<00:04:44.710> click

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
with color here click OK and then click

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.150 
with color here click OK and then click
and<00:04:46.410> that'll<00:04:47.410> make<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.650> line<00:04:47.830> a<00:04:47.860> little<00:04:48.010> bit

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
and that'll make the line a little bit

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.070 
and that'll make the line a little bit
darker<00:04:48.840> all<00:04:49.840> right<00:04:50.350> so<00:04:50.620> that's<00:04:50.740> pretty<00:04:51.040> good

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
darker all right so that's pretty good

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.480 
darker all right so that's pretty good
now<00:04:53.080> last<00:04:53.350> but<00:04:53.470> not<00:04:53.650> least<00:04:53.710> we<00:04:54.100> need<00:04:54.130> to<00:04:54.310> add<00:04:54.460> a

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
now last but not least we need to add a

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.950 
now last but not least we need to add a
shadow<00:04:55.320> underneath<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.890> apple<00:04:57.790> so<00:04:58.630> for<00:04:58.840> that

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
shadow underneath the apple so for that

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.520 
shadow underneath the apple so for that
what<00:04:59.170> I'll<00:04:59.320> do<00:04:59.560> is<00:04:59.800> I'll<00:04:59.830> select<00:05:00.670> the<00:05:00.880> Apple

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
what I'll do is I'll select the Apple

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:08.070 
what I'll do is I'll select the Apple
and<00:05:02.530> I'll<00:05:02.970> copy<00:05:03.970> it<00:05:04.180> and<00:05:04.360> paste<00:05:05.260> it<00:05:06.900> all<00:05:07.900> right

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
and I'll copy it and paste it all right

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.800 
and I'll copy it and paste it all right
and<00:05:08.290> actually<00:05:09.070> I'm<00:05:09.970> going<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.240> paste<00:05:10.420> it<00:05:10.630> on<00:05:10.780> a

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
and actually I'm going to paste it on a

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.990 
and actually I'm going to paste it on a
separate<00:05:11.200> layer<00:05:11.380> so<00:05:12.040> I'll<00:05:12.190> do<00:05:12.340> undo<00:05:12.730> here

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
separate layer so I'll do undo here

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.960 
separate layer so I'll do undo here
control-z<00:05:14.340> control<00:05:15.340> Z<00:05:16.140> copy<00:05:17.140> it<00:05:17.380> again<00:05:17.940> make<00:05:18.940> a

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
control-z control Z copy it again make a

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.250 
control-z control Z copy it again make a
new<00:05:19.270> layer<00:05:19.480> and<00:05:20.460> then<00:05:21.460> paste<00:05:21.790> it<00:05:22.140> and<00:05:23.140> I'm

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
new layer and then paste it and I'm

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.630 
new layer and then paste it and I'm
going<00:05:23.380> to<00:05:23.410> change<00:05:23.650> the<00:05:23.800> color<00:05:24.010> to<00:05:24.100> just<00:05:24.400> let's

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
going to change the color to just let's

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.270 
going to change the color to just let's
say<00:05:26.340> black<00:05:27.340> to<00:05:27.640> start<00:05:27.700> with<00:05:28.500> alright<00:05:29.500> so<00:05:29.980> there

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
say black to start with alright so there

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.710 
say black to start with alright so there
it<00:05:30.370> is<00:05:30.430> and<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:32.670> will<00:05:33.670> select<00:05:33.880> it<00:05:34.270> get<00:05:34.570> my

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
it is and I will select it get my

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.660 
it is and I will select it get my
transform<00:05:35.350> tool<00:05:35.850> and<00:05:37.740> I'm<00:05:38.740> going<00:05:39.130> to<00:05:39.340> squash

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
transform tool and I'm going to squash

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.700 
transform tool and I'm going to squash
it<00:05:41.190> pull<00:05:42.190> it<00:05:42.220> like<00:05:42.430> this<00:05:43.290> pull<00:05:44.290> it<00:05:44.380> like<00:05:44.530> that

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
it pull it like this pull it like that

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.030 
it pull it like this pull it like that
and<00:05:44.980> now<00:05:45.100> have<00:05:45.280> a<00:05:45.310> shadow<00:05:45.580> just<00:05:46.570> take<00:05:47.350> that<00:05:47.650> put

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
and now have a shadow just take that put

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.410 
and now have a shadow just take that put
it<00:05:48.100> here<00:05:49.170> right<00:05:50.170> there's<00:05:50.500> my<00:05:50.710> shadow<00:05:51.010> I<00:05:51.420> can

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
it here right there's my shadow I can

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.280 
it here right there's my shadow I can
make<00:05:53.230> it<00:05:53.410> sit<00:05:53.620> down<00:05:53.770> some<00:05:54.040> more<00:05:55.020> press<00:05:56.020> down

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
make it sit down some more press down

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.620 
make it sit down some more press down
some<00:05:56.560> more<00:05:56.740> and<00:05:57.130> the<00:05:58.120> other<00:05:58.270> thing<00:05:58.330> that<00:05:58.480> I

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
some more and the other thing that I

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.490 
some more and the other thing that I
could<00:05:58.870> do<00:05:59.140> to<00:05:59.170> it<00:05:59.470> is<00:05:59.730> I<00:06:01.110> could<00:06:02.110> take<00:06:02.290> this

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
could do to it is I could take this

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.400 
could do to it is I could take this
shadow<00:06:02.830> this<00:06:03.340> layer<00:06:03.670> anyway<00:06:04.390> and<00:06:04.630> I<00:06:05.170> need<00:06:05.320> to

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
shadow this layer anyway and I need to

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.710 
shadow this layer anyway and I need to
drag<00:06:05.650> this<00:06:05.830> layer<00:06:06.070> below<00:06:06.340> layer<00:06:06.820> 1<00:06:07.120> so<00:06:07.570> I'll

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
drag this layer below layer 1 so I'll

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.230 
drag this layer below layer 1 so I'll
just<00:06:07.780> drag<00:06:08.110> that<00:06:08.170> layer<00:06:08.530> down<00:06:08.770> and<00:06:09.100> so<00:06:10.030> now<00:06:10.060> the

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
just drag that layer down and so now the

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.160 
just drag that layer down and so now the
shadow<00:06:10.660> is<00:06:10.810> behind<00:06:11.500> and<00:06:12.390> if<00:06:13.390> i<00:06:13.690> needed<00:06:13.900> to<00:06:14.140> i

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.170 
shadow is behind and if i needed to i

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.250 
shadow is behind and if i needed to i
could<00:06:14.320> modify<00:06:14.920> the<00:06:15.100> shadow<00:06:15.460> with<00:06:15.760> the<00:06:15.790> shape

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
could modify the shadow with the shape

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.520 
could modify the shadow with the shape
whatnot<00:06:17.260> so<00:06:18.570> let's<00:06:19.570> see<00:06:19.720> here<00:06:19.930> if<00:06:20.020> I<00:06:20.080> needed<00:06:20.350> to

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
whatnot so let's see here if I needed to

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.840 
whatnot so let's see here if I needed to

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.360 
any types of modifications on my shadow
I<00:06:29.500> could<00:06:29.680> just<00:06:29.890> pull<00:06:30.280> it<00:06:30.430> do<00:06:30.760> that

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
I could just pull it do that

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.920 
I could just pull it do that
alright<00:06:33.370> last<00:06:33.999> but<00:06:34.120> not<00:06:34.300> least<00:06:34.360> I<00:06:34.629> can<00:06:34.779> make

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
alright last but not least I can make

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.549 
alright last but not least I can make
this<00:06:35.080> shadow<00:06:35.349> see-through<00:06:35.939> so<00:06:37.169> if<00:06:38.169> I<00:06:38.259> open<00:06:38.499> up

00:06:38.549 --> 00:06:38.559 
this shadow see-through so if I open up

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:41.249 
this shadow see-through so if I open up
my<00:06:38.620> color<00:06:38.949> mixer<00:06:39.370> from<00:06:40.150> a<00:06:40.300> solid<00:06:40.509> black<00:06:40.900> I

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:41.259 
my color mixer from a solid black I

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:43.559 
my color mixer from a solid black I
could<00:06:41.529> change<00:06:41.770> the<00:06:41.979> gradient<00:06:42.219> to<00:06:42.999> a<00:06:43.029> linear

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:43.569 
could change the gradient to a linear

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:51.200 
could change the gradient to a linear
gradient<00:06:44.259> with<00:06:45.249> one<00:06:45.969> side<00:06:46.889> being<00:06:47.889> black<00:06:48.779> at

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
gradient with one side being black at

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.679 
gradient with one side being black at
let's<00:06:52.210> say<00:06:52.479> eighty<00:06:53.139> percent<00:06:53.650> opacity<00:06:54.689> right

00:06:55.679 --> 00:06:55.689 
let's say eighty percent opacity right

00:06:55.689 --> 00:07:01.110 
let's say eighty percent opacity right
and<00:06:55.900> the<00:06:56.680> other<00:06:56.710> side<00:06:57.659> could<00:06:58.659> also<00:06:59.319> be<00:07:00.120> black

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
and the other side could also be black

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.719 
and the other side could also be black
at<00:07:03.360> let's<00:07:04.360> say<00:07:04.599> twenty<00:07:04.930> percent<00:07:05.229> opacity<00:07:05.729> so

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:06.729 
at let's say twenty percent opacity so

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:07.980 
at let's say twenty percent opacity so
now<00:07:06.879> what<00:07:07.060> you<00:07:07.150> have<00:07:07.180> is<00:07:07.389> you<00:07:07.810> have<00:07:07.839> a

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
now what you have is you have a

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:14.040 
now what you have is you have a
see-through<00:07:08.699> shadow<00:07:09.699> and<00:07:12.389> I'll<00:07:13.389> change<00:07:13.839> the

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
see-through shadow and I'll change the

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.959 
see-through shadow and I'll change the
opacity<00:07:14.139> here<00:07:14.919> on<00:07:15.009> this<00:07:15.129> chip<00:07:15.430> more<00:07:15.699> to<00:07:15.819> like

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:15.969 
opacity here on this chip more to like

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:23.040 
opacity here on this chip more to like
fifty<00:07:16.419> percent<00:07:18.270> and<00:07:20.580> one<00:07:21.580> more<00:07:21.789> time<00:07:22.029> in<00:07:22.810> this

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.050 
fifty percent and one more time in this

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.320 
fifty percent and one more time in this
one<00:07:23.319> I'll<00:07:23.919> make<00:07:24.279> it<00:07:24.430> a<00:07:24.460> hundred<00:07:24.669> percent<00:07:25.270> right

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
one I'll make it a hundred percent right

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.629 
one I'll make it a hundred percent right
there<00:07:25.689> so<00:07:26.379> it's<00:07:26.560> black<00:07:26.830> and<00:07:27.069> then<00:07:27.159> I<00:07:27.249> can<00:07:27.399> drag

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 
there so it's black and then I can drag

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:31.670 
there so it's black and then I can drag
this<00:07:27.819> over<00:07:28.120> so<00:07:29.050> the<00:07:29.199> black<00:07:29.409> is<00:07:29.770> much<00:07:30.129> stronger

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 
this over so the black is much stronger

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.529 
this over so the black is much stronger
right<00:07:32.680> and<00:07:32.919> then<00:07:33.490> deselect<00:07:33.699> by<00:07:34.180> clicking<00:07:34.479> on

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:34.539 
right and then deselect by clicking on

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:36.529 
right and then deselect by clicking on
the<00:07:34.599> background<00:07:34.779> and<00:07:35.169> there's<00:07:35.800> my<00:07:35.979> shadow

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:36.539 
the background and there's my shadow

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.909 
the background and there's my shadow
once<00:07:37.539> again<00:07:37.689> I<00:07:37.870> could<00:07:38.110> get<00:07:38.289> the<00:07:38.319> transform

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919 
once again I could get the transform

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:43.230 
once again I could get the transform
tool<00:07:39.659> play<00:07:40.659> with<00:07:40.870> the<00:07:40.990> shape<00:07:41.669> until<00:07:42.669> I'm<00:07:42.939> happy

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 
tool play with the shape until I'm happy

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.260 
tool play with the shape until I'm happy
with<00:07:43.360> it<00:07:43.710> and<00:07:44.710> what's<00:07:44.889> nice<00:07:45.009> about<00:07:45.069> this<00:07:45.520> is<00:07:45.580> if

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.270 
with it and what's nice about this is if

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.059 
with it and what's nice about this is if
I<00:07:46.539> wish<00:07:46.719> to<00:07:46.749> change<00:07:47.050> the<00:07:47.259> background<00:07:47.409> and<00:07:47.919> the

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:48.069 
I wish to change the background and the

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:50.010 
I wish to change the background and the
shadow<00:07:48.279> see<00:07:48.639> through<00:07:48.939> change<00:07:49.719> the<00:07:49.870> background

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.020 
shadow see through change the background

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.629 
shadow see through change the background
color<00:07:50.319> to<00:07:51.629> a<00:07:52.629> green<00:07:53.129> you'll<00:07:54.129> see<00:07:54.339> that<00:07:54.490> the

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 
color to a green you'll see that the

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:57.329 
color to a green you'll see that the
see-through<00:07:55.449> shadow<00:07:55.749> blends<00:07:56.379> in<00:07:56.709> with<00:07:57.279> the

00:07:57.329 --> 00:07:57.339 
see-through shadow blends in with the
