00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello everyone I hope you go 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.330
 well I find you today for 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.309
 a new video aperitif dinner with 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.790
 four little ideas that can be 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.340
 reproduced for Christmas so first 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.549
 we will make carrot soup with 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.549
 the orange 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.930
 then small endive glasses with 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.930
 smoked salmon 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:31.859
 then rostit with smoked salmon and 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.340
 to finish wings and pestles of 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.890
 caramelized chicken so let's start 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.780
 by the recipe of velvety carrots to 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.070
 the orange 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.850
 to do this we will need three 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.420
 carrots about 600 g of carrots 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.090
 a water orange 20 centilitres with 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.840
 a chicken broth of oil 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:04.430
 of olive a clove of salt garlic from 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:08.610
 pepper and cumin we will start with 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.070
 wash and peel the carrots and 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.689
 peel the cloves of garlic we will cut 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.110
 the carrots in very very big 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.750
 washers that we will cook with 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.250
 the minced garlic clove so either in the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.409
 thermomix with a little oil either in 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.360
 a saucepan also with a small 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.310
 little oil for five six minutes 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.140
 just history of walleye and give a 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.900
 little taste of garlic with carrots 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.250
 we will press an orange so me for 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.439
 press laurent I do not break my head 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.829
 I cut my orange in half and I 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.009
 learn it in my hands I squeeze it 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.970
 until all the liquid come out 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.340
 so after five minutes we go 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.579
 add the chicken broth the juice 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.560
 of an orange salt and pepper in the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.280
 thermomix we will cook 20 minutes 100 Â° 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.439
 speed 1 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.270
 or so in the closed pan you 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.540
 cook for twenty a 25 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.250
 minutes over a medium fire then you 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.619
 mix with the thermomix or with 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.479
 the blender plunging and put in the 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.880
 verrines this is really not very 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.819
 complicated it's very good warm or hot 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.030
 cold I do not recommend 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:14.240
 let's go then to the verrines 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.130
 salmon and endive is a recipe 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.370
 very simple for which we will need 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.440
 an endive of salmon cheese 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.870
 racing souls about three big 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.670
 tablespoons of fresh cream from 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.160
 salt and pepper 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.920
 a little milk if necessary we will 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.680
 start by doing so do the 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.330
 cream sauce with cream of 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.420
 life in Serbian and possibly milk 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.530
 to have a better smoothness and 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.900
 put it in the bottom of the verrines 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.910
 we will then cut the endive into 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.610
 removing the heart of Monday this is the 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.190
 the most bitter part we will cut it in 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.450
 very little straps so 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.070
 that we can put a dozen 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.489
 thongs by verrines 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.470
 so we'll put it in the verrines 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.019
 then we will isolate ourselves into small 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.230
 squares our smoked salmon we're going 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.670
 add to the verrines 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.290
 that's what we're going to add 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.030
 chives 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.370
 annette the gemmi in this case a 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.930
 little bit of chives and we're going to 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.280
 put in the fridge the little trick is 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.140
 that I put in the boxes of 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.209
 verrines like that it takes no place 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.030
 in the fridge and it allows to be stored 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:28.310
 very very easily until the moment of 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.570
 serve so let's go to the ngo rostit or 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.380
 salmon potatoes 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.930
 so we will come to the help of a robot and 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.120
 soft toys and finally not peeled how one 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.980
 call it rappe and that's 400 g of 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.880
 potatoes 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.000
 that's what it gives with a 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.549
 paper towels we will absorb the excess water 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.720
 excess moisture so that at the level of 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.780
 cooking it gets lost a little bit 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.450
 the less we will add 15 g of butter 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.500
 melted and a little bit of dill 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:00.769
 we will stir everything and we will do 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.560
 small piles that we will deposit in 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.060
 a hot pan with a small bottom 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.220
 oil 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.220
 here we leave the potatoes leather 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.500
 rather slowly that it softens 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.660
 here we go back here is that 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.579
 given 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.169
 so it takes about 4 to 5 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.430
 minutes per face on a medium fire 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.889
 then we will put using a 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.129
 sleeve pocket of 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.349
 cream on every little rostit that's and 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:31.840
 then finally drop some small ones 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:36.249
 salmon strips is sprinkled one more 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.469
 little bit of dill so not feel all of 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:41.430
 following our last recipe so the 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:43.840
 caramelized chicken wings and drumsticks 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.370
 so I did not hurt to have 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:51.550
 a little bit of rest so he 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:54.849
 will take a kilo of honey chicken 350 g 6 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.150
 tablespoons of soy sauce and 2 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:01.150
 cloves of garlic 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.129
 we will start by putting 350 g of 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.870
 honey the six tablespoons of sauce 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:08.909
 soy and two cloves of chopped garlic 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:12.340
 in a saucepan until boiling 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:15.539
 when that boils we will come to nap christmas and 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.539
 pestle of this preparation 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.759
 that's up to almost 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.249
 all 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:26.229
 we're going a little bit stirred up so that all 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:36.279
 the chicken parts by themselves 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:40.960
 soaked so we'll cover everything 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:42.879
 an aluminum foil the 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.310
 put in the fridge for a minimum of one hour 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.860
 four five hours being the ideal and 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.719
 then we will put it at 200 degrees 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.300
 for an hour in the oven without touching 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:54.009
 the sheet of aluminum foil 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.830
 after those twenty minutes we put it on the 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:59.139
 grill either dufour or barbecue and one 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.939
 just let golden caramelized chicken 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.930
 until it is ready 4-5 minutes 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:06.789
 are largely sufficient 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.169
 and that's what it gives so that's it for 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.879
 the four recipes of this aperitif 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.009

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:12.399
 video will have pleased you will have given you some 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:14.409
 ideas 

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:15.909
 I will try to redo one before 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:16.689
 Christmas I will not promise you anything I will 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.229
