the edges of the paper so the front on

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:08.450 
the edges of the paper so the front on
the<00:00:58.820> side<00:00:59.000> in<00:00:59.150> the<00:00:59.210> back

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.530 

once<00:01:09.460> you're<00:01:09.579> done<00:01:09.670> with<00:01:09.729> that<00:01:09.880> you<00:01:10.299> want<00:01:10.390> to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540

once you're done with that you want to
put<00:01:10.780> a<00:01:11.079> couple<00:01:11.619> really<00:01:11.710> heavy<00:01:12.009> books<00:01:12.280> on<00:01:12.670> top

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
put a couple really heavy books on top

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.120 
put a couple really heavy books on top
of<00:01:13.270> this<00:01:13.600> book<00:01:13.869> so<00:01:14.229> that<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.500> pages<00:01:14.799> stick

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
of this book so that the pages stick

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.719 
of this book so that the pages stick
together<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:17.290> you<00:01:17.470> want<00:01:17.680> to<00:01:17.740> put<00:01:18.009> a<00:01:18.070> spacer<00:01:18.610> in

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
between the cover and the first pages

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.560 
between the cover and the first pages
that<00:01:20.979> you<00:01:21.070> started<00:01:21.340> gluing<00:01:21.520> so<00:01:21.850> that<00:01:21.970> the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
that you started gluing so that the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.820 
that you started gluing so that the
cover<00:01:22.780> doesn't<00:01:22.960> stick<00:01:23.289> to<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.500> rest<00:01:23.649> of<00:01:23.740> the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
cover doesn't stick to the rest of the

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.830 
cover doesn't stick to the rest of the
books<00:01:23.979> so<00:01:24.220> I'm<00:01:24.340> using<00:01:24.520> this<00:01:24.850> little<00:01:25.060> packet<00:01:25.750> of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
books so I'm using this little packet of

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.320 
books so I'm using this little packet of
blood<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.490> then<00:01:27.670> I'm<00:01:27.789> just<00:01:27.880> gonna<00:01:28.030> sit<00:01:28.299> a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
blood and then I'm just gonna sit a

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.109 
blood and then I'm just gonna sit a
couple<00:01:28.530> encyclopedias<00:01:29.530> on<00:01:29.679> top<00:01:29.939> now<00:01:30.939> what's

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
couple encyclopedias on top now what's

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.179 
couple encyclopedias on top now what's
the<00:01:31.210> bedside<00:01:31.539> for<00:01:31.570> about<00:01:31.960> an<00:01:32.320> hour<00:01:32.439> or<00:01:32.710> two<00:01:32.920> and

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
the bedside for about an hour or two and

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.580 
the bedside for about an hour or two and
then<00:01:33.520> once<00:01:34.090> that's<00:01:34.659> done<00:01:34.869> drying<00:01:35.229> put<00:01:35.560> a

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
then once that's done drying put a

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.289 
then once that's done drying put a
second<00:01:35.890> coat<00:01:35.920> on<00:01:36.159> this<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.429> be<00:01:36.520> safe<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:37.030> next

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
second coat on this to be safe the next

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.760 
second coat on this to be safe the next
step<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:37.659> to<00:01:37.869> measure<00:01:38.020> out<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.259> dimensions

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
step is to measure out the dimensions

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.039 
step is to measure out the dimensions
that<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.009> want<00:01:39.159> to<00:01:39.250> opening<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.729> be<00:01:39.880> so<00:01:40.840> I'm

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
that you want to opening to be so I'm

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.480 
that you want to opening to be so I'm
just<00:01:41.229> going<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.409> measure<00:01:41.590> out<00:01:41.890> half<00:01:42.190> an<00:01:42.369> inch

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
just going to measure out half an inch

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.889 
just going to measure out half an inch
from<00:01:42.580> all<00:01:42.789> four<00:01:43.000> sides<00:01:43.030> of<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.420> book<00:01:43.569> and<00:01:43.780> then

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
from all four sides of the book and then

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:59.789 
from all four sides of the book and then
cut<00:01:44.170> out<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.319> middle<00:01:58.020> all<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.140> have<00:01:59.259> to<00:01:59.380> do<00:01:59.530> is

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
cut out the middle all you have to do is

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:00.990 
cut out the middle all you have to do is
start<00:02:00.039> cutting<00:02:00.130> at<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.610> lines<00:02:00.789> that<00:02:00.880> we

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
start cutting at the lines that we

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.940 
start cutting at the lines that we
measured<00:02:01.360> out<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.750> then<00:02:02.049> pulling<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.619> pages

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
measured out and then pulling the pages

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:17.430 
measured out and then pulling the pages
free<00:02:03.159> once<00:02:03.369> they're<00:02:03.580> cut<00:02:03.759> loose

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.140
