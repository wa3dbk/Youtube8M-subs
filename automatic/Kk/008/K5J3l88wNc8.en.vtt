00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 we talk about travel I love traveling 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.240
 ie only each time whenever 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.519
 birth comes to me comes as a fear 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.040
 no and it is always the same fear because I 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.160
 I swear to you that if I was leaving for 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.279
 three months for the borneo forest where 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.949
 there are poisonous monkeys there will be and 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.840
 cimino utilities of poisonous snakes 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.359
 definitely cannibals parasites armed 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.680
 of a rope and a stone 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.510
 I swear to you that my biggest fear 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.189
 it wouldn't be the one to die mine the most 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.380
 big fear would be to 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.300
 meet three Pisans dressed a lot 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.100
 very well looking for a disco 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:46.559
 in the borneo forest because they want to 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:48.390
 fuck you feel that little girl that there 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.700
 you know where a bit of movement is 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.469
 how much 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.539
 a disco 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:01:00.739
 because they told us it will be a 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:07.159
 headed for the swamp we went 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:10.009
 but there is only mud because of us though 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:22.159
 we have been told that in any case that is the 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:25.150
 annibale son pig maybe a blowjob from 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.650
 annibale to have done 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.000
 and so this would be mine more 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.800
 big fear of all because the boy 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.450
 sighted worse than Italians in Italy 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.550
 there are only Italians abroad it is 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.200
 I wish a terrifying thing 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.620
 first of all the absolute thing 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.230
 ugly uglier than all of them 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.120
 recognized by another Italian when 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.380
 you're abroad because maybe it happens to you 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.820
 understood that you are you are understood you are 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.050
 at the table talking to people you are 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.910
 party you're talking to us in a certain way 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.850
 point but you turn and see that there is one 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:02:06.700
 that is watching you and watching you 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:09.479
 in this way the panic cuts though 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.990
 then I discovered a way discovered 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.340
 there is a sentence I tell you a big turning point 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.230
 you have to look at it must do so 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:24.220
 we are not Italians we are Sardinians 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.070
 pippa works perfectly speech 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.000
 what is the Italian when it starts not 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.890
 realizes that he is going to another 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.360
 place he wants to find us all again 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.739
 we want to find a little bit of Italy 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.940
 in the place where we go 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.010
 and that is why he is an Italian yes 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.230
 located in Mexico City and discovers that 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.209
 no you will not be able to put parmesan on 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.380
 orecchiette in Mexico City because 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.750
 accepted months that have no idea of 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.180
 less of what it is nor the Parmesan in the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.080
 orecchiette and the Italian is disappointed 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.790
 I call it the Lindt Rom and the Dome 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.260
 and from the dome numbers what is the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.910
 koponen syndrome in the dome system a 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.530
 that thing for which we are good 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.030
 probability that wherever you are in 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.280
 any part of the world to meet 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:10.530
 a person in front of a monument in 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:10.530
 this attitude here for charity 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.170
 beautiful, but the wonder is fabi 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.160
 but to us to know cupolone but what the fuck there 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.459
 no rubbing of Buckingham Palace was born in 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.459
 low
