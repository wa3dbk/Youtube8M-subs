the<00:01:05.810> mic<00:01:05.990> in<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.470> orient<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:06.979> capsules<00:01:07.490> so

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
the mic in and orient the capsules so

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.910

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
toward the right to fix that you simply

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.440 
toward the right to fix that you simply
turn<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:18.979> bass<00:01:19.160> 90<00:01:19.580> degrees<00:01:19.940> and<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:20.300> actually

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
turn the bass 90 degrees and it actually

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.870 
turn the bass 90 degrees and it actually
clicks<00:01:20.899> satisfyingly<00:01:21.679> into<00:01:22.069> place<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.610> then

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
clicks satisfyingly into place and then

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.300 
clicks satisfyingly into place and then
you'll<00:01:23.060> rotate<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:23.720> ball<00:01:23.929> itself<00:01:24.500> 90<00:01:24.950> degrees

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
you'll rotate the ball itself 90 degrees

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.100 
you'll rotate the ball itself 90 degrees
and<00:01:25.550> it<00:01:25.700> will<00:01:25.789> also<00:01:25.970> click<00:01:26.390> into<00:01:26.599> place<00:01:26.840> and

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
and it will also click into place and

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.499 
and it will also click into place and
now<00:01:27.140> your<00:01:27.649> mics<00:01:27.920> are<00:01:28.250> oriented<00:01:28.880> in<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.119> proper

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
now your mics are oriented in the proper

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.870 
now your mics are oriented in the proper
direction<00:01:29.660> facing<00:01:30.649> your<00:01:30.740> subject<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.490> rather

headphones now one thing I want to point
out<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.660> that<00:03:14.690> mid<00:03:15.080> side<00:03:15.470> recording<00:03:16.070> is

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
out is that mid side recording is

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.030 
out is that mid side recording is
completely<00:03:16.700> mono<00:03:17.320> compatible<00:03:18.320> so<00:03:18.560> that<00:03:18.710> helps

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
completely mono compatible so that helps

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.980 
completely mono compatible so that helps
them<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.280> avoid<00:03:19.640> potential<00:03:20.180> base<00:03:20.450> problems

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
them to avoid potential base problems

that you might get when stereo

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.400 
that you might get when stereo
