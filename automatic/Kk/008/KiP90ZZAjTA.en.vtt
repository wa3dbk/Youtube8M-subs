00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.369 
be curious I mean this is I got the same
team<00:00:15.089> name<00:00:15.389> but<00:00:15.630> it's<00:00:15.750> not<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.900> same<00:00:15.990> team

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
team name but it's not the same team

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.040

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
have the same team but we probably still

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.970 
have the same team but we probably still
be<00:00:20.760> there<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.689> it's<00:00:22.529> totally<00:00:22.859> different

has<00:01:56.880> been<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.060> little<00:01:57.300> spotty<00:01:57.510> for<00:01:57.780> us<00:01:57.930> i<00:01:58.140> know

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
has been a little spotty for us i know

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.410 
has been a little spotty for us i know
for<00:01:58.680> me<00:01:58.800> personally<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.610> being<00:02:00.119> consistent

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
for me personally just being consistent

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.960 
for me personally just being consistent
with<00:02:00.690> my<00:02:00.840> shop<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.320> making<00:02:02.310> sure<00:02:02.430> i'm<00:02:02.580> taking

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
with my shop and making sure i'm taking

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.390 
with my shop and making sure i'm taking
and<00:02:03.090> making<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.450> good<00:02:03.720> shot<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.190> put<00:02:05.340> it

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
and making a good shot so we can put it

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.580 
and making a good shot so we can put it
all<00:02:05.580> together<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.810> 48<00:02:07.200> minutes<00:02:07.350> i<00:02:07.560> think

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
all together for 48 minutes i think

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.810 
all together for 48 minutes i think
that's<00:02:07.920> when<00:02:08.100> we<00:02:08.160> will<00:02:08.280> start<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.580> get<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
that's when we will start to get the

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.999 
that's when we will start to get the
result<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:09.600> again<00:02:09.869> our<00:02:09.899> effort<00:02:10.350> has<00:02:10.470> been<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
result but again our effort has been and

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.310 
result but again our effort has been and
that's<00:02:11.370> what<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.730> ?<00:02:12.060> was<00:02:12.630> early<00:02:13.020> in<00:02:13.050> we<00:02:13.230> were

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
we go back to dallas which we will do in

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.320 
we go back to dallas which we will do in
Mars<00:02:32.160> be<00:02:32.310> worse<00:02:32.459> then<00:02:32.790> it'll<00:02:33.060> be<00:02:33.150> different

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
Mars be worse then it'll be different

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.150 
Mars be worse then it'll be different
yeah<00:02:34.080> they've<00:02:34.260> been<00:02:34.290> watching<00:02:34.530> all<00:02:34.800> season

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
yeah they've been watching all season

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.449 
yeah they've been watching all season
though<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.280> mean<00:02:35.550> they<00:02:35.640> got<00:02:35.790> lead<00:02:36.060> pass<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:38.040> but

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
though I mean they got lead pass so but

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.770 
though I mean they got lead pass so but
I<00:02:38.489> think<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.880> would<00:02:38.970> be<00:02:39.060> more<00:02:39.090> special<00:02:39.510> when

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
I think it would be more special when

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.449 
I think it would be more special when
I'm<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.049> their<00:02:40.260> building<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:40.799> their<00:02:41.190> arena

I'm in their building in their arena

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.160 
I'm in their building in their arena
then<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:42.540> we'll<00:02:42.690> have<00:02:42.780> something<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.110> talk
