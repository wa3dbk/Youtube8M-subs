00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
the tires off and the front right wheel

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.060 
the tires off and the front right wheel
will<00:01:04.680> come<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> rear<00:01:06.590> at<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.740> point<00:01:07.979> you

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
will come to the rear at that point you

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.130 
will come to the rear at that point you
can<00:01:08.220> remove<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.909> put<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.750> front<00:01:10.049> right

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
can remove this one put the front right

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.350 
can remove this one put the front right
there<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.880> actually<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> make<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
there and actually going to make this a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.380 
there and actually going to make this a
little<00:01:12.479> simpler<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.960> show<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> diagram

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
little simpler and show you the diagram

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.719 
little simpler and show you the diagram
indicates<00:01:15.390> what<00:01:15.720> goes<00:01:15.990> where<00:01:17.630> like<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.729> so

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
indicates what goes where like so so

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.190 
indicates what goes where like so so
basically<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> front<00:01:21.420> tires<00:01:21.600> go<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> rear

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
basically the front tires go to the rear

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.840 
basically the front tires go to the rear
and<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> rear<00:01:22.619> tires<00:01:22.860> crossover<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.670> go<00:01:23.790> to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
and the rear tires crossover and go to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.820 
and the rear tires crossover and go to
the<00:01:24.030> front<00:01:24.299> now<00:01:25.110> once<00:01:25.320> you're<00:01:25.439> done<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the front now once you're done with the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.819 
the front now once you're done with the
right<00:01:25.979> side<00:01:26.869> I'm<00:01:27.869> gonna<00:01:28.020> go<00:01:28.229> ahead<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.530> place

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
right side I'm gonna go ahead and place

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.210 
right side I'm gonna go ahead and place
jack<00:01:29.220> stand<00:01:29.689> in<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> front<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
jack stand in the front right with the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.160 
jack stand in the front right with the
wheel<00:01:32.369> removed<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> jack<00:01:34.140> stand

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
wheel removed you can get a jack stand

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.460 
wheel removed you can get a jack stand
in<00:01:34.650> here<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.670> steering<00:01:36.000> knuckle<00:01:36.409> see<00:01:37.409> if
