00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.150
 The attitude of the left hand differs in optics numbers 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.780
 quite different from the classic guitarist 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.129
 classic interests of Linda Bohrmann behind the scenes will 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.669
 and the fingers are put on the rock guitar 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:18.019
 you attack 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.810
 very often across the hall 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.789
 with your thumb and fingers to do it differently 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.069
 he has 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.389
 that is, it is a very different game technique as opposed to the majority 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.350
 hahahaha 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.350
 that is late 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.320
 There he finds 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 Dr 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.990
 with them is happy to bring in a position at now on this point 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.740
 her neck touches a bottom and then you can see the vibrato 50 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.660
 To run 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.680
 and also that makes pages pretty much easier for half a year because it just 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.680
 intervene 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.090
 the circle position Bislich in the middle between two and small town but 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.060
 Bed which shifted towards pickups 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.980
 not so far that the side is fought because if you go too far 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.980
 grips thanks to the tone 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.230
 the arts UdK just behind the desire of the city 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.230
 In the middle of the town you have to spend too much strength 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.050
 in the direction of the Bund move pieces 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.409
 This old custom is not to be firmly suppressed if he is precise 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.620
 just 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.620
 because if the presses too tightly adjusted the page safely 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.570
 It is said only as firmly as was absolutely necessary 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.810
 the Swedes important is a synchronous play of right and left 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.430
 the left hand of the stop Moses at the exact moment embrace that 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.620
 to drive 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.620
 when changing two tones 8 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.419
 what exactly will not help right now 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:14.269
 the note is struck 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.269
 if you start too early Kings Road 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.669
 a 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:29.369
 with which the circle is so ARA Harari that means in both cases Wittmann 2 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:31.859
 2-end stand 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.949
 Right and left have to work so well 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.429
 only one sound is heard at a time 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:42.799
 Arcor is correct too 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.290
 not a hole is created 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.310
 in which the left hand and then jump I understand that it is not that way 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:03:02.029
 Soy be possible that the increase in wounds will be so percent AR 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:03.869
 AR
