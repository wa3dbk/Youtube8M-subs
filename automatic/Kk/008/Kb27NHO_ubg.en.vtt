00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:07.140
 Hello, my name is Maria, I am here to tell you about the introduction of ASMR. 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.620
 This is a spontaneous 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.420
 Passing the feeling 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.620
 Spontaneous perception of meridian response 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.240
 When you hear a unique soft voice, you will feel a pleasant tingling. 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.280
 Or hear some comforting voice 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.380
 Tapping 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Or something else 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.120
 Like my whispers and combing your hair 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.920
 Or give you a scalp massage 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.760
 Blowing 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.600
 I can use this brush on your face. 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.140
 One cheek 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.120
 And your ears. 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.300
 Or the other cheek 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 Another ear 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.080
 This stinging feeling is pleasant 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.260
 It starts at the back of your head. 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.369
 Then travel down your spine and limbs. 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.978
 Relax and give you a sense of well-being 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.220
 We believe that everyone has the ability to experience it. 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.869
 This is just a matter of finding the sound that triggers you to produce this feeling. 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.869
 Fortunately, in ASMR, the choices in the world are endless.
