an 87 I believe Briggs &amp; Stratton motor
the<00:00:11.040> original<00:00:11.639> motor<00:00:12.150> actually<00:00:13.139> over<00:00:13.290> there

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
the original motor actually over there

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.510 
the original motor actually over there
on<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.620> stool<00:00:15.590> it<00:00:16.590> was<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> good<00:00:16.890> motor<00:00:17.100> when<00:00:17.460> I

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
on that stool it was a good motor when I

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.400 
on that stool it was a good motor when I
first<00:00:17.730> got<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.330> know<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.810> had<00:00:19.260> good

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
first got it you know it had good

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.650 
first got it you know it had good
acceleration<00:00:19.680> good<00:00:20.189> power<00:00:20.369> but<00:00:20.730> after<00:00:21.630> a

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
acceleration good power but after a

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.250 
acceleration good power but after a
while<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.740> lost<00:00:23.640> power<00:00:24.260> dramatically

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
while it just lost power dramatically

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.620 
while it just lost power dramatically
and<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.769> wouldn't<00:00:26.220> even<00:00:26.279> pulled<00:00:26.550> me<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.789> after<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
and I wouldn't even pulled me to after a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.519 
and I wouldn't even pulled me to after a
while<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.369> just<00:00:29.369> took<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.820> off<00:00:30.470> kind<00:00:31.470> of

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
while so I just took that off kind of

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.160 
while so I just took that off kind of
angry<00:00:31.800> right<00:00:31.949> now<00:00:31.980> because<00:00:32.399> i<00:00:32.759> went<00:00:33.719> ahead<00:00:33.989> and
