well<00:01:06.860> because<00:01:07.579> squats<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.750> name<00:01:08.900> squat<00:01:09.200> was

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
well because squats the name squat was

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.920 
well because squats the name squat was
already<00:01:09.590> taken<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.280> we<00:01:10.640> decided<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.720> next

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
already taken so we decided the next

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.590 
already taken so we decided the next
best<00:01:12.079> thing<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.409> to<00:01:12.439> call<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:12.740> Larson<00:01:13.070> press

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
best thing is to call the Larson press

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.030 
best thing is to call the Larson press
basically<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.720> Larson<00:01:15.049> press<00:01:15.259> is<00:01:15.470> laying

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
basically the Larson press is laying

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.190 
basically the Larson press is laying
down<00:01:16.159> put<00:01:17.030> your<00:01:17.060> feet<00:01:17.210> either<00:01:17.540> straight<00:01:17.990> up<00:01:18.020> or

to do as long as your feet don't touch

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:24.459 
to do as long as your feet don't touch
the<00:01:22.969> ground<00:01:23.119> you<00:01:23.630> don't<00:01:23.960> get<00:01:24.020> any<00:01:24.170> Lake<00:01:24.319> Drive

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
the ground you don't get any Lake Drive

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.940 
the ground you don't get any Lake Drive
is<00:01:24.920> how<00:01:25.399> to<00:01:25.460> complete<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:25.909> Larson<00:01:26.270> press<00:01:26.950> when

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
is how to complete a Larson press when

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.809 
is how to complete a Larson press when
to<00:01:28.100> add<00:01:28.219> that<00:01:28.490> in<00:01:29.619> basically<00:01:30.619> I<00:01:31.039> like<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.639> do<00:01:31.789> a

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
to add that in basically I like to do a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.649 
to add that in basically I like to do a
light<00:01:32.119> heavy<00:01:32.420> day<00:01:32.950> bi-weekly<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.399> one<00:01:35.299> week<00:01:35.479> is

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
light heavy day bi-weekly so one week is

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.629 
light heavy day bi-weekly so one week is
a<00:01:35.689> lighter<00:01:35.960> day<00:01:36.200> I<00:01:36.229> work<00:01:36.530> around<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.920> 75<00:01:37.399> 80

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:37.639 
a lighter day I work around the 75 80

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.580 
a lighter day I work around the 75 80
percent<00:01:38.030> range<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.539> then<00:01:38.630> this<00:01:38.749> the<00:01:39.049> heavier

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
percent range and then this the heavier

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.700 
percent range and then this the heavier
day<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:40.039> next<00:01:40.249> week<00:01:40.429> I<00:01:40.670> go<00:01:41.090> up<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.689> 95

day the next week I go up to 95

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.010 
day the next week I go up to 95
you<00:01:42.829> know<00:01:42.950> 92<00:01:43.399> percent

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.240 

how<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.080> incorporate<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:49.980> your<00:01:50.100> life

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
how to incorporate this in on your life

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.480 
how to incorporate this in on your life
day<00:01:50.460> after<00:01:50.760> you<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:51.090> your<00:01:51.240> bench<00:01:51.570> session<00:01:52.490> then

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
day after you do your bench session then

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.540 
day after you do your bench session then
strip<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.480> bar<00:01:54.690> down<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:54.960> maybe<00:01:55.290> about<00:01:55.550> 70%

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
strip the bar down to maybe about 70%

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.830 
strip the bar down to maybe about 70%
75%<00:01:57.650> and<00:01:58.650> you're<00:01:58.860> gonna<00:01:59.010> do<00:01:59.370> sets<00:02:00.150> of<00:02:00.360> two<00:02:00.540> reps

75% and you're gonna do sets of two reps

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.110 
75% and you're gonna do sets of two reps
or<00:02:01.290> two<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.680> three<00:02:01.890> sets<00:02:02.160> and<00:02:02.490> you're<00:02:03.030> gonna

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
or two or three sets and you're gonna

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.270 
or two or three sets and you're gonna
pause<00:02:03.390> each<00:02:03.690> one<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.710> reason<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.130> we

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
pause each one and the reason that we

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.999 
pause each one and the reason that we
pause<00:02:05.550> it<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.810> one<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.350> it's<00:02:07.530> really<00:02:07.800> difficult

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
pause it is one is it's really difficult

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.240 
pause it is one is it's really difficult
to<00:02:08.220> stabilize<00:02:08.759> yourself<00:02:08.910> without<00:02:09.479> Lake<00:02:09.869> Drive
