00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
as you guessed Brock Lesnar and this is

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.629 
as you guessed Brock Lesnar and this is
just<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.790> prediction<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.360> mine<00:00:13.519> it's<00:00:14.519> very

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
just a prediction of mine it's very

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.189 
just a prediction of mine it's very
documented<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.330> Brock<00:00:15.540> Lesnar<00:00:15.570> signed<00:00:16.049> on

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
documented that Brock Lesnar signed on

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.529 
documented that Brock Lesnar signed on
for<00:00:16.230> two<00:00:16.590> more<00:00:16.800> years<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:18.090> dividend<00:00:18.420> B

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
for two more years with a dividend B

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.359 
for two more years with a dividend B
which<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.840> averaging<00:00:19.710> about<00:00:19.949> three

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
which is averaging about three

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.509 
which is averaging about three
pay-per-view<00:00:21.060> matches<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.660> know<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.990> year<00:00:22.519> and

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
pay-per-view matches you know a year and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.189 
pay-per-view matches you know a year and
I<00:00:23.609> think<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.029> net<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.420> know<00:00:24.570> inevitable

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
I think it's a net you know inevitable

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.769 
I think it's a net you know inevitable
that<00:00:25.350> we're<00:00:25.590> going<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.859> see<00:00:26.099> Brock<00:00:27.090> Lesnar<00:00:27.480> vs

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
that we're going to see Brock Lesnar vs

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.669 
that we're going to see Brock Lesnar vs
CM<00:00:28.050> Punk<00:00:28.460> now<00:00:29.460> CM<00:00:29.939> Punk<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:31.170> number<00:00:31.439> one

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
CM Punk now CM Punk is the number one

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.290 
CM Punk now CM Punk is the number one
heel<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.219> company<00:00:32.640> no<00:00:32.759> doubt<00:00:33.000> about<00:00:33.120> it

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
heel and the company no doubt about it

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.799 
heel and the company no doubt about it
i'd<00:00:33.960> say<00:00:34.200> probably<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:35.370> only<00:00:36.000> other<00:00:36.270> guy<00:00:36.329> even

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
i'd say probably the only other guy even

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.100 
i'd say probably the only other guy even
close<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.350> level<00:00:37.739> would<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.239> big<00:00:39.870> show

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
close to that level would be a big show

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.910 
close to that level would be a big show
unless<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.469> want<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.680> count<00:00:40.710> Dolph<00:00:41.100> Ziggler

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
unless you want to count Dolph Ziggler

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.430 
unless you want to count Dolph Ziggler
hmm<00:00:44.390> he's<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.539> number<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:45.989> guy<00:00:46.230> when<00:00:46.410> it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
hmm he's just number one guy when it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.479 
hmm he's just number one guy when it
comes<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.739> heels<00:00:46.920> he<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.520> know<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
comes to heels he just is you know and

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.010 
comes to heels he just is you know and
he<00:00:51.320> if<00:00:52.320> Brock<00:00:53.129> Lesnar<00:00:53.489> faces<00:00:53.940> Punk<00:00:54.390> one<00:00:54.899> of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
he if Brock Lesnar faces Punk one of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.029 
he if Brock Lesnar faces Punk one of
them<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.680> go<00:00:55.800> face<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.840> in<00:00:57.890> my<00:00:58.890> opinion

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
them have to go face and in my opinion

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.150 
them have to go face and in my opinion
it<00:00:59.579> would<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.059> Brock<00:01:00.420> Lesnar<00:01:01.160> because

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
it would have to be Brock Lesnar because

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.509 
it would have to be Brock Lesnar because
I<00:01:02.489> don't<00:01:02.789> see<00:01:02.969> them<00:01:03.120> taking<00:01:03.510> punk<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.189> switch

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
I don't see them taking punk and switch

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.039 
I don't see them taking punk and switch
them<00:01:05.640> around<00:01:05.729> anytime<00:01:06.479> soon<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.810> think<00:01:06.990> it

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
them around anytime soon I think it

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.929 
them around anytime soon I think it
would<00:01:07.140> hurt<00:01:07.470> his<00:01:07.650> character<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.760> know<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
would hurt his character you know the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.460 
would hurt his character you know the
switch<00:01:09.240> back<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.600> forth<00:01:09.810> over<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.380> over

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
switch back and forth over and over

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.230 
switch back and forth over and over
again<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.479> do<00:01:12.659> think<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:14.240> in

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
again and I really do think that that in

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.670 
again and I really do think that that in
the<00:01:15.360> not-too-distant<00:01:15.869> future<00:01:16.320> we're<00:01:16.650> going

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
the not-too-distant future we're going

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.950 
the not-too-distant future we're going
to<00:01:16.830> see<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> face<00:01:17.670> turn<00:01:17.970> for<00:01:18.270> Brock<00:01:18.450> Lesnar

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
to see a face turn for Brock Lesnar

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.390 
to see a face turn for Brock Lesnar
maybe<00:01:19.770> Paul<00:01:20.070> Heyman<00:01:20.369> will<00:01:20.490> screw<00:01:20.820> him<00:01:20.909> over<00:01:21.060> or

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
maybe Paul Heyman will screw him over or

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.749 
maybe Paul Heyman will screw him over or

the punk or Lesnar will return a face in
the<00:01:55.619> next<00:01:55.890> year<00:01:56.250> sometime<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the next year sometime to have the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.980 
the next year sometime to have the
rivalry<00:01:58.020> that's<00:01:58.430> destined<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.490> happen<00:01:59.719> but<00:02:00.719> I

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
rivalry that's destined to happen but I
