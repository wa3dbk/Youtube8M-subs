 Catholic University Professor Seung Chan Park

 In front of patients and their families, 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.980

 Actually, I wrote a book that was Thomas Aquinas so good to start with water 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.950
 It was not. 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.870

 Professor Park's dream was a Catholic priest. 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.900
 Studying in Germany without a full-time theological study 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.740
 One day when I was studying the three language philosophy of the theology department at the private blog university 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.100
 then 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.570

 From that point on, it started. 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.700
 It's all over now. Everything is ready now . 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.229
 I had a moment to get out. 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.619
 My conscience bearing kkeot live there are not fooling God then doedeoraguyo 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:02:00.479
 That's the kind of German seminary I came to talk to me about. 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.159
 Now I'll take the information did not at least I did not just one day gonna Gorman yet 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.149

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.759
 I wanted to pay back a step here's one for up to six months in scandal 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:15.269
 What i should do 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:18.989
 Do you really feel really practical result of years just to soothe the pain away 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.430
 Han Yu is just tired he just fall in six months of conflict, even so we 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.530
 Do you feel 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.780
 I have setup development, and in that state my beloved son Elijah 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.620
 Become a priest because it is old. 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:37.500
 It 's a close talk to God who likes to talk about this . 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.910
 By the end of the day, my conscience tells me to go the way you choose 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.170
 I want to know. 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:47.280
 I do not know how valuable the engagement time is. 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.220
 It is time for me to decide my conscience according to the time of reflection and my own conscience. 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.269
 In the true sense of being given 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.930
 And it'll also be good if you knew what dwaeteumyeon back much more strength 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:01.859
 From the time I was able to go out well, 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:06.180
 I do not know how much I appreciate that I can not deceive my conscience. 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:11.730
 In the sense that you have come to many people , the three-day personal story is that you 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:16.860
 Fear was one year when you must judge according to conscience in the true sense 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:23.010
 Who can say that ultimate ethical responsibility can be sufficient ? 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:27.569
 I have that very conscience, and from that conscience to the conscience. 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.860
 Each individual person who owns their own intentions is holding 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.610
 Did you say 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:37.400
 This game can not be crossed to anyone in the real kiln about it 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:40.470
 If the book was to take such a response from one's responsibility for his conscientious work 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.579
 I feel it's a pain. 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.480
 Therefore, young people have a conscience, according to one container 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.480
 Please can you leave 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:58.069
 Oh, why is impressive and lead the life I lead will be half Night View 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:08.209
 In modern society, I constantly ask people to be involved in relationships with things . 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:12.440
 I ask people to look at life only, but there is happiness 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.569
 While giving truly love to look at people who really ran the story worth 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.949
 I feel happy when I do 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:22.760
 If you say that you have a lot of things piled up , 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:28.130
 I'm not writing that brings happiness not pressure 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:32.539
 Human beings are only when they have relationships to be sexually happy . 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:38.300
 Haejumyeon I love to perform for students graduating I love 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:41.139

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.550
 I think I will follow 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.550
 This Thing 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:55.590
 4 people who have room to spare 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:55.590
