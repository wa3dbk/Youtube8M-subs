00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.780
 Welcome to a new app Aveo on this channel this time the first one 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.680
 Preview with my new iPad 2 and I want to continue to put an Expo called 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.979
 Test Barrot 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.169
 these resulted 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.320
 yes it more or less equal entry 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.260
 which, however, are not as reversed as they were back then 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.230
 the app is playing plays dissolve 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.640
 but all that is possible very modern 8 percent fall 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.079
 to talk 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.489
 ee more is so 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.710
 The puck was out for show and that they were really horny and trash 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.489
 Bought 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.670
 in enthusiastic 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.740
 Therefore, just want to introduce a short as said the app if 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.960
 becomes visible in the Bible description 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.840
 a link for download 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.890
 and this APA is really totally not declared legal 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.230
 we'll be more likely to send the individual tweets in one 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.020
 just about this futuristic 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.320
 and 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.360
 you can set different things 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.350
 and the whole life 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.290
 Schönau national text comes his time man 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.450
 can also show yours 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.800
 Percent restored as shown to display 10 of 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.270
 next in line is turn 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.300
 if the once on the test result Daimler and Lagardère series 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.610
 where we are at the moment we are all where we read why 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.910
 Species can also take back a fifth of them to look at 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.310
 and percent 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.680
 What I mean is an acoustic play in the year 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.500
 Jade goody as a payment option there we can get a tool 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.420
 can add a twitter search dissatisfied or a single user 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.040
 We can run a facebook account and chew a Google Medea 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.560
 we have the opportunity for us to have a son 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.329
 to turn it off and we have the opportunity our 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.090
 To set animation 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.100
 that means they have one in options 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.550
 he could do different 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.040
 Percent designs then select them for example accident 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.040
 also calculates 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.680
 Firewood percent keel also have very nice around different colors 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.680
 I think 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.509
 yes and percent, but I am 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.459
 the contrast biting 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.119
 To protect Rothen 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:18.329
 then a way around and so a murder set that is how should 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.639
 I would just get confused in the latest one or so m 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.389
 Mittelstand this is by Hermann Bluhm in the mess Lengedes as the 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.649
 latest and times as in a circle again and again from the beginning 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:33.419
 Jahnel possibility to adjust yes how long should I be displayed with 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.299
 made maximum in the coalition rounds 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.879
 and then adjust how fast should the text move tapas made easy 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.599
 because they want to move the future 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.799
 And reading is still possible when it's a time bomb 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:51.069
 Job on a n you have to look if we want and leave a picture 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.669
 and who just the name or just a note or not at all 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.689
 then the 2 1 could ask 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.169
 and percent which will not let ads or not 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:05.579
 The verdict has shut that off quite simply because it is with ministers 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:06.659
 staged 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:07.849
 while around 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.839
 he always indicates 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:13.189
 a year ago so we want a big one called the tweet was in front of you 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.189
 Year sent that is true, however, misses 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.519
 from therefore to 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.619
 It is not quiet right 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:22.619
 Alessi Richie also made it really nice with picture as it is 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:26.419
 Everything fits together that I really risked doing it in the algorithm 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:27.599
 prevent 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.539
 from the text of this 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:32.309
 she updates 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:36.049
 At such step, for example, Nolan's time will now be around 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.859
 Blacksmith Vet upload users clicks 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.859
 So that's ten seconds to win and then you just catch ten seconds 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.939
 bigger game "Now I want to finish our percentage 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:48.939
 these goods 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.329
 us Leichlingens arrived so to speak that means he does not have a new Schmitz 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.439
 therefore this guy stays now 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.290
 Beelitz love you scream a lot do not come for example sets a cry 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.989
 I was a pure man writes to a cheerful man 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.089
 my list also my account in a row 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:06.509
 he overwrites then he betrays here to be displayed with 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.249
 Jan Immel Skies, meanwhile, down there, too, directs Munich 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:14.449
 look 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.819
 By the way, again as you want to see it again or just 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:19.779
 Answers what they started now 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:20.730

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.469
 add as a favorite 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:26.039
 So that's the normal Facebook page because it keeps normal 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.680
 sorry, sorry 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.860
 it's about time because as you said you can do that on facebook account 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.139
 We now have Twitter and Facebook 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.629
 if then switch back and forth so in the future with the cool 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.020
 then to call others there 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.969
 and percent 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.740
 yes that is a decoration 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.750
 Ratajczak said Darren Aronofsky not so or consulate sat to run 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:53.130
 so neutrons tax i'm really 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.789
 to support this program years 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.749
 you see near writing as I said the link to the Download Store van 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:59.599
 Gogh say again 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.129
 or to write what he costs or Kurt Bröckers 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:03.389

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.550
 a thumbs up I have this time synonymous on my micro recorded 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.629
 because the micro of my camera is just not so much with everyone already noticed 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.159
 So I hope that I like the quality of the sound a bit better than 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:18.520
 level-headed 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.080
