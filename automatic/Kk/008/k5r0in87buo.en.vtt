00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.840
 hello everyone today 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.840
 videos never review whale honda 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:22.640
 you are company lucky john mr grills 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.290
 today's store flagship purchase here 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:30.560
 basically quite large dry 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:32.720
 represented by different lures and in that 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.990
 lucky john's number is also pretty big 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.780
 assortment especially from last year or 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.820
 100 thousand available that is what we can 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.910
 see that is principle 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.900
 lures of the same type and master looking at 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.039
 and 2 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.670
 lucky john pro series but what we have 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:56.440
 is written 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:00.109
 color and a guy three inches 7 strong 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.870
 covered in the center of the dream you washed 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.760
 can you have a trail on the back 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.970
 is the article some already gone 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.900
 technical data with a barcode here on 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:19.189
 number 8 pieces ten as indicated 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:22.579
 that's what different videos have seen 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:26.390
 us on the channel and you know that it is not always 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:30.950
 quantity may coincide with that 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.939
 here is what we have and we see our 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:38.299
 bait 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:40.729
 Now we will return to this side 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:46.549
 most likely therefore such matters 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:50.149
 that's how it looks 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:53.090
 the flattened boar on top is wider than the side 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.840
 if we look at her like that 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.940
 part she has daoud before tailing them 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.510
 changed 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.480
 such a form would be interesting here 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.570
 on a rather long what leg for 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.500
 the tail is here 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.050
 allows him quite intensely 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.060
 work here what else to say 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.170
 pleased with such a ribbed surface 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.360
 sparkles you all see here's a set how would 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.820
 engine oil but if you look at 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:30.700
 lumen he basically comes with a pinkish 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.500
 so a shade of pink lilac even 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.760
 said lilac more than but you 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:40.210
 still here is my bracelet and you can 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:44.590
 also see here on the back slot 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:47.980
 would rather not be small and on the bottom 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.530
 parts are also nowhere else 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.870
 technical others there is no moment exactly 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.100
 these cuts they are made to 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.070
 hiding the sting as effectively as possible 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.989
 offset hook and its base in the body 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.020
 right on this depending on how you 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.700
 see you need to hide it with the child 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.239
 part of the hook here 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.030
 you can do it easily 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:19.230
 bait in red and too many 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:22.150
 cut the movie here is the lures similar 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.890
 green but this is more so 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:31.420
 engine oil and green pumpkin that is 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:33.280
 difficult you will translate it like this 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.280
 here's the bait look all the same 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.040
 same same slot that's ass 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.000
 let's say yes you are that part interesting 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.530
 pretty shapes 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.450
 Well seals leg all too sparkles 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.610
 you see here already the problem goes and 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.680
 red and other principle there too 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.080
 fine but there was no black here 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.230
 black pepper goes in the tail section 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.960
 clearly seen here but quite interesting 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.840
 made a picture of bait again as 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.090
 indicated formula for themselves tewin site 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.130
 there is 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.590
 it is even stated how 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:13.560
 aromatization yes that is it is practically 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:16.950
 edible rubber as can be called and 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.940
 actually up to edible rubber it can 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.940
 the smell is very what 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:29.360
 sustainable principle as if by smell so 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.360
 Here are the bait not inferior to their 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:35.430
 competitors yes even more expensive in 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.120
 In principle, many la vida lucky john already 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.159
 and so have time to say what it's like 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.740
 This is the first one when I ran into him 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:45.599
 asked the store into this edible 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.029
 rubber but say almost edible rubber 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:50.219
 why because she's kinda there 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:52.259
 another technology implemented yes that is 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:55.560
 Here is the opening of both shows 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:58.529
 minutes either supports up to in the body of the bait and 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.550
 there somehow guarded this 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:03.930
 here is the west motivator which 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.529
 spreads and throughout the bait judging 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:12.150
 saturday barrels pretty steady 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:14.789
 Were sure that's why here's such 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:19.860
 The bait was bought by me since 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:22.110
 me here are stock figure tail about such as 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.569
 would be somewhat under exhausted in principle 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.370
 I had not the strength to basically you twisters 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.129
 here begin last year they 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.370
 send early you me again and i have 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:35.219
 continued to pour though were catching and on 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.949
 vibrotail and that's why i decided 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:39.659
 expand now here in the season already 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:43.139
 we have weeks left edges I hope 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:45.960
 already cooked on fishing like this 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.860
 way to expand the range also here 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.719
 this model 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.490
 three inches seemed interesting 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:56.279
 since that's the average size i 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.129
 I think that the communal large predator 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:02.490
 he will be working but also big 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:04.889
 bought bait on about them in our 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.810
 I hope other videos 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:09.330
 this video was interesting maybe 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.780
 someone he will help decide for themselves 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:15.410
 and choose 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.090
 just wanted to say it technically 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:21.770
 yes almost that bait is pretty 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:23.570
 solid they are so real confident 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.800
 it will be visible hook that is, will not 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.030
 tear and but also on three sides 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.250
 I can say that 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.030
 pretty good lucky john lures 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:39.200
 qualities 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:42.050
 here in terms of their boats and garden again then 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.690
 there they come to me quickly and we do not build 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:48.080
 tear very quickly on serves on 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.130
 road surely one two or more 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.890
 fishing 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:57.430
 unless of course their predator pretty me 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.430
 patted here hope this information

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:10.729
