00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:50.270
 means that alejandra and nicolás are 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.010
 they appeared from the disco at four o'clock 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.200
 and half five in the morning they were 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.200
 asleep to share with friends 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.350

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:08.570

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.640
 little thing in state then at noon 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.710

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.130
 flirtation 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.580
 it's so complicated to accept that those 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.890
 non- chemical people and good vibes if you 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.100

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.240

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.240

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.160

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.240

 the party lasted until 6 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.880
 approximately 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.010
 as it should be 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.180

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.560

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.330

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.700
 extinct as if they were all to their little house 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.330
 where it happens that they left me 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.330

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.140

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.049
 bad disco to them and must mediate 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.970
 between nervous and illusioned with him 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.170
 I have relaxed him because he loves the 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.170
 song of several hours 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.510

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.349
