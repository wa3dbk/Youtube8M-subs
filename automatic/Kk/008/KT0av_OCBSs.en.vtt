00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.710
 friends this is a gasoline saving it 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.590
 see also easy we look for the line the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.560
 line that comes from our gasoline 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.960
 our filter and the one that arrives in the system 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.119
 injection and here we put it to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.239
 approximately 30 to 20 centimeters 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.210
 to get to the injector there are placed the 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:35.610
 the gas savers one day they 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.960
 I said we only use the belts and 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.200
 we put them here as tight as 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.840
 you can without mind impress the hose 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.540
 that's how they are placed so good do 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.660
 yours in the next clip there comes 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.440
 how is it done 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.440
 and a greetings 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.199
 friends welcome today I bring a video 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.039
 very interesting let's make a 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.199
 gas saver is based on 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:04.290
 magnets are we going to use two magnets to 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.299
 use a 2 inch hose 10 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.250
 centimeters of hose I will use 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.979
 some fans are very important for 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.320
 do our installation will use 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.360
 a screwdriver and scissors and good some 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.759
 something to measure is not a rule a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.200
 subway what I have out there or window 2 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.720
 to measure our 10 centimeters the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.240
 way only and to the short there are 10 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.619
 centimeters but before starting them 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.119
 I will explain what this is about 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.670
 the magnets are supposed to be an expose 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.800
 that has some science this of 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.680
 magnet science 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.650
 now the magnets have two poles 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.820
 for the positive and negative remember that 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.410
 the magnets the positive poles attract 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.170
 and the negative poles good positive and 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.330
 negative repel is what happens not 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.000
 I know if you can see 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.060
 repel and if they were aligned 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.880
 poles attract that is the example of the 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.550
 magnets not now the case of gasoline 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.690
 I will give as an example that this is 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.200
 here in the center is the line of 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.869
 gasoline 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.429
 and so obviously it would not be the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.220
 fuel I will pass through here with our 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.590
 fuel hose or environment well 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.120
 in the case when gas goes by 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.849
 around here the ions are aligned 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.160
 that's called fuel ionization 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.780
 now doing that we're supposed to be 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.239
 to rounds of 30 to 40 percent 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.910
 gasoline because gas goes 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.180
 aligned or scripted upon arrival 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.720
 ours to combustion be it the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.519
 carburetor or injection system 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.720
 electronic fuel injection 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.230
 our cars depends on the car that 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.959
 you have obviously works for engines 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.250
 of gasoline and diesel engines and good 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.349
 let's do it I already have a 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.120
 installed in my car and I'm doing the 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.310
 test on that day in good at the end of 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.069
 these videos I'm going to put the 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.250
 results that you find with respect to 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.940
 gasoline and good is not too much 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.830
 do it I do not know 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.830
 I do not know gasoline is my face in his 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.190
 moments in Mexico and it goes up every month to 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.350
 better this does not work but you have to 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.350
 see it does not sell much in many places 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.660
 he only sells it and good the results and 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.150
 people say that if it works then 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.190
 let's make friends not think 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.690
 It is very easy to do and therefore if we 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.080
 we save gas until we like it 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.170
 excellent not good to do it 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.780
 very fast as I explained to you 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.000
 they have two poles a pole a pole that 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.290
 rejects in fact I do not know if they can see 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.329
 and a pole that attracts 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.129
 this is how they should look like making a 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.159
 sandwich ok 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.439
 good for you to remember we are going to 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.060
 put them as well as a sandwich when you 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:55.069
 closing is going to be like that 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.069
 another ok let's put 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.180
 one of the magnets in the hose and what 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.710
 let's get to the bottom so that 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.830
 stay well attached and do not leave 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.480
 this hose I do not know is not flammable at 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.280
 moment that receives heat is 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.709
 it just gets smaller 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.970
 but it never gets to melt in the 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.000
 if we put it in our 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.970
 engines nothing happens is a hose 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.290
 anti-flammable anti-flame and that's how I go 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.830
 cut the video and right now it's already 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.440
 ready 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.030
 I will explain how it is we are going to see 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.740
 as I tell you place a magnet here and the 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.740
 another here we continue 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.430
 very good gentlemen francisco is going to be 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.710
 we already put the two magnets remember that 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.160
 they must be aligned when closing 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.610
 the magnets must have the strength of 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.500
 union so now the easiest thing to 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.009
 install in the car is to use some skewers 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.740
 let's move the fans through the 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:01.770
 hose and on top of the magnets 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.830
 ok and here you go the gasoline line 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.520
 we just close and put the 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.919
 skewers so that's how it would look ok so 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.669
 I explain so that the gasoline line 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:18.330
 stay here and this imprisons him ok so it's 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.130
 how would it be going to put it and then to 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.139
 put it to work 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.120
 do it is very easy I used hose 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.250
 transparent to see the magnets 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.169
 but you can use hoses 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.580
 colored black hoses hoses 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.880
 some kind so they do not look at the 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.860
 engine 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.750
 and that's how it would be remembered 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.060
 it must be flexible hoses there is a 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.190
 hose is very very good they are now 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.990
 for this case they are hoses of those 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.610
 Chinese the way is very thin 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.780
 equally to put heat is compact 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.360
 We can use this type of hoses to 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.060
 our experiment our savings 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.280
 gasoline and good put to work by 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.010
 please please comment me what 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:02.090
 it seemed if they already did put it 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.710
 will work do the tank test no 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.840
 get tested for what you always 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.930
 we put the fourth the printed what 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.430
 put before and after what happens 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.220
 at the time of putting this 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:17.520
 and let's see what they say 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:20.610
 all about saving gas and 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.350
 you are the test in my car I put 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.800
 I put the same gasoline that I put to the 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:28.490
 week I placed two are placed since 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.140
 be ready let's put them each 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.480
 every five centimeters we put one and 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.190
 here we put another and here goes the line its 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.670
 green line I'll explain at the end of 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:41.370
 video is already proof of how it 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:43.680
 installed to be done is very 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.710
 easy friends do not stop doing it are the 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.860
 Rolls of gasoline are pretty easy 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.720
 it is very very easy to do not spend on 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.350
 a free market is a place where 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.360
 they sell the damages in 300 pesos and well no 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.430
 no not worth it is not the same just 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.009
 because it changes the magnets a little bit are the 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.900
 neo lidio is not something called 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:08.139
 but hey these magnets are pretty 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:11.610
 good do not ask for anything from others and 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:11.610
 good we are in contact friends 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:17.090
 friends so it is placed we only squeeze 

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.090
 The pinchos 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:24.759
 and that the magnet is in the center of it 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.729
 the way that in the center of the magnets 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:30.389
 that's how it would look like I hope they see a 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:30.389
 little more 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:36.110
 so the sites we run out is not no 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.970
 it warms up and does not melt that's a 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.100
 6 cylinder engine and it works quite 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:43.340
 all right 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:46.420
 friends do yours thank you for watching 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.420
