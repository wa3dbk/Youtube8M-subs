continue<00:04:03.880> contracting<00:04:04.880> traditional<00:04:05.390> artists

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
continue contracting traditional artists

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.430 
continue contracting traditional artists
for<00:04:06.530> some<00:04:06.920> time<00:04:07.330> okay<00:04:08.330> it<00:04:08.570> will<00:04:08.690> just<00:04:08.930> become

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
for some time okay it will just become

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.509 
for some time okay it will just become
another<00:04:09.680> to<00:04:10.130> another<00:04:10.580> medium<00:04:11.209> to<00:04:11.720> do<00:04:11.989> art

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
another to another medium to do art

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.860 
another to another medium to do art
because<00:04:13.519> if<00:04:13.850> you're<00:04:14.000> just<00:04:14.180> limited<00:04:14.330> to<00:04:14.540> just

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
because if you're just limited to just

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.500 
because if you're just limited to just
Photoshop<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.709> and<00:04:16.150> painter<00:04:17.150> there's<00:04:17.359> not

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
Photoshop and and painter there's not

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.840 
Photoshop and and painter there's not
really<00:04:17.690> much<00:04:17.900> you<00:04:17.959> can<00:04:18.229> do<00:04:18.320> with<00:04:18.470> it<00:04:18.620> well<00:04:19.580> when

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
really much you can do with it well when

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.379 
really much you can do with it well when
you<00:04:19.940> talk

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
you talk

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.570 
you talk
artists<00:04:20.930> you<00:04:21.590> have<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.919> keep<00:04:22.069> in<00:04:22.249> mind<00:04:22.430> that

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
artists you have to keep in mind that

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.550 
artists you have to keep in mind that
there's<00:04:22.819> studio<00:04:23.569> artists<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.259> most

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
there's studio artists and most

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.429 
there's studio artists and most
commercial<00:04:25.129> artists<00:04:26.080> what<00:04:27.080> you're<00:04:27.199> talking

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:27.439 
commercial artists what you're talking

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:30.580 
commercial artists what you're talking
about<00:04:27.499> here<00:04:27.919> is<00:04:28.159> more<00:04:28.879> commercial<00:04:29.180> art<00:04:29.629> and

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
about here is more commercial art and

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.320 
about here is more commercial art and
that's<00:04:30.919> quite<00:04:31.669> different<00:04:31.999> because<00:04:32.060> there

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
that's quite different because there

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.640 
that's quite different because there
will<00:04:32.389> always<00:04:32.449> be<00:04:32.779> studio<00:04:33.770> artists<00:04:34.449> I<00:04:35.650> just

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
will always be studio artists I just

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.989 
will always be studio artists I just
don't<00:04:36.800> think<00:04:36.979> a<00:04:37.039> computer<00:04:37.310> could<00:04:37.580> ever<00:04:37.759> get

00:04:37.989 --> 00:04:37.999 
don't think a computer could ever get

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:40.629 
don't think a computer could ever get
rid<00:04:38.150> of<00:04:38.210> that<00:04:38.419> because<00:04:38.810> that's<00:04:39.189> each<00:04:40.189> person's

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
rid of that because that's each person's

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.480 
rid of that because that's each person's
own<00:04:40.789> form<00:04:41.300> of<00:04:41.449> visual<00:04:42.080> expression<00:04:42.409> or<00:04:43.009> however

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
own form of visual expression or however

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.920 
own form of visual expression or however
they<00:04:43.610> choose<00:04:43.639> to<00:04:43.939> express<00:04:44.210> it<00:04:44.449> well<00:04:44.599> I<00:04:44.659> think

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
they choose to express it well I think

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.689 
they choose to express it well I think
that's<00:04:45.139> a<00:04:45.289> false<00:04:45.499> paradigm<00:04:45.770> to<00:04:46.129> say<00:04:46.249> that<00:04:46.430> one

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
that's a false paradigm to say that one

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.100 
that's a false paradigm to say that one
thing<00:04:46.729> replaces<00:04:47.419> another<00:04:47.479> it's<00:04:47.870> simply

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
thing replaces another it's simply

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.290 
thing replaces another it's simply
another<00:04:48.259> medium<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:48.860> mean<00:04:49.009> cave<00:04:49.460> painters<00:04:49.969> back

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
another medium I mean cave painters back

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.409 
another medium I mean cave painters back
in<00:04:50.509> like<00:04:50.659> 10,000<00:04:51.379> BC<00:04:51.770> use<00:04:52.400> pigment<00:04:53.000> oil<00:04:53.180> to

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
in like 10,000 BC use pigment oil to

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.679 
in like 10,000 BC use pigment oil to
sketch<00:04:53.659> on<00:04:53.960> rock<00:04:54.379> now<00:04:55.069> we<00:04:56.060> have<00:04:56.210> evolved<00:04:56.629> a

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:56.689 
sketch on rock now we have evolved a

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:58.240 
sketch on rock now we have evolved a
long<00:04:56.870> ways<00:04:57.199> from<00:04:57.229> since<00:04:57.650> then<00:04:57.830> a<00:04:57.860> lot<00:04:58.099> more

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
long ways from since then a lot more

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.740 
long ways from since then a lot more
different<00:04:58.550> mediums<00:04:58.879> but<00:04:59.330> that<00:04:59.449> doesn't<00:04:59.689> mean

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
different mediums but that doesn't mean

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.409 
different mediums but that doesn't mean
that<00:04:59.870> simply<00:05:00.139> it's<00:05:00.259> being<00:05:00.439> replaced<00:05:01.419> talk

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
that simply it's being replaced talk

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.059 
that simply it's being replaced talk
more<00:05:02.569> like<00:05:02.689> what's<00:05:02.960> poppin<00:05:03.439> commercial<00:05:03.919> use

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:04.069 
more like what's poppin commercial use

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.830 
more like what's poppin commercial use
obviously<00:05:04.370> digital<00:05:05.090> works<00:05:05.300> are<00:05:05.479> popular

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
obviously digital works are popular

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.839 
obviously digital works are popular
commercial<00:05:06.259> use<00:05:06.409> because<00:05:06.800> of<00:05:06.949> what<00:05:07.639> it<00:05:07.729> allows

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
commercial use because of what it allows

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.459 
commercial use because of what it allows
them<00:05:08.060> to<00:05:08.090> do<00:05:08.330> so<00:05:08.539> in<00:05:08.629> that<00:05:08.779> sense<00:05:09.110> it<00:05:09.259> has<00:05:09.289> auto

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469 
them to do so in that sense it has auto

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.529 
them to do so in that sense it has auto
replace<00:05:10.069> digital<00:05:10.460> mediums<00:05:10.789> and<00:05:11.000> you<00:05:11.389> could

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
replace digital mediums and you could

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.209 
replace digital mediums and you could
say<00:05:11.689> you<00:05:11.750> know<00:05:11.900> some<00:05:12.139> academia<00:05:12.710> is<00:05:12.770> prefer<00:05:13.099> to

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:13.219 
say you know some academia is prefer to

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:15.790 
say you know some academia is prefer to
teach<00:05:13.400> traditional<00:05:13.699> but<00:05:14.659> like<00:05:15.169> I<00:05:15.259> said<00:05:15.469> who<00:05:15.770> is

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
teach traditional but like I said who is

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.740 
teach traditional but like I said who is
consuming<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.490> art<00:05:16.699> if<00:05:16.879> more<00:05:17.270> people<00:05:17.629> in<00:05:17.689> the

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
consuming the art if more people in the

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.480 
consuming the art if more people in the
market<00:05:18.080> like<00:05:18.289> digital<00:05:18.800> then<00:05:18.949> obviously<00:05:19.310> will

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
market like digital then obviously will

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.100 
market like digital then obviously will
be<00:05:19.520> replaced<00:05:19.999> if<00:05:20.479> more<00:05:20.719> people<00:05:20.990> by

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
be replaced if more people by

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.209 
be replaced if more people by
traditional<00:05:21.589> art<00:05:21.770> works<00:05:21.919> I'll<00:05:22.099> see

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:22.219 
traditional art works I'll see

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:24.579 
traditional art works I'll see
attritional<00:05:22.550> become<00:05:22.879> popular<00:05:23.330> but<00:05:24.020> I<00:05:24.199> think

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:24.589 
attritional become popular but I think

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:26.649 
attritional become popular but I think
if<00:05:24.770> you<00:05:24.860> look<00:05:24.979> at<00:05:25.039> a<00:05:25.099> continuum<00:05:25.729> of<00:05:25.759> art<00:05:26.270> has<00:05:26.629> a

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
if you look at a continuum of art has a

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.719 
if you look at a continuum of art has a
historical<00:05:27.259> perspective<00:05:27.589> there's<00:05:28.370> been<00:05:28.580> art

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
historical perspective there's been art

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.850 
historical perspective there's been art
for<00:05:29.000> over<00:05:29.120> 5,000<00:05:29.839> years<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.319> a<00:05:30.349> lot<00:05:30.529> of<00:05:30.560> it<00:05:30.740> has

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
for over 5,000 years and a lot of it has

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.230 
for over 5,000 years and a lot of it has
been<00:05:30.889> done<00:05:31.400> with<00:05:31.610> a<00:05:31.639> brush

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
been done with a brush

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.209 
been done with a brush
I<00:05:32.270> don't<00:05:32.599> think<00:05:32.659> within<00:05:32.930> like<00:05:33.259> 50<00:05:33.620> years<00:05:33.830> with

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
I don't think within like 50 years with

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.219 
I don't think within like 50 years with
like<00:05:34.400> a<00:05:34.550> tablet<00:05:35.060> that<00:05:35.120> certainly<00:05:35.509> gets<00:05:35.659> erased

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
like a tablet that certainly gets erased

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.920 
like a tablet that certainly gets erased
I<00:05:36.349> think<00:05:37.279> the<00:05:37.669> future<00:05:37.969> continues<00:05:38.419> along<00:05:38.870> with

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
I think the future continues along with

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.029 
I think the future continues along with
traditional<00:05:39.169> I<00:05:40.180> think<00:05:41.180> the<00:05:41.990> big<00:05:42.289> things<00:05:42.710> like

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
traditional I think the big things like

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.480 
traditional I think the big things like
maybe<00:05:43.449> advertising<00:05:44.449> and<00:05:44.779> really<00:05:45.319> wide<00:05:45.589> widely

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
maybe advertising and really wide widely

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.670 
maybe advertising and really wide widely
known<00:05:46.789> widespread<00:05:47.330> comic<00:05:47.750> books<00:05:48.020> probably

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
known widespread comic books probably

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.360 
known widespread comic books probably
would<00:05:49.399> have<00:05:49.550> Aaron<00:05:50.029> but<00:05:50.839> I<00:05:51.169> know<00:05:51.560> throughout

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
would have Aaron but I know throughout
