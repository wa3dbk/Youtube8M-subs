00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.590
 I'm Javier CaÃ±ada quality director of 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.320
 Aguinaga elver often ask me 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.769
 which is in line to answer this 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.540
 Question 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.490
 Today we are going to show you what is the 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.889
 process of making the surimi and for 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:21.010
 we have our chef jose 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:22.150
 let this man maybe josean 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.180
 let's see how we are doing 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.180
 perfectly today I came here to 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.160
 learn how to make the best surimi and 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.950
 for that, it is necessary to have a 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.590
 fresh fish fresh white fish I 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.330
 brought some exemplary pieces the surimi 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.830
 just as you said the first 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.890
 The ingredient you need is fish 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.360
 very cool fresh have to pass 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.520
 very few hours since it was captured 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.250
 until the second surimi is made 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.500
 subject the surimi has to do with the 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.810
 nobler parts of fish loins 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.210
 and third issue to develop a kilogram of 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.430
 surimi josean 5 kilos of 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.340
 fish then there I want to see you and 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.390
 another has gone for about 12 so what 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.579
 first thing we have to do is 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.379
 loosen up 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.990
 and one of the very good things that it has 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.670
 the surimi is that it is left to combine with 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.810
 another type of protein with another type of 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.149
 aromas but the fundamental ingredient 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.770
 it's the surimi but what it is 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.770
 true is that the surimi is fantastic 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.190
 Well, let's throw a little water 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.690
 yes sir because once the nhtsa is 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.690
 the water to this 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.130
 water is very important to be able 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.400
 remove all the fat that has the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.619
 fish and have the pure end 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.960
 protein that is the surimi you told me 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.550
 that is a thousand-year-old millennial recipe is 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.259
 a recipe that comes from Japan you know 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.390
 in Japan is the place where more 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.300
 they know the quality of the fish and it's a 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.929
 repeated and millennial technique now 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:54.550
 let's add egg white starch and 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:59.130
 a drop of good oil to give it a 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.130
 little bit of color we add paprika 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.590
 It gets us well 9 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.830
 Well, I think we've already given it a 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.080
 Perfect perfect and colorful touch that 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.790
 will show us when it's time to finish 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.210

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.440
 causes and already with the brush 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.090
 and now we are going to extend a little bit to 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.940
 little you will tell me if in the end I get the 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.100

 well I take it out of the oven and now we go 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.260
 to give slow at the end the final touch 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.430
 here what we are doing is a little 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.170
