00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:13.229
 the arterial supply changes but is ensured by the entry into the skull 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:15.219
 of four glasses 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.390
 through the zipi hole such enter the vertebral arteries that join in 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.640
 the basil trunk 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.880
 the two posterior cerebral arteries are divided 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.550
 the internal carotid arteries enter through the crag of the temporal 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.280
 that lodged in the cavernous sinus lateral to the sella turca emit the 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.260
 previous and middle cerebral arteries besides chance 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.850
 the three cerebral arteries according to in around the turkish chair I crossed 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.200
 end of the anterior and posterior communicating arteries to form a 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.220
 polygon that seven sides the polygon of willis 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.280
 this training is a safety mechanism in vascularization 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.550
 cerebral 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.550
 since some glasses can supply to us 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.350
 Finally 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.000
 each artery has its territory of brain distribution 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.180
 the exit of venous blood from the skull occurs through breasts 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.990
 venous ones constituted between the mother cure and the bony furrows of the spout 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:17.089
 everything is directed towards the internal jugular vein that will carry this blood to 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:18.969
 through the neck towards the heart
