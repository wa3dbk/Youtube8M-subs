00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:03.779
 a reason 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.870
 because our last show have shown what different 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.799
 There are wooden floor coverings 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.619
 Tortured in our practical test about what they can do themselves to theirs 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.619
 Wood flooring to give new shine 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.890
 the wage or wood briquettes are particularly homely and robust 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.119
 floor coverings 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.820
 when unsightly after many years of use or heavy use 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.740
 became 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.840
 You can complete them in contrast to textile or laminate 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.090
 renovate because wooden floors can be sanded off and are back afterwards 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.810
 How new before you start sanding will be damage to the wood 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.590
 In addition, all nails must be carefully filled 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.710
 be sunk 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.080
 they could rip the sandpaper or even the delicate ones 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.750
 Damage grinder 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.960
 after the preliminary work they need to renovate their best floor to everyone 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.280
 Case a tactic grinder 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.000
 with this straightening machine 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.510
 work on the floor until the old surface is removed and 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.890
 only the pipe wood is visible 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.479
 "When sanding a plank floor Smithson certain sanding directions 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.040
 be respected 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.190
 you start by loosening with coarse 16 or 24 grinds 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.080
 and drag diagonally random direction from a corner of the room into the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.740
 diagonally opposite the machine in Trier I meanwhile towards 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.260
 Investigations and must be slowed down slightly at the end of the track 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.560
 each raised and careful in the backward movement again 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.690
 lowered 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.390
 The grinder is now retracted on the same track 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.270
 next blow came slightly offset to the first 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.720
 subsequently, the other diagonal of the room will follow the same procedure 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.620
 worked so long that the floor is completely clean and planed 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.450
 You can hardly embarrass them with 24s to get rid of the sanding marks 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.780
 we'll get you regrinds 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.700
 then follows also in Publisher directions of the center and 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.929
 Fine-tuning mid-eighties and '120s loop read 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.219
 To change the loop feet, the machine is tilted sideways and the new 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.169
 Sleeve pushed onto the slats roller 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.809
 The arrow inside the sleeve must point in the running direction of the roller 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.440
 the edges become coarse between the ebb and then fine 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:27.279
 polished 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:31.199
 With modern garment grinding equipment, sanding under radiators is no 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:32.529
 Problem more 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.829
 also finished parquet can be with a conventional grinding machine 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.649
 but you have to be much more cautious and accurate 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:42.119
 work as well as their soil 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:45.829
 while they are almost unrestricted in the one listing of their animals 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:46.759
 I both 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:50.949
 They may have to finish the wood honoring one in the sanding 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:54.249
 Parquet floor pay attention to the wear layer 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:55.569
 to go through 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.139
 They usually have two of the four millimeters available 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:03.519
 and to remove the wood as sparingly as possible 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.019
 use a three slices of machines 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.950
 which distribute the load the loops evenly on the floor 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:15.499
 This grinder has a counter rotation system 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.379
 that is, the base on which the three rotating grinding wheels are mounted 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.479
 are spinning along and creating an absolutely even grind image 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:29.829
 With such a three-disc machine, it is therefore not necessary a certain 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.429
 To keep the grinding direction 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:36.889
 The result is impressive the polished wooden floor they actually made 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.059
 as recently published 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.589
 in our next episode on wood flooring, we will show them 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:46.379
 which possibilities there are for the postprocessing and how they do theirs 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.479
