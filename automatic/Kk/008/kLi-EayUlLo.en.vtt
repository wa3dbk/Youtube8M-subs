00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
hi guys so how do I make my choir guitar

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.210 
hi guys so how do I make my choir guitar
swell<00:01:30.700> sounds<00:01:31.540> so<00:01:32.200> first<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.650> all<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:33.010> don't

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
swell sounds so first of all you don't

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.660 
swell sounds so first of all you don't
really<00:01:33.610> need<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:34.210> volume<00:01:35.050> pedal<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:36.250> can<00:01:36.460> use

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
really need a volume pedal you can use

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.930 
really need a volume pedal you can use
your<00:01:37.710> guitar<00:01:38.760> volume<00:01:39.760> knob<00:01:41.010> but<00:01:42.010> I<00:01:42.040> think<00:01:42.400> it's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
your guitar volume knob but I think it's

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.560 
your guitar volume knob but I think it's
sound<00:01:43.300> smoother<00:01:43.780> with<00:01:44.080> a<00:01:44.290> volume<00:01:44.860> pedal<00:01:45.570> then

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
sound smoother with a volume pedal then

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.740 
sound smoother with a volume pedal then
I<00:01:46.600> have<00:01:47.110> my<00:01:47.440> deep<00:01:47.770> sick<00:01:48.040> compressor<00:01:48.700> just<00:01:49.060> all

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
I have my deep sick compressor just all

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.430 
I have my deep sick compressor just all
the<00:01:49.869> way<00:01:49.960> down<00:01:50.200> so<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.619> sound<00:01:51.130> is<00:01:51.400> more<00:01:51.850> even

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
the way down so the sound is more even

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.219 
the way down so the sound is more even
then<00:01:53.440> you<00:01:53.860> need<00:01:54.040> two<00:01:54.520> delays<00:01:54.850> first<00:01:55.600> I<00:01:55.720> have<00:01:55.990> my

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
then you need two delays first I have my

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.830 
then you need two delays first I have my
diamond<00:01:56.560> memory<00:01:57.100> lane<00:01:57.280> it's<00:01:58.030> set<00:01:58.330> with<00:01:58.510> a<00:01:58.540> lot

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
diamond memory lane it's set with a lot

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.560 
diamond memory lane it's set with a lot
of<00:01:58.990> feedback<00:01:59.500> and<00:01:59.740> mix<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.400> pretty<00:02:01.180> slow<00:02:01.540> so

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
of feedback and mix and pretty slow so

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:09.419 
of feedback and mix and pretty slow so
it<00:02:02.200> trails<00:02:02.650> for<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:02.920> long<00:02:03.160> time<00:02:03.430> like<00:02:03.670> this<00:02:08.429> okay

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
it trails for a long time like this okay

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.640 
it trails for a long time like this okay
then<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:10.030> second<00:02:10.479> delay<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.080> el<00:02:11.260> capistan

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
then the second delay is the el capistan

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.480 
then the second delay is the el capistan
and<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.970> tempo<00:02:13.690> is<00:02:13.900> different<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.950> two

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
and the tempo is different so the two

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.790 
and the tempo is different so the two
delays<00:02:15.850> complement<00:02:16.660> each<00:02:16.810> other<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.590> goes

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
delays complement each other so it goes

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.620 
delays complement each other so it goes
like<00:02:18.670> this<00:02:22.019> so<00:02:23.019> that<00:02:23.050> both<00:02:23.650> delays<00:02:24.130> duh<00:02:24.630> they

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
like this so that both delays duh they

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:34.590 
like this so that both delays duh they
do<00:02:32.130> okay<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.190> see<00:02:33.489> it's<00:02:33.640> more<00:02:33.820> even<00:02:34.269> at<00:02:34.420> the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
do okay you see it's more even at the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.140 
do okay you see it's more even at the
end<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:36.190> after<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.330> need<00:02:37.570> a<00:02:37.930> pitch<00:02:38.530> shifter

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
end so after you need a pitch shifter

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.110 
end so after you need a pitch shifter
like<00:02:40.150> my<00:02:40.480> organizer<00:02:41.110> right<00:02:42.239> here<00:02:43.320> so<00:02:44.320> I<00:02:44.350> have

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.910 
an up octave like at 2:00 o'clock or
something<00:02:50.680> down<00:02:51.310> octave<00:02:52.209> almost<00:02:53.170> all<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.739> way

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
something down octave almost all the way

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.170 
something down octave almost all the way
and<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:55.330> choir<00:02:55.630> setting<00:02:56.170> just<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:57.010> little<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:58.150> I
