00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
what you want to do is you want to pin

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.740 
what you want to do is you want to pin
the<00:00:31.170> sides<00:00:31.500> over<00:00:32.279> here<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:33.210> make<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> edge<00:00:33.600> off

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the sides over here to make the edge off

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.150 
the sides over here to make the edge off
stay<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.020> place<00:00:34.230> rather<00:00:34.410> than<00:00:34.590> pinning<00:00:35.040> it

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
stay in place rather than pinning it

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.319 
stay in place rather than pinning it
under<00:00:35.430> your<00:00:35.520> chin<00:00:35.870> so<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:38.329> you

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
under your chin so I like to do that you

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.970 
under your chin so I like to do that you
don't<00:00:39.510> even<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.140> pin<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> sides<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:40.920> I

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
don't even have to pin the sides but I

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.549 
don't even have to pin the sides but I
think<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:42.059> best<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.290> hijab

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
think it's best to so that the hijab

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.170 
think it's best to so that the hijab
stays<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.040> place<00:00:44.219> or<00:00:44.460> else<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.730> could<00:00:44.910> keep

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
stays in place or else it could keep

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:53.590 
stays in place or else it could keep
moving<00:00:45.510> around<00:00:45.590> just<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.770> pin<00:00:47.010> there

face<00:02:31.820> so<00:02:32.820> what<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.720> want<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.900> do<00:02:34.019> is<00:02:34.140> have<00:02:34.350> like

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
face so what you want to do is have like

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.410 
face so what you want to do is have like
one<00:02:34.830> short<00:02:35.100> side<00:02:35.250> again<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.640> one<00:02:35.940> long<00:02:36.150> side

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
one short side again and one long side

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.710 
one short side again and one long side
and<00:02:36.690> then<00:02:37.610> you<00:02:38.610> could<00:02:38.790> fold<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.209> top<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.540> like
