00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 and people like are welcome a 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.150
 boyfriend today as you can see in the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.589
 title of this today I'm going to decipher or 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.590
 I'm going to give you the scientific explanation 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.809
 of the popular during the time of what 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.610
 color is the dress and not just tell them 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.710
 what color is it really because 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.100
 some people do not see one or the other 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.100
 colour 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.470
 the theme that is revolutionizing the world 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.360
 at this moment it is what color is the 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.070
 dress and for those who do not know what 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.750
 we are talking about it is not that some 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.430
 famously put on a dress a 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.500
 strange color has been found 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.300
 new color composition is though 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.580
 there is a converted photograph 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.739
 before where they say it depends on 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.090
 our state of mind we see the dress of 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.190
 one or the other color 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.950
 incredibly as if by magic 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.350
 people see different colors so 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.940
 before telling them why it is and in 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.280
 true of what color is the dress 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.410
 I would like us to repeat the was this is 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.269
 the popular image that is being taken in 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.400
 the internet if it's the first time they see it 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.380
 I would like you to tell me what colors 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.909
 me in this dress or if they had already 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.800
 seen the first time they ran into 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.360
 it is here colors but if it is yes 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.650
 just like me the first impression 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.190
 what he gave them is that this dress was 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.130
 white with gold cheated us the brain 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.200
 the same designer of this if a photo 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.180
 of catalog showing and checking that 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.040
 The true colors are blue with 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.200
 black that for those who are saying 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.240
 that down below that came out I do not know who I 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.700
 I see her white with gold 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.659
 it is assumed that if indeed this dress 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.020
 was white when 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.570
 we should see it this way 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.759
 however after knowing this I 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.350
 I started to philosophize of those things so 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.420
 deep that come to you in 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.549
 mind what really matters is not 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.920
 what is the real color of this dress 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.200
 but because the new people of 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.759
 different colors like that after a couple 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.409
 of hours of research in newspapers 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.780
 foreigners I found a 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.240
 scientific answer to this fact that 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.490
 now I am going to share the explanation 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.409
 simple is that in our eyes see a 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.240
 object they try to decipher the color of 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.190
 this according to the degree of illumination 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.620
 in other words and then in broad daylight 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.599
 of the day in the afternoon when it starts to 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.310
 darken or at night when it gets dark 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.140
 totally when the degree of 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.569
 lighting and the actual color of the object 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.760
 they combine our brain is confused 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.290
 a little bit and depending on each person you 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.660
 will prioritize one of the two 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.370
 factors the actual color or the degree of 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.200
 lighting therefore in this case 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.239
 some will be guided by a factor or by 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.220
 the other seeing thus the dress of 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.440
 different hue as I know that some 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.480
 people after this is not going either 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.040
 to be clear why I am going to give them 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.540
 an example a bit more specific so 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.100
 first impression you saw the dress 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.630
 it was blue and black that means that 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.930
 the cones in your retina have a 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.269
 high performance 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.189
 in other words that you are more sensitive 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.530
 to the light the opposite who saw the 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.359
 gold and white dress like me 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.489
 we have eyes that do not work 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.989
 also under the you yes good for 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.209
 close this example it says that the 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.549
 Eskimos and those people that online 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.379
 already surrounded by snow they perceive up to 30 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.710
 shades of white while 1 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.960
 but normal its moon 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.490
 and very valid so we have come to the end 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.620
 of this video I hope you have them 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.390
 liked there they have their answer is not 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.370
 that is a myth is not that it depends on 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.620
 mood just depends on 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.170
 our eyes therefore if a dog what 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.210
 see what will perceive this color as well 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.560
 as a colorblind will see it from others and 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.180
 they liked this video do not forget to give it 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.100

 as also share it with that friend 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.920
 that made them believe that this depended on their 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.870
 Been also a couple of days ago believe 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.000
 snap tsja and bain and I'll be going up 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.010
 many things out there so I invite you 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.990
 to continue being me more we see ourselves in a 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.100
 next I am road by day this is 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.100
 being change
