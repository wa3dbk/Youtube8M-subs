all<00:03:50.070> like<00:03:50.480> metallic<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:52.350> holographic<00:03:53.010> if<00:03:53.130> you

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
all like metallic and holographic if you

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.830 
all like metallic and holographic if you
noticed<00:03:53.520> that<00:03:53.580> I<00:03:53.760> think<00:03:54.000> it's<00:03:54.120> cute<00:03:54.390> but<00:03:54.660> it's

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
to flow through or his fin to flow

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.970 
to flow through or his fin to flow
through<00:04:51.850> and<00:04:52.230> as<00:04:53.230> you<00:04:53.290> can<00:04:53.380> see<00:04:53.500> this<00:04:53.620> helmets

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
through and as you can see this helmets

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.730 
through and as you can see this helmets
kind<00:04:54.160> of<00:04:54.220> intricate<00:04:54.700> so<00:04:54.880> it<00:04:55.000> has<00:04:55.150> um<00:04:55.740> scales

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
kind of intricate so it has um scales

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.960 
kind of intricate so it has um scales
going<00:04:56.980> all<00:04:57.160> around<00:04:57.430> I<00:04:57.610> don't<00:04:57.760> know<00:04:57.820> why<00:04:57.910> the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
going all around I don't know why the

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.600 
going all around I don't know why the
camera<00:04:58.270> stops<00:04:58.690> focusing<00:04:59.170> so<00:04:59.350> much<00:04:59.410> but<00:05:00.250> as<00:05:00.460> you

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
camera stops focusing so much but as you

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.390 
camera stops focusing so much but as you
can<00:05:00.700> see<00:05:00.850> it<00:05:00.940> has<00:05:01.620> like<00:05:02.620> this<00:05:02.800> thing<00:05:03.100> going

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
can see it has like this thing going

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.640 
can see it has like this thing going
around<00:05:03.490> as<00:05:03.730> the<00:05:03.910> helmet<00:05:04.300> that<00:05:05.110> he<00:05:05.260> can<00:05:05.410> breathe

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
around as the helmet that he can breathe

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.680 
around as the helmet that he can breathe
through<00:05:05.680> it<00:05:06.100> it's<00:05:06.520> a<00:05:06.610> little<00:05:06.700> bit<00:05:07.030> foggy<00:05:07.360> in

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
through it it's a little bit foggy in

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.760 
through it it's a little bit foggy in
the<00:05:07.780> front<00:05:08.020> so<00:05:08.110> you<00:05:08.200> can't<00:05:08.350> really<00:05:08.470> see<00:05:08.620> his

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
the front so you can't really see his

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.540 
the front so you can't really see his
face<00:05:09.060> but<00:05:10.060> it<00:05:10.150> has<00:05:10.300> like<00:05:10.540> different<00:05:11.220> see<00:05:12.220> or

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
face but it has like different see or

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.310 
face but it has like different see or
like<00:05:12.850> river<00:05:13.300> monster<00:05:13.600> looking<00:05:14.230> designs<00:05:16.320> we

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.590 
skates are pretty huge and I think it's
just<00:05:55.070> because<00:05:55.280> we're<00:05:55.520> used<00:05:55.700> to<00:05:55.820> the<00:05:56.030> roller

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
just because we're used to the roller

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.290 
just because we're used to the roller
made<00:05:56.840> skates<00:05:57.110> but<00:05:57.320> they're<00:05:57.920> kind<00:05:58.160> of<00:05:58.190> big<00:05:58.340> and
