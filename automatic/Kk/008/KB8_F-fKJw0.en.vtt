00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
hdmi matrix switcher which you can see

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.389 
hdmi matrix switcher which you can see
right<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.410> front<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.649> me<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.160> see

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
right here in front of me so you can see

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.650 
right here in front of me so you can see
the<00:00:54.149> four<00:00:54.860> outputs<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.969> four<00:00:57.270> source

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the four outputs with the four source

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.110 
the four outputs with the four source
cluster<00:00:58.109> inputs<00:00:59.070> right<00:00:59.399> here<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.910> is

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
cluster inputs right here so this is

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.290 
cluster inputs right here so this is
zone<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.230> zone<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.649> zone<00:01:01.890> three<00:01:02.219> zone<00:01:02.730> four<00:01:03.030> or

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
zone one zone to zone three zone four or

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.700 
zone one zone to zone three zone four or
however<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.199> mapped<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
however you have it mapped in the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.640 
however you have it mapped in the
configuration<00:01:05.070> tool<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.689> keypad<00:01:07.140> here

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
configuration tool so this keypad here

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.590 
configuration tool so this keypad here
is<00:01:08.150> zone<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.970> you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.000> see<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.450> we're

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
is zone one and you can see that we're

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.520 
is zone one and you can see that we're
on<00:01:12.750> source<00:01:13.260> input<00:01:13.760> for<00:01:14.760> which<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.600> why<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
on source input for which is why the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.350 
on source input for which is why the
light<00:01:16.770> actually<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.460> glowing<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> fourth

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
light actually is glowing on the fourth

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.560 
light actually is glowing on the fourth
source<00:01:18.720> input<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.350> zone<00:01:19.979> one<00:01:20.340> output<00:01:20.670> now<00:01:21.509> we

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
source input on zone one output now we

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.620 
source input on zone one output now we
don't<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:21.990> five<00:01:22.650> or<00:01:23.009> six<00:01:23.400> mapped<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.330> we're

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
don't have five or six mapped so we're

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.999 
don't have five or six mapped so we're
going<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.810> cycle<00:01:25.020> through<00:01:25.200> media<00:01:25.619> extender

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
going to cycle through media extender

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.539 
going to cycle through media extender
and<00:01:26.420> ipod<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:28.259> when<00:01:28.829> we<00:01:28.920> go<00:01:29.040> back<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
and ipod but when we go back to the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.109 
and ipod but when we go back to the
first<00:01:29.820> zone<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:32.040> will<00:01:32.220> see<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:35.670> LED

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
first zone here we will see that the LED

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.649 
first zone here we will see that the LED
actually<00:01:36.509> changes<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.259> we're<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.360> output<00:01:39.360> one

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
actually changes so we're on output one

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.289 
actually changes so we're on output one
and<00:01:40.020> again<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.860> don't<00:01:41.460> look<00:01:41.670> at<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> am<00:01:42.150> FM

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and again we don't look at the am FM

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.670 
and again we don't look at the am FM
stuff<00:01:42.659> because<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:42.869> not<00:01:43.170> really<00:01:43.470> mapped

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
stuff because it's not really mapped

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.530 
stuff because it's not really mapped
properly<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:44.970> actually<00:01:45.090> see<00:01:45.270> that

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
properly but you can actually see that

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.450 
properly but you can actually see that
when<00:01:45.720> you're<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:45.960> source<00:01:46.320> 2<00:01:46.619> which<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.100> MFM

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
when you're on source 2 which is a MFM

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.530 
when you're on source 2 which is a MFM
in<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.700> point<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.110> LED<00:01:50.000> or<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.270> source

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
in this point that the LED or the source

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.920 
in this point that the LED or the source
switch<00:01:52.380> or<00:01:52.590> input<00:01:53.159> 2<00:01:53.909> has<00:01:54.299> actually<00:01:54.780> been

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
switch or input 2 has actually been

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.740 
switch or input 2 has actually been
illuminated<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.130> switcher<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.479> we<00:01:57.600> go

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
illuminated on the switcher and if we go

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.709 
illuminated on the switcher and if we go
to<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> next<00:01:58.310> source<00:01:59.310> you<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.149> see<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.540> it's

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
to the next source you can see that it's

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.359 
to the next source you can see that it's
actually<00:02:00.869> changing<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:01.920> cycle

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
actually changing and we can cycle

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.789 
actually changing and we can cycle
through<00:02:02.399> all<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.990> different<00:02:04.079> ones<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.649> now

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
through all the different ones so now

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.570 
through all the different ones so now
we're<00:02:04.950> back<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.310> one<00:02:05.990> two<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.409> three<00:02:08.190> source

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
we're back to one two and three source

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.820 
we're back to one two and three source
on<00:02:08.970> zone<00:02:09.239> one<00:02:09.569> we<00:02:09.869> can<00:02:09.989> do<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.170> same<00:02:10.440> thing

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
on zone one we can do the same thing

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.640 
on zone one we can do the same thing
with<00:02:11.700> zone<00:02:11.970> 2<00:02:12.360> which<00:02:12.870> would<00:02:13.110> be

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
with zone 2 which would be

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.149 
with zone 2 which would be
this<00:02:14.159> area<00:02:15.120> right<00:02:15.360> here<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.989> if<00:02:16.590> i<00:02:16.709> push<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
this area right here and if i push the

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.190 
this area right here and if i push the
source<00:02:17.430> button<00:02:17.730> which<00:02:18.269> we<00:02:18.569> don't<00:02:18.659> have<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.900> five

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
source button which we don't have a five

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.860 
source button which we don't have a five
or<00:02:19.230> six<00:02:19.829> mapped<00:02:20.129> when<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:20.909> go<00:02:21.060> back<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.269> one<00:02:21.629> we

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
or six mapped when we go back to one we

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.559 
or six mapped when we go back to one we
can<00:02:22.019> see<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.409> zone<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:24.470> source<00:02:25.470> one<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.220> lit

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
can see that zone to source one is lit

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:33.170 
can see that zone to source one is lit
zone<00:02:27.569> to<00:02:27.780> source<00:02:28.140> 2<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.650> lit<00:02:29.030> zone<00:02:30.409> to<00:02:31.790> source<00:02:32.790> 3

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
zone to source 2 is lit zone to source 3

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.470 
zone to source 2 is lit zone to source 3
is<00:02:33.329> lit<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:34.010> source<00:02:35.010> for<00:02:35.489> on<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.909> same<00:02:36.180> zone

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
is lit and source for on the same zone

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.470 
is lit and source for on the same zone
so<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.900> can<00:02:37.049> see<00:02:37.260> very<00:02:37.590> similar<00:02:38.480> performance

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
so you can see very similar performance

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.390 
so you can see very similar performance
and<00:02:39.959> capabilities<00:02:40.019> of<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:40.530> wire<00:02:40.739> storm<00:02:41.159> we've

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400
