you<00:00:00.120> know<00:00:00.269> the<00:00:00.539> one<00:00:00.780> of<00:00:00.900> the<00:00:01.760> most<00:00:02.760> important

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.130 
you know the one of the most important

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.650 
you know the one of the most important
things<00:00:05.130> in<00:00:05.549> training<00:00:06.060> is<00:00:06.270> collar

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
things in training is collar

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.790 
things in training is collar
conditioning<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:08.809> it's<00:00:09.809> also<00:00:10.260> one<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.620> the

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
conditioning and it's also one of the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.650 
conditioning and it's also one of the
most<00:00:11.010> misunderstood<00:00:11.910> there's<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:12.540> many

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
most misunderstood there's so many

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.980 
most misunderstood there's so many
aspects<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.620> but<00:00:14.630> basically<00:00:15.630> what<00:00:15.839> it

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
aspects to it but basically what it

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.680 
aspects to it but basically what it
means<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.789> electric<00:00:18.180> collar<00:00:18.420> is

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
means is that the electric collar is

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.880 
means is that the electric collar is
used<00:00:19.460> to<00:00:22.550> reinforce<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:24.269> command<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.680> dog

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
used to reinforce a command that the dog

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.400 
used to reinforce a command that the dog
already<00:00:26.220> knows<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.849> lot<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.630> times<00:00:27.840> trainers

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
already knows a lot of times trainers

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.109 
already knows a lot of times trainers
get<00:00:28.619> caught<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.250> using<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> electric

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
get caught up in using the electric

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.260 
get caught up in using the electric
collar<00:00:30.679> because<00:00:31.679> they're<00:00:31.890> angry<00:00:32.340> or<00:00:32.550> because

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
collar because they're angry or because

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.850 
collar because they're angry or because
they<00:00:34.079> want<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.910> punish<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.030> dog<00:00:36.420> or<00:00:36.809> because<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
they want to punish a dog or because the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.380 
they want to punish a dog or because the
dog<00:00:38.040> isn't<00:00:38.250> doing<00:00:38.579> what<00:00:38.700> they<00:00:38.879> want<00:00:39.149> and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
dog isn't doing what they want and

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.180 
dog isn't doing what they want and
really<00:00:39.809> that's<00:00:40.050> not<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.320> good<00:00:40.739> use<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
really that's not a good use for the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.139 
really that's not a good use for the
electric<00:00:41.550> collar<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.629> electric<00:00:43.079> collar<00:00:43.290> is

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
electric collar the electric collar is

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.900 
electric collar the electric collar is
used<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.570> reinforce<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.590> command<00:00:47.550> they<00:00:47.670> already

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
used to reinforce a command they already

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.279 
used to reinforce a command they already
know<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:49.500> collar<00:00:49.980> conditioning<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.289> extremely

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
know so collar conditioning is extremely

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.500 
know so collar conditioning is extremely
important<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.579> has<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.910> be<00:00:53.940> done<00:00:54.239> right

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
important and it has to be done right

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.680 
important and it has to be done right
and<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.620> means<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:57.000> dog<00:00:57.270> has<00:00:57.660> to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
and it means that the dog has to

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.599 
and it means that the dog has to
understand<00:00:58.649> what<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.870> stimulus<00:01:00.870> from<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
understand what the stimulus from the

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.329 
understand what the stimulus from the
collar<00:01:02.609> means<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.510> an<00:01:03.809> electronic<00:01:04.619> signal

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
collar means it's an electronic signal

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.940 
collar means it's an electronic signal
that<00:01:05.519> comes<00:01:05.729> from<00:01:06.060> me<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.720> dog<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.770> he's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
that comes from me to this dog and he's

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.530 
that comes from me to this dog and he's
got<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.310> understand<00:01:08.820> if<00:01:09.030> he<00:01:09.119> doesn't

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
got to understand if he doesn't

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.170 
got to understand if he doesn't
understand<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.350> doesn't<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.549> doesn't<00:01:11.970> work

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
understand it it doesn't it doesn't work

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.670 
understand it it doesn't it doesn't work
right<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:14.189> way<00:01:14.400> we<00:01:14.760> teach<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.680> by

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
right so the way we teach that is by

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.620 
right so the way we teach that is by
picking<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.250> command<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.060> dog<00:01:18.270> knows

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
picking a command that the dog knows

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.190 
picking a command that the dog knows
very<00:01:19.020> well<00:01:19.170> like<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.220> sit<00:01:20.580> command<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.299> once

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
very well like the sit command and once

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.060 
very well like the sit command and once
they<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.220> command<00:01:23.700> reliably<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
they can do that command reliably a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.429 
they can do that command reliably a
hundred<00:01:26.070> percent<00:01:26.210> accurately<00:01:27.210> then<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.259> use

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
hundred percent accurately then we use

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.649 
hundred percent accurately then we use
the<00:01:28.650> electric<00:01:29.100> collar<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.670> reinforce<00:01:30.360> that

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the electric collar to reinforce that

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.980 
the electric collar to reinforce that
command<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.290> then<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.909> called<00:01:33.479> collar

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
command and then that is called collar

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.830 
command and then that is called collar
conditioning<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.340> I'm<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.210> demonstrate

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
conditioning so I'm going to demonstrate

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.469 
conditioning so I'm going to demonstrate
that<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.560> its<00:01:37.710> most<00:01:37.950> simple<00:01:38.430> way<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:39.450> a

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
that just in its most simple way with a

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.319 
that just in its most simple way with a
dog<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.829> understands<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:42.299> have

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
dog that understands it just so we have

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.609 
dog that understands it just so we have
a<00:01:42.930> beginning<00:01:43.850> idea<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.229> what<00:01:46.229> collar

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
a beginning idea of what collar

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.420 
a beginning idea of what collar
conditioning<00:01:47.430> actually<00:01:47.880> means<00:01:48.799> he'll

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
conditioning actually means he'll

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.830 
conditioning actually means he'll
he'll<00:01:53.610> sit<00:01:55.650> so<00:01:56.650> he<00:01:56.830> knows<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.430> set<00:01:57.640> command<00:01:58.030> so

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
he'll sit so he knows the set command so

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.660 
he'll sit so he knows the set command so
then<00:01:59.110> I'm<00:01:59.290> going<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.590> pick<00:01:59.860> a<00:02:02.100> number<00:02:03.100> on<00:02:03.490> the

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
then I'm going to pick a number on the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.640 
then I'm going to pick a number on the
electric<00:02:04.060> caller<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.540> lowest<00:02:05.140> one<00:02:05.470> that

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
electric caller the lowest one that

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.040 
electric caller the lowest one that
it'll<00:02:05.890> go<00:02:06.070> which<00:02:06.520> in<00:02:06.700> this<00:02:06.850> case<00:02:07.090> is<00:02:07.330> a<00:02:07.360> 1<00:02:07.660> I'm

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
it'll go which in this case is a 1 I'm

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.260 
it'll go which in this case is a 1 I'm
going<00:02:08.710> to<00:02:08.880> say<00:02:09.910> sit<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:12.280> once<00:02:12.580> he's<00:02:12.820> sitting

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
going to say sit and once he's sitting

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.170 
going to say sit and once he's sitting
I'm<00:02:14.050> going<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.560> begin<00:02:14.710> to<00:02:15.190> caller<00:02:15.430> condition

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
I'm going to begin to caller condition

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.050 
I'm going to begin to caller condition
which<00:02:16.360> will<00:02:16.810> go<00:02:17.080> like<00:02:17.320> this<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:17.950> will<00:02:18.190> say<00:02:18.400> sit

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
which will go like this I will say sit

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.890 
which will go like this I will say sit
and<00:02:19.470> then<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.500> will<00:02:20.830> Nick<00:02:21.340> with<00:02:21.910> this<00:02:22.150> one<00:02:22.630> which

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
and then I will Nick with this one which

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.840 
and then I will Nick with this one which
he's<00:02:23.380> not<00:02:23.650> even<00:02:24.010> going<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.250> you're<00:02:24.370> not<00:02:24.490> even

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
he's not even going to you're not even

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.410 
he's not even going to you're not even
going<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.060> see<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.300> reaction<00:02:25.890> sit<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.940> can<00:02:28.000> see

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
going to see a reaction sit you can see

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.199
