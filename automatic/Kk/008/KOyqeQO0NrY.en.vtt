00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.200
 and hello to all the fiction and we 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.809
 we find for a new video 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.940
 in which I will show you 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:21.360
 how to put movies be it 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.790
 blu ray of the classic divx or even 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.900
 series on your ipad iphone or ipod 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.000
 touch you'll see that the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.940
 manipulation is relatively simple 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.060
 so first of all you have to launch 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.789
 itunes 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.550
 once itunes and launch you go 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.620
 have to connect your cable while 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.219
 simply to your ipod iphone or ipod 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.480
 touch what I'm going to do right now 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:47.969
 that's what is done next you click 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.460
 on your device at the top it's 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.999
 all simple las and ipad 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.019
 you then go into applications 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:56.280
 why in the application because 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.589
 you will have to download a 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.839
 application that is directly on 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.569
 the app store called flex player 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.329
 so the only downside of flex player 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:08.219
 is that the license to read everything 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:11.159
 who is blu ray is paying 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:12.899
 it is priced at 7 euros 99 if I do not 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.240
 say no nonsense but it allows you 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.189
 to read all types of files 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.630
 and that's what's really practical and 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.520
 to put them on your ipad 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.170
 nothing more simple you will see here 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.110
 you see that I put two episodes of 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.030
 the person of interest series the folder 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.430
 of person of interest is here so I 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.859
 go to episode 2 and 3 to add 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.159
 for example the fourth you have 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.700
 need we just go hop we go 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.829
 refresh 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.899
 I take the fourth episode to ideas 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.679
 already 9.4 to take back the 5th you 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.280
 swipe here here you have time 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.390
 Loading 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.729
 so once the loading time 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.030
 low will come to an end 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.590
 the episode will be on itunes in the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.929
 flex player document that will be 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.249
 directly sync on the ipad 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.770
 iphone or ipod touch 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:00.780
 here it is added I have more than 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.740
 synchronized and we end up all of 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.740
 next to show you that 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.780
 it works so now so we 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.099
 is on the ipad where I will launch 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.679
 the application is explained yesterday 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.580
 look like that so I run it and you 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.890
 go see so 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.600
 here already the two episodes so yes if 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.980
 the time I arrived so yes it 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.300
 I also start on the ipad 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.130
 and to finish only computer 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.080
 you see where you had arrived is 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.190
 still practical here is the new 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.390
 episode that I'm going to add so 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.490
 episode 5 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.590
 once I run there is no problem 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.400
 you have the classic interface of when 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.800
 you start a video 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.150
 and here is the quality she is very very 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.970
 good she is excellent she is 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.370
 identical to the one on the computer 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.300
 so there is no loss of quality 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.100
 and frankly I find this 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.070
 great judge app we have some 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.330
 equivalents in free I do not have any more 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.670
 names in mind but I know there are some 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.530
 equivalents and honestly it does not stop 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.180
 no spitting you do not have any 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.070
 formats while there you can put 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.790
 any format the quality it 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.170
 is superb 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.240
 so here I have nothing to say about this 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.690
 application and I owed you the 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.970
 present 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.430
 or so I'll see you soon and 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.260
