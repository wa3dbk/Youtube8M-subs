the light on Gunners actually
technically<00:00:12.090> I'm<00:00:12.300> seeing<00:00:12.570> less<00:00:12.809> light<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.380> I

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
technically I'm seeing less light and I

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.230 
technically I'm seeing less light and I
will<00:00:13.950> tell<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.280> why<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.610> few<00:00:14.820> minutes<00:00:14.969> but

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
one of our pm's desks and i asked about

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.999 
one of our pm's desks and i asked about
them<00:01:33.060> he<00:01:33.570> said<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.869> give<00:01:33.960> him<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> try<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.710> did

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
them he said to give him a try so I did

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.039 
them he said to give him a try so I did
I<00:01:35.220> put<00:01:35.430> them<00:01:35.579> on<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.000> instantly<00:01:36.360> felt<00:01:36.810> less

over the course of the day my eye

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.649 
over the course of the day my eye
fatigue<00:01:40.860> became<00:01:41.250> noticeably<00:01:41.880> less<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.420> over
