00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
okay submenu II this is for exposed if I

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.509 
okay submenu II this is for exposed if I
go<00:00:05.879> out<00:00:05.910> back<00:00:06.210> out<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.569> for<00:00:06.839> exposure<00:00:07.519> config

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
go out back out this for exposure config

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.700 
go out back out this for exposure config
and<00:00:09.530> is<00:00:10.530> oh<00:00:10.769> so<00:00:11.570> easy<00:00:12.570> steps<00:00:13.049> I'll<00:00:13.380> have<00:00:13.679> that

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
and is oh so easy steps I'll have that

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.599 
and is oh so easy steps I'll have that
set<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.549> third<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.210> an<00:00:15.330> EV<00:00:16.609> metering

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
set to a third of an EV metering

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.370 
set to a third of an EV metering
personally<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.510> use<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:19.760> the<00:00:20.869> full<00:00:21.869> matrix

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
personally I use the the full matrix

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.599 
personally I use the the full matrix
metering<00:00:22.890> whatever<00:00:23.880> Olympus<00:00:24.330> call<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:25.609> or

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
metering whatever Olympus call that or

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.720 
metering whatever Olympus call that or
to<00:00:26.849> expose<00:00:27.300> your<00:00:27.510> lot<00:00:27.750> metering<00:00:28.519> i'll<00:00:29.519> have

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
to expose your lot metering i'll have

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.720 
to expose your lot metering i'll have
that<00:00:29.760> are<00:00:30.000> not<00:00:30.150> 0<00:00:31.219> is<00:00:32.219> 0<00:00:33.200> as<00:00:34.200> default<00:00:34.739> i<00:00:35.100> would

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
that are not 0 is 0 as default i would

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.530 
that are not 0 is 0 as default i would
put<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.360> iso<00:00:36.989> 200<00:00:37.680> which<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.540> effectively

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
put that to iso 200 which is effectively

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.389 
put that to iso 200 which is effectively
how<00:00:39.750> i<00:00:39.780> use<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.620> as<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.980> base<00:00:41.190> is

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
how i use that as that as the base is

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.540 
how i use that as that as the base is
though<00:00:42.140> for<00:00:43.140> shooting<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.860> step<00:00:47.160> third<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
though for shooting I so step third of

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.250 
though for shooting I so step third of
an<00:00:47.610> EV<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.840> auto<00:00:50.420> not<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:52.460> all<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:54.260> that

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
an EV I so auto not to all we have that

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.350 
an EV I so auto not to all we have that
will<00:00:55.410> go<00:00:55.590> all<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.710> way<00:00:55.829> up<00:00:55.980> 6400<00:00:56.850> high<00:00:57.000> limit

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
will go all the way up 6400 high limit

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.090 
will go all the way up 6400 high limit
but<00:00:57.539> personally<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:59.100> limit<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.520> my<00:00:59.699> sort<00:01:00.690> of

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
preference for nice will be SE iso 1600

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.760 
preference for nice will be SE iso 1600
and<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.670> default<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.060> 200<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.080> press<00:01:10.350> ok<00:01:10.740> on

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
and the default is 200 so press ok on

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.609

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
that is 0 auto this would normally sit

shutter<00:01:19.439> priority<00:01:20.119> these<00:01:21.119> are<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> modes

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
that auto ISO would be available I will

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.380 
that auto ISO would be available I will
switch<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.140> into<00:01:25.560> all<00:01:25.939> that<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.270> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
switch that into all that can be a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.410 
switch that into all that can be a
really<00:01:27.689> useful<00:01:28.220> feature<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> camera<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
really useful feature of the camera to

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.469 
really useful feature of the camera to
be<00:01:30.570> able<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.220> manual<00:01:32.220> exposure<00:01:32.549> mode<00:01:32.970> set

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
be able to in manual exposure mode set

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.039 
be able to in manual exposure mode set
the<00:01:34.079> aperture<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.520> shutter<00:01:35.579> speed<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.420> allow

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
the aperture and shutter speed and allow

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.560 
the aperture and shutter speed and allow
the<00:01:37.110> iso<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.189> automatically<00:01:38.850> ramp<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the iso to automatically ramp up and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.480 
the iso to automatically ramp up and
down<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:40.020> give<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:41.720> good<00:01:42.720> exposure<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.460> i

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
down to give you a good exposure so i

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.190 
down to give you a good exposure so i
have<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.909> set<00:01:45.149> at<00:01:45.180> all<00:01:45.619> bolt<00:01:46.619> timer<00:01:48.049> what<00:01:49.049> do

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
have that set at all bolt timer what do

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.039 
have that set at all bolt timer what do
we<00:01:49.320> have<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:51.170> think<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.350> eight<00:01:52.470> minutes

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
we have I think that was eight minutes

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.660 
we have I think that was eight minutes
anti-shock<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:55.680> set<00:01:55.860> off<00:01:56.009> bracketing

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
anti-shock so we set off bracketing

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.340 
anti-shock so we set off bracketing
we're<00:01:57.180> not<00:01:57.299> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.570> use<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:59.570> now<00:02:00.570> that's

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
we're not going to use that now that's

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.010 
we're not going to use that now that's
not<00:02:01.530> really<00:02:01.770> configuration<00:02:02.719> setting<00:02:03.719> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
not really configuration setting a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.859 
not really configuration setting a
one-off<00:02:04.920> configuration<00:02:05.909> you'd<00:02:06.450> come<00:02:06.719> back

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
one-off configuration you'd come back

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.719 
one-off configuration you'd come back
into<00:02:07.229> these<00:02:07.350> menus<00:02:07.890> when<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.220> want<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.550> access

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
into these menus when you want to access

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.229 
into these menus when you want to access
bracketing<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.890> case<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.340> would<00:02:11.550> come

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
bracketing and in that case I would come

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.150 
bracketing and in that case I would come
into<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.599> news<00:02:12.959> auto<00:02:13.290> exposure

acting<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:15.360> generally<00:02:15.750> i<00:02:15.780> do<00:02:15.870> something<00:02:16.350> like

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
acting and generally i do something like

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.480 
acting and generally i do something like

three frames at not point seven TV for

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
bracketing but we're going to switch

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.980 
bracketing but we're going to switch
that<00:02:21.600> off<00:02:21.660> believe<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:22.530> off<00:02:22.650> as<00:02:22.950> default

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
that off believe that off as default

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.990 
that off believe that off as default
okay
