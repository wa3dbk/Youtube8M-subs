00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.190
 I like the chair it took the drawer pen I like said the clerk in August 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.929
 inside the closet I like it over the closet 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.389
 I like under the bed 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.499
 I like the floor of the car I like I like I like I like because 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.220
 your excellent phase 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.090
 October is a means of preventing combat and with the sense of action 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.279
 to breast cancer in Brazil 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.140
 hehehe face a campaign called the taste actually did not invent 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.819
 copied from an American campaign 

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:39.140
 I'm like it 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.990
 and turn the progressive turned a fever 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.180
 from one hour to another people started well in everything that is place 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.930
 especially twitter and facebook 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.430
 I like in the gÃ¡vea that I like on the bike August in the chair 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.520
 I liked the closet. 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.620
 I really like 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.170
 I like it under my bed. 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.160
 I like I like I like I like I like 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.320
 men do not know what they want 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.860
 I was starting to get curious, I was curious too, I wanted to know what you have 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.249
 Your taste, I like it 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.249
 I thought it was some viral marketing campaign 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.880
 that in a little while and appeared a shop bottom 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.470
 magazine 'a brand of clothing a cosmetic brand 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.310
 no matter what company some brand 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.670
 talking about your taste 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.479
 I traveled 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.700
 very cool talking cut 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.500
 Congratulations to you guys you were very good did in marketing you will oppose 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.259
 Wonderful campaign that gave a supercerto 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.670
 who spread to all that is singing left the men 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.450
 curious women made the women come together in search of a 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.550
 because I found out what it is that I like I went behind were asked pro 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.620
 I asked for another one I asked for favors and everything else arrived in Brasilia 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.540
 start exchanging emails in principle we will help to promote October as the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.320
 month of combat and prevention 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.370
 breast cancer and for that you speak you should write on your twitter a 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.759
 phrase of your pc book 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.149
 I like to mean one thing I will not say I will not ruin the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.590
 nobody's joke 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.160
 but the place where you like this thing and then in the middle of the enem what to talk about 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.800
 last year we did and the men were super curious 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.260
 I was really curious and I asked several of my friends what I want is 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.970
 the taste 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.410
 and all of them 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.559
 they did not talk it's a girl thing people can not answer 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:29.329
 Okay, okay? 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.329
 this one of the men had a woman 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:39.210
 could have breast cancer and that she might be alerted to awareness 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.949
 on account of this campaign 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:43.729
 a campaign that gave a great deal 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.379
 and they're no good at all 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.359
 the campaign 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.439
 spread in general 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.989
 has created curiosity in people in men and women 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:58.769
 spread a message across the four corners of the message 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.359
 prose attention with this message 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.569
 and no one touched the subject and prevention to breast cancer 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.999
 When you see what it was for? 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.459
 awareness went behind information 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.139
 access got stuck 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.159
 not only leaves us the curious ones in the songs that he chose put in the 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.199
 curious polls route route but we are succeeding in achieving these 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.739
 click here 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.739
 ex-curious agent 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:26.540
 You prefer to leave people curious. 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.540
 of a subject that is to avoid prejudice 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:31.849
 is indicated 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.769
 I understood nothing the way my skin responds to me so you 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.769
 thinking it's bad just because you're not participating in the joke 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:40.729
 not 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:41.989
 I think it's bad 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.989
 What did you campaign the year of apology the month of October 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.550
 and prevention of breast cancer 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.250
 identification of breast cancer 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.040
 and you did not speak 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.270
 a pity the mullah on breast cancer 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:04:00.199
 I still thought it's okay, I'll give it a while, it'll end a month, 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.909
 group is finishing a joke 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:08.090
 and it will come a day or who started this chain or who distributes the 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.120
 E-mails the father appears out of nowhere another enemy 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.620
 Talking about people October is the month of October to 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:21.669
 give breast cancer the exam done that way you can identify from 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.719
 such a way we will clarify 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:25.580
 the campaign 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.659
 It was not to make people curious. 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.059
 I was to leave everything 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:31.550
 conscious 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.409
 and we did not do it 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:38.339
 breast cancer affects thousands and thousands of women throughout Brazil and the 

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:39.080
 world 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.949
 prevention and identification is very easy, you just need to 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.770
 self-examination that can be done while showering while you change clothes on the 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.330
 A beautiful car, or coming home from work. 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.550
 The self examination consists of more or less in you touching your breast in several 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.740
 regions and try to write down if you find 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.070
 some slightly harder region a little tougher than normal 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:07.599
 I'm doing it to show 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.659
 on a test and have that opportunity 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.240
 how to turn what I like one more place 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.069
 in the place is one day you make or three years 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.310
 if someone asks you what it is that I like 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.450
 enjoy 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.700
 makes an email explaining talking about the month of combat and cancer prevention 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.220
 explaining how is the self-examination hockey that should be 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.389
 identified 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.550
 to find you or not for you to be quiet exchange ideas 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.389
 I do not use it there, it's so cool about 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.550
 the truth will 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.999
 for press 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:46.620
 if he could have made a much better use of his taste, every hit was super bowl 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.050
 to the goat come with me no 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.630
 I can only show her and if they communicate prison, then you 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.630
 is the next beauty squares and parks bye 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.529
 in this sense 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:05.370
 have more 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.550
 if you still do not know how you do self-examination 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.520
 maybe I can help you
