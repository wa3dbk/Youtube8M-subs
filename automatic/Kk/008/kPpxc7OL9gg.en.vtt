best way is like this the in-between way
which<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:38.149> not<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:38.450> right<00:01:38.570> way<00:01:38.780> is<00:01:38.990> like<00:01:39.049> this

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.460 

that's<00:01:45.659> also<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> right<00:01:46.530> way<00:01:47.390> okay<00:01:48.470> keep

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
that's also not the right way okay keep

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.859
