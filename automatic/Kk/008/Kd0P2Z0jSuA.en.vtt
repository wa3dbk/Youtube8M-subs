00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.130
 Hi to everyone in this video, I 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.059
 I will review our new TV 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.360
 for starters, I would like to say why I 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:13.969
 I chose 4k TV so far 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.730
 still stand hd TV stores or to 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.130
 of course called full hd 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.710
 I am not sufficiently all available 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.310
 The thing is, I think it's a day. 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.980
 already a dinosaur that will soon die off 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.720
 in general, finally can be purely 23 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.039
 of the year 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.320
 just like in general you died there 9 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.440
 standard from him died there 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.420
 tapes and TV is a very technical 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:45.020
 long use it is bought not on 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.110
 3 not for five years but 15 who are on the floor 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.060
 life buys or for life therefore 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.120
 as the English say we are not so rich 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.460
 to buy cheap things or like me 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.100
 I say not worth buying 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.670
 old technology for new money because 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.299
 that a clean couple of years will already be wrong 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:09.049
 relevant and want something new 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.720
 money is already spent in general 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.000
 let's 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.470
 in the morning the equipment of our TV 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.290
 actually the TV itself you saw it 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.470
 my power cord is plugged into the outlet i 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.060
 I will not show now further well 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.780
 actually it is clear that here is the guide 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.360
 operation and warranty card and 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.900
 we also have two 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.420
 remote control 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.040
 one ordinary standard self and not at all 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.690
 I use 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:41.180
 then comes the remote which is called 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:41.180
 I can magic repair work only to them in 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.990
 he design so generally stylish because 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.820
 what I watched previous some versions 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.040
 they were like some kind of design 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.200
 some old woman in the epilator here 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.700
 this is already such a normal bow 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.440
 fits well so on we go to 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.830
 bundled all sorts of connectors 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:11.730
 tulips an adapter from a meniscus that usual 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:17.820
 ramp filter some clips and something 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:20.340
 left here was a bag as we move 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.400
 to the overview of the very appearance but the view 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.519
 Front principle standard for many 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.170
 TVs without any 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:32.810
 overhead columns and so on just 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:36.209
 the screen at the bottom of it then let's logo lg 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.420
 there is also a joystick down there 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:43.100
 control in case it doesn't work 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.569
 the remote has a red indicator 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.760
 some 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:55.689
 back view here with us we can see 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:58.519
 the power here is a headphone jack 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:01.939
 connector for the network if there is no Wi-Fi and 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.889
 just wire optical connector 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.950
 which 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:09.319
 meniscus from which he showed 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.500
 an adapter to a regular ramp called in 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:18.319
 one here there is a connector under 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:23.290
 plans there are adapters connector from satellite 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.290
 ordinary cable and here we have 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:37.699
 written 2 hdmi connectors 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:44.810
 but in my opinion here is a double connector view 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:45.169
 Side 1 hdmi usb connector and top 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:52.090
 we have 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:54.640
 seo slot is vertical and so little 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.640
 as the parameters of the TV itself I have 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.180
 42 inches diagonal 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:05.650
 its resolution is 3840 x 2160 pixels 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:10.360
 that is, this 4k does not hold 100 hertz either 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:13.410
 he has a true 4 processor cake to them about 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.799
 it now we will stop in more detail 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:21.389
 true 4k processor it improves video then 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.700
 have any incoming electronic signals 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:30.010
 I myself have downloaded the old series which 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:33.160
 I wanted to see on the laptop screen 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.370
 then you gi mun he in general looked like 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.710
 bad enough there and their squares and everything 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.500
 If here now see the setting who 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:50.710
 see it only 240 pixels 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:54.010
 A 45-minute series Dodge then it all 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.200
 weighs 90 megabytes that is a pity and in general 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.020
 then nine out of ten jackals just 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.970
 completely there and the squares are all one 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.110
 Well, probably now on the TV screen 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:07.360
 Tetris will be there but there is no process 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.680
 it improves the video and in general even 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.639
 such a compressed video is to tears, he 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.740
 more or less acceptable in general 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.320
 shows unity with what it is not very 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.200
 copes this analog signal through 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.150
 the antenna there seems to be very sad and 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.700
 a little bit but I donâ€™t actually look 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.409
 tv antenna 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.899
 Well 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:31.050
 live tv 7 is equipped that is with 

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:33.839
 March, you are here and the browser and cinema 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.679
 can do buy paid movies and 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:40.259
 watch for free and there are so many 

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:44.489
 what is there to browse is also very so + 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:48.409
 good i mean you can take there if 

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:51.300
 suddenly the computer is covered or do not know 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:56.369
 no, that is, go there to watch 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:59.689
 there is a cork weather anything there he is not 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:06:07.889
 very fast at working 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:09.509
 Well, of course, I also watched 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.719
 can you install my other videos i 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:15.959
 I will give links how to synchronize the phone 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:18.649
 with a TV set 

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:22.649
 withdraw from the phone on televisions and either 

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:25.169
 sync it to your computer through 

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:27.689
 wi-fi router that's all that's all 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:31.459
