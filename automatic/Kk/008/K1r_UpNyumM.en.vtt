oh<00:00:00.060> these<00:00:00.539> days<00:00:00.870> the<00:00:01.140> idea<00:00:01.439> of<00:00:01.560> a<00:00:01.620> storm<00:00:02.010> proof

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
oh these days the idea of a storm proof

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.579 
oh these days the idea of a storm proof
and<00:00:02.550> energy-efficient<00:00:03.419> home<00:00:03.600> sounds<00:00:04.259> great

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
and energy-efficient home sounds great

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.740 
and energy-efficient home sounds great
and<00:00:05.100> while<00:00:05.339> this<00:00:05.609> might<00:00:05.850> look<00:00:06.210> like<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.480> lego

it should also be environmentally

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.660 
it should also be environmentally
friendly<00:00:18.680> from<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.770> distance<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.279> looks<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.640> a

the proform system it's a method of
construction<00:00:30.480> where<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.869> do<00:00:31.019> stack<00:00:31.320> all<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
construction where you do stack all the

exterior walls using a styrofoam block

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.410 
exterior walls using a styrofoam block
then<00:00:35.010> once<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:35.489> get<00:00:35.579> them<00:00:35.700> all<00:00:35.760> stacked<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
then once we get them all stacked and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.450 
then once we get them all stacked and
braced<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.140> pour<00:00:37.380> concrete<00:00:37.590> inside<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.340> it

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
braced in we pour concrete inside of it
