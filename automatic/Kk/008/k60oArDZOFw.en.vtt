00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.980
 in this video we wanted to show the world 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.860
 league legends using big more 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.320
 diverse composition of characters i think 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.600
 here the main thing is to give more details who are all 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.880
 These characters look like the world in 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.170
 which they live 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.000
 when you play you only see 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.960
 a small part of a big story which 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.960
 we want to tell 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.470
 video with such a deep study 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.180
 lets you feel the champion 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.240
 makes you understand better portrayed 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.000
 characters in such videos are much more 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.150
 detailed graphics 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.800
 textures and patterns when we consider 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.600
 all of their faces we see them 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.690
 react to the situation and truly 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.820
 we understand their temperament and personality to us 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.740
 I had to find a balance in my own way 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.510
 the right moment and through which we 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.740
 could tell more about the character 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.740
 right during the action 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.020
 one of my favorite moments is when 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.560
 draven comes on millions 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.540
 leans and all their data boris 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.950
 it sucks to be you he doesn't even need it 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.950
 talk about him all written on his face 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.979
 there is such a mom who wanted a brother 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.570
 to portray 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:59.840
 graves is not impressed nothing is capable 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.640
 to impress grayson we've already seen everything 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.940
 We try to reflect this in his acting 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.300
 the game 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.380
 and then we still see the shadow of fear 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.840
 on his face 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.970
 see how he loses flour no 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.600
 manages to even raise guns cases 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:20.360
 Orage here at this moment a little graves 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:22.670
 scared and it's cool every character 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.440
 should be felt differently and move 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.150
 differently either fly jeans if 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.190
 someone waving an ax in a special way 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.290
 brother always shown if someone 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.480
 no particular champion swing 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.940
 will just as well wag the yard all 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.940
 characters have personality 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.739
 action besides there are still their figures 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.250
 understand the proportions 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.380
 their size each of these details is all this 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.910
 small bricks of which 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.940
 individuality of darius 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.420
 for example we made a powerful jaw 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:00.489
 eye size mouth even nose width attached 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.489
 he is so massively brutal 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.080
 ari we wanted to give fox grace 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:14.720
 therefore added such small details and 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:16.490
 street and eyes nose lips in of course u 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.590
 she has fox ears and tail 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.750
 but even her gestures in the video 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.420
 passes the main sliding such 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.230
 prowling running style showing or 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.230
 sue nature 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.540
 one of the most difficult tasks 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.340
 we stood was made sound 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.470
 design of the video so that players 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.800
 even with eyes closed could immediately 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.840
 learn your favorite characters with 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.080
 sonic point of view of work on the roller 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.940
 always begins noise noise sound 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.160
 these are essentially different sounds that 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.840
 man can publish therefore we 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.320
 write down the armor saber 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.270
 rustling of leather or fabric steps of noise and 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.280
 very important for narration as 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.380
 it 's about making a video from scratch 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.390
 you have not recorded live sound 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.790
 tracks and all the sounds of movements account for 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.790
 create manually for each character 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.670
 if he was her hard because the place 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.820
 powerful character in armor has already been 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.310
 Darius is busy so for leon and us 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.890
 I had to look for some zest 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.520
 high sounds from which would just blow 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.520
 the sun 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.130
 I wanted our video to stand out with 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.440
 musical point of view everyone 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.910
 the character needs its own theme music and 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.070
 and not easy to pick up 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:04.440
 you don't have much in the world 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:06.570
 musical instruments nautilus was 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.640
 really difficult well that's how should 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.250
 sound healthy anger suit 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.250
 but when you start thinking is 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:18.080
 fairly straightforward approach he walks 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.080
 under water means there we will search 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.610
 we want after watching the video 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.100
 communication of players with their champions 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.050
 grow stronger 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.760
 I play a lot for Jax and lead him 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.410
 the screen and the incarnation I'm stronger 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.260
 attached to this character 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:13.020
 when i watch videos i understand this my 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.170
 grandfather and I shout back because 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.860
 I often play with Darius cool like me 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.750
 broke 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.150
 such dialogues may occur behind 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.010
 view our video this video 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.230
 imbued with love and passion for our game 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.940
 so when they see the players will get 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.070
 as much pleasure as you got 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.110
 when we did it and let's do 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.820
 something else cool for our players 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.820
 Well, to see for yourself too
