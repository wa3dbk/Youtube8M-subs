00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.730
 we are here with esteban gutierrez third 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.380
 ferrari team driver for 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.689
 talk about the next grand prix you are 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.490
 will dispute in china shanghai is a circuit 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.020
 very different from that of Malaysia 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:40.070
 how can you describe it in a few 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:42.020
 words is very different indeed 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.970
 main feature of the circuit 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.580
 of shanghai is that there are many curves 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.470
 as fast as curve 1 the one before 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.570
 long straight in the last part of the 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:56.120
 route 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:58.910
 with these two they put a strain on i 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.500
 Front age tires considering 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.360
 that asphalt temperatures do not 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.610
 certainly reach that of 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.190
 Malaysia this changes a lot 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.210
 conditions in which the tires work and the 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:15.500
 type of trim needed spec v 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.090
 mont of port of mi I expect that for 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.460
 we will be a bit more difficult 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.560
 because the fact that the Malay to 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.050
 temperatures were so high it gave us 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.959
 an advantage denied our low 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:32.149
 tire degradation level in 

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:33.890
 china peoples we can tell fi hope to 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.530
 see the distance decrease again 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.140
 from our opponents to be able to exploit 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.880
 at best our current potential is 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.509
 to have a weekend without 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.509
 drawbacks 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.300
 has highlighted very well the peculiarities 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.980
 of the imposing shanghai circuit 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.420
 also important braking and therefore the 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.350
 front tire management is 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.350
 fundamental 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.980
 the sealing problem 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.860
 let's talk more in detail about the set-up 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.440
 specific required on this track 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.179
 and to normal what you are looking for 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.920
 do normally for an attention 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.510
 particular to the management of the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.250
 balance of the rear of the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.640
 car and the fact that there is more 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.960
 oversteer the usual also wear 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.360
 of the front tires can be a 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.310
 Unlimited factor a race land I do not have 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.870
 still looked at the weather forecast but 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.090
 last year for example was 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.800
 quite cold when on the asphalt la 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.140
 temperature is low and the tires 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.270
 front wheels are put to the test by 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.070
 major braking occurs on 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.810
 Greek phenomenon 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.610
 this possibility must be kept in 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.560
 considering how ready the 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.190
 strategy give in this year in 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.900
 outbound exists ours we talked about 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.060
 of the long straight track of 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.990
 shanghai can represent a good one 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.990
 overtaking opportunities 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.270
 absolutely yes it is definitely a great one 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.340
 possibility at the same time and not 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.770
 I remember badly the longest straight of the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.940
 world now similar to what we will see a 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:15.150
 Mexico City 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:18.090
 I think it's a Chinese flight circuit that 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.800
 puts a strain on the brakes you get 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.099
 at the end of the long straight of one 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.130
 speed of about 330 kilometers per hour 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.959
 there is a hairpin to deal with at 50 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.290
 kilometers per hour and braking distance 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.019
 it is about 120 meters and thus decreases 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.519
 so speed in so little space is 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.630
 really a great commitment for 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.250
 the braking system 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.110
 this is probably one of the 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.290
 main features and this 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.290
 route 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.880
 China is also a very market 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.709
 important for the ferrari and its 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.080
 road cars and shanghai ensure 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:04:03.790
 very charming tenacity you are happy 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:12.170
 to go there but murdoch on pole with joy 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:14.900
 I like traveling a lot and I think it is 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.760
 a huge privilege to have a kind of 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.950
 life that allows us to see all the 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.950
 world the winter values ​​in time so it seems 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.200
 we never stop having the opportunity to 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.300
 seeing cities like shanghai is a lot 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.610
 stimulating even if we never have 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.590
 plenty of time to devote to the real visit 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.240
 it is a resort's own 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.550
 extremely positive to have the 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.440
 possibility of seeing different cultures e 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.419
 together we have lots of fans at 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.639
 customers we are happy to be able to 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.639
 meet rift to them
