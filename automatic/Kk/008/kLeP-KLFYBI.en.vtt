the<00:02:37.500> most<00:02:37.859> easiest<00:02:38.579> ways<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:39.060> would<00:02:39.269> say<00:02:39.480> of

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
the most easiest ways I would say of

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.250 
the most easiest ways I would say of
going<00:02:39.840> about<00:02:40.079> adding<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.859> so<00:02:41.849> let's<00:02:42.150> go<00:02:42.959> back

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
going about adding it so let's go back

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.280 
going about adding it so let's go back
to<00:02:43.439> a<00:02:43.470> host<00:02:43.799> file<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:44.730> we<00:02:44.849> just<00:02:45.120> run<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.989> take

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
to a host file so we just run the take

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.129 
to a host file so we just run the take
ownership<00:02:46.500> part<00:02:47.099> as<00:02:47.280> well<00:02:47.720> which<00:02:48.720> will<00:02:48.989> now

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
ownership part as well which will now

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.190 
ownership part as well which will now
allow<00:02:49.409> us<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.709> open<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.280> edit<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.609> file<00:02:51.200> so

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
allow us to open and edit this file so

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.849 
allow us to open and edit this file so
if<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.349> open<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:52.859> inside<00:02:53.459> notepad<00:02:54.090> here

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
if I open this inside notepad here

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.229 
if I open this inside notepad here
another<00:02:55.859> way<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.190> doing<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.519> in<00:02:56.639> notepad<00:02:56.849> is

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
another way of doing it in notepad is

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.420 
another way of doing it in notepad is
running<00:02:57.930> notepad<00:02:58.409> as<00:02:58.560> administrator<00:02:59.250> and

open it in that way I won't bother
showing<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.459> way<00:03:03.290> but<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:05.099> just<00:03:05.340> need

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
showing you that way but you just need

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.879 
showing you that way but you just need
to<00:03:05.609> open<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.120> up<00:03:06.209> now<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.450> as<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.870> can<00:03:07.019> see<00:03:07.079> we

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
now can edit our hosts file if you

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.080 
now can edit our hosts file if you
wanted<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.129> block<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.700> particular<00:03:12.209> website<00:03:14.090> you

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
wanted to block a particular website you

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.879 
wanted to block a particular website you
would<00:03:15.209> actually<00:03:15.359> use<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:15.989> IP<00:03:16.379> here<00:03:17.370> okay<00:03:18.889> so

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
would actually use this IP here okay so

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:25.670 
would actually use this IP here okay so
this<00:03:20.459> IP<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:21.389> would<00:03:21.510> use<00:03:21.750> just<00:03:24.590> straighten<00:03:25.590> it

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
this IP you would use just straighten it

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.000 
this IP you would use just straighten it
up<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.069> then<00:03:26.790> what<00:03:27.329> you<00:03:27.419> would<00:03:27.540> do<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.560> put<00:03:28.859> the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
up and then what you would do is put the

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.409 
up and then what you would do is put the
location<00:03:29.430> or<00:03:29.849> the<00:03:31.400> actual<00:03:32.400> site<00:03:32.699> so<00:03:33.060> if<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.239> put

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
location or the actual site so if I put

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:37.819 
location or the actual site so if I put
BBC<00:03:33.959> co<00:03:34.500> dot<00:03:34.650> u<00:03:34.859> K<00:03:35.299> so<00:03:36.299> this<00:03:37.230> will<00:03:37.409> now<00:03:37.560> block

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
BBC co dot u K so this will now block

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.599 
BBC co dot u K so this will now block
