dishes<00:01:24.550> in<00:01:24.880> my<00:01:24.910> book<00:01:25.240> because<00:01:25.720> they<00:01:26.020> are<00:01:26.200> the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
dishes in my book because they are the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.490 
dishes in my book because they are the
most<00:01:26.619> complicated<00:01:27.190> if<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:27.729> did<00:01:28.080> 90%<00:01:29.080> on<00:01:29.170> my<00:01:29.289> book

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
most complicated if I did 90% on my book

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.930 
most complicated if I did 90% on my book
which<00:01:29.679> is<00:01:29.800> a<00:01:29.830> lot<00:01:29.979> of<00:01:30.100> lentils<00:01:30.459> and<00:01:30.580> beans<00:01:30.640> it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
which is a lot of lentils and beans it

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.760 
which is a lot of lentils and beans it
would<00:01:31.030> just<00:01:31.179> be<00:01:31.300> okay<00:01:31.780> chop<00:01:32.050> this<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.410> dump<00:01:32.619> it

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
would just be okay chop this and dump it

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.559 
would just be okay chop this and dump it
it<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.100> then<00:01:33.250> essentially<00:01:33.850> it<00:01:34.119> so<00:01:34.300> this<00:01:34.420> is

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
it and then essentially it so this is

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:36.749 
it and then essentially it so this is
just<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.200> little<00:01:35.500> bit<00:01:35.619> more<00:01:35.800> complicated<00:01:36.130> okay

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
just a little bit more complicated okay

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.100 
just a little bit more complicated okay
and<00:01:36.970> it's<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.179> lot<00:01:37.360> of<00:01:37.390> layering<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.020> we're

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
and it's a lot of layering so we're

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.749 
and it's a lot of layering so we're
gonna<00:01:38.200> let<00:01:38.440> that<00:01:38.470> cook<00:01:38.830> up<00:01:39.069> as<00:01:39.310> it<00:01:39.459> kind<00:01:39.670> of

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
gonna let that cook up as it kind of

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.460 
gonna let that cook up as it kind of
gets<00:01:39.970> that<00:01:40.060> nice<00:01:40.240> aroma<00:01:40.660> and<00:01:41.080> we're<00:01:41.289> going<00:01:41.410> to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
gets that nice aroma and we're going to

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.440 
gets that nice aroma and we're going to
take<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.679> marinade<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.369> marinade<00:01:42.759> is<00:01:42.880> so<00:01:43.119> key

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
take the marinade the marinade is so key

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.270 
take the marinade the marinade is so key
and<00:01:43.690> in<00:01:43.869> my<00:01:44.050> marinade<00:01:44.440> I've<00:01:44.619> done<00:01:44.800> basically

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
and in my marinade I've done basically

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.999 
and in my marinade I've done basically
ginger<00:01:46.209> garlic<00:01:46.539> grated<00:01:47.110> which<00:01:47.679> gives<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:47.979> a

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
ginger garlic grated which gives you a

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.380 
ginger garlic grated which gives you a
great<00:01:48.250> flavor<00:01:48.550> instead<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:48.970> having<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.270> use<00:01:49.360> a

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
great flavor instead of having to use a

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.650 
great flavor instead of having to use a
food<00:01:49.780> processor<00:01:49.840> a<00:01:50.590> little<00:01:51.130> bit<00:01:51.250> of<00:01:51.369> mint<00:01:52.300> and
