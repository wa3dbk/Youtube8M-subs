the backlight keyboard completely new
and<00:00:16.400> novel<00:00:16.580> experience<00:00:17.240> for<00:00:17.420> me<00:00:17.540> I've<00:00:17.689> never

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
and novel experience for me I've never

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.780 
and novel experience for me I've never
had<00:00:17.990> a<00:00:18.020> backlight<00:00:18.410> keyboard<00:00:18.650> before<00:00:19.160> and<00:00:19.550> this

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790 
had a backlight keyboard before and this

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.570 
had a backlight keyboard before and this
one<00:00:20.029> comes<00:00:20.330> with<00:00:20.390> quite<00:00:20.720> a<00:00:20.750> few<00:00:21.080> options<00:00:21.550> so<00:00:22.550> I

one comes with quite a few options so I

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.910 
one comes with quite a few options so I
brought<00:00:23.000> up<00:00:23.270> the<00:00:23.390> smarts<00:00:24.260> manager<00:00:24.740> on

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920

indeed the Ibaka light keyboard if I

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.400 
indeed the Ibaka light keyboard if I
just<00:00:32.330> zoom<00:00:32.419> in<00:00:32.660> for<00:00:32.750> a<00:00:32.840> second<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:33.199> show<00:00:33.260> you

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
just zoom in for a second to show you

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.229 
just zoom in for a second to show you
options<00:00:33.800> that<00:00:33.890> we<00:00:33.980> have<00:00:34.250> they<00:00:35.120> are<00:00:35.150> on<00:00:37.239> two

options that we have they are on two

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.840 
options that we have they are on two
different<00:00:38.479> settings<00:00:39.080> off<00:00:39.890> which<00:00:40.699> it

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
different settings off which it

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.689 
different settings off which it
currently<00:00:41.120> is<00:00:41.210> at<00:00:41.330> the<00:00:41.390> moment<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:41.900> auto<00:00:42.699> so

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
currently is at the moment and auto so

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.570 
currently is at the moment and auto so
just<00:00:44.330> to<00:00:44.420> demonstrate<00:00:44.449> first<00:00:45.379> of<00:00:45.530> all<00:00:45.710> this<00:00:46.370> is

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
just to demonstrate first of all this is

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.000 
just to demonstrate first of all this is
what<00:00:46.729> the<00:00:46.879> keyboard<00:00:47.180> looks<00:00:47.570> like<00:00:47.900> when<00:00:48.860> it's

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
what the keyboard looks like when it's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.009 
what the keyboard looks like when it's
on<00:00:49.220> and<00:00:49.400> off<00:00:49.489> I'll<00:00:49.879> have<00:00:50.089> to<00:00:50.239> just<00:00:50.750> turn<00:00:50.900> off

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
on and off I'll have to just turn off

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.229 
on and off I'll have to just turn off
the<00:00:51.140> lights<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.500> demonstrate<00:00:51.949> this<00:00:52.120> so<00:00:53.120> the

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
the lights to demonstrate this so the

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.630 
the lights to demonstrate this so the
first<00:00:53.510> test<00:00:53.750> is<00:00:54.019> to<00:00:54.140> turn<00:00:54.409> on<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:55.190> backlight

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
first test is to turn on the backlight

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:03.280 
first test is to turn on the backlight
keyboard<00:00:55.820> at<00:00:56.299> 50%<00:00:59.559> there<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:00.680> go<00:01:02.080> I'll<00:01:03.080> just

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
keyboard at 50% there you go I'll just

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.869 
keyboard at 50% there you go I'll just
zoom<00:01:03.650> in<00:01:03.830> on<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:04.159> keyboard<00:01:04.549> a<00:01:04.580> little<00:01:04.760> bit

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
zoom in on the keyboard a little bit

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.959 
zoom in on the keyboard a little bit
more<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:05.269> you<00:01:05.360> can<00:01:05.479> see<00:01:05.630> how<00:01:05.869> bright<00:01:06.320> it<00:01:06.650> is

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:06.969 
more so you can see how bright it is

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:12.099 
more so you can see how bright it is
that's<00:01:07.969> at<00:01:08.119> 50%<00:01:08.509> and<00:01:10.180> then<00:01:11.180> I<00:01:11.390> will<00:01:11.600> switch<00:01:11.899> it

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:12.109 
that's at 50% and then I will switch it

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:14.800 
that's at 50% and then I will switch it
to<00:01:12.140> 100%<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:14.210> we'll<00:01:14.390> see<00:01:14.509> what<00:01:14.719> the

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
to 100% and we'll see what the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.069 
to 100% and we'll see what the
difference<00:01:15.140> is<00:01:16.210> much<00:01:17.210> more<00:01:17.450> illumination

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
difference is much more illumination

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:19.929 
difference is much more illumination
they<00:01:18.229> can<00:01:18.439> even<00:01:18.710> see<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.070> keys<00:01:19.310> from<00:01:19.729> this

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
they can even see the keys from this

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.179 
they can even see the keys from this
distance<00:01:20.420> on<00:01:20.869> that<00:01:21.259> test<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:23.210> there<00:01:23.750> we<00:01:23.869> are

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
distance on that test and there we are

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.069 
distance on that test and there we are
so<00:01:25.189> what<00:01:25.520> are<00:01:25.640> you<00:01:25.759> going<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:25.969> do<00:01:26.119> now<00:01:26.329> is<00:01:26.750> I'm

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
so what are you going to do now is I'm

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.399 
so what are you going to do now is I'm
going<00:01:27.229> to<00:01:27.320> turn<00:01:27.530> on<00:01:27.829> the<00:01:28.039> light<00:01:28.689> a<00:01:29.689> little<00:01:30.109> lamp

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
going to turn on the light a little lamp

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.800 
going to turn on the light a little lamp
next<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:30.859> the<00:01:30.979> keyboard<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:31.520> then<00:01:32.119> put<00:01:32.539> the

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
next to the keyboard and then put the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.739 
next to the keyboard and then put the
cueball<00:01:33.590> setting<00:01:33.950> on<00:01:34.100> Auto<00:01:34.369> so<00:01:35.270> that's<00:01:35.450> turned

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 
cueball setting on Auto so that's turned

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:37.630 
cueball setting on Auto so that's turned
off<00:01:35.929> about<00:01:36.200> light<00:01:36.350> keyboard<00:01:36.799> now<00:01:36.979> because

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
off about light keyboard now because

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.160 
off about light keyboard now because
there<00:01:37.759> is<00:01:37.880> light<00:01:38.090> but<00:01:38.539> hopefully<00:01:38.899> what<00:01:39.020> should

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
there is light but hopefully what should

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.889 
there is light but hopefully what should
happen<00:01:39.289> when<00:01:39.649> I<00:01:39.710> turn<00:01:40.009> off<00:01:40.219> the<00:01:40.399> light<00:01:40.579> in<00:01:41.090> the

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
happen when I turn off the light in the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.649 
happen when I turn off the light in the
room<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:42.880> backlight<00:01:43.880> keyboard<00:01:44.090> should<00:01:44.479> come

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
room the backlight keyboard should come

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.039 
room the backlight keyboard should come
on<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.789> there<00:01:46.789> you<00:01:46.969> see<00:01:47.270> it<00:01:47.299> after<00:01:47.630> about<00:01:47.869> half

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
on and there you see it after about half

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.349 
on and there you see it after about half
a<00:01:48.380> second<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:49.340> lights<00:01:49.609> came<00:01:49.939> on<00:01:50.090> on<00:01:50.299> the

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
a second the lights came on on the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:55.080 
a second the lights came on on the
keyboard<00:01:50.719> so<00:01:51.049> just<00:01:51.289> to<00:01:51.350> demonstrate<00:01:51.380> again

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.099 

and<00:01:56.090> there<00:01:56.630> we<00:01:56.719> go

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
and there we go

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.219 
and there we go
it<00:01:57.439> looks<00:01:57.829> like<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:59.420> keyboard<00:01:59.869> backlight

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
it looks like the keyboard backlight

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.340 
it looks like the keyboard backlight
keyboard<00:02:00.530> comes<00:02:00.920> on<00:02:01.069> at<00:02:01.189> 50%<00:02:01.960> because<00:02:02.960> that's

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
keyboard comes on at 50% because that's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.230 
keyboard comes on at 50% because that's
what<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.649> looks<00:02:03.829> like<00:02:04.069> at<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.819> moment<00:02:04.939> but<00:02:05.119> if

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
what it looks like at the moment but if

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.440 
what it looks like at the moment but if
I<00:02:05.359> put<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.799> 100%<00:02:06.799> but<00:02:07.130> quite<00:02:07.369> keyboard<00:02:07.729> on<00:02:07.880> you

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
I put the 100% but quite keyboard on you

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.359 
I put the 100% but quite keyboard on you
can<00:02:08.600> see<00:02:08.720> little<00:02:08.869> lights<00:02:09.140> up<00:02:09.289> even<00:02:09.710> more<00:02:09.920> so
