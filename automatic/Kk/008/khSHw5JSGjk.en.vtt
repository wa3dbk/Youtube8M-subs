00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 or lies ahead and warmly comes to 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.450
 a new mini edition of nordeck 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.820
 Today with a very interesting 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.590
 tip and how can you not only 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.389
 There are enough photos and videos for that 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.940
 apps in the app store but how can you 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.090
 actually ios apps on your iphone 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.039
 like here in my extras 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.480
 folder the whole apple apps the no 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.920
 I need my human I do not know 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.990
 which of them you really never need 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.960
 but with me there are a few hiding 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.619
 and that is actually possible if you 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.870
 here simply the first page of yours 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.880
 homescreens completely full as you have 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.860
 so i need it at iphone 5 and 5 s 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.420
 and so on all four times 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.090
 five fields will be taken and best 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.520
 Also the bottom of the dock and then you push 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.590
 the app you want to get rid of when you are 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.629
 let's just say that here 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.950
 the second page does one 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.750
 second homescreen on is also no matter 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.100
 if there are other apps if you are 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.989
 So generally more than a room screener 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.480
 not bad until now we keep the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.820
 pushed all here push it back 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.739
 at first and pretend to 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.019
 We with another app on a folder 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.400
 make every folder publicly her 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.380
 Keep the app the whole time 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.640
 wanted to hide pressed now pulls 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.070
 the whole thing down 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.299
 the folder is closing and now 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.250
 we have the episode about the dock 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.830
 float down and just let go 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.140
 So easy is the whole thing 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.509
 you see here from the extras she is 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.340
 disappeared now want the home 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.780
 screen serve the apps as well 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.950
 to wiggle and there is none 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.590
 second homescreen more 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.000
 that means the app is gone where do we find it 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.170
 if we are here now in spotlight 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.909
 Of course we can always go for it 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.549
 I still find and open my name 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.470
 just think tips 1 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.170
 that is as I said already gone and here 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.810
 we have the tips app quite simply the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.640
 is now here on a small thing 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.340
 chips dumont iphone and here you see 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.920
 but the tips app is nowhere in there 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.579
 So I'll make you here too now 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.710
 nothing before 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.210
 she was here before on the second 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.619
 side there you see three missing medium 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.899
 piece as I said still the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.909
 newsstand and the app I'm watching 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.170
 just hid and if you have that 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.700
 want to restore whole then must 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.890
 restart your iphone for a short time 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.630
 then the apps should all come back on 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.819
 appear on this second homescreen 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.780
 where they last hide before hiding 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.850
 were placed 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.990
 it happens automatically you can do that 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.250
 unfortunately not prevent it if you have it 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.870
 Actually she wants to hide 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.790
 you have to stay that every time 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.290
 repeat but I found it somehow 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.160
 a nice guy of course saves money here 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.319
 unfortunately I have no memory space 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.390
 but it just looks great when you go with it 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.319
 enough apps I think a bit 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.870
 tidier 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.910
 and that was it again when 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.530
 you liked the tip then I am 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.819
 just subscribed to the thumbs up 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.720
 the channel if you have not yet 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.520
 should have done 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.190
 Just click through 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.330
 go through our other videos and write 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.489
 me and in the comments 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.900
 which apps he really enjoys 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.239
 always wanted to have hidden and 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.070
 what her this tip now that we 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.290
 knew him would have used me 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.950
 really interested and therefore 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.239

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.830
 Bye and see you next time too 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.830
