00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:35.869
 Second Colossus hardy time 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.869
 a tec nep gol fashion seals 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.770
 Let's go to the second hardy colossus until 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.840
 that in this second colossus we have there 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.240
 four minutes and 30 seconds to 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.850
 defeat it is why I already stopped at 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.950
 front of the colossus where the flash in the hand 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.500
 He already saw that I'm here in front of him. 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.240
 it will raise its front legs and it is 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.120
 At this point I have to accept the 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.950
 arrow on the bottom of my paw I was wrong 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.800
 first sucker 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.290
 The second I have now accepted sword in the 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.800
 hand and we're going to come up here in the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.380
 Colossus paw on the floor this 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.750
 second with us in atec hard times mode 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.390
 it has three vital points 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.830
 while in normal mode it displays 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.830
 only two vital points 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.680
 now I'll try to use the trick here 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.340
 Let's see if it will work 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.140
 Look who was light here in turned 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.270
 I took advantage of the very 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.980
 movement of the colossus to rise here in 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.570
 Up and only in this I saved some time there 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.540
 considerable and here is the first 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.720
 vital point of the colossus good in the bootie 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.560
 let's copy this region first 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.560
 The blow was gone. 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.799
 according to the bope, it was once the only island 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.350
 how many strokes are needed from the point 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:26.260
 vital does not disappear here is hard malu 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.420
 then it disappeared and where it appeared 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.570
 nothing comes back scoundrel 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.980
 I almost went down now . 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:40.720
 Security there is only safe. 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.630
 a blow I think it's only me there now yes 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.390
 Let's go to the head now, that's where the 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.150
 second vital point as here in the 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.600
 I would run that our time is short 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:56.610
 It does not stop and neither does the nema stopwatch. 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:00.250
 that let's then look at that scene time 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.569
 I got it in my head and now I advise 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.969
 you stay exactly at this point 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.700
 all because you see it does not matter what 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:11.700
 when the colossus moves the vander 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.599
 do not lose your balance so stay 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.910
 right here where I am and go ps 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:23.180
 the land without pity without mercy that the 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:25.979
 power is blood on us another blow 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.289
 firmness the vital point has already 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.479
 third and last vital point is here 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.789
 or on the side of the colossus near 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:36.210
 belly then here let's go let's go 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:40.560
 Let's see, let's just 1 minute and 50 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.539
 seconds boy it's here in the 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.789
 side I'm going to fall 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.770
 I grabbed the hair and the vital point is here 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.590
 3rd and last 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.650
 and this vital point here of the belly of the 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.990
 colossus is the most critical vital point 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.750
 because they see that vander does not have 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.720
 support in this region as 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.729
 walking the vander is swinging 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.000
 very expensive then this region here is 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:10.199
 complicated in nothing more than calmly in the 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.080
 CES am unable more 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:15.349
 swordfish bora girl is the mine is in 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.199
 end 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:21.210
 Look, the vander has no balance but 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:27.630
 it will not end yet another blow 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:30.900
 we'll boy is this second there 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.690
 colossus finalized within the time here 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.759
 No hard time until I hope everyone 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.699
