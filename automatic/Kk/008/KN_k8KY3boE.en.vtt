00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
to one final a little loop around the

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.110 
to one final a little loop around the
inside<00:06:53.920> here<00:06:54.990> basically<00:06:55.990> on<00:06:56.560> the<00:06:56.910> trim<00:06:57.910> ring

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
inside here basically on the trim ring

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.050 
inside here basically on the trim ring
and<00:06:58.570> the<00:06:58.960> outside<00:06:59.320> of<00:06:59.350> the<00:06:59.470> vehicle<00:07:00.060> sometimes

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.060 
and the outside of the vehicle sometimes

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.240 
and the outside of the vehicle sometimes
what<00:07:01.270> I<00:07:01.450> would<00:07:01.600> do<00:07:01.750> is<00:07:01.930> go<00:07:02.680> on<00:07:02.770> the<00:07:02.830> inside<00:07:03.220> of

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250 
what I would do is go on the inside of

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.460 
what I would do is go on the inside of
this<00:07:03.430> bottom<00:07:03.790> channel<00:07:04.240> here<00:07:04.960> so<00:07:04.990> you<00:07:05.260> can<00:07:05.380> have

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.470 
this bottom channel here so you can have

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.410 
this bottom channel here so you can have
your<00:07:05.620> finger<00:07:05.920> just<00:07:06.100> kind<00:07:06.310> of<00:07:06.370> rub<00:07:06.550> along<00:07:07.150> there

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:07.420 
your finger just kind of rub along there

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.810 
your finger just kind of rub along there
to<00:07:07.720> keep<00:07:07.900> that<00:07:08.050> open<00:07:08.230> for<00:07:08.410> you<00:07:11.340> just<00:07:12.340> go<00:07:12.520> around

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
to keep that open for you just go around

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.410 
to keep that open for you just go around
one<00:07:13.060> more<00:07:13.270> time<00:07:14.460> make<00:07:15.460> sure<00:07:15.490> it's<00:07:15.850> good

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:16.420 
one more time make sure it's good

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.990 
one more time make sure it's good
once<00:07:16.960> again<00:07:17.110> it's<00:07:17.620> very<00:07:17.950> important<00:07:18.520> that<00:07:18.700> it's

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 
once again it's very important that it's

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.230 
once again it's very important that it's
a<00:07:19.180> it's<00:07:19.510> at<00:07:19.690> least<00:07:20.050> above<00:07:20.560> 65<00:07:21.160> degrees<00:07:21.550> out<00:07:21.760> or

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 
a it's at least above 65 degrees out or

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.700 
a it's at least above 65 degrees out or
you're<00:07:22.540> in<00:07:22.600> a<00:07:22.660> garage<00:07:22.840> where<00:07:23.170> you<00:07:23.230> can<00:07:23.380> do<00:07:23.530> this

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:23.710 
you're in a garage where you can do this

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.980 
you're in a garage where you can do this
and<00:07:23.920> make<00:07:24.040> sure<00:07:24.070> that<00:07:24.340> this<00:07:24.520> this<00:07:25.480> adheres

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990 
and make sure that this this adheres

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.700 
and make sure that this this adheres
very<00:07:26.290> good<00:07:27.240> okay<00:07:28.240> so<00:07:28.300> now<00:07:28.630> cuz<00:07:29.320> we're<00:07:29.500> letting

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:29.710 
very good okay so now cuz we're letting

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:35.240 
very good okay so now cuz we're letting
this<00:07:29.800> dry<00:07:30.510> make<00:07:31.510> sure<00:07:31.690> that's<00:07:31.810> nice<00:07:32.140> and<00:07:32.200> dry

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.250 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.680 

usually<00:07:36.250> dries<00:07:36.520> pretty<00:07:36.850> quick<00:07:37.120> what<00:07:37.450> we<00:07:37.540> have

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:37.690 
usually dries pretty quick what we have

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.280 
usually dries pretty quick what we have
here<00:07:37.990> if<00:07:38.650> our<00:07:38.770> rubber<00:07:39.040> molded<00:07:39.880> trim<00:07:40.330> ring<00:07:40.540> now

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:41.290 
here if our rubber molded trim ring now

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.040 
here if our rubber molded trim ring now
we<00:07:41.350> do<00:07:41.650> this<00:07:41.830> our<00:07:42.160> goal<00:07:42.370> is<00:07:43.060> to<00:07:43.360> start<00:07:43.660> mend

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.050 
we do this our goal is to start mend

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.200 
we do this our goal is to start mend
this<00:07:44.260> in<00:07:44.410> the<00:07:44.470> same<00:07:44.710> spot<00:07:45.160> is<00:07:45.460> our<00:07:45.820> interior

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.210 
this in the same spot is our interior

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.940 
this in the same spot is our interior
molding<00:07:46.780> is<00:07:46.900> so<00:07:47.140> basically<00:07:47.530> we're<00:07:47.770> going<00:07:47.890> to

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:47.950 
molding is so basically we're going to

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.190 
molding is so basically we're going to
start<00:07:48.220> it<00:07:48.400> here<00:07:48.700> work<00:07:49.330> our<00:07:49.540> way<00:07:49.690> around<00:07:49.810> and

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:50.200 
start it here work our way around and

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.430 
start it here work our way around and
come<00:07:50.260> back<00:07:50.410> to<00:07:50.740> here<00:07:50.950> so
