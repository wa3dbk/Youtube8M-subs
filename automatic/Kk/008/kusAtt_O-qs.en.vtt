00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.630
We don’t often review pick-ups here at Car
Keys, but when you realise the L200 was Mitsubishi’s

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.829
best-selling vehicle in 2014, it just shows
how popular these practical work horses have

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.850
become in Britain.
Fitted with a double cab like the L200 behind

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.090
me, you can have a practical family car, with
a large loading bed that can also go off-road.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.360
Pickups can also save business owners money,
because its status as a commercial vehicle

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.760
means they don’t have to stump up for company
car tax.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.440
Despite its utilitarian roots, the L200 certainly
has one of the most car-like interiors amongst

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.109
its rivals, with a steering wheel which is
good to hold and well laid-out controls. Our

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:09.060
main criticism is the dashboard’s shiny
plastics, but at least they look tough and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.800
should be easy to keep clean. Still, the VW
Amarok manages to feel classier inside overall.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.670
The L200 wins back points with its plentiful
cubby holes and cup holders, and that could

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.380
make life easier if your pickup doubles up
as a mobile office.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.910
The back bench in the double cab is quite
spacious, with plenty of legroom, and the

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.310
seats are actually quite comfortable, unlike
some rivals whose rear seats are rather firm

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.640
and force you to sit bolt upright.
The most important thing about any pick-up

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.110
is obviously its bed, and this load area is
1.5 metres long and just under 1.5 metres

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.110
at its widest point. Choose the smaller Club
or Single cab and the passenger space shrinks,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.110
but the bed grows to 1.8 or 2.2 metres in
length. All three can carry a tonne of cargo,

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.459
that’s literally one tonne. You can also
choose options like a tonneau cover or even

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:56.630
a rear enclosure to keep items secure, just
like this one.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.000
You sit quite high up in the L200, so drivers
of 4x4s will feel instantly at home. For those

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.910
more used to smaller cars, the large door
mirrors and tight turning circle make life

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.560
easier, but we’d recommend you opt for a
rear parking camera, or at least sensors,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.870
because it’s almost impossible to judge
how far you can reverse into spaces.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.560
Up the pace and there’s not too much body
roll in corners and the brakes feel powerful,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:34.200
but the vague steering needs fairly large
inputs when tackling sharper bends. The gearbox

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.840
feels tough as old boots, but also rather
agricultural, with lots of vibrations coming

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.020
through, even in neutral.
Using these levers you can select four-wheel

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:53.830
drive and a low ratio gearbox to maximise
power at very slow speeds.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.980
The 2.5-litre diesel has 134bhp and lots of
torque, so it feels powerful enough to tow

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.450
large trailers, and quicker than its official
nought to 62mph time of 15 seconds would suggest.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:13.819
That’s partly because it makes so much noise
when you put your foot down, it feels like

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:22.300
more must be happening. Refinement is definitely
an area where pickups lag behind cars and

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.200
most 4x4s.
As 4x4s have taken a step upmarket, versatile

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.680
and rugged pick-ups have stepped in to take
their place. Commercial vehicle status, along

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.860
with 35mpg economy and attractive deals has
certainly made them affordable for many businesses.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.380
With different cab sizes and trim levels,
right from the basic 4Work to the Barbarian

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.890
double-cab you see behind me, Mitsubishi can
also tailor the L200 to your needs. That’s

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.390
work use sorted, but for regular family outings,
a more refined engine and plusher interior

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.620
would do wonders.
But, what do you think of the Mitsubishi L200?
