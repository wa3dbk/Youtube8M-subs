00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Good day, I quite often 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.330
 I use our rail services 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.429
 because of the year i have like it says 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.040
 itâ€™s boiling so today let's 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.630
 talk about d exchange and how it sees 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.749
 ordinary passenger 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.749
 [music] 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.750
 the basis of any railway 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.270
 it is the canvas itself and the rolling 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.100
 the composition of which moves on it is not 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.110
 I will spend your time about the state 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.880
 paid on some parts of the iron 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.160
 the roads will best say my photos 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.160
 so let's move on to the second one. 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.660
 so arranged that trains have a deadline 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.850
 operational services still more 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.610
 than cars but they have their 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.010
 restrictions even Moscow region to 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.070
 so far train trains are designed 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.260
 in the 70s some of them already 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.729
 almost 45 years old let them pass 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.650
 overhauls 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.960
 ordinary passenger from this much 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.330
 more pleasant do not become rusty cars 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.700
 wooden seats yes I still 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.760
 come across and in the yard if that already 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.009
 second decade of the 21st century skipping 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.810
 all air wash package dim 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.090
 lighting and of course the absence 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.400
 heating she of course can and 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.619
 be present but the machinists themselves are afraid 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.320
 include it is likely that after 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.570
 such a train just get up and again 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.480
 these are only points of view of the passengers themselves 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.460
 machinists will tell you more 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.500
 [music] 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:46.800
 gentlemen good look poor how 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.830
 stone age spoon type stand here 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.289
 voltage button control system 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.179
 failed but pay attention to the remote 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.399
 control completely fill with water 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.520
 how can you ride such 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.100
 how can electric locomotives work in such 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.959
 conditions 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.670
 Well, for example, I was scared to go to 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.039
 train that sausage in all 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.050
 side and 2 it reached 60 kilometers 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.720
 at one o'clock on the arrows issued such 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.300
 the gnash that the ears laid and it was 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.430
 not at all isolated cases informers 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.590
 remind us that this railway 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.810
 danger zone twill yes it 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.970
 in general extreme is not the best way all about 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.800
 what I said above shows that she 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.050
 numerous station ads 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.810
 RSH offers to buy advertising on 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.730
 transport and guess what 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.770
 photos emblazoned overseas 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.380
 railroad here such here they are 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.020
 patriots 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.090
 In addition to all this, RZD believe that all 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.100
 people are dwarfs because instead on the shelf 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.500
 second-class carriage can only be pressed 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.690
 legs and shrank by half this 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.950
 given that with the imitation of prices or 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.600
 it's on some long-distance trains 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.020
 the cost is as much as 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.490
 plane tickets to the word about prices with this 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.160
 Generally any confusion turns out 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.110
 give an example of my life tickets 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.470
 Kursk station to the glorious provincial 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.480
 cities starting with a letter costs 192 rubles from 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.750
 Kursk railway station to Tsaritsyno station 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.210
 which is on the way 28 rubles and the queen is over 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.610
 to the same city with the letter s 140 rubles 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.330
 total one hundred and sixty eight rubles not 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.640
 notice a difference of 24 rubles a distance 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.620
 also what it turns out to drive 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.870
 cheaper you have to go halfway and 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.790
 buy another ticket that surprises me 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.580
 even more so is this attitude expected 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.240
 students and a greater percentage 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.070
 passenger traffic it's just them 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.600
 officially session in metropolitan universities 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.660
 share on July 7 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.320
 Rzhd same annuls benefits already June 15 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.420
 continue as you wish and last 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.460
 fact assessments in the same city near Moscow 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.650
 for letter and assol year and for students on 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.260
 fare on the express does not work but here 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.280
 if you buy it in Moscow, easily 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.620
 In this they completely and let's remember more 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.050
 one case near Moscow shcherbinka 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.710
 electric train demolishing car moving on 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.930
 move 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.970
 how orgy the driver first writes 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.250
 ignored the prohibitory signal and left 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.560
 on the way to happiness video clarified the whole 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.840
 the situation is a barrier with a traffic light in general 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.640
 did not close and the car went solid 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.430
 stream right in front of the approaching 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.500
 train is only part of what i wanted 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.310
 would say behind the scenes leave the controllers 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.799
 turnstiles 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.900
 yes and much more but it will serve 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.940
 theme for one of the following releases 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.750

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.720
 skip it 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.790
 Here in this depot and dandy harness not 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.520
 childishly every wagon repaired 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.340
 washed by not one liter of vodka and then 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.710
 locksmith on the top shelves fuck aunts 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.660
 in orange jerseys after that 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.860
 have to be washed wagons 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.720
 from vomit and sperm and what infuriates you 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.630
