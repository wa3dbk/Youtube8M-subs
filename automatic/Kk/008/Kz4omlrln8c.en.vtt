 a sophisticated backup battery for 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.000
 our mobile devices are 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.460
 Battery is compatible with iPhone 6 and 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.559
 iphone 6 plus since it has a cable 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.960
 integrated lighting with which we are going to 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.300
 can connect our phone the 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.250
 capacity of this battery is 6000 thousand 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.050
 empires which is double the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.910
 capacity of our iphone device 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.160

 battery is aluminum as you can see 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.079
 in the presentation also has 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.930
 a very good protection against 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.790
 overload and has two ports 3.4 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.640
 we will continue to see the presentation of 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.620
 this box as it opens here and here 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.450
 We can really observe the product 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.729
 that we are going to acquire we can see a 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.020
 illustrative image of this side where 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.360
 it tells us that it also has a 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.520
 additional port and usb in this part we 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.979
 mentions that you will be able to use it in 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.440
 calls up to 25 hours in use of 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.100
 internet up to 20 hours and on standby 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.040
 until 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.799
 630 hours duration we will continue 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.840
 exploring this box here in the part of 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.820
 back he mentions that he is not only 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.650
 compatible with phones but also 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.659
 with good tablets we will be able to load it 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.310
 with this battery even this battery 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.140
 it also helps you to charge your ipod 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.820
 besides the cable the air and my integrated 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.670
 with which account also include us 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.680
 a usb cable to micro and usb and good in the 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.299
 part of here below we can see a 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.460
 illustration where it tells us all the 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.560
 features that this battery has 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.570
 but I think it 's better to get it out of the 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.570
 packaging very carefully 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.170
 we already have around here as you can see 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.730
 our battery we are going to put it this 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.550
 side comes very well packaged 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.900
 that is, there is something else down here and 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.330
 we found the cable 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.580
 we also have here what is the 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.190
 One year warranty which is a guarantee 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.350
 very important international that they have 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.180
 consider that and also give us a 20 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.950
 percent discount in a next 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.880
 buy so good that's pretty 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.730
 father we have here also what is the 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.010
 user manual that good is also 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.870
 important to always have a manual for 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.880
 really know how to use the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.080
 product that we are acquiring good 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.580
 I was already reading the user manual 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.950
 so I already know how our 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.600
 battery I want you to see the size is 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.910
 super comfortable we fit in the palm of the 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.250
 hand also is anything but heavy is 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.680
 quite comfortable as I told you is about 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.170
 aluminum obviously with this area that is 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.750
 totally plastic here on this side 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.680
 we found what is our tablet 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.050
 lighting 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.209
 that we will remember it like that and here what 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.680
 we have so we will be able to connect it 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.810
 to our device but we're going to 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.760
 do in a moment more let's leave it 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.650
 again over here there is 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.600
 perfectly saved in this part 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.790
 we have the power button let's go to 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.350
 apply and as you can see there is 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.300
 they lit our four light bulbs 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.590
 led that means is 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.290
 fully charged 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.060
 this battery we are going to pay it in the part 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.489
 from above we will find a port 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.319
 usb to be able to connect him to another one 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.360
 device since you could even 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.220
 connect up to two devices to the 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.110
 time in the part of here back 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.940
 we found the name of the jones brand 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.890
 mobile and some features of what 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.750
 what is this product and of course 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.190
 we have the patent on this side in the 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.980
 part of bottom we found the port 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.440
 microusb and these perforations that good 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.910
 obviously they are for the base that 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.890
 we have here that we are going to check the 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.680
 also since it is a magnetic base 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.329
 here we have two new ones of course in 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.069
 the bottom we have these 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.750
 anti-skid so we can have 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.000
 the security that our device 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.579
 it's not going to fall for nothing they even have 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.829
 plastic here because you're going to be able to fix it 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.470
 somewhere specific to this 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.269
 side we have another microusb port that is 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.670
 where to have connected our cable to 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.200
 can recharge this battery that good 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.010
 let's check our cable too 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.010
 let's get it out 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.560
 and as I mentioned them well, we also 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.290
 includes it here we have it is already a 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.299
 cable not very long but it is quite 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.020
 comfortable and of course also has the 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.490
 initials jm de georges mobile well 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.139
 friends but I have already placed our 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.440
 battery at its base I want you to see that 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.940
 for nothing falls because it is totally 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.950
 magnetized and good time came 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.169
 put to charge our device as 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.090
 can see I need a battery so 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.160
 let's put it to charge we're going to 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.360
 remove it from the base let's take out 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.889
 our cable 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.889
 and we are going to connect it 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.909
 there we have it already and we are going to light it 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.909

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.160
 and there it is loading us and our 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.740
 super fast and very easy device 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.660
