00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.209
 when we're like this together and they come 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:13.210
 all dreams together in the head 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:18.570
 when you blas and although you're thinking 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:21.880
 in plans for the future I see you 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.090
 composing and working in the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:29.180
 producer that belonged to your uncle and in 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:37.460
 three others in the other three 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:40.900
 julieta for me because they too 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.900
 they are also in my dreams 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.060
 good excuse me but I was 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.390
 interrupting I can end up apologizing 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.420
 I did not want to bother him and the three of us 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:57.450
 I see living from your music what you 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.450
 you compose and being very famous 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.769
 I'm just going to think about that moment 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.769
 questions and I answer you 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.479
 at least half of the sleep we have 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.479
 We are together 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.720
 but I really want julieta 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.220
 can also be happy like us 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.220
 the same thing happens with rosemary 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.220
 good 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.570
 it's time to finish fixing everything 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.580
 this of the parade of the males of the 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.980
 school so now I'm going to 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.980
 show how you are going to copy me 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.890
 the professional model you copy me 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.640
 looking at the cheap horizon 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.510
 first thank you 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.690
 two 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.860
 one 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.640
 we brake the trip 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.600
 sounds 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.600
 and me 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.409
 that is to say 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.530
 that is to say that we have to 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:26.200
 finish on paper we will surround 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:26.200
 we only participate in the stone 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.220
