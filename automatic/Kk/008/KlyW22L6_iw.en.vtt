00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello to all I find today 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.830
 with a new video that is the 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.180
 tutorial that we made during 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.849
 Sunday's live 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.860
 we wanted to test the Saharawi 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.080
 recalled art the sahara technique believe 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.880
 rather with girls and suddenly we 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.330
 thought we would do it all 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.369
 simply 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.350
 So I asked a basic non-mining 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.330
 plus 5 126 of checchi potter is one of 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.340
 my favorites and to achieve this 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.869
 technical you will need paper 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.250
 cellophane I could also we can 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.869
 do with aluminum but I do not 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.609
 am not convinced by him because 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.679
 I think that at night it may scratch 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.820
 still your base even if dry white 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.430
 but I know I would have to 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.800
 try again you pat which you put 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.660
 polish on your little piece of bone and 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.100
 the pann and you pat a little for 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.079
 remove the excess thing I did not have 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.850
 not done at first but after that was the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.410
 tutorial it's not a tutorial in 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.789
 reality these are the folds on youtube which 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.930
 will rather make a tutorial because 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.390
 I had never realized this 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.190
 technique but luckily we 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.949
 was there because it was not easy 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.390
 at all we then tap on the finger 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.219
 I had no protection because I 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.020
 know that white mont sassou maputo 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.309
 quickly so again for 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.780
 those who do not know the shape of my 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.570
 index is pretty weird because it's 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.250
 a false nail it was repaired in resin 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.710
 following an accident with a freezer 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.150
 chica where I suffered a lot 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.060
 it's normal and does not have its shape 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.299
 more classic but it will quickly return to 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.299
 the normal 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.850
 I thought it was a bit 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.560
 empty this is the art of the coup I chose 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.760
 to put studs and by doing so I 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 realized and movies can be 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.490
 rightly point out that this 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.230
 looked a lot like the islands 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.670
 arctic with mademoiselle images bull 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.170
 this is the link of his blog in the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.550
 barbaric for the aÃ¯ not made of article on 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.380
 his charm is posted a picture on 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.940
 instagram and frankly the choice of 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.510
 flowers were top and Morocco budgets 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.860
 express 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.600
 in the end it's true that it's exactly 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.790
 the same look good I give him there first 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.200
 all the credits for this beautiful art for 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.730
 to hold the bunkers is very simple 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.860
 you ask a little bit of top coat you 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.560
 take a tin tun oo a sharp hole 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.390

 and here are the tutorials now 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.930
