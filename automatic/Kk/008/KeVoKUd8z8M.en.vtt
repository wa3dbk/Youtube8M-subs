00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
this proof of concept and I just yeah

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.639 
this proof of concept and I just yeah
redesigned<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.540> bit<00:00:42.750> make<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.079> made<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.590> a

redesigned it a bit make it made it a

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.369 
redesigned it a bit make it made it a
bit<00:00:43.829> more<00:00:44.010> slim<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.750> yeah<00:00:45.750> now<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.079> got<00:00:46.200> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
bit more slim and yeah now we got a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.529 
bit more slim and yeah now we got a
really<00:00:46.680> nicely<00:00:47.039> working<00:00:47.700> high<00:00:47.850> efficient

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
really nicely working high efficient

iren farm and I want to go over the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.290 
iren farm and I want to go over the
principles<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.610> machine<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.149> you

really quick well first of all you need
villagers<00:00:58.219> villagers<00:00:59.219> produce<00:00:59.969> iron<00:01:00.690> golems

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
villagers villagers produce iron golems

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.250 
villagers villagers produce iron golems
because<00:01:02.489> yeah<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.180> want<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.539> be<00:01:03.660> protected

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
because yeah they want to be protected

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
because yeah they want to be protected
from<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> zombies<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.460> come<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.909> night

to produce a new one sometimes there are
small<00:02:23.490> breaks<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:24.210> between<00:02:24.270> but<00:02:24.840> there<00:02:25.110> they

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
small breaks in between but there they

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.820 
small breaks in between but there they
produce<00:02:25.520> really<00:02:26.520> fast<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:28.260> saw<00:02:28.470> how<00:02:28.620> long

this they will exclusively as born on
the<00:03:39.260> spawning<00:03:40.260> plates<00:03:40.650> they're<00:03:40.950> on<00:03:41.070> the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
the spawning plates they're on the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.520 
the spawning plates they're on the
pressure<00:03:41.430> plates<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:42.180> bony<00:03:42.540> plates<00:03:42.810> yeah

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
pressure plates this bony plates yeah

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.220 
pressure plates this bony plates yeah
that<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:44.580> how<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:44.760> do<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.050> iron

awesome<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.380> tried<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:52.769> out<00:03:52.860> dude<00:03:53.220> I'm

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
awesome you tried it out dude I'm

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.990 
awesome you tried it out dude I'm
thankful<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:54.440> thought<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.560> would<00:03:55.709> not<00:03:55.920> work

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
thankful I thought that would not work

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.509 
thankful I thought that would not work
but<00:03:57.000> now<00:03:57.330> we<00:03:57.390> know<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.050> I'm<00:03:58.980> pretty<00:03:59.190> sure<00:03:59.310> you

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
but now we know and I'm pretty sure you

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.960 
but now we know and I'm pretty sure you
can<00:03:59.700> make<00:03:59.850> it<00:04:00.000> even<00:04:00.150> more<00:04:00.269> compact<00:04:00.989> but<00:04:01.440> I

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
can make it even more compact but I

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.390 
can make it even more compact but I
think<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.060> need<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.570> white<00:04:04.530> spawning<00:04:04.980> area

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
think you need to white spawning area

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.020 
think you need to white spawning area
for<00:04:05.700> them<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:06.660> show<00:04:06.870> up<00:04:06.900> but<00:04:07.860> well<00:04:08.670> more

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
for them to show up but well more

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.060 
for them to show up but well more
testing<00:04:09.540> needed<00:04:09.780> maybe<00:04:10.200> we<00:04:10.410> can<00:04:10.620> make<00:04:10.739> it<00:04:10.890> even

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
testing needed maybe we can make it even

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.009 
testing needed maybe we can make it even
more<00:04:11.130> compact<00:04:11.760> but<00:04:12.060> for<00:04:12.300> now<00:04:12.450> that<00:04:12.750> should

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
more compact but for now that should

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.270 
more compact but for now that should
work<00:04:13.260> nicely<00:04:13.910> so<00:04:14.910> that's<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.360> for<00:04:15.630> today<00:04:16.280> I'm

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
work nicely so that's it for today I'm

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.050 
work nicely so that's it for today I'm
