 the reception of large and small 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.029

 emergency physician activity that 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.420
 practice of prehospital medicine

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.239
 along the body 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.910
 but we are also going into operation where 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.400
 we must be versatile whose 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.440
 example one expects from an essayist that he 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.640
 do more than just osteoarthritis and 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.350
 that they also help as a doctor 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.550
 emergency or possibly in care 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.550
 intensive intimist 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.200
 the function of military doctor to 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.490
 account 12 it's basically a 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.930
 function of doctor close to the military 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.730
 Belgian who also provides consultation 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.610
 of general medicine but especially and 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.500
 basically accompany men 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.180
 in the field as part of the 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.180
 mentoring of Afghan soldiers 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.880
 functional are not functional ganis 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.369
 your is essentially the one 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.899
 of anesthesiologists so we were 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.670
 co-responsible for the reception of 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.619
 seriously injured patients but my 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.950
 main activity was going well in 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.950
 operating room 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.110
 in double benefit of being a 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.670
 military anesthetist and we have a 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.410
 broader view of the world than our 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.330
 civil colleagues disadvantage 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.590
 naturally and that the missions are 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.590
 sometimes difficult so much of a point of 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.940
 professional as well as family view this 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.500
 is not always clear when you 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.330
 go on a mission and especially when you 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.290
 come back and that we do not want nor before 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.290
 nor the hoteliers corons 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.409
 with the experience we acquire in 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.750
 military environment one can without doubt 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.310
 provide relevant and 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.980
 interesting to take over a 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.159
 seriously injured a polytraumatized in the middle 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.159
