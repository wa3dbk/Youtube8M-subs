00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.489
 activity that micromania so taking 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.710
 people who ask for sauna zones 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.000

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.610
 it's mine I saw assassin's creed ben 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.909
 as a big fan and I did not hesitate 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.950
 the game ben the game pawns in these 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.799

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:29.030
 babine of course and well we'll start 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.030
 the small possible unpacking behind 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.399
 with the small presentation of the tray 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.840
 good there is nothing that changes the rules 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:46.869
 a checkerboard at the normal price 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.920
 the contribution that it's just low on 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:56.740
 the assassin's universe creed so here 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:02:01.799
 Ilya characters and the filbert diot 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.799
 arnaud edward taylor 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:27.959
 if I score on the game board that I 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.959
 will introduce you 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.209
 two masters like that 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:02.750
 so there is one that changes apart from the names of 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:05.849
 stations and badiliz of course but also 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:10.260
 versailles the treasure chests you 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:12.390
 have known of both the quarter series so 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:20.030
 actually guys and factions and 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:20.030
 the action mercenary thieves murderers 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:31.560
 courtesan six continents but also the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:42.870
 guild lyrics after that you are 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:49.260
 often made the points the low points 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:51.959
 points to chicago critics 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.000
 starwood on campus libya i'm not going 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.260
 still jokes of what like them 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.269
 as I paid to play alone it is necessary 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.459
 rather play the pure and like the game 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.049
 for me I am all alone I have for 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.190
 start the debate and for not that 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:10.680
 I was fine, here are the colors of the 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:15.359
 abstergo points so the credits more 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:19.769
 early you have of course the idea the famous 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:20.669
 with a lighter aude and that makes 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.289
 long time I played little at my price 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.289
 so the failing I hope that sincere 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:36.850
 a small project pouch throwing up in 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:44.710
 hostage what do you want you so the 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:57.790
 houses are like these is the fact 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:59.410
 to remove efforts to propose the 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:28.810
 cards mortgage the penny of the times 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:36.250
 everything and we get to the characters those 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:41.070
 who did that dp2 did not break a 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.070
 instead of accepting that he who does not 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:52.750
 so with ezio good this sport are break 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.440
 retail 100% not the highest level 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.440
 easily recognizes 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.840
 but if you have to say we have a bit of 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:20.420
 badly recognize but it's that these 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:29.900
 altaïr you have to reconnect with her the 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:31.670
 piles that he has that here it's easter in 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:37.370
 scene it's just good that in his hand in 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:40.160
 done at a hole up and actually goes the 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.570
 pressure hole is too good bath 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:51.280
 hot than to put a little bit of 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:51.280
 angry after you have aveline who here 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:58.840
 only when she recognized pascal simon 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:08.540
 shaw and his hat pirates 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:09.890

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:17.180
 creed what's a little hard went 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:20.270
 to find figurines does not arise 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.280

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.000
