the<00:00:52.250> top<00:00:52.399> of<00:00:52.519> the<00:00:52.579> frame<00:00:52.790> here<00:00:53.059> there's<00:00:53.659> a

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
the top of the frame here there's a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.180 
the top of the frame here there's a
metal<00:00:54.050> socket<00:00:54.469> so<00:00:55.010> we<00:00:55.190> start<00:00:55.429> with<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:55.640> frame

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
metal socket so we start with the frame

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.650 
metal socket so we start with the frame
and<00:00:58.190> then<00:00:58.399> next<00:00:58.640> we've<00:00:58.879> got<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.149> juice<00:00:59.329> tray

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
in them which will hopefully give us

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.010 
in them which will hopefully give us
give<00:05:52.730> the<00:05:52.850> cider<00:05:53.090> some<00:05:53.390> flavor<00:05:53.660> because<00:05:53.870> I'm

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
give the cider some flavor because I'm

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.410 
give the cider some flavor because I'm
going<00:05:54.110> to<00:05:54.170> ferment<00:05:54.380> this<00:05:54.530> into<00:05:54.770> cider<00:05:55.300> so<00:05:56.300> I'm

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420 
going to ferment this into cider so I'm

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.560 
going to ferment this into cider so I'm
putting<00:05:56.660> an<00:05:56.750> airlock<00:05:57.020> on<00:05:57.170> that<00:05:58.420> and<00:05:59.420> there's

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
putting an airlock on that and there's

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.850 
putting an airlock on that and there's
no<00:05:59.690> added<00:05:59.930> yeast<00:06:00.110> or<00:06:00.290> anything<00:06:00.620> that's<00:06:00.800> just

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
no added yeast or anything that's just

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.290 
no added yeast or anything that's just
fermenting<00:06:01.460> on<00:06:01.520> its<00:06:01.670> own<00:06:01.790> natural<00:06:02.000> yeast

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
fermenting on its own natural yeast

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.930 
fermenting on its own natural yeast
that's<00:06:02.570> on<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.810> skin<00:06:03.050> of<00:06:03.080> the<00:06:03.260> apples<00:06:03.940> so

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
that's on the skin of the apples so

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.720 
that's on the skin of the apples so
that's<00:06:05.120> the<00:06:05.270> atomic<00:06:05.450> shrimp<00:06:05.810> cider<00:06:06.050> press<00:06:06.730> if

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
that's the atomic shrimp cider press if

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:08.890 
that's the atomic shrimp cider press if
