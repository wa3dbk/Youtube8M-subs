in the right hand and an F bass I got
going<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> G<00:00:31.859> chord<00:00:32.099> with<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> passing<00:00:33.239> tone

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
going to a G chord with a passing tone

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.729 
going to a G chord with a passing tone
an<00:00:36.270> f-sharp<00:00:38.930> in<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:39.989> right<00:00:40.200> hand<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.590> would

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
an f-sharp in the right hand that would

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.180 
an f-sharp in the right hand that would
be

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.689 

I<00:00:45.309> like<00:00:45.879> to<00:00:46.030> look<00:00:46.149> at<00:00:46.300> this<00:00:46.420> as<00:00:46.690> a<00:00:46.719> as<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.590> G<00:00:48.399> chord

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
I like to look at this as a as a G chord

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.350 
I like to look at this as a as a G chord
and<00:00:48.820> not<00:00:49.000> B<00:00:49.989> minor<00:00:50.260> chord<00:00:50.379> going<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.190> a<00:00:51.430> G<00:00:52.329> chord

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
and not B minor chord going to a G chord

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.670 
and not B minor chord going to a G chord
because<00:00:52.899> actually<00:00:53.350> this<00:00:53.500> is<00:00:55.019> the<00:00:56.019> F<00:00:56.199> sharp<00:00:56.530> is

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
because actually this is the F sharp is

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.819 
because actually this is the F sharp is
just<00:00:56.890> a<00:00:56.980> passing<00:00:57.190> tone<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.930> the<00:00:59.110> footage<00:00:59.589> II

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
just a passing tone for the footage II

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:07.840 
just a passing tone for the footage II
like<00:01:00.339> the<00:01:00.460> major<00:01:00.670> seven<00:01:01.180> going<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.870> one<00:01:02.519> so

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:15.330 

the<00:01:08.270> next<00:01:08.630> chord<00:01:08.930> is<00:01:09.140> a<00:01:09.950> c7<00:01:10.909> flat<00:01:11.360> 9<00:01:11.720> chord

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.639 

so<00:01:15.939> what<00:01:16.119> we<00:01:16.270> have<00:01:16.420> here<00:01:16.750> in<00:01:16.899> the<00:01:16.960> left<00:01:17.200> hand<00:01:17.409> is

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649

you would see it in my numbers we have a

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:38.029 
you would see it in my numbers we have a
1<00:01:29.200> 7<00:01:30.479> 3<00:01:31.479> 5<00:01:32.470> flat<00:01:33.250> 9<00:01:33.610> going<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.539> a<00:01:34.570> normal<00:01:34.929> knife

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.020

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
the next chord the 4th chord is a F sus

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.730 
the next chord the 4th chord is a F sus
chord<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.740> right<00:01:48.009> hand<00:01:48.250> we<00:01:48.399> have<00:01:48.520> B<00:01:49.179> flat<00:01:49.440> G<00:01:50.440> B

chord and right hand we have B flat G B
flat<00:01:51.479> C<00:01:53.220> Justin<00:01:54.220> F<00:01:54.549> in<00:01:54.819> the<00:01:54.909> base<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:58.299> he

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
flat C Justin F in the base so he

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.960 
flat C Justin F in the base so he
resolves<00:01:59.020> upwards<00:01:59.709> not<00:02:00.039> downwards<00:02:00.099> like<00:02:00.670> you

more difficult technically because we

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.010 
more difficult technically because we

the real tempo it all adds up now this

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.480 
the real tempo it all adds up now this
this<00:05:19.060> little<00:05:19.480> ornamentation<00:05:20.020> here<00:05:20.380> can<00:05:21.370> be

this little ornamentation here can be

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.570 
this little ornamentation here can be
very<00:05:21.850> difficult<00:05:22.120> to<00:05:23.050> play<00:05:23.290> at<00:05:24.010> a<00:05:24.100> high<00:05:24.130> speed

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
very difficult to play at a high speed

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.040 
very difficult to play at a high speed

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
your wrist every time you play a new

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.600 
your wrist every time you play a new
chord<00:05:31.810> kind<00:05:32.320> of<00:05:32.410> like<00:05:32.560> this<00:05:35.100> of<00:05:36.100> course<00:05:36.460> I'm

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
chord kind of like this of course I'm

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.510 
chord kind of like this of course I'm
exaggerating<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:37.570> movement<00:05:37.990> but<00:05:41.400> you<00:05:42.400> have

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
exaggerating the movement but you have

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.610 
exaggerating the movement but you have
to<00:05:42.610> make<00:05:42.760> sure<00:05:42.970> you<00:05:43.210> have<00:05:43.360> zero<00:05:43.810> tension<00:05:44.200> in

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
to make sure you have zero tension in

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.560 
to make sure you have zero tension in
your<00:05:44.950> wrist<00:05:45.220> when<00:05:46.180> you're<00:05:46.360> when<00:05:46.540> you're

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
your wrist when you're when you're

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.530 
your wrist when you're when you're
playing<00:05:46.840> low<00:05:47.050> because<00:05:47.410> if<00:05:47.680> you<00:05:47.800> do<00:05:48.010> it's<00:05:48.580> well

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
playing low because if you do it's well

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:56.610

virtually<00:05:50.080> impossible<00:05:54.930> well<00:05:55.930> and<00:05:56.110> then<00:05:56.320> he

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
virtually impossible well and then he

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.930 
virtually impossible well and then he
closes<00:05:57.040> it<00:05:57.130> off<00:05:57.280> with<00:05:59.730> with<00:06:00.870> octaves<00:06:02.490> and<00:06:03.490> an<00:06:03.790> F
