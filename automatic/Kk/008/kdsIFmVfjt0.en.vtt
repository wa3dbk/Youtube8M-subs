we<00:00:04.890> started<00:00:05.370> with<00:00:05.610> the<00:00:06.050> basic<00:00:07.050> movement<00:00:08.030> the

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
we started with the basic movement the

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.480 
we started with the basic movement the
bouncy<00:00:09.690> loop<00:00:09.930> and<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.530> split<00:00:10.920> step<00:00:11.220> which

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
bouncy loop and the split step which

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.430 
bouncy loop and the split step which
will<00:00:11.670> give<00:00:11.850> you<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.060> balance<00:00:12.270> the<00:00:12.900> next<00:00:13.200> step

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
will give you the balance the next step

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.470 
will give you the balance the next step
is<00:00:13.680> when<00:00:14.250> we<00:00:14.370> get<00:00:14.580> out<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.030> middle<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.390> the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
is when we get out of the middle of the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.810 
is when we get out of the middle of the
court<00:00:15.830> when<00:00:16.830> somebody's<00:00:17.279> hitting<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.640> ball

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
court when somebody's hitting the ball

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.569 
court when somebody's hitting the ball
wide<00:00:18.230> you<00:00:19.230> need<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.740> get<00:00:19.890> back<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> middle

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:20.579 
wide you need to get back to the middle

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.960 
wide you need to get back to the middle
this<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.689> must<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:22.950> a<00:00:23.099> very<00:00:23.460> very<00:00:23.700> major

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
this is a must this is a very very major

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.240 
this is a must this is a very very major
thing<00:00:24.419> becomes<00:00:25.259> to<00:00:25.439> quit<00:00:25.619> work<00:00:25.829> because<00:00:26.130> you

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
thing becomes to quit work because you

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.620 
thing becomes to quit work because you
need<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.489> cover<00:00:26.669> the<00:00:26.880> court<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.239> need<00:00:27.329> to<00:00:27.480> get

need to cover the court you need to get

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.690 
need to cover the court you need to get
back<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.020> the<00:00:28.140> village<00:00:28.290> to<00:00:28.980> prevent<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
back to the village to prevent the

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.900 
back to the village to prevent the
opportunity<00:00:30.739> for<00:00:31.739> your<00:00:31.890> opponent<00:00:32.279> put<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
opportunity for your opponent put the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.970 
opportunity for your opponent put the
ball<00:00:33.060> away<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.899> there's<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.230> technique<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.680> it

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
ball away so there's a technique to it

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.189 
ball away so there's a technique to it
and<00:00:35.160> I'm<00:00:35.370> gonna<00:00:35.489> show<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.510> technique<00:00:36.989> is

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
and I'm gonna show the technique is

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.770 
and I'm gonna show the technique is
called<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.680> crossover<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:39.090> do<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> crossover

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
called a crossover you do a crossover

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.520 
called a crossover you do a crossover
step<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.920> then<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:42.210> blend<00:00:42.480> into<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.050> shuffle

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
step and then you blend into the shuffle

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.529 
step and then you blend into the shuffle
and<00:00:44.039> I'll<00:00:44.190> show<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.489> exactly<00:00:45.000> how<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.390> done

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and I'll show you exactly how it's done

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.660 
and I'll show you exactly how it's done
right<00:00:45.600> now<00:00:46.940> crossover<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.239> bring<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:50.280> leg

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
right now crossover you bring that leg

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.529 
right now crossover you bring that leg
across<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.629> then<00:00:52.109> you<00:00:52.379> go<00:00:53.280> into<00:00:53.519> a<00:00:53.910> regular

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
across and then you go into a regular

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.000 
across and then you go into a regular
sidestep<00:00:55.289> shuffle

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
sidestep shuffle

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.160 
sidestep shuffle
it's<00:00:56.910> done<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.480> I'll<00:00:57.690> do<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.899> slow

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
it's done like this I'll do it slow

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.169 
it's done like this I'll do it slow
motion<00:00:58.679> and<00:00:59.129> I'll<00:00:59.249> do<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> little<00:00:59.489> faster<00:01:00.059> that

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
motion and I'll do a little faster that

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.450 
motion and I'll do a little faster that
will<00:01:00.300> incorporate<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.899> ball<00:01:01.079> into<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.429> so<00:01:02.429> you

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
will incorporate the ball into it so you

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.189 
will incorporate the ball into it so you
hit<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.909> forehead

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
hit the forehead

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.010 
hit the forehead
and<00:01:05.320> then<00:01:05.439> you<00:01:05.560> cross<00:01:05.860> over<00:01:06.509> then<00:01:07.509> you<00:01:07.659> go<00:01:07.840> into

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
and then you cross over then you go into

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.790 
and then you cross over then you go into
the<00:01:08.170> top

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.550 

you<00:01:11.370> cross<00:01:11.670> over<00:01:12.050> and<00:01:13.050> notice<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:15.500> when<00:01:16.500> I

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
you cross over and notice that when I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.230 
you cross over and notice that when I
cross<00:01:16.890> over<00:01:17.100> my<00:01:17.400> rack<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.760> still<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.090> front

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
cross over my rack is still in front

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.790 
cross over my rack is still in front
because<00:01:18.540> that's<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.020> ready<00:01:19.200> position<00:01:19.380> that

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
because that's the ready position that

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.040 
because that's the ready position that
we<00:01:19.860> talked<00:01:20.070> about<00:01:20.250> earlier<00:01:20.850> now<00:01:21.840> we're<00:01:21.960> going

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
we talked about earlier now we're going

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.500 
we talked about earlier now we're going
to<00:01:22.110> incorporate<00:01:22.230> the<00:01:22.620> ball<00:01:22.800> into<00:01:22.980> it<00:01:23.510> start

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
to incorporate the ball into it start

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:33.460 
to incorporate the ball into it start
really<00:01:24.780> slow

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.250 

well<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.160> and<00:01:35.090> wants<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:35.450> get<00:01:35.660> warmed<00:01:35.930> up<00:01:36.050> we

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
well so and wants to get warmed up we

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.760 
well so and wants to get warmed up we
can<00:01:36.440> speed<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:36.710> up<00:01:38.800> but<00:01:39.800> notice<00:01:40.360> second<00:01:41.770> I'm

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
can speed it up but notice second I'm

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.670 
can speed it up but notice second I'm
always<00:01:43.010> over<00:01:43.370> there<00:01:43.900> then<00:01:44.900> I'm<00:01:45.050> in<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.260> point

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.310 

okay<00:01:51.680> so<00:01:51.740> we<00:01:52.070> did<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:53.360> recovery<00:01:53.870> from<00:01:54.170> the

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
okay so we did the recovery from the

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.680 
okay so we did the recovery from the
foreign<00:01:54.680> side<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.400> now<00:01:55.640> we're<00:01:55.760> gonna<00:01:55.880> do<00:01:56.150> the

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
foreign side and now we're gonna do the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.600 
foreign side and now we're gonna do the
same<00:01:56.930> thing<00:01:57.170> on<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:57.410> back<00:01:57.560> inside<00:01:58.010> it's

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
same thing on the back inside it's

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.550 
same thing on the back inside it's
slightly<00:01:59.000> different<00:01:59.390> for<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.900> reason<00:02:00.350> that

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
slightly different for the reason that

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.880 
slightly different for the reason that
when<00:02:01.310> I<00:02:01.340> had<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.700> forehead<00:02:02.680> hitting<00:02:03.680> with<00:02:03.800> an

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
when I had the forehead hitting with an

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.520 
when I had the forehead hitting with an
open<00:02:04.220> stance<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.480> crossover<00:02:06.080> is<00:02:06.200> kind<00:02:06.410> of

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
open stance so the crossover is kind of

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.760 
open stance so the crossover is kind of
natural<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:08.030> when<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.179> hit<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.390> backhand<00:02:08.770> I'm

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
natural and when I hit a backhand I'm

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.470 
natural and when I hit a backhand I'm
hitting<00:02:10.070> with<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.220> close<00:02:10.550> fit<00:02:13.060> turn<00:02:14.060> my<00:02:14.240> hips

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
hitting with a close fit turn my hips

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.320 
hitting with a close fit turn my hips
and<00:02:15.380> go<00:02:15.560> like<00:02:15.710> this<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.280> then<00:02:16.910> go<00:02:17.090> into<00:02:17.240> the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
and go like this and then go into the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.530 
and go like this and then go into the
shuffle<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.050> then<00:02:18.580> notice<00:02:19.580> how<00:02:19.790> when<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.330> go

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
shuffle and then notice how when I go

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.220 
shuffle and then notice how when I go
back<00:02:20.780> I'm<00:02:21.440> changing<00:02:22.010> my<00:02:22.130> grip<00:02:22.370> back<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:24.140> the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
back I'm changing my grip back to the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.650 
back I'm changing my grip back to the
ready<00:02:24.440> position<00:02:24.730> always<00:02:25.730> going<00:02:26.180> back<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.510> this

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660
