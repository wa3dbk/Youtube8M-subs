another seven leg yield to the left it's

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.030 
another seven leg yield to the left it's
not<00:02:23.820> quite<00:02:24.060> as<00:02:24.300> fluent<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.320> mark<00:02:25.530> goes<00:02:25.800> to

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
not quite as fluent so the mark goes to

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.640 
not quite as fluent so the mark goes to
a<00:02:26.100> six<00:02:26.340> point<00:02:26.670> five<00:02:30.320> that<00:02:31.320> C<00:02:33.590> transitioned<00:02:34.590> to

medium<00:02:35.130> walk<00:02:35.600> clearly<00:02:36.600> shown<00:02:37.010> was<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.040> little

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
medium walk clearly shown was a little

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.210 
medium walk clearly shown was a little
late<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.180> marks<00:02:39.510> are<00:02:39.720> six<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.350> she

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
late so the marks are six and she

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.840 
late so the marks are six and she

walk showing the horse tracking up which

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.350 
walk showing the horse tracking up which
means<00:02:48.660> she's<00:02:48.989> over<00:02:49.380> tracking<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.360> she

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
means she's over tracking and she

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.840 
means she's over tracking and she
lengthens<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.930> frame<00:02:52.320> there's<00:02:53.130> no<00:02:53.459> tension

the horse to stretch downwards and
forwards<00:05:33.259> there<00:05:34.259> is<00:05:34.409> some<00:05:34.650> attempt<00:05:35.009> to<00:05:35.189> do<00:05:35.370> it

shown with more downward stretch so the

so it would have been a lower mark the
