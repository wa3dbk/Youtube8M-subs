00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.060
 I 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:07.259
 but 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.560
 but 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.780
 We are engaged in a long time and designs 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.900
 heating main repair of heating main that is 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.760
 work we supply the city with heat 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.780
 we transport heat 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.780
 give people hot water 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.850
 in terms of expanding production and us 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.410
 there are new areas being built ie we 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.380
 supply heat build anew highway 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:48.520
 we lay new and attended assembly 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:50.989
 that is, the connection to the heat at home with us 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.290
 the company specializes in what we 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.989
 we do the layout that is, initially we 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.030
 do excavation trench find our 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.520
 heating main 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.290
 dig out and and make sinuses and 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.300
 respectively assembled or 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.130
 emergency work respectively when 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.860
 they ended the construction part 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.580
 over and we'll backfill the same 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.560
 Excavator for yourself planning too 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.590
 that is, black land, that is, we rent 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.020
 the city object on the finishing 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.960
 we currently have three loaders 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:31.400
 yourself you have established yourself as 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.450
 pretty little say 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.270
 machine consuming 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.330
 That is, the engine is designed for Russia 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.530
 specially that it works well for ours 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.530
 harsh conditions 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.159
 with themselves last generation consume 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:54.240
 much less fuel compared to 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:56.799
 other manufacturers eco mode 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.200
 the car behaves better and pretty 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.959
 and consume less fuel and smoothness 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:08.799
 backhand shovel you from the la 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:10.629
 accordingly it becomes better with us 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.000
 there is a vibrotamper 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.680
 hydraulic breakers 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.840
 have we all exactly equipped sweep 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.900
 hydraulic hammer respectively 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.910
 Dolgin rock and difficult areas frozen 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.220
 or tamper we do 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.299
 landscaping that is, we are doing sidewalks 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.400
 and roads and a breakdown figure ranging from 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.790
 excavated trenches and finishing 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.159
 layout that is 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.230
 universal machine will do everything 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:41.000
 can i finish one machine i 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.879
 would recommend because the car is in 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.129
 first long on the market 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.329
 I have already repeated that it comes 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.489
 exactly with the original 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.849
 original british plants coming 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.849
 i.e
