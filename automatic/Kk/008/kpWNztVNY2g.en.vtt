species in particular I've got a bottom
bait<00:00:30.570> out<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.410> gather<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.800> there's

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
bait out here so I gather that there's

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.400 
bait out here so I gather that there's
amberjack<00:00:32.880> down<00:00:33.120> there<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.930> at<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> same

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
amberjack down there and at the same

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.410 
amberjack down there and at the same
time<00:00:34.469> we've<00:00:34.829> got<00:00:35.040> them<00:00:35.370> we've<00:00:35.850> got<00:00:35.969> two<00:00:36.149> kites

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
time we've got them we've got two kites

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.270 
time we've got them we've got two kites
out<00:00:36.750> each<00:00:37.110> one<00:00:37.350> with<00:00:37.469> two<00:00:37.620> lines<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.129> we've

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
out each one with two lines and we've

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.930 
out each one with two lines and we've
got<00:00:38.489> live<00:00:39.120> baits<00:00:39.360> up<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.690> surface<00:00:40.079> though

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
got live baits up on the surface though

got live baits up on the surface though
the<00:00:41.940> most<00:00:42.149> likely<00:00:42.420> thing<00:00:42.570> there<00:00:43.020> will<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the most likely thing there will be a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.479

believe them but because I'm a fisherman
my<00:02:29.410> might<00:02:29.560> think<00:02:29.769> I<00:02:29.859> this<00:02:30.040> maybe<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:30.459> guy

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
my might think I this maybe this guy

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:31.710 
my might think I this maybe this guy
will<00:02:30.609> believe<00:02:30.940> some<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.150> these<00:02:31.269> stories<00:02:31.630> so

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
will believe some of these stories so

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.930 
will believe some of these stories so
they<00:02:31.810> tell<00:02:31.989> me<00:02:32.019> stories<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:33.190> that's<00:02:33.400> and

they tell me stories and that's and
that's<00:02:34.030> sort<00:02:34.239> of<00:02:34.359> how<00:02:34.480> we<00:02:34.540> get<00:02:34.720> into<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.959> lot<00:02:35.079> of

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
that's sort of how we get into a lot of

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.170 
that's sort of how we get into a lot of
the<00:02:35.200> programs<00:02:35.350> if<00:02:36.040> it's<00:02:36.549> on<00:02:36.639> the<00:02:36.700> basis<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.090> a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
the programs if it's on the basis of a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.849 
the programs if it's on the basis of a
story<00:02:37.420> which<00:02:37.690> sounds<00:02:38.139> like<00:02:38.290> somebody<00:02:38.829> just

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
story which sounds like somebody just

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.099 
story which sounds like somebody just
made<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.280> up<00:02:39.400> but<00:02:40.060> actually<00:02:40.389> if<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.660> if<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:40.959> go

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
made it up but actually if you if you go

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.809 
made it up but actually if you if you go
and<00:02:41.200> look<00:02:41.260> into<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.769> you<00:02:42.489> know<00:02:42.519> there<00:02:42.700> really

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
and look into it you know there really

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.640 
and look into it you know there really
is<00:02:43.090> something<00:02:43.329> there<00:02:43.959> is<00:02:44.109> some<00:02:44.260> animal<00:02:44.530> down

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
is something there is some animal down

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.760 
is something there is some animal down
