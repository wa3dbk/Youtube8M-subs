money into his pocket but the one thing

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.310 
money into his pocket but the one thing
I<00:03:14.100> do<00:03:14.430> disagree<00:03:14.549> with<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:15.299> that<00:03:16.019> freedom

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
I do disagree with is that that freedom

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.890 
I do disagree with is that that freedom
of<00:03:16.380> speech<00:03:16.620> means<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.519> freedom<00:03:18.150> well<00:03:18.299> it<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.870> a

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
of speech means the freedom well it is a

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.960 
of speech means the freedom well it is a
freedom<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.410> be<00:03:19.470> an<00:03:19.560> idiot<00:03:19.709> but<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.459> think<00:03:20.850> that

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
freedom to be an idiot but I think that

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.390 
freedom to be an idiot but I think that
we<00:03:21.030> should<00:03:21.060> also<00:03:21.330> use<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:22.440> freedom<00:03:22.830> as<00:03:23.190> an

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
we should also use that freedom as an

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.759 
we should also use that freedom as an
opportunity<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.390> privilege<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:25.080> not<00:03:25.560> act

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
opportunity and a privilege and not act
