 hi again everyone if you are in this 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.420
 video is that you want to put your 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.720
 American server with the voices in 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.400
 English but with the texts in Spanish the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.230
 first step is to visit the link that you 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.999
 I'm letting you take you to the tutorial 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.560
 I did a few days ago how they put 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:28.199
 voices in English and texts in Spanish 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.579
 in European servers after having 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.679
 done the tutorial we will have in the a 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.800
 chela well I like I play normally in 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.450
 the server from west europe so I 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.460
 it appears that but as in this tutorial 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.579
 let's do it with the america we're not going 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.440
 to change region 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.260
 we give you here we select america from 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.089
 North and automatically marks English 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.539
 because it is the only one that leaves us and 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.539
 let's save 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.400
 for those who play normally in the 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.320
 American server will also appear like this 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.450
 because you will have the client updated 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.100
 to date but those that do not 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.930
 are doing this tutorial and play 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.700
 normally on European servers 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.730
 they will have four very long 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.220
 little bit and when it's over it would stay like that 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.380
 it's worth it now if we enter to play we will have 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.780
 all the texts and all the voices in 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.230
 English but we want to put alone 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:21.990
 the text in Spanish so we closed the 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:24.540
 launcher let's start team 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.610
 local disk c we have installed the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.180
 game riot games ratings 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.180
 rap 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.990
 system 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.710
 and we locate the local file what 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.000
 We open with notepad 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.520
 or with any editor 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.710
 and we see that locates is equal to in 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.710
 low and it will change is low 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.400
 we close we keep 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.649
 and we opened the game 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.970
 go on board 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.360
 and we already see the texts in Spanish 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.830
 play and other news does not come out 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.910
 because they are not updated I do not know why 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.330
 but the launcher yes and if we give to 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.540
 play is all in Spanish button 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.030
 to play 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.709
 profile champion fighting history 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.770
 Runes is all in Spanish and if we enter 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.970
 to play we will have the voices in English 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.970
 let's check it 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.070
 As you can see the voices are in English 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.120
 very important that the tutorial be done 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.769
 that I have indicated to you at the beginning of 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.769
 video because if not it will not work 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.359
 if we just change the local file what 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.250
 The only thing we will achieve is to have the 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.260
 voices and texts in the same language in 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.750
 this case in Spanish and that does not 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.720
 interesting you have to do the tutorial 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.170
 that I'm leaving the link again on 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.640
 tutorial that and this so that you have the 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.220
 voices in English and texts in Spanish 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.409
 on the American server if your server 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.180
 is one of the Europeans simply 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.099
 do the first tutorial this does not make you 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.109
 missing if you have any questions you can 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.510
 leave it in the comments and if you give it 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.400

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.590
