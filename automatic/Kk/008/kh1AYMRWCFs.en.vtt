let's<00:00:04.020> talk<00:00:04.230> about<00:00:04.350> money<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:05.430> real<00:00:05.609> reason

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
let's talk about money the real reason

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.519 
let's talk about money the real reason
that<00:00:06.029> you're<00:00:06.270> interested<00:00:06.480> in<00:00:06.870> photo<00:00:07.230> booths

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
that you're interested in photo booths

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.290 
that you're interested in photo booths
because<00:00:08.160> there<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.519> lot<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.760> money<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.179> be

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
because there is a lot of money to be

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.209 
because there is a lot of money to be
made<00:00:09.510> in<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:09.870> but<00:00:10.440> we<00:00:10.559> want<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.769> be<00:00:10.830> realistic

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
made in this but we want to be realistic

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.520 
made in this but we want to be realistic
a<00:00:11.700> lot<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.540> other<00:00:12.630> companies<00:00:12.960> are<00:00:13.320> probably

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
a lot of other companies are probably

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.690 
a lot of other companies are probably
going<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.710> tell<00:00:13.860> you're<00:00:14.009> going<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.190> make<00:00:14.280> 50

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
going to tell you're going to make 50

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.430 
going to tell you're going to make 50
grand<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:15.179> year<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.750> just<00:00:15.960> think<00:00:16.109> that's<00:00:16.289> a

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
grand a year and I just think that's a

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.160 
grand a year and I just think that's a
little<00:00:16.529> misleading<00:00:17.510> that<00:00:18.510> would<00:00:18.690> be<00:00:18.779> assuming

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
little misleading that would be assuming

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.410 
little misleading that would be assuming
that<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.439> book<00:00:19.770> every<00:00:20.520> single<00:00:20.699> Saturday<00:00:21.060> in

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
that you book every single Saturday in

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.450 
that you book every single Saturday in
the<00:00:21.539> year<00:00:21.840> which<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.199> just<00:00:22.529> not<00:00:22.949> gonna<00:00:23.220> happen

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the year which is just not gonna happen

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.130 
the year which is just not gonna happen
most<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.420> your<00:00:24.539> events<00:00:24.810> are<00:00:24.930> going<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.080> be

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
most of your events are going to be

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140 
most of your events are going to be
weddings<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.800> most<00:00:26.130> cities<00:00:26.460> have<00:00:26.490> seasons

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
weddings and most cities have seasons

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.179 
weddings and most cities have seasons
for<00:00:27.390> weddings<00:00:27.689> ours<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> summer<00:00:28.890> usually

for weddings ours is the summer usually
June<00:00:29.699> through<00:00:30.119> September<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:31.140> we<00:00:31.650> booked

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
June through September and we booked

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.280 
June through September and we booked
almost<00:00:32.189> every<00:00:32.430> Saturday<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:32.910> those<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:34.079> when

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
almost every Saturday in those but when

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.170 
almost every Saturday in those but when
it<00:00:34.410> comes<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.770> February<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.489> March<00:00:35.790> we're

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
it comes to February and March we're

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.690 
it comes to February and March we're
maybe<00:00:36.329> getting<00:00:36.719> one<00:00:36.750> event<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.800> month<00:00:38.010> so

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
maybe getting one event of a month so

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.880 
maybe getting one event of a month so
we're<00:00:39.300> looking<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.809> big<00:00:40.290> overall

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
we're looking for that big overall

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.760 
we're looking for that big overall
picture<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.640> 30<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.120> 40<00:00:42.480> maybe<00:00:42.840> 50<00:00:43.110> events<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.710> a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
picture of 30 to 40 maybe 50 events in a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.100 
picture of 30 to 40 maybe 50 events in a
big<00:00:43.980> city<00:00:44.250> but<00:00:44.789> probably<00:00:45.300> more<00:00:45.450> like<00:00:45.629> 30<00:00:45.930> or<00:00:46.079> 40

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
big city but probably more like 30 or 40

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.880 
big city but probably more like 30 or 40
events<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.829> year<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:48.210> what<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.260> charge<00:00:49.590> per

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
events a year so what we charge per

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.779 
events a year so what we charge per
event<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:51.030> between<00:00:51.500> $700<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.739> $1,000<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
event is between $700 and $1,000 and

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.400 
event is between $700 and $1,000 and
that<00:00:53.879> depends<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.329> how<00:00:54.449> long<00:00:54.629> we're<00:00:54.870> there<00:00:55.110> we

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
that depends on how long we're there we

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.410 
that depends on how long we're there we
do<00:00:55.530> two<00:00:55.739> three<00:00:56.100> four<00:00:56.399> hour<00:00:56.550> events<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.329> it

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
do two three four hour events and it

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.240 
do two three four hour events and it
kind<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.660> breaks<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.500> I'd<00:00:58.949> say<00:00:59.129> our

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
kind of breaks up like that I'd say our

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.040 
kind of breaks up like that I'd say our
average<00:00:59.609> event<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.120> about<00:01:00.449> eight<00:01:00.690> hundred<00:01:01.020> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
average event is about eight hundred and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.410 
average event is about eight hundred and
fifty<00:01:01.260> dollars<00:01:01.829> per<00:01:01.859> event<00:01:02.340> now<00:01:03.090> there<00:01:03.300> are

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
fifty dollars per event now there are

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.179 
fifty dollars per event now there are
weekday<00:01:03.809> events<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.470> do<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:04.739> corporate

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
weekday events that we do for corporate

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.149 
weekday events that we do for corporate
companies<00:01:05.640> or<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.320> kids<00:01:07.320> birthdays<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.070> we

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
companies or like kids birthdays that we

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.440 
companies or like kids birthdays that we
charge<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.549> little<00:01:08.640> bit<00:01:08.880> less<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.390> because

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
charge a little bit less just because

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.480 
charge a little bit less just because
there's<00:01:09.930> less<00:01:10.140> demand<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:10.890> may<00:01:11.189> be<00:01:11.250> doing

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
there's less demand so we may be doing

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.880 
there's less demand so we may be doing
between<00:01:11.970> four<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.420> six<00:01:12.810> hundred<00:01:13.140> for<00:01:13.380> a

doing 30 events a year at about $850 is
your<00:01:21.360> average<00:01:21.720> you're<00:01:22.049> looking<00:01:22.259> around

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
your average you're looking around

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.719 
your average you're looking around
$25,000<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.909> revenue<00:01:24.420> now<00:01:25.320> that's<00:01:26.070> not<00:01:26.280> profit

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
$25,000 in revenue now that's not profit

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.300 
$25,000 in revenue now that's not profit
that's<00:01:26.880> revenue<00:01:27.530> $25,000<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:29.009> thing<00:01:29.220> I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
that's revenue $25,000 the thing I

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.789 
that's revenue $25,000 the thing I
really<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.670> about<00:01:29.729> photo<00:01:30.240> booths<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.799> that

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
really like about photo booths is that

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.880 
really like about photo booths is that
there's<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.070> lot<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.340> profit<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.000> revenue

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
there's a lot of profit in that revenue

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.100 
there's a lot of profit in that revenue
expenses<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:35.040> advertising<00:01:35.720> ink<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.930> paper

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
expenses are advertising ink and paper

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.289 
expenses are advertising ink and paper
those<00:01:37.530> are<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> big<00:01:37.920> ones<00:01:38.119> advertising<00:01:39.119> over

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
those are the big ones advertising over

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.380 
those are the big ones advertising over
the<00:01:39.900> whole<00:01:40.140> year<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.759> cities<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.299> were

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the whole year and for cities that were

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.700 
the whole year and for cities that were
working<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.780> we're<00:01:42.990> averaging<00:01:43.140> about<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
working in we're averaging about a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.219 
working in we're averaging about a
hundred<00:01:44.189> dollars<00:01:44.549> per<00:01:44.850> sale<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.020> means
