that does not mean you want them to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.580 
that does not mean you want them to
think<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.909> everything's<00:01:15.540> perfect<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.409> do

knockdown drag out if that's your
relationship<00:01:23.729> I'm<00:01:23.939> definitely<00:01:24.659> against<00:01:25.290> that

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
relationship I'm definitely against that

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.990

for<00:01:25.710> taking<00:01:26.040> place<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.610> front<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
for taking place in front of the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.760 
for taking place in front of the
children<00:01:27.180> well<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.080> say<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.409> don't

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
children well I have to say we don't

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.270 
children well I have to say we don't
after<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.610> think<00:01:30.420> 18<00:01:30.780> years<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.439> soon<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
after I think 18 years and soon and

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.550 
after I think 18 years and soon and
being<00:01:32.490> together<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:33.810> definitely<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:34.290> not<00:01:34.380> do

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
being together we definitely do not do

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.050 
being together we definitely do not do
the<00:01:34.680> knock-down<00:01:35.070> drag-out<00:01:35.490> fights<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.880> front

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the knock-down drag-out fights in front

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.850 
the knock-down drag-out fights in front
of<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.180> kids<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.479> mean<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.750> do<00:01:36.960> bicker<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.619> I

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
of the kids I mean we do bicker but I

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.350 
of the kids I mean we do bicker but I
think<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.369> some<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.060> healthy

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
think that some of that is healthy

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.090 
think that some of that is healthy
because<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.780> teaches<00:01:39.930> our<00:01:40.200> kids<00:01:40.500> right<00:01:40.829> things

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
because it teaches our kids right things

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.010 
because it teaches our kids right things
aren't<00:01:41.460> always<00:01:41.670> perfect<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.720> okay<00:01:42.960> to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
aren't always perfect and it's okay to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.020 
aren't always perfect and it's okay to
argue<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.280> it's<00:01:44.399> not<00:01:44.579> okay<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> be

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
argue it's but it's not okay to be

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.270 
argue it's but it's not okay to be
hurtful<00:01:45.329> towards<00:01:45.750> one<00:01:46.049> another<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.560> there

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
hurtful towards one another and there

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.399 
hurtful towards one another and there
are<00:01:47.460> definitely<00:01:48.149> times<00:01:48.240> where<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.720> find<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.229> I

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
are definitely times where I find that I

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.770 
are definitely times where I find that I
actually<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.340> leave<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.700> room<00:01:50.850> or<00:01:51.119> he

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
actually have to leave the room or he

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.210 
actually have to leave the room or he
