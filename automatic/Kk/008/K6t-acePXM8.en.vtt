elephant print on the rounder tool box

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.469 
elephant print on the rounder tool box
maybe<00:01:49.740> could<00:01:50.100> be<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.280> little<00:01:50.729> bit<00:01:50.880> lower<00:01:51.180> but

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
maybe could be a little bit lower but

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.149 
maybe could be a little bit lower but
see<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.930> size<00:01:52.140> 13<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.800> I<00:01:52.830> don't<00:01:53.010> know<00:01:53.070> if

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
see this is size 13 so I don't know if

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.070 
see this is size 13 so I don't know if
that's<00:01:53.340> affecting<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:56.300> but<00:01:57.300> all<00:01:57.479> think<00:01:57.750> just

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
that's affecting it but all think just

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:06.800 
that's affecting it but all think just
sits<00:01:58.800> a<00:01:59.009> little<00:01:59.280> bit<00:01:59.490> lower<00:02:05.030> that<00:02:06.030> stars<00:02:06.450> there

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
sits a little bit lower that stars there

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.130 
sits a little bit lower that stars there
I<00:02:09.979> guess<00:02:10.979> everything<00:02:11.400> else<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.700> on<00:02:11.880> point<00:02:12.180> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
I guess everything else is on point the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.310 
I guess everything else is on point the
rep<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.650> even<00:02:14.040> more<00:02:14.910> tumbled<00:02:15.480> into<00:02:15.690> alternate

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
rep is even more tumbled into alternate

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.240 
rep is even more tumbled into alternate
which<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.709> crazy

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
which is crazy

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.790 
which is crazy

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
little thicker on authentic this is the

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.460 
little thicker on authentic this is the
authentic<00:03:23.150> look<00:03:23.810> at<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.020> look<00:03:24.290> at<00:03:24.380> the

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
grooves and here's the rep just a tiny

grooves and here's the rep just a tiny
bit<00:03:28.760> thinner<00:03:29.660> on<00:03:29.960> the<00:03:30.020> rep<00:03:30.430> off<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.730> can<00:03:32.030> see

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
bit thinner on the rep off you can see

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.530 
bit thinner on the rep off you can see
that<00:03:32.510> though<00:03:36.130> other<00:03:37.130> difference<00:03:37.640> is<00:03:37.880> this

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
that though other difference is this

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.770 
that though other difference is this
part<00:03:39.050> right<00:03:39.080> here<00:03:39.290> on<00:03:39.740> the<00:03:40.190> authentic<00:03:43.780> now

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
part right here on the authentic now

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.860 
part right here on the authentic now
we're<00:03:44.960> going<00:03:45.050> to<00:03:45.140> look<00:03:45.260> at<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.500> rep<00:03:49.870> being

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
we're going to look at the rep being

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.920 
we're going to look at the rep being
real<00:03:51.080> technical<00:03:51.620> right<00:03:51.770> now<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:53.420> shade<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:53.900> a

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
real technical right now the shade is a

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.810 
real technical right now the shade is a
little<00:03:54.410> bit<00:03:54.590> lighter<00:03:54.860> on<00:03:55.070> the<00:03:55.100> rep<00:03:55.400> and

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
little bit lighter on the rep and

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.780 
little bit lighter on the rep and
compared<00:03:56.180> to<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.390> authentic<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:57.520> the<00:03:58.520> holes

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
compared to the authentic and the holes

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.330 
compared to the authentic and the holes
are<00:03:59.120> just<00:03:59.300> a<00:04:01.840> little<00:04:02.840> better<00:04:03.020> on<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.800> all<00:04:04.010> I'll

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
are just a little better on the all I'll

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.120 
are just a little better on the all I'll
think<00:04:04.760> right<00:04:05.000> here<00:04:08.470> as<00:04:09.470> you<00:04:09.770> can<00:04:09.890> see<00:04:10.010> the

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
think right here as you can see the

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.280 
think right here as you can see the
whole<00:04:10.340> tabs<00:04:10.970> right<00:04:11.270> there<00:04:11.510> are<00:04:11.690> a<00:04:11.720> little<00:04:11.960> bit

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
whole tabs right there are a little bit

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.430 
whole tabs right there are a little bit
farther<00:04:12.590> apart<00:04:12.800> on<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.340> authentic<00:04:14.290> see<00:04:15.290> that

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
farther apart on the authentic see that

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.880 
farther apart on the authentic see that
gap<00:04:15.710> in<00:04:15.890> between<00:04:16.480> right<00:04:17.480> here<00:04:17.780> it's<00:04:18.710> a<00:04:18.770> little

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
gap in between right here it's a little

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.100 
gap in between right here it's a little
bit<00:04:19.040> wider<00:04:19.400> and<00:04:20.260> on<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.470> rep<00:04:22.840> overall<00:04:23.840> man

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
bit wider and on the rep overall man

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:35.909 
bit wider and on the rep overall man
this<00:04:24.380> three<00:04:24.770> is<00:04:24.920> like<00:04:25.100> crazy<00:04:26.680> close

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.860 

the<00:04:36.340> biggest<00:04:36.550> flaw<00:04:36.819> like<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.090> said<00:04:37.360> is<00:04:37.479> at<00:04:37.659> top

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
the biggest flaw like I said is at top

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.689 
the biggest flaw like I said is at top
of<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:38.110> tongues<00:04:38.409> a<00:04:38.590> little<00:04:38.889> ripple<00:04:39.280> but<00:04:39.430> I

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
of that tongues a little ripple but I

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.270 
of that tongues a little ripple but I
believe<00:04:40.629> people<00:04:40.810> do<00:04:41.379> get<00:04:41.560> pairs<00:04:41.860> where<00:04:42.099> it's

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
believe people do get pairs where it's

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.860 
believe people do get pairs where it's
the<00:04:42.669> tongue<00:04:42.909> is<00:04:43.030> a<00:04:43.120> little<00:04:43.330> bit<00:04:43.539> there's<00:04:43.810> a

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
the tongue is a little bit there's a

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.960 
the tongue is a little bit there's a
little<00:04:44.080> better<00:04:44.229> so<00:04:44.440> it<00:04:44.530> varies<00:04:44.979> compared<00:04:45.849> to

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
little better so it varies compared to

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.749 
little better so it varies compared to
pair<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:46.449> soul<00:04:47.349> both<00:04:47.650> red<00:04:47.979> with<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.250> white<00:04:48.310> jump

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
pair and soul both red with a white jump

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:54.390 
pair and soul both red with a white jump
man<00:04:51.960> we've<00:04:52.960> got<00:04:53.169> the<00:04:53.259> size<00:04:53.500> tie<00:04:53.800> both<00:04:54.069> got<00:04:54.280> the
