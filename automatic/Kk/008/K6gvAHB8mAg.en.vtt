try<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.200> figure<00:01:20.470> out<00:01:20.620> you<00:01:20.920> can<00:01:21.220> I<00:01:21.310> said<00:01:21.610> get

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
try to figure out you can I said get

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:36.980 
try to figure out you can I said get
away<00:01:23.070> easy<00:01:24.070> gigs<00:01:26.729> six<00:01:34.080> there's<00:01:35.080> seven<00:01:35.770> eight

away easy gigs six there's seven eight

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.020 
away easy gigs six there's seven eight
probably<00:01:37.990> find<00:01:38.170> more<00:01:38.440> if<00:01:38.650> I<00:01:38.800> wasn't<00:01:39.009> stuck<00:01:39.850> out

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
probably find more if I wasn't stuck out
