 I would still like to use Assoces 4 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.879
 quite simply 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.879
 we open the application 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.199
 we looked for an accountant we want 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.699

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.860

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.750
 first version 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.060
 to conclude on a link 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.060
 any of them 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.370

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.829
 we click 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.479
 application 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.639
 the roms we click on crystal 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.639

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.599
 its excess of debts 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.599
 the application will still be there 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.489
