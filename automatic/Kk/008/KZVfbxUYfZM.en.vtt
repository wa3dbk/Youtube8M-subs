00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
New Year over the holidays I had an

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.339 
New Year over the holidays I had an
intense<00:00:08.029> craving<00:00:08.269> for<00:00:08.630> chocolate<00:00:08.840> milk<00:00:09.290> and

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:09.349 
intense craving for chocolate milk and

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.440 
intense craving for chocolate milk and
all<00:00:09.500> the<00:00:09.620> stores<00:00:09.920> were<00:00:10.099> closed<00:00:10.370> so<00:00:10.639> I<00:00:10.999> read<00:00:11.330> it

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
all the stores were closed so I read it

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.930 
all the stores were closed so I read it
around<00:00:11.660> in<00:00:11.870> the<00:00:11.929> pantry<00:00:12.410> and<00:00:12.879> experimented<00:00:13.879> a

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
around in the pantry and experimented a

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.150 
around in the pantry and experimented a
bit<00:00:13.969> and<00:00:14.329> came<00:00:14.749> up<00:00:14.959> with<00:00:15.289> a<00:00:15.499> reasonable

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
bit and came up with a reasonable

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.310 
bit and came up with a reasonable
substitute<00:00:16.400> now<00:00:17.030> this<00:00:17.180> is<00:00:17.330> not<00:00:17.539> identical<00:00:18.200> to

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
substitute now this is not identical to

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.470 
substitute now this is not identical to
the<00:00:18.440> one<00:00:18.590> that<00:00:18.830> you<00:00:19.400> will<00:00:19.550> buy<00:00:19.789> in<00:00:20.060> the<00:00:20.210> store

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
the one that you will buy in the store

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.589 
the one that you will buy in the store

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599 
but if you're stuck like I was in a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.210 
but if you're stuck like I was in a
pinch<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:24.019> you<00:00:24.080> want<00:00:24.320> some<00:00:24.590> it's<00:00:24.830> pretty<00:00:25.039> easy

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
pinch and you want some it's pretty easy

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.269 
pinch and you want some it's pretty easy
to<00:00:25.369> make<00:00:25.609> and<00:00:25.910> it<00:00:26.240> tastes<00:00:26.480> pretty<00:00:26.660> good<00:00:27.279> so

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
to make and it tastes pretty good so

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:35.650 
to make and it tastes pretty good so
here's<00:00:28.490> the<00:00:28.669> ingredients

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.940 

what<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.809> want<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.829> yourself

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
what you want to do is get yourself

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.130 
what you want to do is get yourself
about<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.970> two<00:00:39.210> cup<00:00:39.510> container<00:00:40.579> and<00:00:41.809> first<00:00:42.809> hang

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
about a two cup container and first hang

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.979 
about a two cup container and first hang
out<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.920> regular<00:00:44.640> sugar<00:00:47.449> then<00:00:48.449> add<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.840> icing

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
out the regular sugar then add the icing

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.490 
out the regular sugar then add the icing
sugar<00:00:50.000> this<00:00:51.000> part<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.510> get<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.720> little<00:00:51.930> messy

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.350 

so<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.739> measure<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.220> rough<00:00:56.550> don't<00:00:56.910> tamp<00:00:57.210> it

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
so just measure this rough don't tamp it

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.040 
so just measure this rough don't tamp it
down<00:00:57.420> or<00:00:57.750> anything

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.920 

next<00:01:01.050> measure<00:01:01.230> your<00:01:01.530> cocoa<00:01:02.120> by<00:01:03.120> spooning<00:01:03.659> it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
next measure your cocoa by spooning it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.969 
next measure your cocoa by spooning it
into<00:01:04.940> your<00:01:05.940> measuring<00:01:06.180> cup

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
into your measuring cup

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.590 
into your measuring cup
this<00:01:07.979> does<00:01:08.220> not<00:01:08.399> pour<00:01:08.759> very<00:01:09.000> well<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.509> you

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
this does not pour very well and if you

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.359 
this does not pour very well and if you
think<00:01:09.780> icing<00:01:10.140> sugar<00:01:10.289> makes<00:01:10.649> a<00:01:10.800> mess<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.160> is

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
think icing sugar makes a mess this is

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:20.560 
think icing sugar makes a mess this is
like<00:01:11.550> three<00:01:11.759> times<00:01:11.789> is<00:01:12.180> magically<00:01:12.720> not

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.750 

yeah<00:01:21.170> again<00:01:21.470> don't<00:01:21.680> tamp<00:01:22.040> it<00:01:22.160> down<00:01:22.220> too<00:01:22.550> much

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
yeah again don't tamp it down too much

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.200 
yeah again don't tamp it down too much
just<00:01:22.970> kind<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:23.270> even<00:01:23.540> it<00:01:23.630> out<00:01:24.730> just<00:01:25.730> add<00:01:26.000> that

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
just kind of even it out just add that

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.910 
just kind of even it out just add that
to<00:01:26.480> it<00:01:27.850> then<00:01:28.850> carefully<00:01:29.390> measure<00:01:29.660> your<00:01:29.990> salt

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.620 

and<00:01:33.920> just<00:01:34.400> sprinkle<00:01:34.820> that<00:01:34.850> over<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.270> top<00:01:35.390> and

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.490 

put<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.750> lid<00:01:41.930> on<00:01:42.140> it<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:44.240> give<00:01:44.660> it<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.960> really

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
looking pretty good now chocolate milk

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.250 
looking pretty good now chocolate milk
is<00:01:53.150> one<00:01:53.300> of<00:01:53.390> those<00:01:53.479> things<00:01:53.780> every<00:01:54.050> met

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
is one of those things every met

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.440 
is one of those things every met
everybody<00:01:54.590> makes<00:01:55.040> their<00:01:55.250> own<00:01:55.310> way<00:01:55.670> there's

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
everybody makes their own way there's

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.240 
everybody makes their own way there's
basically<00:01:56.960> two<00:01:57.260> ways<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.710> do<00:01:57.800> with<00:01:57.950> powder

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
basically two ways to do with powder

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.330 
basically two ways to do with powder
first<00:01:58.580> or<00:01:58.910> powder<00:01:59.120> after<00:01:59.690> I<00:01:59.930> always<00:02:00.890> prefer

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
first or powder after I always prefer

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.520 
first or powder after I always prefer
the<00:02:01.520> powder<00:02:01.700> first<00:02:02.090> method<00:02:02.660> because<00:02:03.380> you're

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
the powder first method because you're

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.980 
the powder first method because you're
not<00:02:03.680> chasing<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.250> around<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:04.760> much<00:02:04.970> so<00:02:05.870> I'll

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
not chasing it around so much so I'll

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.060 
not chasing it around so much so I'll
put<00:02:06.229> like<00:02:06.380> a<00:02:06.910> good<00:02:07.910> spoon<00:02:08.270> in<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.570> bit<00:02:11.830> now<00:02:12.830> if

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
put like a good spoon in a bit now if

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.680 
put like a good spoon in a bit now if
you<00:02:13.190> don't<00:02:13.459> want<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.760> be<00:02:13.850> chasing<00:02:14.150> lumps

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
you don't want to be chasing lumps

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.260 
you don't want to be chasing lumps
around<00:02:15.020> what<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.100> should<00:02:16.310> do<00:02:16.520> is<00:02:16.760> just<00:02:16.790> add<00:02:17.240> a

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
around what you should do is just add a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.570 
around what you should do is just add a
little<00:02:17.660> bit<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:18.140> milk<00:02:18.850> at<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.090> beginning

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
little bit of milk at the beginning

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:31.420 
little bit of milk at the beginning
