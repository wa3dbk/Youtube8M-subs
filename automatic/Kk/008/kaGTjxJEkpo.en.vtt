disappointed with the result it was
tight<00:00:03.330> game<00:00:03.629> probably<00:00:04.560> settled<00:00:04.950> by<00:00:05.930> one

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
tight game probably settled by one

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.640 
tight game probably settled by one
moment<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:08.960> standout<00:00:09.960> quality<00:00:12.349> we<00:00:13.349> didn't

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
moment of standout quality we didn't

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.180 
moment of standout quality we didn't
really<00:00:13.920> create<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.670> chances<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.599> we've

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
really create the chances that we've

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.510 
really create the chances that we've
done<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.340> previous<00:00:17.550> games<00:00:17.970> at<00:00:18.240> home<00:00:18.359> but<00:00:19.520> you

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
done in previous games at home but you

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.689 
done in previous games at home but you
know<00:00:20.670> that's<00:00:21.500> and<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:22.859> we<00:00:23.279> are<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
know that's and so it is we are the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.310 
know that's and so it is we are the
chances<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> first<00:00:24.449> half<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.960> think<00:00:25.230> we

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
chances in the first half I think we

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.220 
chances in the first half I think we
look<00:00:25.439> pretty<00:00:25.699> pretty<00:00:26.699> dangerous<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.570> last

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
look pretty pretty dangerous in the last

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.380 
look pretty pretty dangerous in the last
25<00:00:28.680> minutes<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.189> first<00:00:29.310> half<00:00:29.519> create<00:00:30.210> some

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
25 minutes of the first half create some

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.600 
25 minutes of the first half create some
good<00:00:30.539> chances<00:00:30.720> there<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.349> didn't<00:00:32.340> happen<00:00:32.520> for

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
good chances there but didn't happen for

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:43.190 
good chances there but didn't happen for

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
interested of course because because of

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.549 
interested of course because because of
his<00:00:46.710> arrival<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:48.120> always<00:00:48.989> difficult<00:00:49.230> to

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
his arrival here always difficult to

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.639 
his arrival here always difficult to
judge<00:00:49.829> your<00:00:49.980> player<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.899> going<00:00:51.899> into<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.199> losing

situation when we're not being

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.860 
situation when we're not being
particularly<00:00:54.360> creative<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.989> think<00:00:55.170> that's

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
particularly creative and I think that's

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.319 
particularly creative and I think that's
you<00:00:57.870> know<00:00:57.989> but<00:00:58.140> I'm<00:00:58.379> pleased<00:00:58.859> he's<00:00:59.070> handsome

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
you know but I'm pleased he's handsome

experience<00:01:04.710> playing<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.489> front<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.880> our<00:01:06.000> own

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
experience playing in front of our own

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.740 
experience playing in front of our own
crowd<00:01:07.250> but<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.280> never<00:01:08.970> easy<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.510> sort<00:01:09.659> of

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
crowd but it's never easy to sort of

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.840 
crowd but it's never easy to sort of
quantify<00:01:10.909> what<00:01:12.470> is<00:01:13.470> capable<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.979> because<00:01:14.400> he's

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
quantify what is capable of because he's

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.050 
quantify what is capable of because he's
a<00:01:14.880> goalscorer<00:01:15.210> means<00:01:15.890> record<00:01:16.890> would<00:01:17.820> bear

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
a goalscorer means record would bear

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.490 
a goalscorer means record would bear
that<00:01:18.240> out<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.049> know<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.290> didn't

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
that out but we you know we didn't

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.300 
that out but we you know we didn't
really<00:01:19.610> create<00:01:20.610> too<00:01:20.909> much<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> last<00:01:22.310> 20

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
really create too much in the last 20

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.249 
really create too much in the last 20
minutes<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.540> very<00:01:24.720> difficult<00:01:24.900> to

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
minutes or so so it is very difficult to

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.390 
minutes or so so it is very difficult to
sort<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.960> quantify<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.590> bum<00:01:28.829> I'm<00:01:29.070> pleased

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
sort of to quantify that bum I'm pleased

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.550 
sort of to quantify that bum I'm pleased
he's<00:01:29.579> had<00:01:29.729> some<00:01:29.939> time<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.450> pitch

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.389 

defensively<00:01:33.560> I<00:01:33.649> thought<00:01:33.890> we<00:01:34.009> were<00:01:34.069> rock<00:01:34.219> solid

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
defensively I thought we were rock solid

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.849 
defensively I thought we were rock solid
today<00:01:34.670> we<00:01:34.939> made<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.420> lot<00:01:35.630> of<00:01:35.689> changes<00:01:36.170> some

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
today we made a lot of changes some

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.819 
today we made a lot of changes some
forced<00:01:37.600> others<00:01:38.600> with<00:01:38.840> players<00:01:39.350> coming<00:01:39.619> back

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
forced others with players coming back

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.800 
forced others with players coming back
into<00:01:40.069> the<00:01:40.189> team<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:40.729> it<00:01:41.359> was<00:01:41.539> a<00:01:41.569> little<00:01:41.630> bit

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
into the team so it was a little bit

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.709 
into the team so it was a little bit
disruptive<00:01:42.369> prior<00:01:43.369> to<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:44.119> kickoff<00:01:44.479> but

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
disruptive prior to the the kickoff but

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.959 
disruptive prior to the the kickoff but
I<00:01:45.049> thought<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.469> back<00:01:45.619> for<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.159> as<00:01:46.340> my<00:01:46.549> baggage

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
I thought the back for and as my baggage

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.779 
I thought the back for and as my baggage
were<00:01:47.659> rock<00:01:47.869> solid<00:01:48.109> in<00:01:48.859> fairness<00:01:49.159> they<00:01:49.579> didn't

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
were rock solid in fairness they didn't

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.510 
were rock solid in fairness they didn't
have<00:01:49.939> have<00:01:50.539> to<00:01:50.689> deal<00:01:50.869> with<00:01:51.020> too<00:01:51.349> much<00:01:51.530> because

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
have have to deal with too much because

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.839 
have have to deal with too much because
ahead<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.539> them<00:01:53.689> so<00:01:54.289> midfield<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:54.979> our<00:01:55.250> front

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
ahead of them so midfield and our front

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:01.059

allow<00:02:01.130> Lester<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.909> gain<00:02:02.149> any<00:02:02.329> real<00:02:02.689> momentum

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
allow Lester to gain any real momentum

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.100 
allow Lester to gain any real momentum
