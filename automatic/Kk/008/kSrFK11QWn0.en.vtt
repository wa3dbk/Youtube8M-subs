00:01:18.193 --> 00:01:19.628
 Meeting with you 

00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:23.688
 With a panorama to kill 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:27.465
 Face to face 

00:01:28.383 --> 00:01:31.355
 In hidden places we feel the cold 

00:02:03.072 --> 00:02:06.165
 Evening conceals me 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.336
 but you know the plans I'm making 

00:02:11.323 --> 00:02:14.046
 Inspection continues 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.259
 could be? 

00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:19.557
 The hole that I am opening? 

00:02:22.213 --> 00:02:23.844
 a religious reason 

00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:27.886
 A mystery opening inside 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.402
 a week is the cause until 

00:02:33.722 --> 00:02:36.454
 Let's dance on fire 

00:02:37.563 --> 00:02:41.148
 That deadly kiss is all we need 

00:02:41.792 --> 00:02:44.303
 Let's dance on fire 

00:02:44.985 --> 00:02:48.652
 by the deadly sounds of those broken dreams 

00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:52.314
 Let's dance on fire 

00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:56.266
 that deadly kiss is all we need 

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.755
 Let's dance on fire 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.231
 when everything we see 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.486
 it's the scenario to kill 

00:03:35.664 --> 00:03:37.333
 The alternative for You 

00:03:38.553 --> 00:03:41.425
 it's the scenario to kill 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:44.889
 Between shadows, 

00:03:45.643 --> 00:03:49.356
 the murder stops 

00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:16.231
 Let's dance on fire 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.643
 That deadly kiss is all we need 

00:04:21.171 --> 00:04:23.711
 Let's dance on fire 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.401
 by the deadly sounds of those broken dreams 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.361
 Let's dance on fire 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.057
 That deadly kiss is all we need 

00:04:36.487 --> 00:04:41.693
 Let's dance in the fire! 

00:04:59.594 --> 00:05:02.417
 The crystal tears of the earth 

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:06.556
 they fall like snowflakes on your body 

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:10.162
 it's the first time in years 

00:05:10.486 --> 00:05:11.830
 that you bathe your skin with pink spots ... 

00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:15.858
 ... of a lover 

00:05:18.143 --> 00:05:19.888
 an opportunity to find 

00:05:20.398 --> 00:05:23.639
 to the Phoenix bird for the llama 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.652
 an opportunity to die 

00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:29.607
 but we can... 

00:05:30.025 --> 00:05:32.526
 Dance on fire 

00:05:33.486 --> 00:05:36.940
 That deadly kiss is all we need 

00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:39.838
 let's dance on fire 

00:05:41.398 --> 00:05:44.918
 by the deadly sounds of those broken dreams 

00:05:45.735 --> 00:05:48.189
 let's dance on fire 

00:05:48.883 --> 00:05:52.323
 that deadly kiss is all we need 

00:05:52.788 --> 00:05:55.292
 Let's dance in the fire! 

00:05:56.335 --> 00:05:58.212
 When everything we see 

00:05:58.202 --> 00:06:02.541
 Be the scenario to Kill!
