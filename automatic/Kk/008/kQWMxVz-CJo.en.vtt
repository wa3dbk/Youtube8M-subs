what<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.200> do<00:03:24.120> just<00:03:25.120> move<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.510> block<00:03:25.959> along<00:03:26.320> the

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
what to do just move the block along the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.910 
what to do just move the block along the
pathway<00:03:27.840> until<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:28.989> ends<00:03:29.260> up<00:03:29.410> where<00:03:29.739> it's

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
pathway until it ends up where it's

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:59.810 
pathway until it ends up where it's
supposed<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.489> be

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.680 

push<00:04:00.450> in<00:04:00.750> Allah<00:04:01.550> and<00:04:02.550> in<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:02.910> where<00:04:03.180> it's

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
push in Allah and in it where it's

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.130 
push in Allah and in it where it's
supposed<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:04.440> be<00:04:07.940> once<00:04:08.940> it's<00:04:09.180> in<00:04:09.330> place<00:04:09.510> climb

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
supposed to be once it's in place climb

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:18.410 
supposed to be once it's in place climb
up<00:04:10.410> here<00:04:12.170> then<00:04:13.170> could<00:04:13.650> I'm<00:04:13.830> on<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.520> ladder<00:04:17.420> and

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
up here then could I'm on the ladder and

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.970 
up here then could I'm on the ladder and
here<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:18.870> want<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.109> play<00:04:19.290> these<00:04:19.380> elbows<00:04:19.650> Allah

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
here you want to play these elbows Allah

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:49.670 
here you want to play these elbows Allah
by<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.790> start<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.269> fairy

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.650 

that's<00:04:50.680> right<00:04:50.980> the<00:04:51.190> theory<00:04:51.490> starts<00:04:51.970> going<00:04:52.390> and

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
that's right the theory starts going and

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.980 
that's right the theory starts going and
we<00:04:53.530> get<00:04:53.680> some<00:04:53.920> fights<00:04:54.190> with<00:04:54.430> Stalvey<00:04:57.810> see<00:04:58.810> on

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
we get some fights with Stalvey see on

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.770 
we get some fights with Stalvey see on
the<00:04:59.140> map<00:04:59.320> in<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.650> lower<00:04:59.830> right<00:05:00.160> hand<00:05:00.190> corner

the map in the lower right hand corner

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.630 
the map in the lower right hand corner
say<00:05:01.780> taking<00:05:02.410> you<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.920> other<00:05:03.070> side<00:05:03.160> of<00:05:03.430> the

room

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.810 

when<00:05:30.800> you're<00:05:30.950> on<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.160> other<00:05:31.310> side<00:05:31.610> of<00:05:31.640> the

when you're on the other side of the

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.570 
when you're on the other side of the
room<00:05:32.030> you<00:05:32.060> can<00:05:32.360> use<00:05:32.390> the<00:05:32.690> hugger<00:05:32.870> boots<00:05:33.200> to

I<00:05:41.470> believe<00:05:42.470> that's<00:05:42.620> names<00:05:42.980> of<00:05:43.190> ferry<00:05:51.010> and<00:05:52.010> Navi

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
I believe that's names of ferry and Navi

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.010 
I believe that's names of ferry and Navi
will<00:05:52.820> tell<00:05:53.270> us<00:05:53.450> to<00:05:53.810> get<00:05:54.170> off<00:05:54.560> of<00:05:54.620> the<00:05:55.160> ferry<00:05:55.700> a

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
will tell us to get off of the ferry a

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.020 
will tell us to get off of the ferry a
little<00:05:57.020> bit<00:05:57.170> too<00:05:57.740> late<00:05:58.010> but<00:05:58.340> better<00:05:58.610> late<00:05:58.820> than

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
little bit too late but better late than

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.090 
little bit too late but better late than
never
