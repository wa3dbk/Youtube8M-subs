00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
as you can see from our performance in

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.360 
as you can see from our performance in
qualifying<00:00:06.690> it<00:00:07.200> wasn't<00:00:07.680> such<00:00:07.830> an<00:00:07.980> easy<00:00:08.250> day

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
qualifying it wasn't such an easy day

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.820 
qualifying it wasn't such an easy day
for<00:00:08.400> us<00:00:08.670> which<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.000> why<00:00:09.300> most<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.440> drivers

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
for us which is why most of the drivers

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.830 
for us which is why most of the drivers
are<00:00:10.980> still<00:00:11.219> down<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:11.790> their<00:00:12.030> trucks<00:00:12.360> speaking

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
are still down in their trucks speaking

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.419 
are still down in their trucks speaking
with<00:00:12.929> their<00:00:13.049> engineer<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.590> trying<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.190> figure

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
with their engineer is trying to figure

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.369 
with their engineer is trying to figure
out<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.610> way<00:00:14.700> but<00:00:15.480> we're<00:00:15.690> gonna<00:00:15.839> make<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.199> better

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
out a way but we're gonna make it better

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.070 
out a way but we're gonna make it better
for<00:00:17.130> tomorrow<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:18.300> we're<00:00:18.449> gonna<00:00:18.600> get<00:00:18.810> them<00:00:18.960> up

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
for tomorrow but we're gonna get them up

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.870 
for tomorrow but we're gonna get them up
here<00:00:19.109> eventually<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.160> won't<00:00:20.369> see<00:00:20.580> all<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
here eventually so you won't see all the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.310 
here eventually so you won't see all the
drivers<00:00:21.090> no<00:00:21.689> worry<00:00:21.869> about<00:00:21.900> that

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
drivers no worry about that

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.499 
drivers no worry about that
but<00:00:23.890> since<00:00:24.099> we<00:00:24.249> can't<00:00:24.490> get<00:00:24.579> hold<00:00:24.789> of<00:00:24.880> our<00:00:25.060> DTM

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
but since we can't get hold of our DTM

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.359 
but since we can't get hold of our DTM
drivers<00:00:26.050> we<00:00:26.410> thought<00:00:26.650> we<00:00:26.829> might<00:00:27.009> introduce

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
drivers we thought we might introduce

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.999 
drivers we thought we might introduce

me the one let's go back a little bit to

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:01.169 
me the one let's go back a little bit to
the<00:01:59.439> performance<00:01:59.860> today<00:02:00.009> I<00:02:00.220> mean<00:02:00.459> a<00:02:00.729> really

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
the performance today I mean a really

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.699 
the performance today I mean a really
tough<00:02:01.390> day<00:02:01.630> for<00:02:01.959> the<00:02:02.020> guys<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:02.409> could<00:02:02.560> see

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
tough day for the guys you could see

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.679 
tough day for the guys you could see
that<00:02:02.830> they<00:02:02.979> were<00:02:03.009> pushing<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.729> lot<00:02:04.000> out<00:02:04.179> there

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
that they were pushing a lot out there

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.960 
that they were pushing a lot out there
gary<00:02:05.259> won<00:02:05.679> the<00:02:05.860> race<00:02:06.009> here<00:02:06.280> last<00:02:06.490> year<00:02:06.610> is<00:02:06.819> not

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
gary won the race here last year is not

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.240 
gary won the race here last year is not
as<00:02:07.090> if<00:02:07.240> he's<00:02:07.479> struggling<00:02:08.319> for<00:02:08.859> speed<00:02:09.130> around

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
as if he's struggling for speed around

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.039 
as if he's struggling for speed around
this<00:02:09.549> track<00:02:09.789> but<00:02:10.000> somehow<00:02:10.299> we<00:02:10.479> just<00:02:10.750> didn't

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
this track but somehow we just didn't

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.770 
this track but somehow we just didn't
quite<00:02:11.230> get<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.440> together<00:02:11.970> yeah<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.000> think<00:02:13.269> it's

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
quite get it together yeah I think it's

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.900 
quite get it together yeah I think it's
one<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:13.930> these<00:02:14.109> crew<00:02:14.380> tracks<00:02:14.739> I<00:02:14.980> think<00:02:15.190> that<00:02:15.400> if

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
one of these crew tracks I think that if

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.580 
one of these crew tracks I think that if
you've<00:02:16.420> not<00:02:16.570> got<00:02:16.630> perfect<00:02:17.170> balance<00:02:17.470> if

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
you've not got perfect balance if

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.710 
you've not got perfect balance if
something's<00:02:17.950> not<00:02:18.010> going<00:02:18.280> right<00:02:18.450> three<00:02:19.450> tenths

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
something's not going right three tenths

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.199 
something's not going right three tenths
off<00:02:19.959> Paul<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.620> it's<00:02:21.549> like<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.760> second

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
off Paul is it's like a second

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.970 
off Paul is it's like a second
everywhere<00:02:22.540> else<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:22.930> think<00:02:22.989> it's<00:02:23.260> it's<00:02:23.620> so

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
everywhere else and I think it's it's so

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.580 
everywhere else and I think it's it's so
crucial<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.970> think<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:26.079> the<00:02:26.170> point<00:02:26.380> where<00:02:26.560> I

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
crucial and I think to the point where I

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.920 
crucial and I think to the point where I
think<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.950> driver<00:02:27.190> kind<00:02:27.850> of<00:02:27.940> becomes<00:02:28.299> unknown

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
think the driver kind of becomes unknown

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.410 
think the driver kind of becomes unknown
and<00:02:29.260> he<00:02:30.220> can't<00:02:30.459> make<00:02:30.609> up<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.940> difference<00:02:31.090> in

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
and he can't make up the difference in

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.729 
and he can't make up the difference in
the<00:02:31.510> parts<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.989> track<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.560> car

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
the parts of the track that the car

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.470 
the parts of the track that the car
suits<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.190> because<00:02:33.459> it's<00:02:33.609> only<00:02:33.760> four<00:02:34.030> corners

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
suits it because it's only four corners

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.509 
suits it because it's only four corners
long<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:34.989> think<00:02:35.680> you're<00:02:36.160> playing<00:02:36.250> with<00:02:36.400> a

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
long I think you're playing with a

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.000 
long I think you're playing with a
battle<00:02:36.880> but<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.569> think<00:02:37.989> we<00:02:38.170> all<00:02:38.290> know<00:02:38.470> Gary<00:02:38.739> I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
battle but I think we all know Gary I

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.470 
battle but I think we all know Gary I
think<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:39.400> know<00:02:39.519> he<00:02:39.639> likes<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:40.060> pushes<00:02:40.329> we

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
think we know he likes the pushes we

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.479 
think we know he likes the pushes we
about<00:02:40.780> being<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.709> midfield<00:02:41.889> I'm<00:02:42.310> sure

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
about being in the midfield I'm sure

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.520 
about being in the midfield I'm sure
he'll<00:02:42.700> be<00:02:42.910> keeping<00:02:43.389> us<00:02:43.690> entertained<00:02:43.810> tomorrow

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
he'll be keeping us entertained tomorrow

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.620 
he'll be keeping us entertained tomorrow
and<00:02:44.799> I<00:02:45.250> wouldn't<00:02:45.880> expect<00:02:46.120> them<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.329> finish

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
and I wouldn't expect them to finish

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.150 
and I wouldn't expect them to finish
12th<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.139> certainly<00:02:47.410> expect<00:02:47.769> them<00:02:47.889> to<00:02:47.920> be<00:02:48.100> at

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
12th and certainly expect them to be at

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.650 
12th and certainly expect them to be at
least<00:02:48.310> being<00:02:48.609> the<00:02:48.700> points<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.180> hopefully

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
least being the points and hopefully

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.629 
least being the points and hopefully
we'll<00:02:50.049> see<00:02:50.230> him<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.530> bit<00:02:50.739> further<00:02:51.160> up<00:02:51.190> because

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
we'll see him a bit further up because

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.420 
we'll see him a bit further up because
it's<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.090> long<00:02:52.269> campaign<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:54.130> saw<00:02:54.280> what

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
it's a long campaign and you saw what

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.220 
it's a long campaign and you saw what
happened<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.880> last<00:02:55.090> year<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:58.690> know<00:02:58.720> lost<00:02:59.049> that

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
happened to last year you know lost that

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.440 
happened to last year you know lost that
by<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.380> few<00:02:59.620> points<00:02:59.920> at<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.069> end<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.519> maybe

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
by a few points at the end so maybe

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.660 
by a few points at the end so maybe
it'll<00:03:01.660> change<00:03:01.780> his<00:03:01.959> mind<00:03:02.079> say<00:03:02.319> of<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.670> you

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
it'll change his mind say of it you

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.059 
it'll change his mind say of it you
certainly<00:03:04.030> be<00:03:04.209> on<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.510> grid<00:03:05.170> raring<00:03:05.829> to<00:03:05.859> go

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
certainly be on the grid raring to go

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.680 
certainly be on the grid raring to go
tomorrow<00:03:06.250> we've<00:03:07.030> obviously<00:03:07.180> got<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.480> lot<00:03:07.540> of

to<00:03:28.920> help<00:03:29.130> them<00:03:29.340> what<00:03:29.459> do<00:03:29.520> you<00:03:29.580> think<00:03:29.849> as<00:03:30.239> a

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
to help them what do you think as a

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.150 
to help them what do you think as a
driver<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.900> just<00:03:31.080> go<00:03:31.200> out<00:03:31.290> there<00:03:31.530> regardless

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
driver you just go out there regardless

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.030 
driver you just go out there regardless
of<00:03:32.280> your<00:03:32.370> age<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:33.180> perform<00:03:33.650> well<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.680> started

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
of your age and perform well I started

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.040 
of your age and perform well I started
here<00:03:35.340> when<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.580> was<00:03:35.730> quite<00:03:35.910> young<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.720> makes<00:03:36.900> me

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
here when I was quite young it makes me

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.809 
here when I was quite young it makes me
feel<00:03:37.200> old<00:03:37.470> when<00:03:37.770> you<00:03:37.860> see<00:03:38.010> he's<00:03:38.160> only<00:03:38.310> 18<00:03:38.670> and

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
feel old when you see he's only 18 and

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.020 
feel old when you see he's only 18 and
I'm<00:03:38.880> 27<00:03:39.330> though<00:03:39.770> it<00:03:40.770> almost<00:03:40.950> makes<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.489> you

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
I'm 27 though it almost makes you you

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.880 
I'm 27 though it almost makes you you
know<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.239> look<00:03:42.450> back<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.930> but<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.650> think

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
know you look back and it but I think

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.530 
know you look back and it but I think
the<00:03:44.370> young<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:44.910> young<00:03:45.060> guys<00:03:45.239> are<00:03:45.420> obviously

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
the young the young guys are obviously

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.030 
the young the young guys are obviously
the<00:03:45.810> future<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.290> think<00:03:46.319> that's<00:03:46.650> always<00:03:46.890> the

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
the future and I think that's always the

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.610 
the future and I think that's always the
case<00:03:47.450> they're<00:03:48.450> always<00:03:48.600> pushing<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:49.140> think<00:03:49.350> the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
case they're always pushing I think the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.199 
case they're always pushing I think the
doors<00:03:50.040> are<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.280> limits<00:03:50.610> but<00:03:50.790> they<00:03:50.970> get<00:03:51.060> the

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
doors are the limits but they get the

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.330 
doors are the limits but they get the
lap<00:03:51.330> time<00:03:51.540> out<00:03:51.660> with<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.840> car<00:03:52.019> obviously<00:03:52.890> this

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
lap time out with a car obviously this

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.830 
lap time out with a car obviously this
is<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.489> difficult<00:03:53.819> place<00:03:54.180> when<00:03:54.450> you<00:03:54.540> when<00:03:54.750> you

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
is a difficult place when you when you

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.740 
is a difficult place when you when you
come<00:03:55.080> for<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.769> Pascal<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.459> likes<00:03:56.670> of<00:03:56.850> not

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
come for a Pascal the likes of not

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.420 
come for a Pascal the likes of not
knowing<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.049> track<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:58.650> think<00:03:58.950> when<00:03:59.310> you've

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
knowing the track I think when you've

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.800 
knowing the track I think when you've
only<00:03:59.549> got<00:03:59.730> an<00:03:59.819> hour<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.120> half<00:04:00.299> of<00:04:00.420> practice

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
only got an hour and a half of practice

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.240 
only got an hour and a half of practice
and<00:04:01.019> then<00:04:01.110> you're<00:04:01.560> in<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.769> deep<00:04:01.920> end<00:04:02.040> in

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
and then you're in the deep end in

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.220 
and then you're in the deep end in
qualifying<00:04:02.730> it's<00:04:03.480> going<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.720> be<00:04:03.810> difficult

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
qualifying it's going to be difficult

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.690 
qualifying it's going to be difficult
and<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.410> think<00:04:04.620> for<00:04:04.799> Mercedes<00:04:05.190> is<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.340> deal<00:04:05.549> like

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
and I think for Mercedes is a deal like

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.449 
and I think for Mercedes is a deal like
this<00:04:05.760> that's<00:04:06.630> me<00:04:06.840> is<00:04:07.049> but<00:04:07.319> I<00:04:07.890> think<00:04:08.250> they've

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
this that's me is but I think they've

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.759 
this that's me is but I think they've
got<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.880> great<00:04:09.150> guy<00:04:09.360> like<00:04:09.600> Gary<00:04:09.930> who's<00:04:10.500> very

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
got a great guy like Gary who's very

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.610 
got a great guy like Gary who's very
open<00:04:11.160> as<00:04:11.940> we<00:04:12.239> all<00:04:12.600> worked<00:04:12.840> with<00:04:13.019> Gary<00:04:13.170> over<00:04:13.380> the

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
open as we all worked with Gary over the

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.620 
open as we all worked with Gary over the
years<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.069> think<00:04:14.130> when<00:04:14.459> you're<00:04:14.640> open<00:04:14.940> it

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
years and I think when you're open it

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.789 
years and I think when you're open it
makes<00:04:15.810> a<00:04:15.900> difference<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.380> he's<00:04:16.500> got<00:04:16.680> the

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
makes a difference and he's got the

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.229 
makes a difference and he's got the
experience<00:04:17.280> hopefully<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.790> will<00:04:17.850> help<00:04:18.030> him

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
experience hopefully that will help him

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.360 
experience hopefully that will help him
and<00:04:18.810> develop<00:04:19.229> into<00:04:19.380> something<00:04:19.799> that<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:20.250> know

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
and develop into something that you know

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.940 
and develop into something that you know
of<00:04:20.640> take<00:04:20.820> over<00:04:21.060> his<00:04:21.180> role<00:04:21.780> when<00:04:22.169> Gary<00:04:22.470> moves<00:04:22.770> on

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
of take over his role when Gary moves on

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.790 
of take over his role when Gary moves on
and<00:04:23.250> up<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.490> ladder<00:04:23.669> as<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.060> goes<00:04:24.180> but<00:04:24.680> but<00:04:25.680> I'm

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
and up the ladder as it goes but but I'm

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.320 
and up the ladder as it goes but but I'm
sure<00:04:25.979> Gary's<00:04:26.310> got<00:04:26.430> a<00:04:26.490> few<00:04:26.669> years<00:04:26.700> left<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.240> I'm

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
sure Gary's got a few years left and I'm

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.540 
sure Gary's got a few years left and I'm
still<00:04:27.570> yeah<00:04:28.530> we'll<00:04:28.710> hang<00:04:28.890> on<00:04:28.979> to<00:04:29.130> Gary<00:04:29.280> for<00:04:29.520> a

still yeah we'll hang on to Gary for a
few<00:04:29.700> more<00:04:29.820> years<00:04:29.880> yet<00:04:30.300> so<00:04:31.260> going<00:04:31.470> on<00:04:31.710> moving<00:04:32.220> on

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
to your Formula One I mean it's it's

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.690 
to your Formula One I mean it's it's
going<00:04:34.260> very<00:04:34.380> well<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:34.890> had<00:04:35.010> a<00:04:35.039> really<00:04:35.340> couple

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
going very well you had a really couple

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.760 
going very well you had a really couple
good<00:04:36.360> couple<00:04:36.660> of<00:04:36.720> strong<00:04:36.990> races<00:04:37.410> in<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.560> last

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
good couple of strong races in the last

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.200 
good couple of strong races in the last
races<00:04:38.010> are<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:38.550> quite<00:04:38.729> happy<00:04:39.000> with<00:04:39.090> your

races are you quite happy with your
progress<00:04:40.010> yeah<00:04:41.010> I<00:04:41.039> think<00:04:41.250> we<00:04:41.789> have<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.120> be<00:04:42.240> for

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
progress yeah I think we have to be for

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.960 
progress yeah I think we have to be for
Force<00:04:43.169> India<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:43.740> obviously<00:04:44.220> I<00:04:44.310> made<00:04:44.610> food<00:04:44.760> run

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
Force India is obviously I made food run

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.770 
Force India is obviously I made food run
and<00:04:45.120> team<00:04:46.460> top<00:04:47.460> of<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.700> midfield<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.270> know<00:04:48.570> what

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
and team top of the midfield I know what

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.200 
and team top of the midfield I know what
it's<00:04:48.900> like<00:04:48.930> to<00:04:49.050> be<00:04:49.289> back<00:04:49.470> within<00:04:49.710> midfield

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
it's like to be back within midfield

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.000 
it's like to be back within midfield
yeah<00:04:51.210> well<00:04:51.510> it's<00:04:51.690> it<00:04:52.169> changes<00:04:52.590> your<00:04:52.740> mindset

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
yeah well it's it changes your mindset

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.940 
yeah well it's it changes your mindset
slightly<00:04:53.610> but<00:04:53.990> no<00:04:54.990> I<00:04:55.020> think<00:04:55.440> we've<00:04:55.770> been<00:04:55.919> a

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
slightly but no I think we've been a

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.010 
slightly but no I think we've been a
fortunate<00:04:56.430> position<00:04:56.520> this<00:04:56.940> year<00:04:57.090> with<00:04:57.240> we

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
fortunate position this year with we

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.930 
fortunate position this year with we
went<00:04:58.260> through<00:04:58.470> to<00:04:58.890> have<00:04:59.039> a<00:04:59.100> consistent<00:04:59.520> car

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
went through to have a consistent car

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.700 
went through to have a consistent car
and<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:00.510> make<00:05:00.660> sure<00:05:00.840> we<00:05:00.960> got<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.289> car<00:05:01.500> in<00:05:01.680> a

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
and to make sure we got the car in a

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.710 
and to make sure we got the car in a
performance<00:05:02.490> label<00:05:03.060> that<00:05:03.180> was<00:05:03.360> good<00:05:03.539> it<00:05:03.600> was

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
performance label that was good it was

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.230 
performance label that was good it was
gonna<00:05:03.900> help<00:05:04.140> us<00:05:04.320> and<00:05:04.470> make<00:05:04.950> us<00:05:05.130> be<00:05:05.729> consistent

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
gonna help us and make us be consistent

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.900 
gonna help us and make us be consistent
over<00:05:06.419> the<00:05:06.510> year<00:05:07.039> or<00:05:08.039> so<00:05:08.220> somewhere<00:05:08.610> we<00:05:08.850> in

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
over the year or so somewhere we in

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.700 
over the year or so somewhere we in
qualifying<00:05:09.450> as<00:05:09.600> you<00:05:09.720> see<00:05:09.870> with<00:05:10.020> Mercedes<00:05:10.440> but

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
qualifying as you see with Mercedes but

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.129 
qualifying as you see with Mercedes but
the<00:05:11.490> reverse<00:05:11.789> happens<00:05:12.360> in<00:05:12.479> the<00:05:12.570> race<00:05:12.750> and<00:05:12.960> they

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
the reverse happens in the race and they

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.200 
the reverse happens in the race and they
seem<00:05:13.350> to<00:05:13.500> go<00:05:14.070> a<00:05:14.100> bit<00:05:14.190> backwards<00:05:14.789> and<00:05:14.940> we<00:05:15.000> come

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
seem to go a bit backwards and we come

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.680 
seem to go a bit backwards and we come
forward<00:05:15.600> but<00:05:16.729> battling<00:05:17.729> all<00:05:17.850> the<00:05:17.970> way<00:05:18.090> I<00:05:18.270> think

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
forward but battling all the way I think

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.529 
forward but battling all the way I think
we've<00:05:19.680> we've<00:05:19.950> obviously<00:05:20.160> matched<00:05:20.940> their<00:05:21.240> best

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
we've we've obviously matched their best

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.150 
we've we've obviously matched their best
result<00:05:21.690> from<00:05:21.930> last<00:05:22.200> year<00:05:22.440> already<00:05:22.860> in<00:05:23.070> the

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
result from last year already in the

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.159 
result from last year already in the
fourth<00:05:23.370> prong<00:05:23.580> between<00:05:23.820> the

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
fourth prong between the

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.080 
fourth prong between the
and<00:05:24.349> narrowly<00:05:25.159> missed<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.520> podium<00:05:25.879> so<00:05:25.909> I

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
and narrowly missed the podium so I

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.270 
and narrowly missed the podium so I
think<00:05:26.360> when<00:05:27.139> the<00:05:27.259> car<00:05:27.469> suits<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:28.039> the

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
think when the car suits the the

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.770 
think when the car suits the the
conditions<00:05:28.729> in<00:05:28.849> suits<00:05:29.060> attract<00:05:29.360> a<00:05:29.389> bit<00:05:29.629> better

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
conditions in suits attract a bit better

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.450 
conditions in suits attract a bit better
I<00:05:29.930> think<00:05:30.080> will<00:05:30.349> be<00:05:30.469> far<00:05:30.650> more<00:05:30.680> aggressive<00:05:31.310> and

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
I think will be far more aggressive and

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.369 
I think will be far more aggressive and
I<00:05:31.520> think<00:05:31.759> ultimately<00:05:32.240> we<00:05:32.779> probably<00:05:32.990> will<00:05:33.199> get

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:33.379 
I think ultimately we probably will get

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.350 
I think ultimately we probably will get
on<00:05:33.529> the<00:05:33.560> podium<00:05:33.909> should<00:05:34.909> we<00:05:35.029> get<00:05:35.120> a<00:05:35.180> bit<00:05:35.330> more

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
on the podium should we get a bit more

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.779 
on the podium should we get a bit more
luck<00:05:35.659> on<00:05:35.779> our<00:05:35.870> site<00:05:36.080> but<00:05:36.249> taking<00:05:37.249> that<00:05:37.279> away

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
luck on our site but taking that away

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.700 
luck on our site but taking that away
the<00:05:38.210> important<00:05:38.569> thing<00:05:38.749> is<00:05:38.900> like<00:05:39.110> last<00:05:39.349> week<00:05:39.560> is

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
the important thing is like last week is

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.989 
the important thing is like last week is
to<00:05:39.830> keep<00:05:39.979> plucking<00:05:40.219> away<00:05:40.430> at<00:05:40.580> the<00:05:40.639> points

00:05:40.989 --> 00:05:40.999 
to keep plucking away at the points

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:43.029 
to keep plucking away at the points
we're<00:05:41.870> already<00:05:42.080> in<00:05:42.259> a<00:05:42.319> strong<00:05:42.499> position<00:05:42.680> I

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
we're already in a strong position I

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.129 
we're already in a strong position I
start<00:05:43.279> to<00:05:43.460> difficult<00:05:43.939> races<00:05:44.120> maybe<00:05:44.870> we<00:05:44.960> should

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
start to difficult races maybe we should

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.890 
start to difficult races maybe we should
have<00:05:45.229> done<00:05:45.349> better<00:05:45.529> but<00:05:46.330> coming<00:05:47.330> up<00:05:47.389> to<00:05:47.539> Monaco

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
have done better but coming up to Monaco

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
going to be a strong bat of ultimately

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.490 
going to be a strong bat of ultimately
makan<00:05:58.909> we're<00:05:59.479> not<00:05:59.629> lost<00:05:59.810> respect<00:06:00.020> for<00:06:00.259> them

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
and we know that they will overtake her

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.149 
and we know that they will overtake her
shortly<00:06:02.870> but<00:06:03.169> while<00:06:03.379> that<00:06:03.620> while<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:03.979> time

shortly but while that while the time

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:06.820 
shortly but while that while the time
lasts<00:06:04.669> if<00:06:05.060> we<00:06:05.180> can<00:06:05.360> get<00:06:05.539> a<00:06:05.750> bigger<00:06:06.169> gap<00:06:06.409> into

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
lasts if we can get a bigger gap into

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.860 
lasts if we can get a bigger gap into
Williams<00:06:07.400> and<00:06:07.639> sober<00:06:08.000> that<00:06:08.120> you<00:06:08.270> you<00:06:08.779> know

front<00:06:29.990> of<00:06:30.139> McLaren<00:06:30.500> I<00:06:30.919> mean<00:06:31.460> that's<00:06:31.639> that's

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:32.089 
front of McLaren I mean that's that's

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:34.480 
front of McLaren I mean that's that's
quite<00:06:32.270> a<00:06:32.389> feat<00:06:32.839> in<00:06:32.960> itself<00:06:33.050> and<00:06:33.620> you<00:06:33.680> said<00:06:33.919> okay

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
quite a feat in itself and you said okay

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.189 
quite a feat in itself and you said okay
you<00:06:34.550> weren't<00:06:34.759> expected<00:06:35.270> to<00:06:35.360> be<00:06:35.479> them<00:06:35.689> but<00:06:35.930> in

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
you weren't expected to be them but in

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.050 
you weren't expected to be them but in
all<00:06:36.500> honesty<00:06:36.979> it's<00:06:37.310> looking<00:06:37.729> like<00:06:37.849> if<00:06:37.969> you

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
all honesty it's looking like if you

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.850 
all honesty it's looking like if you
keep<00:06:38.240> going<00:06:38.449> as<00:06:38.659> you<00:06:38.779> are<00:06:38.960> it's<00:06:39.560> quite

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
keep going as you are it's quite

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.929 
keep going as you are it's quite
realistic<00:06:40.460> that<00:06:40.969> you<00:06:41.120> could<00:06:41.300> beat<00:06:41.449> McLaren<00:06:42.939> at

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:43.939 
realistic that you could beat McLaren at

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:45.939 
realistic that you could beat McLaren at
the<00:06:44.060> moment<00:06:44.389> it<00:06:44.509> looks<00:06:44.689> like<00:06:44.870> that<00:06:44.990> but<00:06:45.050> I

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:45.949 
the moment it looks like that but I

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:48.309 
the moment it looks like that but I
think<00:06:46.250> it's<00:06:46.610> one<00:06:46.969> can<00:06:47.270> guy<00:06:47.599> but<00:06:47.839> the<00:06:47.899> boys<00:06:48.050> got

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 
think it's one can guy but the boys got

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.779 
think it's one can guy but the boys got
a<00:06:48.349> crazy<00:06:49.009> little<00:06:49.189> Mexican<00:06:49.839> yeah<00:06:51.580> he's<00:06:52.580> gonna

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
a crazy little Mexican yeah he's gonna

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:55.240 
a crazy little Mexican yeah he's gonna
prove<00:06:53.029> difficult<00:06:53.270> and<00:06:53.779> I<00:06:54.529> think<00:06:55.069> that's

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
prove difficult and I think that's

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.339 
prove difficult and I think that's
obviously<00:06:55.669> been<00:06:56.389> a<00:06:56.419> big<00:06:56.599> state<00:06:56.810> for<00:06:56.960> us<00:06:57.050> era<00:06:57.199> to

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349 
obviously been a big state for us era to

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:59.019 
obviously been a big state for us era to
to<00:06:57.860> take<00:06:58.039> the<00:06:58.129> responsibility<00:06:58.310> in<00:06:58.969> the

00:06:59.019 --> 00:06:59.029 
to take the responsibility in the

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:01.059 
to take the responsibility in the
pressure<00:06:59.270> by<00:06:59.509> clownin<00:06:59.930> and<00:07:00.080> what<00:07:00.710> it<00:07:00.830> is<00:07:00.919> at

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:01.069 
pressure by clownin and what it is at

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:03.490 
pressure by clownin and what it is at
the<00:07:01.159> moment<00:07:01.310> but<00:07:01.810> you<00:07:02.810> know<00:07:02.899> I'm<00:07:02.990> very

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
the moment but you know I'm very

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.769 
the moment but you know I'm very

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:17.849 
it's nice when you're on different

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:21.369 
it's nice when you're on different
strategies<00:07:18.419> and<00:07:18.449> you're<00:07:18.810> out<00:07:18.930> the<00:07:19.080> way<00:07:20.030> but

00:07:21.369 --> 00:07:21.379 
strategies and you're out the way but

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:24.200 
strategies and you're out the way but
it's<00:07:22.379> a<00:07:22.500> long<00:07:22.710> season<00:07:23.039> Suzie<00:07:23.550> don't<00:07:23.909> don't

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210 
it's a long season Suzie don't don't

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.360 
it's a long season Suzie don't don't
forget<00:07:24.539> that<00:07:24.690> and<00:07:24.990> if<00:07:25.560> you<00:07:25.919> see<00:07:26.099> where

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.370 
forget that and if you see where

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.339 
forget that and if you see where
Williams<00:07:26.699> around<00:07:26.940> last<00:07:27.180> year<00:07:27.360> they<00:07:27.599> won<00:07:27.780> at

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:28.349 
Williams around last year they won at

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:30.080 
Williams around last year they won at
Barcelona<00:07:28.919> the<00:07:29.159> Grand<00:07:29.370> Prix<00:07:29.610> and<00:07:29.639> look<00:07:29.879> where

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.090 
Barcelona the Grand Prix and look where

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.540 
Barcelona the Grand Prix and look where
they<00:07:30.180> finished<00:07:30.479> in<00:07:30.870> the<00:07:30.990> last<00:07:31.110> one<00:07:31.409> and

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550 
they finished in the last one and

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.809 
they finished in the last one and
essentially<00:07:32.550> that's<00:07:32.759> the<00:07:32.879> same<00:07:33.090> regulations

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:34.819
