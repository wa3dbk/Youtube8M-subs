00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.490
 almost five years after the greatest tragedy of the Brazilian space program 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.590
 aeronautics will test for the first time per month as a whole single rocket 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:12.049
 of Brazil 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.829
 the design of the satellite launch vehicle has been totally overhauled 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:17.990
 to avoid another failure 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.090
 see details in the exclusive report of roberth the baltic I have seen flamengo 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.980
 have been two years of work so that it can re-open 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.689
 the construction of the new prime minister with the Soviet satellite launcher 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.710
 is late for lack of money and technology but in August it goes 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.630
 passing the first major test is scheduled for the 6th day in São José dos 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.710
 interior fields of sao paulo this engine will be on for one minute 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.250
 long enough to know if we are on the right track to finally 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.320
 to get to space with our rocket she is critical the company noticed 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.870
 some modifications were made 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.280
 good to increase the reliability of the system the project changes were 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.930
 commissioned after the tragic death of 21 technicians from the Alcantara base in the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.700
 Maranhão 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.570
 on August 22, 2003 they were preparing to launch the rocket 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.790
 that would happen two days later but the voluntary connection of one of the 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.920
 caused an explosion and ended their life and their dreams but that 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.180
 did not prevent a new team from taking over the project 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.960
 it is she who has, for example, the delicate task of putting fuel in the engine 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.120
 were 50 days until the completion of this new 'engine' job of the vls one already 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.920
 is ready for the first test 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.420
 after the accident in Alcantara in 2003 is loaded with seventeen hundred and one hundred pounds 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.910
 of solid or sufficient propellant to represent the conditions it will 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:50.659
 meet 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.010
 during launch into space 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.440
 there was a great need for a complete overhaul of the entire project 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.000
 in all their systems why this need why we do not know 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 exactly what it caused 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.089
 the accident because when you do not have a single specific cause with you 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:14.349
 reinforced 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.359
 walls project act 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:20.239
 This is why it is only happening the author's text costing a million and 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.359
 real mean 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:25.709
 and aeronautics paid another three million and six hundred thousand dollars to 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.529
 Russian space agency pointed out flaws and solutions to make the launch 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:32.839
 Safer I'd like to see you. 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:36.829
 there were some successful squares if this test was successful the first 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.599
 version of the new rocket the third world xv will be released without letter and 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.049
 partially supplied in 2010 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.729
 in the following year the second version can fill up with fuel for the space 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:54.219
 finally in 2012 the complete vehicle will be launched with 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:58.849
 a satellite for the director of the aeronautics and space institute will be 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.929
 difficult to contain the emotion at the time when the driver horacio grandson the fish 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:05.380
 about a minute but mistake 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.330
 we have a sample of our life because it is a test with a lot of energy and the 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.170
 people get about 10 minutes every 30 seconds and 60 seconds 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.429
 ballots 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:15.979
 not over yet
