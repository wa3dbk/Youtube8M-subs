compression<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.729> now<00:01:06.180> what<00:01:06.540> we've<00:01:06.689> seen<00:01:06.930> is

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
compression and now what we've seen is

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.530 
compression and now what we've seen is
through<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.010> use<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.250> compression<00:01:08.939> shorts<00:01:09.330> it

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
through the use of compression shorts it

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.090 
through the use of compression shorts it
really<00:01:09.810> afforded<00:01:10.320> us<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.530> whole<00:01:10.740> new<00:01:10.890> way<00:01:11.070> of

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
really afforded us a whole new way of

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.340 
really afforded us a whole new way of
looking<00:01:11.369> at<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> uniform<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.750> athletes<00:01:13.170> are
