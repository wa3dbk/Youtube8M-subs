this team will go as far as we push it
you<00:00:47.910> know<00:00:48.030> where<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.329> leaders<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.780> team

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
you know where the leaders of this team

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.410 
you know where the leaders of this team
so<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.950> got<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> lot<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.640> young<00:00:50.969> guys<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.329> the
