to become you know better what I felt
was<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.110> best<00:02:00.490> there<00:02:01.490> were<00:02:01.610> some<00:02:01.850> good

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
was the best there were some good

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.370 
was the best there were some good
private<00:02:03.079> schools<00:02:03.380> in<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.680> area<00:02:05.170> what<00:02:06.170> we

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
private schools in the area what we

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.800 
private schools in the area what we
discovered<00:02:06.560> was<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.700> tuition<00:02:08.630> was

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
discovered was the tuition was

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.000 
discovered was the tuition was
astronomical<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:10.780> we<00:02:11.780> couldn't<00:02:12.260> afford<00:02:12.590> it

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
astronomical and we couldn't afford it

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.220 
astronomical and we couldn't afford it
and<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.269> like<00:02:14.450> thousands<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:14.989> other<00:02:15.170> families

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
and so like thousands of other families

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.320 
and so like thousands of other families

the Griffins faced an uncomfortable

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.600 
the Griffins faced an uncomfortable

children to the school of their choice

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.350 
children to the school of their choice
was<00:02:21.260> not<00:02:21.530> within<00:02:21.739> their<00:02:22.010> means<00:02:22.180> they<00:02:23.180> had<00:02:23.330> no

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
to describe it I was average if you're

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.660 
to describe it I was average if you're
in<00:02:47.000> his<00:02:47.120> organization<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:49.160> have<00:02:49.340> no

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
in his organization and you have no

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.229 
in his organization and you have no
power<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.540> exit<00:02:51.140> your<00:02:51.890> voice<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.610> diminished

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
power to exit your voice is diminished

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.570 
power to exit your voice is diminished
but<00:02:54.049> if<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.290> hundred<00:02:54.560> organization<00:02:55.340> and

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
but if you hundred organization and

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.120 
but if you hundred organization and
people<00:02:55.910> know<00:02:56.269> that<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:57.349> have<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.680> power<00:02:57.890> to

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
people know that you have the power to

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.610 
people know that you have the power to
leave<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:58.819> when<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.209> need<00:02:59.510> resources<00:03:00.200> go

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
leave and when you need resources go

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.819 
leave and when you need resources go
with<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:01.880> will<00:03:02.090> have<00:03:02.329> an<00:03:02.480> impact<00:03:02.690> on<00:03:03.320> the

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
with you that will have an impact on the

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.490 
with you that will have an impact on the
decision-making<00:03:04.640> inside<00:03:05.359> that<00:03:05.630> organization

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
decision-making inside that organization

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.699 
decision-making inside that organization
and<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.340> think<00:03:07.579> that<00:03:07.940> there's<00:03:08.239> a<00:03:08.329> way<00:03:08.680> for<00:03:09.680> us

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
and so I think that there's a way for us

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.720 
and so I think that there's a way for us
to<00:03:09.970> redesign<00:03:10.970> our<00:03:12.250> educational<00:03:13.250> system<00:03:13.700> in
