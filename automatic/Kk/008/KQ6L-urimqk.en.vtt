00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.560
 Rainer rough she mixes the cards 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.090
 she is so cool women can do the same 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.019
 we fight men we are still trying 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.019
 let's go for it 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.669
 I already have struggles from women 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.800
 staged but it was interesting too 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.230
 see how the matter is concerned 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.550
 she fights that in her special way 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.950
 Of course, you also want to be in your role 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.290
 see and so we tried this 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.420
 Style into the sequence to integrate them 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.740
 is madness so strong she throws me 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.740
 over the head as if it was nothing 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.260
 Michelle is not new to things either 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.820
 action 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.600
 she can box and she has one more time 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.710
 made a big step forward 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.829
 take it seriously every day because there is 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.400
 not many great fights between women 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.540
 hits the face 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.540
 I really gave everything 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:17.220
 to fight in halles is one 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:19.770
 challenge throughout my entire life 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.659
 Career I carried the topteams 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.159
 How about putting me in a dress? 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.040
 of course I have blue spots 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.869
 The clothes are brought to the 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.970
 needs of the fight adjusted so 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.590
 I have freedom of knee tournaments 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.960
 dance shoes very flexible 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.070
 the first thing I thought was with it 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.840
 I kill someone 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.729
 my actual sport is fighting 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.300
 products, the weight is on anyway 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.100
 the feet 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.630
 So we know the same movements 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.440
 make and therefore baseless this is the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.009
 New glamorous Luca fight scene 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.899
 Of course I do not have that 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.369
 just in this outfit beat it 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.149
 is a super hours biting 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.860
 The fight scene is so unique and cool 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.610
 great fun you will see like me 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.610
 fly through the area 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.890
 fast and furious just on first april 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.890
 everywhere in the cinema 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.450

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.069
 I have in the universal studios 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.739
 We finally promised to go home 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.969
 came 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:39.540
 where it all started in california 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.540
 Here you see at 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.250
 in the first movie the race was a lot 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.099
 smaller 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.080
 an underground event but now seven 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.330
 movies later it is important to show 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.430
 that not only the characters grow up 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.819
 but also the world in 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.819
 they live 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.769
 this has a 14-year history 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.629
 I'll never be in one again 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.580
 row with games like that for so long 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.010
 with one or even two generations 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.340

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.340

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.950
