being lazy
hey<00:00:30.990> it's<00:00:31.260> not<00:00:31.529> because<00:00:31.830> I'm<00:00:31.949> lazy<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.550> is

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.780 
hey it's not because I'm lazy this is
another<00:00:32.940> way<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.270> doing<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.750> works<00:00:37.790> what

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
another way of doing it it works what

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.389

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.860 
okay what if I hide it really I think
it's<00:00:41.489> because<00:00:41.730> many<00:00:41.940> people<00:00:42.120> underestimate

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
