00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.419 

okay<00:00:00.149> so<00:00:00.210> here's<00:00:00.780> a<00:00:00.870> video<00:00:00.989> brief<00:00:01.920> one<00:00:02.129> that

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
okay so here's a video brief one that

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.930 
okay so here's a video brief one that
had<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.610> repair<00:00:03.380> the<00:00:04.380> ace<00:00:04.680> pipe<00:00:05.009> on<00:00:05.250> your

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
had to repair the ace pipe on your

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.629 
had to repair the ace pipe on your
discovery<00:00:06.390> -<00:00:06.629> and<00:00:07.040> I<00:00:08.040> believe<00:00:08.309> this<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.610> a

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
discovery - and I believe this is a

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.280 
discovery - and I believe this is a
standard<00:00:09.090> problem<00:00:09.269> they<00:00:09.570> start<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.960> leak<00:00:10.110> and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
standard problem they start to leak and

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.580 
standard problem they start to leak and
generally<00:00:11.280> in<00:00:12.269> around<00:00:12.540> here<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.410> pipe

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
generally in around here the pipe

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.200 
generally in around here the pipe
corrodes<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.219> breaks<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.700> think<00:00:14.880> they<00:00:14.969> said

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
corrodes and breaks I think they said

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.820 
corrodes and breaks I think they said
there's<00:00:15.480> no<00:00:15.570> support<00:00:15.870> for<00:00:16.080> here<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.500> wheel

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
there's no support for here on the wheel

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.279 
there's no support for here on the wheel

before<00:00:19.439> me<00:00:19.710> obviously<00:00:20.039> tried<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.340> do<00:00:20.430> this

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
before me obviously tried to do this

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.779 
before me obviously tried to do this
repair<00:00:20.789> before<00:00:21.000> he<00:00:21.900> had<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> copper<00:00:22.680> pipe<00:00:22.859> same

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
repair before he had a copper pipe same

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.000 
repair before he had a copper pipe same
as<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.689> but<00:00:25.380> when<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.650> was<00:00:25.740> repaired

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
as I have here but when it was repaired

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.410 
as I have here but when it was repaired
he<00:00:26.340> left<00:00:26.519> us<00:00:26.640> sitting<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:26.939> top<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.269> chassis

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
he left us sitting on top of the chassis

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.839 
he left us sitting on top of the chassis
so<00:00:27.630> was<00:00:28.080> eroding<00:00:29.010> away<00:00:29.070> there<00:00:29.369> rubbing<00:00:29.670> away

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
so was eroding away there rubbing away

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.479 
so was eroding away there rubbing away
on<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.060> chassis<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:31.199> what<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.130> need<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.399> do

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
on the chassis and what you need to do

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.160 
on the chassis and what you need to do
this<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:33.530> ten<00:00:34.530> mill<00:00:34.680> copper<00:00:35.010> pipe<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:36.170> bought

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
this is ten mill copper pipe I bought

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.780 
this is ten mill copper pipe I bought
this<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.590> plumbers<00:00:38.040> place<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.399> morning

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
this in a plumbers place this morning

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.119 
this in a plumbers place this morning
sixteen<00:00:39.239> pounds<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> ten<00:00:40.620> meters<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.010> it

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
sixteen pounds for the ten meters of it

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.740 
sixteen pounds for the ten meters of it
and<00:00:41.960> two<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.110> these<00:00:43.820> ten<00:00:44.820> mil<00:00:45.030> compression

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
and two of these ten mil compression

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.670 
and two of these ten mil compression
joints<00:00:48.170> this<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> old<00:00:49.730> pipe<00:00:51.530> that<00:00:52.530> was

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
joints this is the old pipe that was

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.350 
joints this is the old pipe that was
originally<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.250> there<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.760> old<00:00:53.879> theatre<00:00:54.270> guy

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
originally in there the old theatre guy

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.069 
originally in there the old theatre guy
put<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.219> I<00:00:56.660> don't<00:00:57.660> think<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:57.989> gonna

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
put in and I don't think it's gonna

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.819 
put in and I don't think it's gonna
focus<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.309> there<00:01:00.829> it's

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
focus on it but you can see there it's

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.049 
focus on it but you can see there it's
kind<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.129> where<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> chassis<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.910> being

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
kind of where that the chassis is being

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.880 
kind of where that the chassis is being
ribbon<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:04.369> anyway<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> start<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
ribbon on it anyway to start with and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.219 
ribbon on it anyway to start with and
basically<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.310> need<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.689> I've<00:01:09.689> cut<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.020> joint

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
basically you need to I've cut the joint

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.690 
basically you need to I've cut the joint
obviously<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> old<00:01:11.130> joint<00:01:11.369> these<00:01:11.520> are

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
obviously the old joint these are

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.980 
obviously the old joint these are
different<00:01:12.150> size<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:12.570> some<00:01:12.689> reason<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:12.930> think

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
different size for some reason I think

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.700 
different size for some reason I think
the<00:01:13.110> last<00:01:13.260> ones<00:01:13.439> are<00:01:13.560> 3/8<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.240> 3<00:01:15.240> 8<00:01:15.360> or<00:01:15.540> 10

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
the last ones are 3/8 on it 3 8 or 10

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.249 
the last ones are 3/8 on it 3 8 or 10
milliliter<00:01:16.710> mill<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.189> get<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
milliliter mill if you can get it and

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.510 
milliliter mill if you can get it and
I've<00:01:19.259> cut<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> joints<00:01:19.860> here<00:01:19.979> anyway<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.430> is

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
I've cut the joints here anyway this is

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.130 
I've cut the joints here anyway this is
the<00:01:20.610> original<00:01:20.790> Land<00:01:21.330> Rover<00:01:21.600> pipe<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.020> I've

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the original Land Rover pipe and I've

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.950 
the original Land Rover pipe and I've
added<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.470> my<00:01:22.619> 10<00:01:22.860> mil<00:01:23.040> copper<00:01:23.369> pipe<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.960> I'll

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
added in my 10 mil copper pipe and I'll

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.090 
added in my 10 mil copper pipe and I'll
go<00:01:25.080> under<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> car<00:01:25.500> now<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.830> I'll<00:01:25.890> show<00:01:25.920> you

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
go under the car now and I'll show you

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.920 
go under the car now and I'll show you
exactly<00:01:26.369> where<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.670> goes<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.720> when

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
exactly where it goes to but just when

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.749 
exactly where it goes to but just when
you're<00:01:28.080> cutting<00:01:28.229> any<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.590> these<00:01:28.650> joints<00:01:28.950> just

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
you're cutting any of these joints just

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.640 
you're cutting any of these joints just
be<00:01:29.850> very<00:01:30.060> careful<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.450> metal<00:01:30.720> filings<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.530> you

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
be very careful of metal filings and you

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.990 
be very careful of metal filings and you
sort<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.950> bits<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.250> get<00:01:32.369> into<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> pipe<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.970> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
sort of bits to get into the pipe the a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.539 
sort of bits to get into the pipe the a
system<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.540> very<00:01:33.720> very<00:01:33.990> sensitive<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.619> any

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
system is very very sensitive and any

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.580 
system is very very sensitive and any
sort<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.909> debris<00:01:36.479> or<00:01:36.600> anything<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.930> there<00:01:37.079> with

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
sort of debris or anything in there with

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.380 
sort of debris or anything in there with
will<00:01:37.799> cause<00:01:38.009> serious<00:01:38.310> problems<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.060> probably

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
will cause serious problems and probably

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.410 
will cause serious problems and probably
comfy<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.229> are<00:01:40.259> underneath<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.770> car<00:01:41.420> as

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
comfy here we are underneath the car as

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.710 
comfy here we are underneath the car as
you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:43.280> pipe<00:01:44.280> comes<00:01:44.520> across<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.360> top<00:01:45.570> of

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
you can see pipe comes across the top of

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.590 
you can see pipe comes across the top of
the<00:01:45.780> steering<00:01:46.259> box<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.030> then<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.390> across

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the steering box here and then in across

the top of the cooling the : pipes here

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.460 
the top of the cooling the : pipes here
I<00:01:51.470> put<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.500> cable<00:01:52.890> ties<00:01:53.040> here<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.549> hold<00:01:54.470> the

my chassis built and bit of my own
mistake<00:02:02.280> really

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
mistake really

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.639 
mistake really
I've<00:02:02.790> left<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.240> bolt<00:02:03.659> sticking<00:02:04.170> out<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> back

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
I've left a bolt sticking out the back

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.440 
I've left a bolt sticking out the back
of<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.670> bracket<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.240> rubbing

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
of the the bracket and it's rubbing

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.639 
of the the bracket and it's rubbing
against<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.780> pipes<00:02:07.020> we'll<00:02:07.229> just<00:02:07.380> make<00:02:07.500> sure

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
against the pipes we'll just make sure

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.930 
against the pipes we'll just make sure
that<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.920> pipes<00:02:08.129> are<00:02:08.280> well<00:02:08.399> secure<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.819> in

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
that the pipes are well secure it in

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.999 
that the pipes are well secure it in
here<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.270> nothing<00:02:09.989> will<00:02:10.319> touch<00:02:10.500> them<00:02:10.709> or<00:02:10.920> they

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
here and nothing will touch them or they

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.540 
here and nothing will touch them or they
can't

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
can't

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.250 
can't
if<00:02:11.610> anything<00:02:11.910> has<00:02:12.090> ended<00:02:12.990> with<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.140> same

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
if anything has ended with the same

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260 
if anything has ended with the same
issue<00:02:13.500> again<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:14.010> no<00:02:14.610> time<00:02:14.850> there's<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> lot<00:02:15.180> of

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
issue again in no time there's a lot of

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.610 
issue again in no time there's a lot of
vibration<00:02:15.390> on<00:02:15.780> these<00:02:15.930> pipes<00:02:16.140> when<00:02:16.470> they're

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
vibration on these pipes when they're

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.270 
vibration on these pipes when they're
under<00:02:16.800> pressure<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:18.680> up<00:02:19.680> there<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:19.950> can<00:02:20.250> see

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
under pressure and up there you can see

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.980 
under pressure and up there you can see
the<00:02:20.730> other<00:02:20.880> compression<00:02:21.360> going<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.690> put<00:02:21.870> in

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
the other compression going to put in

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.350 
the other compression going to put in
and<00:02:22.700> this<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.910> return<00:02:24.240> feed<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:26.360> ACE

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360
