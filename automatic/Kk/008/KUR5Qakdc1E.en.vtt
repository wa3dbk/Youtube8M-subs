00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.660

 his tenacity of the few radios when they mention the songs speak of 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:45.730
 composer 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.990

 bety pino is one of the few and announcer that mentioned the 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.110
 composers when you talk about the song and you have to do it because it's 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.040
 much to say the applause only the artists take it if the composer and 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.569

 I was amazed because I always mentioned I needed everything 

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:23.879
 when the new talent like my case 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:25.900
 Suez is needed because 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.990
 the most important stimulus 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.110
 land the citation of the public and that people know what soul and where 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.020

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:06.699
 end of badges 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.180
 I met my work for the guitarist and in the a-7 script with a beginning 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.610
 never dedicate myself professionally ruse world there is no party in 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.169
 miami 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:15.939
 Zuleta mantle or die 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:19.869
 they included several songs and that's where the idea of ​​doing something lion 

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:21.210
 get him to do something to 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.400
 daniela romo although nobody knew me 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.919
 semproni who has never been chosen as that was removed that is decided by the 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:27.599
 public 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.050
 even the first promotional was not my song fly to the firemen 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.159
 also the very good motto does not have what terms will be good 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:37.309
 but it jumped why you want to eat globally and that opened me 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:38.469
 the doors 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:41.719
 so that it does not look more beautiful producers read more on automate and 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:42.699
 well then 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:46.289
 no way I could do it to daniela put something for me clear that 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.819
 well we get the citizens to a big chain this performance encounter 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:52.699
 also with the wonderful Maria Sorté is one of the most 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:56.479
 outstanding in Mexico and that has had an unblemished trajectory 2 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:58.680
 twenty years of artistic career that already has 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.600
 spent the afternoon with us a few days ago we do not remember tony themes 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.150
 because rightly and now it is promoting a new production 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.030
 lioness white 0 0 what song attracted maría sorté in her repertoire from 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.930
 I took measures percent the song with chances that had well stuck I think that 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.430
 over here it has gone so well 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.100
 and it was in the previous album to this one according to said with the Sevillian that 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.050
 publicite say or as they say a recording of well-known songs of 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.050
 well-known songs and that some chance was for María sorté 

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:47.520
 tremendous chances maría sorté 

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.220
 the song of toby measured not explicitly well spent the afternoon with 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.729
 snail where the songs of animals are born and that hardly resented 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:58.449
 chances of achieving it in the corridor inaugurated the mind because it was poor of 

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:01.580
 me and it helped me a lot we got to very important places to the first places of 

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.589
 his death also serves as mexico Mexico 

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:05.750
