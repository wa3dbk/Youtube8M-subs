00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:03.610
 so I think scouts pam to the map 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.360
 to see if an expo 2 where he is he sees us what is going on 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.579
 criteria 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:11.209
 % var 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.409
 that's good because normally 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:18.160
 there is a lot of fatwas the artichoke in the middle a life of these ladies of donnea 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.659
 creepjack on the fountain 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.469
 and if we already marked from the beginning me I did not lose nor your ducos 

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:25.310
 we already feel the difference in the pop 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.650
 I really have more cope him his fall on the web while almost nene 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.159
 3 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:31.279
 and so sees his 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.279
 still pretty big as the beginning of the game 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.250
 so that hardly better I think 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.530
 this account there I try to focus sw bag a sense 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.210
 its his little trick gamaty focus sw and a final choice behind and it takes 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.330
 they know 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.550
 of all the purses it is necessary that is why that iran remained 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.710
 difficult a lot of things that can be done 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.160
 just because the right things at the right time so there the party a little 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.270
 draft your entire pokemon team that he 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.270
 I'm pretty badly placed actually what I did with humility who knows 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.320
 who quotes tiscali these people that must be avoided 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.229
 we're going it's not lost genitive believe I did eat line by 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.600
 the aco of high seas 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.600
 you can not tell him I still managed to get rid of 3 days 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.360
 adversary who is not bad at all 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.759
 here is 20 50 50 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.130
 a remote corner 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.270
 you believe for my part we did it 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.689
 or so again 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.379
 still something his city according to the preferences and has that prefer 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.510
 prefer to stay there at 50 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.679
 the whole war for example justine for example who 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.969
 I often saw playing at 5 years all the range to save the most 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.810
 money possible and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.660
 play pretty aggressive 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.409
 a pub of the criterium for all 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.509
 always to see more money even if we have a little less pop 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.090
 it must play a pretty sure effect you must not miss bankruptcy 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.010
 I tend to 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.010
 a respect by passing 40 fishing trials 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.130
 cleared of three offices and then 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.400
 to crack the pop 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.449
 karzai in this situation we end up with 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.219
 ten more new jobs if you play 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.199
 it's always interesting 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:18.759
 but on james summer well for his 50's pop &amp; co a little bit continuous with my 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:21.819
 grax so cinema2 to ask them an expand by letting go of posing a 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.119
 expand 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:25.949
 and chasing away ends up with an expand outside the camps get 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.459
 do well the other arrived 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.459
 we managed to manage a good part of the game so there the criteria 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.359
 I write the internship has been pretty clear over five years it's quite complicated 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:38.909
 I write pelamis only align the la 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.240
 the companion of the minor 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.690
 I had not dissolved super system even though mourinho a major people on 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.649
 the 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.009
 on the bm it's always taken 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:52.110
 a doruma survey and on the siturv thing here i noticed it has 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.329
 at purepeople red spots 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.329
 I did not really expect that I thought that is planned the golfer 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.989
 what in general help them must also finish finally especially others 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.019
 Jossinet 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.019
 they love each other are this new hitch 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.969
 raffle h always at five out of 50 he's gonna I try to do if that's what 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.499
 I said I prefer fishing 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:12.789
 I see he is there 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:15.429
 and yesterday 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:16.699
 I try to 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:19.699
 to take bad 'stats' are on a future and its preys in tps disk 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.770
 coach pose an exhibition it is necessary especially 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.799
 do not be surprised if the fact that we do not want to take 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.829
 do we take a risk by doing an expo and if we come to term 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.619
 a lot of girls in a party 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:31.629
 we lose 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.430
 because the expo immediately falls off relationships was nothing to hide 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.639
 your thighs a little bm 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:39.629
 it's a little rough at the end of the first set like that it's not necessarily a 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.109
 good idea you have to try to 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.109
 always pair of my possible unit try to sign the bm 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:48.209
 to prevent 2008 a little bit of all happens 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.839
 we can move the Sunnis 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:54.079
 here it is dany cros what to try to eat with the codeo tests not 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.779
 to be eaten 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:04:01.049
 and located all the worries 6 let's go so fast you have to be more 2 w a little 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.709
 different published pmi indices is immediately the opposing units your 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.269
 much faster 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.339
 so there I am not too much to demerder 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:09.119
 I lost a minute I believe 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:11.939
 and I was amazed that they eat in the commune to know that I was laying 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.199
 an exhibition 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.719
 for it is rather a good operation 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.499
 that I still have is staying at 50 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:21.589
 allows me to still have merchant to buy a ppr 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.139
 So here is 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.670
 it's a market that friendship then we go to bankruptcy 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.949
 no wonder hesitate closer to home it was 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.749
 easier for him 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:35.240
 because they had their customers as much as the version of the facts but 

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:36.999
 I would've done the same thing 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:39.999
 for this narrative and mirroring this work with m 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.699
 with pawns especially when we take palexpo me when I take an exhibition I 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.120
 do not do it because the pawns and will say in the text yes 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.169
 like that we will not do 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.059
 what level of mouzon 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:54.059
 laplug to the advancement of a man or a party 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.419
 percent since mid-September 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.800
 in the college it actually allows with the link 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.029
 dwm 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:03.330
 so skeleton because I'm leaving 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.990
 to take guards takes damage on the p -o party 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.050
 scattered warrens in countries in crisis because I was there 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.449
 give a small advantage 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.300
 however more 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.120
 a 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.949
 a foam tons of millet for sure 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.820
 I'm still struggling to survive on the message 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.180
 in manal rooms and that one can 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.250
 scoop opposes well really practical 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.339
 until then I I am selling lat 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:30.360
 armed with axes and scams 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.310
 because one in hollow I'm never been very hard 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.310
 very fan of sticks theme be general 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.029
 good I'm not going to oversold yet but it happens to me 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:44.770
 peremans and sasha itunes going on but with an investigation our hero have 

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:45.659
 tick 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:48.909
 our reading about the mapar campaign the whole army party 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.749
 and suddenly 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.009
 what then the c6 of clipping hear here we expose not want to take 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:02.330
 I will not take a chance in hd 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.159
 tried to pass the message that 25 as soon as possible in the gg the crisis 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.210
 I have a bunch of dictating his 1 6 to his shots the coma 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.710
 committee before tonight 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.699
 to pass the leash a little faster 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.529
 so here it is the race to others it is the race that the misfortune 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:20.210
 the palu I had expo 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.940
 in fact, I looked a little if there was an exhibition and I did not see that I 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.999
 I spoke with m I do not think he posed the exhibition 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:30.029
 I assure you that 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:31.770
 this is the 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.059
 but senna creepjack 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:37.059
 we are already well advanced in the range we are wise a past level 5 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:40.620
 theoretically I have a lot more ads than him I have not looked at the level of 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.620
 these after a month I'm two I do not think he is 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:46.919
 here is one last bankruptcy 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.369
 it's going to be quite expeditious because I have a lot of 

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:53.360
 we can see so much more weight than him 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.680
 so I try to 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.770
 spin lacono for not that they eat limits 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.830
 with the exception that comes behind this koalas believing reality 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.650
 is that matter with hypnosis 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.249
 place not very fast so have pawns in a fault 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:09.120
 you do not have to rush into a ferrari communal hall 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.319
 if the revolution 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:13.009
 he drew a lot of 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:14.849
 from truckee it's a bit of a pity 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:17.749
 so always 

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:21.309
 also we try to implement the big clues 

00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:22.629
 on the rails war 

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:25.720
 the buffoon slopes look haggard always because it allows to have 

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:27.960
 from the six Romands opposite 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.510
 he's double and can finish the blue waters in the face narrate their must 

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:33.419
 also a lot of damage on the w 

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.830
 and on the slopes 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.940
 here you are there I try to wood anyway enough enough I had two porsche 

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:39.309
 2005 c1 

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:41.869
 it's pretty simple like fighting in itself 

00:07:41.869 --> 00:07:44.889
 it must be a little rigor I try to they did not believe it and then the 

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:46.389
 bachelor lesson 

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:48.010
 6 for me the honda 

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.850
 a sheath win
