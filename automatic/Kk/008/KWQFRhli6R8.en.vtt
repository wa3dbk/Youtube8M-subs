this<00:02:21.420> way<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.900> how<00:02:22.470> we<00:02:22.530> get<00:02:22.950> through<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.490> let

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
this way is how we get through and let

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.000 
this way is how we get through and let
these<00:02:23.820> kids<00:02:24.060> know<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.110> okay<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.560> be<00:02:25.710> who

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
these kids know that it's okay to be who

think<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.860> biggest<00:02:29.100> change<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:29.640> cows

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
think the biggest change that cows

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.270 
think the biggest change that cows
making<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.780> mindset<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.320> people<00:02:31.800> when

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
making is in the mindset of people when

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.040 
making is in the mindset of people when
maybe<00:02:32.490> like<00:02:32.820> I<00:02:33.060> would<00:02:33.240> hear<00:02:33.420> someone<00:02:33.690> making<00:02:33.870> a

maybe like I would hear someone making a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.440 
maybe like I would hear someone making a
joke<00:02:34.320> about<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.920> black<00:02:35.250> kid<00:02:35.580> every<00:02:36.000> times<00:02:36.240> when
