00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
port so that's all those and what's this

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.130 
port so that's all those and what's this
one<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:50.860> says<00:03:51.250> DC<00:03:51.730> in<00:03:52.330> so<00:03:52.630> this<00:03:52.780> is<00:03:52.930> for<00:03:53.110> the

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
one it says DC in so this is for the

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.190 
one it says DC in so this is for the
charger<00:03:53.710> I'm<00:03:54.370> guessing<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.090> little<00:03:55.210> dub<00:03:55.600> next

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
charger I'm guessing the little dub next

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.890 
charger I'm guessing the little dub next
to<00:03:56.290> it<00:03:56.350> is<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:57.270> microphone<00:03:58.830> yep<00:03:59.830> it<00:04:00.070> is<00:04:00.130> and

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
to it is the microphone yep it is and

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.890 
to it is the microphone yep it is and
the<00:04:01.900> power<00:04:02.140> button<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.740> the<00:04:03.210> audio<00:04:04.210> jack

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.899 

snap<00:04:07.739> focusing<00:04:08.340> okay<00:04:08.970> it<00:04:09.299> is<00:04:09.629> now<00:04:09.989> I<00:04:10.019> think<00:04:10.909> as

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
snap focusing okay it is now I think as

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.479

you<00:04:31.050> can<00:04:31.080> remove<00:04:31.560> this<00:04:31.830> little<00:04:32.130> part<00:04:32.460> but<00:04:32.639> I'm

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
you can remove this little part but I'm

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:33.920 
you can remove this little part but I'm
not<00:04:32.940> going<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.150> do<00:04:33.300> that<00:04:33.330> because<00:04:33.600> I<00:04:33.750> don't

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
not going to do that because I don't

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.779 
not going to do that because I don't
think<00:04:34.110> that's<00:04:34.229> essential<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:37.789> apparently

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
think that's essential and apparently

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:44.629 
think that's essential and apparently
its<00:04:39.210> magnetic<00:04:39.750> as<00:04:39.930> well<00:04:41.720> ok<00:04:42.720> so<00:04:43.380> I've<00:04:44.010> opened
