00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 welcome friends to the oranges of the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.660
 cutting and correction workshop is the 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.030
 second tips provided we made them 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.429
 can go very well to many it will seem 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.440
 this is a cosmetic issue that we are going to 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.590
 pose today but do not forget that 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.660
 cosmetics in greek means 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.240
 perfection so if we are 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.980
 looking for perfection it can be that in 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.070
 the road we get to do things very 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.269
 good about that always remember 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.820
 with great pride an anecdote of a 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.280
 my student was recognized went with 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.670
 pseudonym of course was recognized in 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.469
 a literary contest and this and one of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.960
 the jurors is telenoche how they did 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.329
 to find out and he answered by the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.350
 presentation marché or be like 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.579
 weighs the presentation in a good jury 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.590
 is not going to lean a little more for the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.730
 person who took things well that by 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.910
 example did not break his eye 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.040
 the reader when he started to read by 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.629
 example this text that we have here the 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.100
 organization of associated provinces or 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.290
 for good read it after quiet is 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.280
 a pavada that I wrote simply for 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.830
 show them how we can get to 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.400
 break the eye of the poor reader where 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.500
 notice as soon as possible ground floor 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.720
 more than happened in the text below 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.020
 we have exactly the same thing but there 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.020
 a big difference in this case the 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.890
 Words are not breaking from the retina 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.539
 to nobody 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.330
 see how they are here is much more 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.490
 kind but what happens are in capital letters 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.590
 and of course they are capitalized like the 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.590
 previous text what happens that we have 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.789
 past we have passed it to the letter 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.729
 verses small versa smallcaps in English 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.880
 the small capital letters look like 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.860
 define the dictionary of the real 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.310
 Spanish academy here I have the ex 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.890
 took a photo to the dictionary says 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.259
 uppercase equal in size to the lower case 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.920
 of the same older class put the cabbage 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.409
 list 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.330
 uppercase equal in size to the lower case 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.970
 of the same class will be better understood 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.670
 if we see it in action what is it for 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.470
 this first thing we do is when 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.680
 we have written with all capital letters 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.600
 of the case we have written everything 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.430
 capitalize what we do is grab the 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:28.310
 areas made and by format 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.069
 chains format that is changing here what 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.230
 we have let's put lower case that 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.630
 means let's say directly we're 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.390
 all sent to lowercase and there it is 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.650
 this is now or for UFO and the rest 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.900
 abductions of all those swearwords 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.760
 huge that broke the reader's eye 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.680
 now be in lowercase the 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.480
 we select one by one 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.740
 it is not true we select the first 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.310
 let's format let's source 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:01.130
 and there we put smallcaps what 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.890
 we have in those who have in Castilian 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.660
 they will see what it says see salts verza 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.600
 lists 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.640
 and it is already we get it is directly 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:17.840
 we gave him ok we do the same with UFOs 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.520
 format mov uvni format font we are going to 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.610
 see so you can see the change of small 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.800
 that we propose here we give ok one and 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.690
 see how the course is going laughing and 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.810
 after we do good you know 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.190
 perfectly that we have this pincelito 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.730
 format for which you do not know it comes 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.710
 very well to know it format and for example 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.400
 here abductions we put it in 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.470
 abductions we release the cursor the same 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.860
 happens with this one that said ground floor this 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.569
 is another tremendous is not true but see 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.920
 surrounds it here ground floor 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:55.799
 I go to source format format they remember 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.260
 how it was and now I'm going to smallcaps I'm going to 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.230
 remain the hatred that I will be left 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.139
 small uppercase that we have been left 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.609
 good clever we have 44 words put 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:10.379
 let's say or for omni abductions 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:14.700
 directly and ground floor we have all 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:17.250
 in small capitals or verses or 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.549
 Also called little verses for not 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.680
 break the eye to the reader this is used 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.720
 also in narrative this seems like a 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.400
 brochure a flyer but also to 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.639
 narrative we use it for example in the 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.500
 story of poe east of the fall of the 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.800
 house usher there is a time when the 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.440
 characters scream very loud no and look 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.570
 that a voice like this is convenient 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.610
 that we put everything in a letter 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.280
 a little bigger but not at all 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.880
 capitalized because she is too much a 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.940
 thing is the effect and another thing is the f 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.190
 the effect would be as well said German 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.990
 Cáceres in the report that he says in 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.900
 cutting workshop and correct the 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.790
 Effectiveness is the abuse of the effect 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.420
 So why make a poster 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.940
 gimmicky full of huge words if 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.670
 we can directly give the reader the 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.470
 kindness of the versalitas boys 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.290
 do not stop using this here that I have to 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.540
 put something a little bit stronger than 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.240
 usual and they will see that everything will be 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.310
 much much easier much simpler 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.680
 and I'm waiting for you on Friday with a new 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.120
 cutting and correction workshop program 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.120
 thank you very much guys
