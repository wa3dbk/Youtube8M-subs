York<00:00:30.720> Times<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:32.090> the<00:00:33.090> new<00:00:33.300> browser<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:34.520> quite

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
York Times here the new browser is quite

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.209 
York Times here the new browser is quite
similar<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.510> old<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:37.309> in<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:39.390> sense<00:00:39.690> that

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
similar to the old one in the sense that

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.319 
similar to the old one in the sense that
the<00:00:41.219> interface<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.670> going<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.969> be<00:00:42.059> fairly

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
the interface is going to be fairly

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.580 
the interface is going to be fairly
familiar<00:00:43.670> what<00:00:44.670> they<00:00:44.850> do<00:00:44.960> tout<00:00:45.960> though<00:00:46.350> are

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
familiar what they do tout though are

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.110 
familiar what they do tout though are
these<00:00:47.100> new<00:00:47.430> gestures<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:49.850> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.000> just

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
these new gestures that you can just

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.740 
these new gestures that you can just
flick<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.780> side<00:00:52.160> either<00:00:53.160> way<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.120> from<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
flick to the side either way so from the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.990 
flick to the side either way so from the
left<00:00:55.730> or<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.989> right<00:00:58.280> you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.430> open<00:00:59.789> up<00:00:59.850> a

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
left or on the right you can open up a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.310 
left or on the right you can open up a
new<00:01:00.030> window<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:07.350> know<00:01:07.439> hit<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:08.900> Yahoo<00:01:09.900> for

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
new window and you know hit up Yahoo for

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.870 
new window and you know hit up Yahoo for
example<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:12.500> apparently<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.740> supports<00:01:14.549> eight

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
example and apparently it supports eight

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.109 
example and apparently it supports eight
different<00:01:15.450> tabs<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.740> haven't<00:01:17.549> tested<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.970> yet

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
different tabs I haven't tested that yet

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.050 
different tabs I haven't tested that yet
but<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:19.320> fairly<00:01:21.710> fairly<00:01:22.710> good<00:01:23.040> if<00:01:23.880> that's

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
but it's fairly fairly good if that's

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
but it's fairly fairly good if that's
the<00:01:24.210> case<00:01:26.570> now<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.320> other<00:01:28.409> thing<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the case now the other thing that it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.620 
the case now the other thing that it
supports<00:01:29.490> our<00:01:30.380> gestures<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.280> also

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
supports our gestures and that is also

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.730 
supports our gestures and that is also
something<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.810> has<00:01:34.320> been<00:01:34.350> brought<00:01:34.680> over

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
something that has been brought over

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.160 
something that has been brought over
from<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.280> previous<00:01:35.430> version<00:01:35.820> now<00:01:37.670> this<00:01:39.170> has

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
from the previous version now this has
