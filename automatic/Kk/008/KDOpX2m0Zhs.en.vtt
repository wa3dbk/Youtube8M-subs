00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.859
 hi my name is stefani this is 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.189
 reading blog and today 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.809
 I'm going to talk about the traveling castle 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.780
 written by the British author of jean 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.059
 wyn jones and the book on which he based 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.360
 the movie the vagabond castle of 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.960
 studio ghibli what is equal to there or 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.960
 miles here 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.450
 this book took me five years in 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.550
 find it here in chile was quite 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.620
 difficult I was looking for it since I saw 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.010
 the movie 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.210
 and it's also one of the most expensive I've 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.910
 bought 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.510
 It is worth saying that buying books in Chile 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:54.690
 is inherently expensive, it 's almost like a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.820
 I like a pleasure for the richest, not the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.920
 Flying castle transports us to the world 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.860
 of ingrid a place where the magic 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.050
 is still valid and there are many sorcerers and 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.899
 witches who use their magic for purposes 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.050
 selfish one of them is the witch of the 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.479
 páramo which for bad luck of 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.700
 our protagonist sophie hatter is 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.090
 angry with her and turns her into a 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.580
 elderly woman in this way the only way in 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.670
 that sophie can return to normal 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.710
 is to travel to the wasteland to look for the castle 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.320
 ambulant that is where one of the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.470
 magicians more powerful and more come to the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.710
 same time that is the magician hou it 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.200
 rumora that hole is a donjuán that devours 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.110
 the hearts of beautiful women the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.580
 young women and that's why everyone 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.560
 he fears the traveling castle 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.350
 hull is quite peculiar is a 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.010
 somewhat childish character a little 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.010
 sarcastic 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.150
 I really loved the book itself 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.880
 the movie is very different 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.760
 they have the same characters are 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.409
 located in the same world and context 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.500
 the movie points to one 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.720
 much more warlike context while 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.060
 the book is more about the conflict between 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.330
 the two characters between sofía and between 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.250
 hold it's interesting that they are totally 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.470
 different although I was looking for 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.010
 for a long time this story that was 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.290
 the original story of dolphin and me 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.099
 I was glad to know that they were different already 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.810
 that was like reading a bit more about the 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.989
 characters who had no longer loved 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.670
 read a different perspective but without 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.670
 forget that this is the perspective 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.910
 original the book comes with an envelope 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.220
 stage illustrated with the film is cap 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.610
 hard on the spine says the castle 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.769
 walking 'with black letters and it's 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.709
 completely white in fact I think that 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.300
 it's the only white book that I have and I 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.380
 love 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.150
 the edition is very elegant is the fact 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.060
 that also is as an issue 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.420
 pocket but hard cover I love for 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.210
 I usually love all editions very 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.120
 very careful 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.460
 and usually invest money in them since 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.010
 I think they are worth it 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.210
 I always prefer the top edition 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.370
 hard to the softcover edition 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.870
 and surely all the books that 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.060
 comment will be this way 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.760
 that has been the log of history 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.290
 today and I hope we can see them 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.720
 in the next chapter 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.060
