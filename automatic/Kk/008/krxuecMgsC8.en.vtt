00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:08.680
 hello today we are going to do an introduction 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.320
 to the harmonics on the guitar how 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.170
 draw out natural harmonics and 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.949
 artificial with the left hand and with 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.109
 the right hand are some very notes 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:23.199
 useful for certain styles like 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:26.349
 rock and to do introductions in 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:29.570
 Agree pop songs are some notes 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:32.150
 very curious and very usable 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.329
 let's go first with the natural chords 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.030
 the natural chords are the ones that come out 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:46.010
 by construction on the guitar in the 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:49.790
 frets 5 7 and 12 and also 5 + 12 7 + 12 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.129
 Ie December 12 still appear to 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.350
 long guitar we are going to focus 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.040
 the time in 5 7 and 12 so that the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.750
 listen to how a harmonic is created 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:06.620
 very easy you place is the finger 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.080
 You fret over sneak around above 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.080
 storage room between the frets as 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.670
 when we press notes but on top of the 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.670
 bar on top of the fret 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:23.010
 without pressing as we do when we place 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.370
 crazy is to say only the finger touching the 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.590
 rope 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.590
 not squeezing skimming 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:36.060
 let's hear it I put the finger I have 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.060
 I read over the agreement 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.020
 and after pressing the loose you see 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.009
 you think it 's a high note like more 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:51.190
 acute is the harmonic well at 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.280
 length of the fifth fret 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.280
 yes 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.090
 all the harmonics come out 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.090
 along the 7 also 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.450
 throughout the 12 9 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.400
 after 5 and 7 + 12 which 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.760
 all right 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.760
 even from the 24 that would be around here 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.310
 although the logical site has fretted it 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.950
 of 24 would be to continue counting if your 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.409
 window has 24 after 32 where design 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.420
 but that's how it is that he does not have 24 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:38.109
 you can find the place where it would be 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.659
 the 24th and we could still continue beyond 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.790
 agreement but it is already very difficult to 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.709
 find natural harmonics and not 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.700
 we know exactly where in the 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.170
 guitar 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.010
 Here we have the reference of 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.010
 frets you see 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.180
 and 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.520
 natural harmonics 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.710
 we can also generate harmonics 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:08.470
 artificial with the right hand 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:14.819
 for this we have to brush the rope 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:18.780
 besides with the pick with the thumb 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:23.159
 it's a bit complicated, come on let's go 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.850
 see now rubbing is the rope with the pick 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:28.640
 and with your finger like 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.100
 and you can press any fret now 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.170
 there are no limitations of the 5th fret and 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.300
 7 the harmonics come out in any 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.580
 body and in any fret now 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.440
 we have to press the note you want to give 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.230
 the note with this artificial harmonic 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:48.120
 fix for example the normal play 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.120
 and I'm going to get the harmonic 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.580
 I'm pressing the note with the pick and 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.580
 rubbing with your finger 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.370
 besides advancing with which we should not 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.930
 find in the body that we have the 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.180
 mast to the bridge the place where better 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.430
 the harmonic comes out because in all 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.620
 sites have us the same we have to have 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.100
 According careful where you click 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.100
 fixed 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.680
 it's more come out several and madrid 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.500
 to take out the harmonics 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.520
 because you need a little practice 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.289
 to get that friction 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:54.939
 / 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:54.939
 the plectrum the rope and the finger 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.860
 I'm dying 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.060
 ah 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.400
 Y 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.720
 these are the natural harmonics and 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.720
 artificial
