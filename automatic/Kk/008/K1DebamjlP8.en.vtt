welcome<00:00:02.250> back<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.550> another<00:00:02.730> minecraft<00:00:03.060> video

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
welcome back to another minecraft video

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.910 
welcome back to another minecraft video
today<00:00:03.990> we've<00:00:04.140> got<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.319> concept<00:00:04.710> for

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
today we've got a concept for

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.010 
today we've got a concept for
interactive<00:00:05.730> Holograms<00:00:06.299> this<00:00:06.629> has<00:00:06.750> been<00:00:06.870> done

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
interactive Holograms this has been done

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.740 
interactive Holograms this has been done
before<00:00:07.170> by<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.470> Suzuki<00:00:08.040> but<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.820> have<00:00:09.300> indeed

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
before by a Suzuki but I have indeed

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.060 
before by a Suzuki but I have indeed
made<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:10.050> different<00:00:10.380> way<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.469> doing<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.860> this

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
made a different way of doing it this

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.280 
made a different way of doing it this
one<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.790> little<00:00:11.910> less<00:00:12.480> complicated<00:00:13.080> because

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
one is a little less complicated because

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.620 
one is a little less complicated because
it<00:00:13.500> doesn't<00:00:13.740> involve<00:00:13.950> slimes<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.940> therefore

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
it doesn't involve slimes so therefore

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.000 
it doesn't involve slimes so therefore
it<00:00:15.690> doesn't<00:00:15.839> have<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.049> particles<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.800> when

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
it doesn't have the particles of when

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.429 
it doesn't have the particles of when
you<00:00:17.100> kill<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.430> slime<00:00:17.869> so<00:00:18.869> let's<00:00:19.050> take<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.289> look

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
you kill the slime so let's take a look

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.660 
you kill the slime so let's take a look
at<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:20.039> what<00:00:20.160> if<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.279> got<00:00:20.400> here<00:00:20.520> we've<00:00:20.640> got

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670

will<00:00:33.600> see<00:00:33.780> there<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> hitbox<00:00:34.260> here<00:00:34.620> but<00:00:35.219> we

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
will see there is a hitbox here but we

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.069 
will see there is a hitbox here but we
right<00:00:35.670> click<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.390> gives<00:00:36.570> us<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.809> diamond

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.270 
right click that it gives us a diamond
sword<00:00:37.170> because<00:00:37.410> we've<00:00:37.500> selected<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.010> diamond

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
sword because we've selected the diamond

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.740 
sword because we've selected the diamond
sword<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:38.700> could<00:00:38.850> put<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.210> bow<00:00:39.420> here

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
sword but we could put like a bow here

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.200

this<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.410> completely<00:00:40.890> tileable<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.550> this

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
this is completely tileable in this

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.910 
this is completely tileable in this
direction<00:00:42.360> i<00:00:42.660> think<00:00:42.840> i<00:00:42.960> will<00:00:43.320> jump<00:00:43.559> into<00:00:43.739> that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
direction i think i will jump into that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.010 
direction i think i will jump into that
but<00:00:44.840> yeah<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.200> what's<00:00:47.010> going<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.340> mmm<00:00:48.239> well

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
but yeah so what's going on mmm well

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.139 
but yeah so what's going on mmm well
basically<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:50.129> invisible<00:00:50.670> block<00:00:50.850> here<00:00:51.059> is

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
basically this invisible block here is

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.689 
basically this invisible block here is
block<00:00:51.360> 36<00:00:51.899> which<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> piston<00:00:52.920> extension<00:00:53.430> and

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
block 36 which is a piston extension and

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.250 
block 36 which is a piston extension and
when<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:53.969> update<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.300> piston<00:00:54.629> extension<00:00:55.079> it

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
when you update a piston extension it

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.619 
when you update a piston extension it
actually<00:00:55.649> disappears<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.399> just<00:00:56.850> straight-out

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
actually disappears it just straight-out

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.380 
actually disappears it just straight-out
disappears<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:59.190> let's<00:00:59.550> jump<00:00:59.879> down<00:00:59.940> into

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
disappears and so let's jump down into

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.869 
disappears and so let's jump down into
our<00:01:00.960> redstone<00:01:01.800> down<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:02.340> fighting<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> in

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
our redstone down here fighting it in

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.260 
our redstone down here fighting it in
there<00:01:03.030> cool<00:01:03.510> there<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.019> go<00:01:04.110> Rin<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.790> first<00:01:06.119> of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
there cool there we go Rin so first of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.420 
there cool there we go Rin so first of
all<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.530> clock<00:01:07.799> running<00:01:08.070> right<00:01:08.250> here

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
all we have a clock running right here

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.429 
all we have a clock running right here
course<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:08.820> do<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:09.000> need<00:01:09.119> clocks<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:10.320> are

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
course we do we need clocks we are

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.260 
have a button right here and we need a
lava<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.560> actually<00:01:41.060> nevermind<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.119> won't

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
lava for this actually nevermind I won't

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.810 
lava for this actually nevermind I won't
do<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.590> because<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:44.130> cannot<00:01:44.399> pick<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:44.729> that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
do it because we cannot pick up that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.340 
do it because we cannot pick up that
sword<00:01:45.090> that's<00:01:45.299> what<00:01:45.450> will<00:01:45.659> never<00:01:45.930> despawn

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
sword that's what will never despawn

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.600 
sword that's what will never despawn
when<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.649> will<00:01:46.770> never<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.250> able<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.460> pick<00:01:47.549> it

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
when you will never be able to pick it

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.359 
when you will never be able to pick it
up<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.450> pretty<00:01:48.659> cool<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:48.960> pretty<00:01:49.500> nice

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
up so it's pretty cool it's pretty nice

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.679 
up so it's pretty cool it's pretty nice
for<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> display<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.540> or

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
for like a display like this or

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.170 
for like a display like this or
something<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.530> also<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:54.000> what

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
something but we also have this is what

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.120 
something but we also have this is what
someone's<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.750> sword<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.170> been<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.740> age<00:01:55.920> of

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
someone's the sword it's been the age of

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.749 
someone's the sword it's been the age of
32<00:01:56.430> 768<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.200> never<00:01:58.380> actually<00:01:58.680> gets<00:01:59.040> minus

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
32 768 so it never actually gets minus

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.999 
32 768 so it never actually gets minus
32768<00:02:00.360> my<00:02:00.570> apology<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.469> never<00:02:01.680> actually

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
32768 my apology so it never actually

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.590 
32768 my apology so it never actually
despond<00:02:02.640> because<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.060> constantly<00:02:03.450> going

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
despond because it's constantly going

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.069 
despond because it's constantly going
down<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.219> already<00:02:05.490> gone<00:02:05.640> past<00:02:05.750> zero<00:02:06.750> so

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
down so it's already gone past zero so

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.609 
down so it's already gone past zero so
it<00:02:07.229> can't<00:02:07.469> hit<00:02:08.129> well<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.789> can't<00:02:09.060> get<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
it can't hit well it can't get to the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.190 
it can't hit well it can't get to the
point<00:02:10.800> where<00:02:11.039> these<00:02:11.220> bonds<00:02:11.459> convert<00:02:11.790> ass

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
point where these bonds convert ass

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.070 
point where these bonds convert ass
and<00:02:12.290> pick<00:02:12.860> up<00:02:12.950> Slayer<00:02:13.160> 3<00:02:13.190> 2767<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.750> one

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
and pick up Slayer 3 2767 so that one

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.869 
and pick up Slayer 3 2767 so that one
basically<00:02:15.739> never<00:02:16.190> goes<00:02:16.400> down<00:02:16.430> because

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
basically never goes down because

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.280 
basically never goes down because

outside of the integer that minecraft
can<00:02:18.650> understand<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:20.410> above<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:21.530> we've<00:02:21.739> got

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
can understand so above that we've got

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.449 
can understand so above that we've got
our<00:02:21.920> clock<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:22.730> we<00:02:23.629> have<00:02:23.870> this<00:02:24.769> is<00:02:24.980> actually

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
our clock and we have this is actually

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.780 
our clock and we have this is actually
gone<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.940> was<00:02:26.209> an<00:02:26.300> old<00:02:26.420> system<00:02:26.720> i<00:02:26.750> was<00:02:26.870> using

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
gone I was an old system i was using

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.860 
gone I was an old system i was using
this<00:02:28.790> block<00:02:29.120> here<00:02:29.330> is<00:02:29.450> testing<00:02:29.750> for<00:02:29.840> the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
this block here is testing for the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.660 
this block here is testing for the
piston<00:02:30.140> extension<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.769> that's<00:02:30.890> when<00:02:31.610> that

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
piston extension so and that's when that

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.690 
piston extension so and that's when that
test<00:02:31.910> successful<00:02:32.380> there<00:02:33.380> is<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.769> torch<00:02:34.220> right

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
test successful there is a torch right

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.640 
test successful there is a torch right
under<00:02:35.090> here<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.750> mean<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.319> test<00:02:36.530> is

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
under here I mean that test is

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.920 
under here I mean that test is
successful<00:02:36.830> thought<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.610> or<00:02:38.150> not<00:02:38.480> successful

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
successful thought the or not successful

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.330 
successful thought the or not successful
but<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.170> piston<00:02:39.440> extension<00:02:39.860> disappears<00:02:40.220> so

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
but the piston extension disappears so

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.550 
but the piston extension disappears so
when<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.549> right<00:02:40.790> click<00:02:40.819> it<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:42.110> does<00:02:42.379> this

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
when you right click it it does this

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.140 
when you right click it it does this
period<00:02:42.799> let's<00:02:42.950> see<00:02:43.010> can<00:02:43.160> we<00:02:43.220> get<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.910> so<00:02:44.060> you

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
period let's see can we get it so you

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.830 
period let's see can we get it so you
can<00:02:44.269> see<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:46.640> see<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.849> comparator<00:02:47.660> turned

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
can see it you see the comparator turned

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.589 
can see it you see the comparator turned
off<00:02:48.019> for<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.650> second<00:02:48.890> there<00:02:49.010> but<00:02:49.549> it<00:02:49.819> d<00:02:50.209> powers

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
off for a second there but it d powers

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.839 
off for a second there but it d powers
this<00:02:50.780> torch<00:02:51.019> and<00:02:51.260> this<00:02:51.590> one<00:02:51.739> just<00:02:51.769> gives<00:02:52.760> the

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
this torch and this one just gives the

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.940 
this torch and this one just gives the
player<00:02:53.000> diamond<00:02:53.390> sword<00:02:53.569> and<00:02:53.750> set<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.799> block

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
player diamond sword and set the block

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.220 
player diamond sword and set the block
back<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.430> piston<00:02:55.760> extension<00:02:56.150> so<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.810> works

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
back to a piston extension so it works

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.620 
back to a piston extension so it works
in<00:02:57.590> such<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.280> way<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.940> block<00:02:59.120> disappears

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
in such a way that the block disappears

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.360 
in such a way that the block disappears
it<00:02:59.840> detects<00:03:00.319> that<00:03:00.500> there<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.739> no<00:03:00.860> more<00:03:01.130> block

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
it detects that there is no more block

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.539 
it detects that there is no more block
there<00:03:01.579> and<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.930> gives<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.950> sort<00:03:04.190> so

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
there and it gives you the the sort so

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.030 
there and it gives you the the sort so
how<00:03:05.060> can<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:05.360> be<00:03:05.420> tiled<00:03:05.720> well<00:03:06.019> basically<00:03:06.799> if

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
how can this be tiled well basically if

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.100 
how can this be tiled well basically if
you<00:03:07.160> want<00:03:07.489> to<00:03:07.670> if<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.329> were<00:03:08.450> going<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.840> set<00:03:09.019> up

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
you want to if you were going to set up

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.870 
you want to if you were going to set up
a<00:03:09.140> map<00:03:09.319> that<00:03:09.349> that<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:10.069> were<00:03:10.220> using<00:03:10.340> this<00:03:10.670> kind

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
a map that that you were using this kind

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.050 
a map that that you were using this kind
of<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.239> method<00:03:11.870> if<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:12.380> look<00:03:12.590> down<00:03:13.060> this

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
of a method if you look down this

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.509 
of a method if you look down this
direction<00:03:14.470> there<00:03:15.470> is<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.620> one-block<00:03:16.040> gap<00:03:16.310> so

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
direction there is a one-block gap so

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.580 
direction there is a one-block gap so
you<00:03:16.609> can<00:03:16.730> just<00:03:16.760> set<00:03:17.000> up<00:03:17.090> if<00:03:17.540> even<00:03:17.959> you<00:03:18.139> just<00:03:18.470> set

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
you can just set up if even you just set

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.949 
you can just set up if even you just set
a<00:03:18.620> bright<00:03:18.829> right<00:03:19.130> by<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.310> because<00:03:19.690> there<00:03:20.690> is<00:03:20.810> no

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
a bright right by it because there is no

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.509 
a bright right by it because there is no
command<00:03:21.380> blocks<00:03:21.590> as<00:03:21.739> far<00:03:21.920> down<00:03:21.950> as<00:03:22.130> you<00:03:22.310> go

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
command blocks as far down as you go

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.520 
command blocks as far down as you go
here<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.480> could<00:03:23.660> just<00:03:23.840> set<00:03:24.260> up<00:03:24.380> right

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
here so you could just set up right

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.590 
here so you could just set up right
beside<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.889> and<00:03:25.190> it<00:03:25.730> will<00:03:25.850> be<00:03:26.090> you'll<00:03:26.359> be<00:03:26.480> fine

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
beside it and it will be you'll be fine

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.319 
beside it and it will be you'll be fine
it<00:03:26.840> should<00:03:27.290> just<00:03:27.530> put<00:03:28.130> there<00:03:28.430> right<00:03:28.670> beside<00:03:29.150> it

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
it should just put there right beside it

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.220 
it should just put there right beside it
and<00:03:29.630> there<00:03:30.260> will<00:03:30.470> be<00:03:30.500> no<00:03:30.680> problems<00:03:31.040> with<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.370> so

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
and there will be no problems with it so

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.770 
and there will be no problems with it so
that's<00:03:33.230> pretty<00:03:33.590> cool<00:03:33.739> it's<00:03:34.160> been<00:03:34.720> doable<00:03:35.720> for

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
that's pretty cool it's been doable for

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.879 
that's pretty cool it's been doable for
a<00:03:35.989> while<00:03:36.260> but<00:03:36.680> with<00:03:36.889> horses<00:03:37.250> because<00:03:37.850> horses

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
a while but with horses because horses

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.800 
a while but with horses because horses
their<00:03:39.889> names<00:03:40.100> always<00:03:40.549> appeared<00:03:40.880> from<00:03:41.480> a

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
their names always appeared from a

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.680 
their names always appeared from a
really<00:03:42.170> big<00:03:42.290> distance<00:03:42.950> but<00:03:43.220> not<00:03:43.400> like<00:03:43.609> this

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
really big distance but not like this

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.240 
really big distance but not like this
type<00:03:44.690> of<00:03:44.720> distance<00:03:45.109> where<00:03:45.290> even<00:03:45.950> from<00:03:46.100> way

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
type of distance where even from way

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.430 
type of distance where even from way
back<00:03:46.430> here<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:47.389> name<00:03:47.600> is<00:03:47.810> still<00:03:47.989> visible<00:03:48.109> even

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
back here the name is still visible even

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.400 
back here the name is still visible even
long<00:03:48.739> after<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:49.190> entity<00:03:49.579> is<00:03:49.700> d<00:03:49.880> spawned<00:03:50.410> when

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
long after the entity is d spawned when

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.849 
long after the entity is d spawned when
Nazis<00:03:51.680> bomber<00:03:51.889> d<00:03:52.100> rendered<00:03:52.489> because<00:03:53.329> of<00:03:53.989> a<00:03:54.590> new

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
Nazis bomber d rendered because of a new

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.150 
Nazis bomber d rendered because of a new
mechanic<00:03:55.040> that<00:03:55.340> is<00:03:56.319> if<00:03:57.319> I<00:03:57.440> go<00:03:57.590> if<00:03:57.739> I<00:03:57.829> jump<00:03:58.010> down

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
mechanic that is if I go if I jump down

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.440 
mechanic that is if I go if I jump down
into<00:03:58.370> our<00:03:58.519> redstone<00:03:58.849> you<00:03:58.940> can<00:03:59.060> see<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.269> right

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
into our redstone you can see it right

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.970 
into our redstone you can see it right
here<00:03:59.690> I<00:04:00.290> think<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:00.799> is<00:04:00.829> it's<00:04:01.700> this<00:04:02.090> one<00:04:02.739> nope<00:04:03.739> oh

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
here I think it is it's this one nope oh

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.059 
here I think it is it's this one nope oh
yeah<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:04.760> is<00:04:04.940> um<00:04:05.150> this<00:04:06.109> custom<00:04:06.530> name<00:04:06.680> visible

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
yeah it is um this custom name visible

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.180 
yeah it is um this custom name visible
true<00:04:07.609> tag<00:04:08.120> right<00:04:08.389> here<00:04:08.599> that<00:04:09.440> means<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:09.829> for

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
true tag right here that means that for

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.520 
true tag right here that means that for
any<00:04:10.370> entity<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.900> custom<00:04:12.169> name<00:04:12.290> will<00:04:12.440> be

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
any entity the custom name will be

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.470 
any entity the custom name will be
visible<00:04:12.769> we<00:04:12.950> could<00:04:13.130> have<00:04:13.220> done<00:04:13.400> actually<00:04:14.359> let

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
visible we could have done actually let

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.060 
visible we could have done actually let
me<00:04:14.510> see<00:04:14.690> if<00:04:15.169> we<00:04:15.410> were<00:04:15.799> to<00:04:16.780> do

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
me see if we were to do

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.800 
me see if we were to do
if<00:04:20.070> we<00:04:20.490> got<00:04:20.670> rid<00:04:20.700> of<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.510> piston

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
if we got rid of the the piston

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.080 
if we got rid of the the piston
extension<00:04:22.200> right<00:04:22.320> here<00:04:22.670> and<00:04:23.670> we<00:04:23.760> named<00:04:23.940> the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
extension right here and we named the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.000 
extension right here and we named the
diamond<00:04:24.360> sword<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.780> spawned<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.650> in<00:04:25.770> with<00:04:25.980> the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
diamond sword and spawned it in with the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.550 
diamond sword and spawned it in with the
age<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.520> all<00:04:26.640> that<00:04:26.820> values<00:04:27.390> and<00:04:27.600> stuff<00:04:27.810> the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
age and all that values and stuff the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.410 
age and all that values and stuff the
the<00:04:29.190> name<00:04:29.340> would<00:04:29.550> actually<00:04:29.880> appear<00:04:30.120> above<00:04:30.210> it

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
the name would actually appear above it

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.790 
the name would actually appear above it
still<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:30.990> it<00:04:31.110> might<00:04:31.260> actually<00:04:31.380> look<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.650> bit

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
still and it might actually look a bit

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.440 
still and it might actually look a bit
better<00:04:31.950> but<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.580> think<00:04:32.970> it's<00:04:33.120> kind<00:04:33.210> of<00:04:33.300> cool

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
better but I think it's kind of cool

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.320 
better but I think it's kind of cool
like<00:04:33.630> this<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:34.020> if<00:04:34.080> we<00:04:34.170> kept<00:04:34.670> hitting<00:04:35.670> if<00:04:36.180> we

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
like this and if we kept hitting if we

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.690 
like this and if we kept hitting if we
put<00:04:36.510> a<00:04:36.540> button<00:04:36.920> here<00:04:37.920> I'm<00:04:38.190> just<00:04:38.220> kept<00:04:38.550> hitting

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
put a button here I'm just kept hitting

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.940 
put a button here I'm just kept hitting
this<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:40.620> will<00:04:40.830> see<00:04:41.190> bench<00:04:42.000> oh<00:04:42.210> whoops

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
this you will see bench oh whoops

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.600 
this you will see bench oh whoops
eventually<00:04:43.950> this<00:04:44.070> is<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.340> one<00:04:44.460> for<00:04:44.490> the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
eventually this is the one for the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.760 
eventually this is the one for the
piston<00:04:44.880> extension<00:04:45.300> but<00:04:45.750> it<00:04:45.930> powers<00:04:46.470> this<00:04:46.620> as

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
piston extension but it powers this as

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.680 
piston extension but it powers this as
well<00:04:46.890> so<00:04:47.130> it's<00:04:47.250> all<00:04:47.340> good<00:04:47.370> that<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.330> name<00:04:48.480> tag

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
well so it's all good that the name tag

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.690 
well so it's all good that the name tag
does<00:04:48.870> actually<00:04:49.020> get<00:04:49.320> darker<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:49.890> it<00:04:50.550> looks

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
does actually get darker and it looks

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.250 
does actually get darker and it looks
pretty<00:04:50.910> cool<00:04:51.090> so<00:04:51.540> one<00:04:51.690> thing<00:04:51.780> I<00:04:51.870> would<00:04:52.020> like<00:04:52.050> to

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
pretty cool so one thing I would like to

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.020 
pretty cool so one thing I would like to
do<00:04:52.380> is<00:04:52.530> have<00:04:52.560> like<00:04:52.800> a<00:04:52.830> kind<00:04:53.040> of<00:04:53.130> particle<00:04:53.760> like

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
do is have like a kind of particle like

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.350 
do is have like a kind of particle like
smoke<00:04:54.510> particle<00:04:54.930> go<00:04:55.080> around<00:04:55.400> go<00:04:56.400> on<00:04:56.670> around<00:04:57.060> it

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
smoke particle go around go on around it

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.060 
smoke particle go around go on around it
and<00:04:57.450> stuff<00:04:57.720> but<00:04:58.170> you<00:04:58.350> can<00:04:58.530> see<00:04:58.680> that<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:58.950> name

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
and stuff but you can see that the name

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.560 
and stuff but you can see that the name
does<00:04:59.280> get<00:04:59.460> darker<00:04:59.760> and<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:00.030> makes<00:05:00.210> for<00:05:00.360> some

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
does get darker and it makes for some

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.780 
does get darker and it makes for some
pretty<00:05:00.600> interesting<00:05:01.110> effects<00:05:01.620> i'm<00:05:02.490> not<00:05:02.730> sure

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
pretty interesting effects i'm not sure

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.100 
pretty interesting effects i'm not sure
but<00:05:03.000> i<00:05:03.150> think<00:05:03.210> this<00:05:03.570> works<00:05:03.780> in<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.020> same

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
but i think this works in the same

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.350 
but i think this works in the same
retail<00:05:04.530> raw<00:05:04.710> does<00:05:04.950> so<00:05:05.580> you<00:05:05.610> can<00:05:05.790> put<00:05:05.910> in<00:05:06.030> colors

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
retail raw does so you can put in colors

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.670 
retail raw does so you can put in colors
you<00:05:06.570> can<00:05:06.660> put<00:05:06.810> in<00:05:06.900> all<00:05:06.990> that<00:05:07.020> stuff<00:05:07.380> which<00:05:07.560> is

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
you can put in all that stuff which is
