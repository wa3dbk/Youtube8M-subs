two<00:01:29.970> ways<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.270> doing<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.560> first<00:01:32.130> way

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
two ways of doing this but the first way

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.630 
two ways of doing this but the first way
is<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.570> right-click<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.369> hard<00:01:35.579> drive

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
is to right-click and the hard drive

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.490 
is to right-click and the hard drive
that<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.090> want<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.420> change<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:36.960> click
