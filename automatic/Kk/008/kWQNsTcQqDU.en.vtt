00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 the first machine that there is commercial of 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.140
 atari was the pont and the first model the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.660
 citron nolan bushnell at a gas station 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.639
 when he came back after a while to 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.910
 see how the machine had gone 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:19.060
 it worked it was full of coins 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.090
 21 the break out was born as a version 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.070
 from the single- player pont to alcorn 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.770
 acav engineer and creator of the pont 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.050
 had designed a prototype that he used 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.969
 too much girl to move the game by 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.880
 what was unfeasible as a product 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:34.540
 commercial take something like that in search of a 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.940
 solution 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.890
 nolan bushnell proposed a challenge to his 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.230
 employees that consisted in reducing the 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.690
 number of chips and the winner would get 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.329
 a juicy economic reward 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.620
 steve jobs learned about the contest and 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.800
 he proposed it to his friend Steve Wozniak 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.250
 who in just 72 hours and managed 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.100
 reduce the 75 chips to only 25 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.620
 Steve Jobs received the reward and gave 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.520
 water since a small part of the prize 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.649
 Web 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.019
 jacques would learn later about this 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.939
 play is but jobs would tell you that great 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.250
 part of the money he used to found 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.350
 the future if there is nothing like 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.940
 have a friend who knows computer science 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.130

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.650
 you can do it but without offending me ok 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:37.540
 I will continue the pacman was the first game 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:40.540

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.410
 world the most expensive is the nintendo world 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:00.100
 championship 1990 for nes and only 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.290
 there are 116 units in circulation every time 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.800
 that one of these cartridges is auctioned in 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.610
 ebay 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.540
 the final price is usually stratospheric 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.060
 25 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.670
 the design of the zelda tri force is 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.260
 based on the standard of the campus 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.519
 of the Japanese eye 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:23.140
 26 the first sega mascot was álex 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:24.760
 kilo 27 an American representative of 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.739
 capcom commented that in the final game 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.720
 fire was in bad taste that the 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.269
 protagonists had to face 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.310
 with girls in a fight the designer 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.920
 Japanese player replied that no 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.840
 there was no girl in the game when 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.209
 the American asked him about poison and 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.180
 roxy the Japanese replied that they were not 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.760
 girls who were transsexual at two 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.120
 girls they changed the haircut and 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.290
 wardrobe for the final version 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.060
 28 nintendo invented the crosshead and the 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.780
 first command in which it was incorporated was 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.760
 in the pack of nes however a system 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.920
 of similar control was that of matter 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.780
 on television that consisted of a disc 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.540
 that when pressed with the finger was 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.250
 able to distinguish between 16 positions 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.090
 different 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.239
 29 the final seventh fantasy was a game 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.700
 designed for the nintendo 64 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.440
 however square in this did not have 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.859
 discussions because of the cartridges 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.799
 that used the 64-bit console and 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.720
 that limited the size of the games 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.180
 square extract mentada would launch 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.799
 finally his final fantasy for the 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:37.349
 playstation on 13 of that 30 batman is 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.599
 known as putman in japan but it was 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.459
 its entry into the American market the 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.200
 which led to his name change due 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.110
 to the similarities in the language in the 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.270
 area of ​​words justifies 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.400
 well that was all the curiosities of 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.570
 the video games but without first giving a 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.360
 pylon is an urban legend that begins 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.970
 30 plus a pylon this urban legend 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.490
 begins on the date of January 29, 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.460
 2004 when it was created for the best 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.650
 Game Boy Advance Console is all a 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.590
 success the game is called pokémon edition 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.920
 leaf green and there is born the urban legend 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.930
 of a pokemon called hypnos this 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.290
 character that is called as the pokemon 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.419
 pederast and pedophile was called so by 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.550
 an episode of pokemon in which the 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.590
 chapter consisted between the protagonist 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.660
 I saw posters of abducted children 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.580
 nobody knew because the children were 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.700
 kidnapped after many investigations 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.130
 in the chapter it was learned that children 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.020
 they were in a building in which the 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.900
 roof had forest between the building 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.910
 they went to the top floor they go in and you see that 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.400
 there is a very elegant celebration all 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.440
 they danced but the center of the place was 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.000
 hypnos with its predecessor moving its 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.160
 pendulum from the right to the left and 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.190
 upside down and in a door was 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.650
 the forest was the children 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.990

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.590
 people that is epic in these video games 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.380

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.600
