00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.469
 hello everyone and welcome to retro 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.599
 well new channel section trainer 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.099
 this time about competitive bouts of 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.960
 sixth generation of pokemon x and of 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.340
 pokemon and is that after will be less 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.099
 I 'm playing and I 've already dedicated myself to training 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.060
 at a competitive level because 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.980
 it corresponds in game I could not do anything 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.060
 more so I picked up two new pokémon and 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.590
 we have to make good teams 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.720
 competitive to play with people 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.519
 competitively online in the bottles 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.769
 by points and good is a new section 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.540
 association of Wi-Fi combats and then 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.160
 I will try every day or every two days I will 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.629
 see how I do it but I will try to bring 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.550
 many guti matches so you can see 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.140
 as it moves slightly all 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.370
 footage before this generation and others and 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.289
 good to start more in this fight 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.079
 that I've played before a fight against 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.610
 a Japanese of which I can not 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.520
 say it because I do not know and well there 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.219
 you have your team loads canto xx the and 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.989
 my kletzky lakers team edito let's go 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.489
 to see it and we will comment on it because I 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.829
 I think it 's try to comment on 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.390
 combats because a lot of people that if not 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.600
 surely miss so good there 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.920
 you do not want to debate with me and it comes out 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.330
 kletzky 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.150
 what is gay 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.500
 is that it contracts islands well 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.660
 we start with a shift remember that 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.490
 club that has joker therefore 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.050
 all habits are physical some 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.330
 other special physicists go for 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.190
 priority so I make it natural because 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.980
 the first one that isolated the anxieties for 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.780
 to increase his attack he is paralyzed 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.880
 so good to projects now what do I do 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.140
 dirty game because remember that game 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.480
 dirty against opponent's way 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.910
 stronger is because he sticks to himself 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.230
 let's say so dirty game but it does not kill 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.000
 through dances to come 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.100
 explaining here because it's how it's worth 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.330
 you want to die sure good in the case 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.479
 has that is 40 2 percent that you do not 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.460
 commented is that it can be with remains and 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.500
 good in the next turn at least 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.050
 supposed to make vile shadow that's why he takes out 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.820
 first in this gray shadow turn 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.950
 person who would be paralyzed but they are not 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.190
 for me it does not kill me apart from achilles 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.190
 nor of coña 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.110
 and that has a lot of attack the defense of 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.850
 skiing is good trained that 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:16.080
 room has maximum defense maximums 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:18.360
 of life in which you think it recovers 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.370
 unfortunately anal because he recovers 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.840
 and cangas face this charge and as 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.390
 I say to you unfortunately because loads 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.070
 analog calculus would burn would evolve 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.810
 and remember if you win here because they are 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.780
 evolving can pull twice 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.930
 attacks twice 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.940
 and well here he was paralyzed by four ships 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.620
 we will go lucky 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.040
 at least for the speed to start 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.360
 that are always wide open 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.459
 but it is not possible and it makes me a 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.200
 increase an increase twice is 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.579
 say that he does not kill me and that is the 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.290
 problem that I have complete that is not going 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.000
 all in blow and therefore two 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.980
 points increases and they increase a lot 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.719
 the attack so it's very dangerous with 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.470
 nascar at this moment is that he dies with 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:01.150
 two points increases twice and then 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.370
 nothing we get to the milestone because it has 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.859
 imposter and therefore it becomes 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.180
 cangas that does not have the chosen handkerchief and 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.109
 so surely that is faster 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.170
 that is paralyzed 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.639
 well here I did an oasis was 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.859
 earthquake that attack was the best summer 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.599
 wine increment says but did not count that 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.060
 it took me work makes me a critic and 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.349
 emanates from a double or the work does not wait 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.269
 that we are really working because 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.220
 I thought I would think that it also led 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.870
 work that was paralyzed so that 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.730
 nothing wrong that movement but 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.040
 good to grow like that super huarmaca 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.959
 nascar good we make time with the 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.090
 team that is nazi hell that takes 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.220
 here is the online and we turn it into 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.840
 one good blazer not see the 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.849
 protection because if you know the thing that 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.040
 I usually hit below, so I do 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.040
 for this holy altar it does not fail ica nasca 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:52.420
 because I had a lot of attack I had for two 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.950
 and good that is good momentum a time 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.900
 that we're going to leave everything x 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.940
 that by the way they were going to grab fast that 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.610
 we convert is forbidden but good 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.560
 the rules of these are wifi 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.390
 a bit shoddy because they no longer have 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.090
 allowed fast is prohibited or 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.970
 that was legal but good the web video was going 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.700
 paralyzed that is incredible that envite 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.130
 and I think he did not kill it took me away a lot there 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.340
 with the millennium unfortunately suffering 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.859
 speed with perfect momentum 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.949
 and well here I will make the claw 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.979
 quick that makes respite that I say good 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:30.330
 then shortcut and kill me but not 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.330
 it is popular and it is already 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.840
 badly bad bad and we continue with momentum 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.500
 there is 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.690
 magic shine type to the retinue fight 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.160
 perfect quite as we have left with 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.160
 14 of that lake ignite igneous 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.600
 and I manage to defeat it I get it 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.860
 defeat and I die for the recoil is 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.080
 incredible this combat I liked 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.550
 a lot this real fight and put 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.880
 norms of people like me dead by 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.470
 recoil I win and well let's hope 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.850
 liked this fight and I tell you to comment 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.470
 if they liked to leave many 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.970
 comments and if they want more fighting 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.160
