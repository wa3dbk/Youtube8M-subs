00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.700 

when<00:00:15.280> I<00:00:15.310> flew<00:00:15.640> the<00:00:15.910> the<00:00:16.209> v6<00:00:16.660> I<00:00:16.870> just<00:00:17.080> expected

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
when I flew the the v6 I just expected

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.500 
when I flew the the v6 I just expected
that<00:00:17.740> it<00:00:17.920> was<00:00:18.040> going<00:00:18.220> to<00:00:18.250> turn<00:00:18.940> it<00:00:19.120> into<00:00:19.270> this

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
that it was going to turn it into this

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.130 
that it was going to turn it into this
sluggish<00:00:20.140> GA<00:00:20.800> style<00:00:21.640> airplane<00:00:22.119> which<00:00:22.960> it

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
sluggish GA style airplane which it

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.320 
sluggish GA style airplane which it
didn't<00:00:23.410> do<00:00:23.590> it<00:00:23.800> just<00:00:24.160> we<00:00:24.550> still<00:00:24.790> have<00:00:25.029> the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
didn't do it just we still have the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.400 
didn't do it just we still have the
geared<00:00:25.840> engine<00:00:26.260> it's<00:00:26.650> the<00:00:27.220> torque<00:00:28.000> is

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
geared engine it's the torque is

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.679 
geared engine it's the torque is
multiplied<00:00:29.410> so<00:00:30.130> it<00:00:30.250> still<00:00:30.490> is<00:00:30.820> a<00:00:31.090> when<00:00:31.570> you

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
multiplied so it still is a when you

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.390 
multiplied so it still is a when you
open<00:00:31.990> that<00:00:32.110> throttle<00:00:32.349> up<00:00:32.650> the<00:00:32.829> tails<00:00:33.070> in<00:00:33.280> the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
open that throttle up the tails in the

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.610 
open that throttle up the tails in the
air<00:00:33.430> and<00:00:33.790> you're<00:00:33.970> and<00:00:34.480> you're<00:00:34.510> within<00:00:35.079> four

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
air and you're and you're within four

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.830 
air and you're and you're within four
seconds<00:00:36.040> here<00:00:36.220> in<00:00:36.310> the<00:00:36.340> air<00:00:36.550> climbs<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.660> only

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
seconds here in the air climbs the only

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.090 
seconds here in the air climbs the only
thing<00:00:37.930> it<00:00:38.020> did<00:00:38.140> was<00:00:38.170> it<00:00:38.410> probably<00:00:38.770> probably

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
thing it did was it probably probably

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.010 
thing it did was it probably probably
just<00:00:39.489> about<00:00:39.640> tripled<00:00:40.060> the<00:00:40.150> climb<00:00:40.390> rate<00:00:40.600> you

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
just about tripled the climb rate you

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.069 
just about tripled the climb rate you
know<00:00:41.079> this<00:00:41.320> this<00:00:41.560> thing<00:00:41.770> finds<00:00:42.130> it<00:00:42.280> at<00:00:42.640> about

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
know this this thing finds it at about

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.930 
know this this thing finds it at about
2,500<00:00:44.079> feet<00:00:44.230> a<00:00:44.260> minute<00:00:44.620> you<00:00:45.340> get<00:00:45.550> to<00:00:45.670> a<00:00:45.699> safe

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
2,500 feet a minute you get to a safe

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.849 
2,500 feet a minute you get to a safe
altitude<00:00:46.149> faster<00:00:47.020> and<00:00:47.260> if<00:00:47.379> you're<00:00:47.530> operating

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
altitude faster and if you're operating

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.009 
altitude faster and if you're operating
out<00:00:48.129> of<00:00:48.160> a<00:00:48.309> short<00:00:48.520> runway<00:00:48.789> you're<00:00:49.149> at<00:00:49.269> a<00:00:49.300> at<00:00:49.719> an

if you had a problem then you can you
have<00:00:58.570> L<00:00:58.719> know<00:00:58.899> L<00:00:59.109> did<00:00:59.410> enough<00:00:59.559> to<00:00:59.679> turn<00:00:59.859> around

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
have L know L did enough to turn around

have L know L did enough to turn around
it<00:01:00.609> just<00:01:00.879> took<00:01:01.210> away<00:01:01.390> my<00:01:01.750> fears<00:01:02.199> of

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
it just took away my fears of

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.640 
it just took away my fears of
make<00:01:03.129> having<00:01:03.579> an<00:01:03.699> unsafe<00:01:04.120> or<00:01:04.600> let's<00:01:05.199> say<00:01:05.320> an

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
make having an unsafe or let's say an

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.400 
make having an unsafe or let's say an
airplane<00:01:06.460> that<00:01:06.490> would<00:01:07.180> have<00:01:07.410> questionable

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
airplane that would have questionable

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.190 
airplane that would have questionable
safety<00:01:08.710> records<00:01:09.280> so<00:01:09.520> I<00:01:09.550> I'm<00:01:10.210> I'm<00:01:10.960> just

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
safety records so I I'm I'm just

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.200 
safety records so I I'm I'm just
extremely<00:01:11.530> pleased<00:01:12.040> with<00:01:12.280> it<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:12.640> it's<00:01:12.820> and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
extremely pleased with it and it's and

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.880 
extremely pleased with it and it's and
it's<00:01:13.330> nothing<00:01:13.840> but<00:01:14.020> a<00:01:14.080> hoot<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:14.620> fly<00:01:14.830> this

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
it's nothing but a hoot to fly this

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.950 
it's nothing but a hoot to fly this
thing<00:01:15.100> with<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.579> with<00:01:15.820> this<00:01:15.939> power<00:01:16.150> on<00:01:16.270> this

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
thing with the with this power on this

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.149 
thing with the with this power on this
engine<00:01:17.320> is<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.500> hundred<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:17.979> eighty

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
engine is a hundred and eighty

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.399 
engine is a hundred and eighty
horsepower<00:01:18.729> as<00:01:19.000> it's<00:01:19.210> in<00:01:19.329> the<00:01:19.420> car<00:01:19.720> where

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
horsepower as it's in the car where

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.850 
horsepower as it's in the car where
we're<00:01:20.650> operating<00:01:21.040> it<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.960> takeoff<00:01:23.350> at<00:01:23.619> about

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
we're operating it for takeoff at about

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.080 
we're operating it for takeoff at about
between<00:01:24.640> 52<00:01:25.329> and<00:01:25.619> 5500<00:01:26.619> rpm<00:01:27.040> we<00:01:27.670> figure<00:01:27.909> we're

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
between 52 and 5500 rpm we figure we're

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.679 
between 52 and 5500 rpm we figure we're
at<00:01:28.390> about<00:01:28.570> 160<00:01:29.290> horsepower<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.790> but<00:01:31.570> we're

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
at about 160 horsepower and but we're

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.160 
at about 160 horsepower and but we're
putting<00:01:31.960> a<00:01:32.049> Honda<00:01:32.439> engine<00:01:32.710> in<00:01:32.860> that<00:01:33.040> it's<00:01:34.170> 245

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
putting a Honda engine in that it's 245

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.600 
putting a Honda engine in that it's 245
horsepower<00:01:35.200> at<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:38.439> expect<00:01:39.340> that<00:01:39.460> that

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
horsepower at that I expect that that

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.310 
horsepower at that I expect that that
that's<00:01:40.030> going<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.360> be<00:01:40.479> a<00:01:40.509> real<00:01:42.659> hot<00:01:43.659> seller<00:01:43.990> as

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
that's going to be a real hot seller as

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.039 
that's going to be a real hot seller as
well<00:01:44.380> in<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.219> engine<00:01:45.340> only<00:01:45.579> weighs<00:01:45.869> maybe<00:01:46.869> at

well in the engine only weighs maybe at

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:47.520 
well in the engine only weighs maybe at
the<00:01:47.170> most

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530

well for those who may be interested in
aircraft<00:02:22.750> like<00:02:23.019> this<00:02:23.200> can<00:02:23.349> you<00:02:23.379> talk<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.620> little

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
aircraft like this can you talk a little

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.819 
aircraft like this can you talk a little
bit<00:02:23.950> about<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.909> construction<00:02:25.870> profile<00:02:26.500> what

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
bit about the construction profile what

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.740 
bit about the construction profile what
it<00:02:26.920> takes<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.280> build<00:02:27.489> one<00:02:27.730> what's<00:02:28.420> involved

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
it takes to build one what's involved

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.539 
it takes to build one what's involved
and<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.379> course<00:02:29.590> we<00:02:29.769> got<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.040> ask<00:02:30.129> the<00:02:30.310> cost

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
and of course we got to ask the cost

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.899 
and of course we got to ask the cost
okay<00:02:31.450> we<00:02:32.439> do<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> lot<00:02:33.010> at<00:02:33.189> the<00:02:33.310> factory<00:02:33.760> the

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
okay we do a lot at the factory the

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.879 
okay we do a lot at the factory the
entire<00:02:34.150> center<00:02:34.540> section<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:34.989> built<00:02:35.290> at<00:02:35.769> the

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:35.889 
entire center section is built at the

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.220 
entire center section is built at the
factory<00:02:36.250> with<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.459> landing<00:02:36.939> gear<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.239> it<00:02:37.359> my

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
factory with the landing gear in it my

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.470 
factory with the landing gear in it my
philosophy<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.099> it<00:02:39.549> has<00:02:39.849> been<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.180> way<00:02:40.299> also

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
philosophy and it has been this way also

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.709 
philosophy and it has been this way also
on<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.870> tornado<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:42.359> anything<00:02:43.359> in<00:02:43.599> the

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:43.719 
on the tornado is that anything in the

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:48.449 
on the tornado is that anything in the
kit<00:02:44.019> is<00:02:46.079> anything<00:02:47.079> critical<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.829> when<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.040> say

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
kit is anything critical and when I say

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.610 
kit is anything critical and when I say
critical<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:48.939> mean<00:02:49.090> something<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.629> if<00:02:50.169> they

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
critical I mean something that if they

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.229 
critical I mean something that if they
made<00:02:50.769> a<00:02:50.799> mistake<00:02:51.159> on<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.549> you<00:02:51.730> end<00:02:52.030> up<00:02:52.090> with<00:02:52.209> a

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
made a mistake on and you end up with a

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.750 
made a mistake on and you end up with a
catastrophic<00:02:52.540> failure<00:02:52.989> we<00:02:53.739> we<00:02:54.040> try<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.310> take

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
catastrophic failure we we try to take

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.929 
catastrophic failure we we try to take
those<00:02:55.000> those<00:02:55.540> kinds<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:56.250> items<00:02:57.250> out<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:57.730> the

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
those those kinds of items out of the

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.959 
those those kinds of items out of the
builder's<00:02:58.329> hands<00:02:58.689> and<00:02:59.099> so<00:03:00.099> we<00:03:00.459> do<00:03:00.579> all<00:03:00.760> the

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:00.969 
builder's hands and so we do all the

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.209 
builder's hands and so we do all the
spire<00:03:01.269> work<00:03:01.540> we<00:03:02.169> actually<00:03:02.530> build<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.889> complete

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:03.219 
spire work we actually build a complete

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.759 
spire work we actually build a complete
center<00:03:03.549> section<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.689> the<00:03:05.049> customer<00:03:05.409> actually

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
center section the the customer actually

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.679 
center section the the customer actually
has<00:03:05.889> to<00:03:06.040> disassemble<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:07.000> portion<00:03:07.510> of<00:03:07.599> the

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
has to disassemble a portion of the

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.589 
has to disassemble a portion of the
center<00:03:07.989> section<00:03:08.349> to<00:03:08.739> install<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.879> fuel<00:03:10.150> tanks

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
center section to install the fuel tanks

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.259 
center section to install the fuel tanks
and<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.650> also<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.730> plumbing<00:03:13.060> for<00:03:13.209> the

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
and and also the plumbing for the

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.199 
and and also the plumbing for the
retractable<00:03:14.109> gear<00:03:14.519> we<00:03:15.519> also<00:03:15.639> do<00:03:15.879> the<00:03:16.000> control

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
retractable gear we also do the control

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.170 
retractable gear we also do the control
surfaces<00:03:16.870> again<00:03:17.709> with<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.189> tapirs<00:03:18.700> control

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
surfaces again with the tapirs control

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.240 
surfaces again with the tapirs control
surfaces<00:03:19.569> are<00:03:19.750> hard<00:03:19.930> hard<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.590> build<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.069> so

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
surfaces are hard hard to build and so

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.430 
surfaces are hard hard to build and so
forth<00:03:21.489> so<00:03:21.699> so<00:03:22.269> we<00:03:22.419> do<00:03:22.629> all<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:23.019> that<00:03:23.169> at<00:03:23.319> the

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
forth so so we do all of that at the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.550 
forth so so we do all of that at the
factory<00:03:23.859> the<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:25.359> fuselage<00:03:25.900> is<00:03:26.290> where<00:03:26.470> the

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
factory the the fuselage is where the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.069 
factory the the fuselage is where the
majority<00:03:26.979> of<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.099> work<00:03:27.280> is<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.819> and<00:03:28.780> it's<00:03:28.930> a

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
majority of the work is and and it's a

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.099 
majority of the work is and and it's a
chromoly<00:03:29.769> in<00:03:30.280> fact<00:03:30.489> they<00:03:30.609> did<00:03:30.819> this<00:03:31.109> the

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
chromoly in fact they did this the

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.789 
chromoly in fact they did this the
reason<00:03:32.349> I<00:03:32.439> originally<00:03:33.099> I<00:03:33.129> was<00:03:33.280> going<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.459> do<00:03:33.639> a

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
reason I originally I was going to do a

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.990 
reason I originally I was going to do a
monocoque<00:03:35.799> construction<00:03:35.859> in<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.579> fuselage

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
monocoque construction in the fuselage

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.599 
monocoque construction in the fuselage
but<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:38.049> fixed<00:03:38.590> stream<00:03:38.829> that's<00:03:39.069> required

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
but the the fixed stream that's required

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.089 
but the the fixed stream that's required
would<00:03:40.180> be<00:03:40.359> required<00:03:40.780> for<00:03:40.870> each<00:03:41.169> builder<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:41.919> do

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
would be required for each builder to do

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.080 
would be required for each builder to do
the<00:03:42.430> monocoque<00:03:43.120> fuselage<00:03:44.109> I<00:03:44.349> felt<00:03:44.560> would<00:03:44.680> be

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
the monocoque fuselage I felt would be

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.429 
the monocoque fuselage I felt would be
adding<00:03:46.090> too<00:03:46.239> great<00:03:46.479> a<00:03:46.509> burden<00:03:46.569> to<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.109> to<00:03:47.349> the

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 
adding too great a burden to the to the

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.729 
adding too great a burden to the to the
Builder<00:03:47.769> so<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:48.370> decided<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.909> go<00:03:49.060> with<00:03:49.269> a

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
Builder so I decided to go with a

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.270 
Builder so I decided to go with a
semi-monocoque<00:03:51.959> with<00:03:52.959> chromoly<00:03:53.379> steel<00:03:53.739> cage

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
semi-monocoque with chromoly steel cage

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.479 
semi-monocoque with chromoly steel cage
and<00:03:54.639> and<00:03:55.599> then<00:03:55.900> that<00:03:56.319> way<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.709> cage<00:03:56.979> becomes

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
and and then that way that cage becomes

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.939 
and and then that way that cage becomes
the<00:03:57.699> fixture<00:03:58.090> so<00:03:58.120> there's<00:03:58.540> no<00:03:58.720> need<00:03:58.989> for<00:03:59.349> for

00:03:59.939 --> 00:03:59.949 
the fixture so there's no need for for

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.059 
the fixture so there's no need for for
additional<00:04:00.340> fixturing<00:04:00.729> to<00:04:01.060> build<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:02.019> kit<00:04:02.259> the

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
additional fixturing to build a kit the

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.119 
additional fixturing to build a kit the
the<00:04:03.609> build<00:04:03.909> time<00:04:04.269> of<00:04:04.659> the<00:04:04.900> kit<00:04:05.109> is<00:04:05.319> about<00:04:08.129> 1200

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
the build time of the kit is about 1200

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.749 
the build time of the kit is about 1200

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
right now in the marketplace I think

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.810 
right now in the marketplace I think
it's<00:05:55.169> soft<00:05:55.380> all<00:05:55.590> over<00:05:55.830> but<00:05:56.370> we're<00:05:56.580> seeing<00:05:56.789> a

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
it's soft all over but we're seeing a

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.430 
it's soft all over but we're seeing a
lot<00:05:56.970> if<00:05:57.150> we<00:05:57.270> still<00:05:57.479> have<00:05:57.630> a<00:05:57.659> lot<00:05:57.900> of<00:05:58.050> interest

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
lot if we still have a lot of interest

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.510 
lot if we still have a lot of interest
and<00:05:58.590> I<00:05:58.680> think<00:05:58.889> it's<00:05:58.979> kind<00:05:59.159> of<00:05:59.220> a<00:05:59.310> niche<00:05:59.490> market

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
and I think it's kind of a niche market

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.689 
and I think it's kind of a niche market
we<00:06:00.060> our<00:06:00.599> customers<00:06:01.080> are<00:06:01.259> still<00:06:01.440> still<00:06:02.250> very
