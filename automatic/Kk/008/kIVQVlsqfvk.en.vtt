miniseries was the writing process
easier<00:02:46.840> than<00:02:47.319> when<00:02:47.739> you

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
easier than when you

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.040 
easier than when you
doing<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.460> sketch<00:02:48.670> show<00:02:48.880> or<00:02:49.090> word<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.810> same

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
sort of fights and tensions from the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.900 
sort of fights and tensions from the
early<00:02:53.050> days<00:02:53.230> still<00:02:53.440> there<00:02:53.800> it<00:02:54.490> was<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.640> little

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
early days still there it was a little

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.090 
early days still there it was a little
easier<00:02:55.030> because<00:02:55.270> we<00:02:55.540> would<00:02:55.860> there'd<00:02:56.860> still<00:02:56.920> be

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
easier because we would there'd still be

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.240 
easier because we would there'd still be
fights<00:02:57.400> but<00:02:57.610> we'd<00:02:57.730> get<00:02:57.850> winded<00:02:58.240> quickly<00:02:59.070> so<00:03:00.070> we

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
fights but we'd get winded quickly so we

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.530 
fights but we'd get winded quickly so we
didn't<00:03:00.490> have<00:03:00.550> we'd<00:03:00.820> have<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.060> energy<00:03:01.210> to<00:03:01.420> keep

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
didn't have we'd have the energy to keep

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.990
