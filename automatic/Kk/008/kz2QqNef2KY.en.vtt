00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.290
 Hello, good kids, we're here 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.790
 new advanced warfighter video good 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.130
 this time in a game game of 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.559
 good weapons let's see I'm already half 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.059
 installed in the new room to 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.910
 better it sounds a little different but 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.800
 is that I do not know what happens that seems to be 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.560
 listen with a little echo or something like that 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.529
 tell me what you hear if you notice 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:31.769
 much detail and that and then regulate it 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.769
 another way, my mother, let's see, let's go 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.680
 and the other 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.680
 it is where it is 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.719
 or not worth 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.820
 use 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.880
 power 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.430
 It's worth, it's worth seeing because it seems that 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.850
 they are coming out all the time around here 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.850
 let's see yes 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.930
 but but hey it does not give you over a shot 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.530
 It is worth vale vale and this power always and 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.530
 inside all 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.540

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.050

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.540

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:27.580

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.420
 it's quiet, calm, look, uncle 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.420
 a shot like everything 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.260
 with this from a distance it's crazy 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.010
 these are more no salts 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.200

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.200
 and it escapes me goodbye 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.880
 at the time we go let's go 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.420
 stop this over here 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.979
 we go 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.670
 look I love you as a hunted 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.080

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.480

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.310
 here nothing 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.090
 let's see if it's still up here 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.430
 it seems that no 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.430
 I've seen one here we go let's go 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.500
 we found worth it is worth at least 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.360
 I have removed the e 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.820
 m 14 that you do not see what it costs to 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.930
 take it off sometimes less bad 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.480
 that the east map is big and that and 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.290
 single 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.200
 it's worth here 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.370
 fuck did not give me time 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.370
 it's a bit late 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.859
 I think this does not come this does not come 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.620
 I think he took it back we're going to 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.939
 this 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.939
 no no 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.939
 we go 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.870
 there 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:23.930
 ok, no, uncle is touched and with this 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.980
 it takes three or four shots not 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.260
 there was way there's another one around here another 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.310
 on the right hello 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.819
 we have jumped 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.819
 two 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.160
 there 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.160
 He said 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.790
 does not go the whole face worth it's worth it is that 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.300
 I seem to be asking for rhythm 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.760
 already cost at the beginning 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.450
 the bus 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.520
 bush to see how I get out as I leave here 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.080
 he has seen me 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.080
 is that he has no reach of this 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.020
 did not obviate my mother who has been rafa two 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.020
 Whole chargers and do not die 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:19.989
 come on and the other one that is touched is 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.989
 touched see here we go vale 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.630
 the fault can not be take 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.300
 I do not know if not 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.310
 it's going to be that 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.310
 you are not calm 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.830
 fuck it is that it does not kill the bazooka Yeste 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:50.910
 there are times you have to give it but 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.480
 towards the body so we can kill it, let's go 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.480
 we go 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.320
 we go 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.389
 I do not say to see if it bursts is 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.819
 trying to stay close to me it's like that 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.130
 okay, let's go 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:12.620
 Well, I started there a little loose 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.020
 but that's also why two or three ago 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.300
 days I think I played the console and still 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.639
 well it has not been bad 26-14 have killed me 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.020
 at first especially after I've already 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.720
 caught pace and that they are more 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.310
 difficult after the weapons but good 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.139
 I hope you liked it and I'll go 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.240
 uploading more videos to show you 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.069
 that's how the room and everything 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.300
 so nothing that I hope you have 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.300
 liked and until next time
