the<00:01:34.009> herbal<00:01:34.670> essences<00:01:35.030> fresh<00:01:35.329> balanced

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
the herbal essences fresh balanced

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.289 
the herbal essences fresh balanced
clarifying<00:01:36.350> shampoo<00:01:36.829> normal<00:01:37.520> or<00:01:37.759> oily<00:01:37.939> hair

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
clarifying shampoo normal or oily hair

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.660 
clarifying shampoo normal or oily hair
and<00:01:38.600> then<00:01:39.320> this<00:01:39.530> is<00:01:39.590> citrus<00:01:40.130> blossom<00:01:40.579> and

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
and then this is citrus blossom and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.310 
and then this is citrus blossom and
green<00:01:40.939> tea<00:01:41.180> extract<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:41.899> I<00:01:41.930> just<00:01:42.109> use<00:01:42.289> that

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
green tea extract so I just use that

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.980 
green tea extract so I just use that
shampoo<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:43.670> use<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.210> same<00:01:44.420> conditioner

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
shampoo and I use the same conditioner

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.170 
shampoo and I use the same conditioner
and<00:01:45.140> I<00:01:45.770> find<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:46.159> that<00:01:46.399> really<00:01:46.729> helps<00:01:47.119> to

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
and I find that that really helps to

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.959 
and I find that that really helps to
control<00:01:47.479> my<00:01:48.049> oil<00:01:48.229> in<00:01:49.039> my<00:01:49.130> hair<00:01:49.159> it<00:01:49.670> doesn't<00:01:49.909> get

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
greasy as quickly but obviously if you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.380 
greasy as quickly but obviously if you
have<00:01:52.189> dry<00:01:52.369> ends<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:52.939> stuff<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:53.179> probably

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
have dry ends and stuff you probably

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.990 
have dry ends and stuff you probably
better<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.869> use<00:01:54.109> a<00:01:54.289> dry<00:01:54.469> and<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:55.640> normal

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
all before and but i was finding like

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.090 
all before and but i was finding like
because<00:04:23.140> I<00:04:23.170> don't<00:04:23.410> wash<00:04:23.500> my<00:04:23.650> hair<00:04:23.770> every<00:04:23.950> day<00:04:23.980> I

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
because I don't wash my hair every day I

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.590 
because I don't wash my hair every day I
find<00:04:24.400> that<00:04:24.520> I<00:04:24.580> can<00:04:24.760> leave<00:04:24.970> it<00:04:25.210> for<00:04:25.450> a<00:04:25.480> little

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
find that I can leave it for a little

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.830 
find that I can leave it for a little
bit<00:04:25.780> longer<00:04:25.960> and<00:04:26.520> but<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:27.790> was<00:04:28.270> finding<00:04:28.510> that

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
bit longer and but I was finding that

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.730 
bit longer and but I was finding that
when<00:04:29.260> I<00:04:29.290> didn't<00:04:29.590> want<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.770> wash<00:04:29.919> it

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
when I didn't want to wash it

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.749 
when I didn't want to wash it
kind<00:04:30.919> of<00:04:30.949> having<00:04:31.250> two<00:04:31.370> because<00:04:31.580> it<00:04:31.669> was

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
kind of having two because it was

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.510 
kind of having two because it was
getting<00:04:31.849> greasy<00:04:32.449> I've<00:04:32.780> been<00:04:32.990> using<00:04:33.289> this<00:04:34.039> and

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
getting greasy I've been using this and

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.080 
getting greasy I've been using this and
it's<00:04:34.610> amazing<00:04:35.240> like<00:04:35.479> it<00:04:36.080> it<00:04:36.770> does<00:04:37.130> leave<00:04:37.669> white

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
it's amazing like it it does leave white

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.640 
it's amazing like it it does leave white
marks<00:04:38.449> in<00:04:38.569> your<00:04:38.599> hair<00:04:38.840> but<00:04:39.110> I<00:04:39.199> think<00:04:39.380> kind<00:04:39.590> of

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
marks in your hair but I think kind of

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.580 
marks in your hair but I think kind of
any<00:04:39.860> dry<00:04:40.130> shampoo<00:04:40.520> is<00:04:40.639> going<00:04:40.819> to<00:04:40.880> do<00:04:41.000> that<00:04:41.180> and

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
any dry shampoo is going to do that and

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.680 
any dry shampoo is going to do that and
I<00:04:42.590> don't<00:04:43.430> really<00:04:43.520> care<00:04:43.729> to<00:04:44.150> be<00:04:44.180> honest<00:04:44.479> I<00:04:44.630> just

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
I don't really care to be honest I just

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.930 
I don't really care to be honest I just
rub<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.050> in<00:04:45.259> and<00:04:45.470> it's<00:04:45.590> gone<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:46.009> it<00:04:46.580> literally

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
rub it in and it's gone and it literally

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.240 
rub it in and it's gone and it literally
takes<00:04:47.509> any<00:04:47.810> kind<00:04:48.139> of<00:04:48.259> like<00:04:48.380> heaviness<00:04:48.860> out<00:04:49.160> of

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
takes any kind of like heaviness out of

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.670 
takes any kind of like heaviness out of
your<00:04:49.370> hair<00:04:49.550> just<00:04:50.150> feel<00:04:50.360> so<00:04:50.509> light<00:04:50.810> and<00:04:50.840> bouncy

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
like I sometimes if I even use if I

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.439 
like I sometimes if I even use if I
don't<00:04:57.349> need<00:04:57.500> to<00:04:57.560> feel<00:04:58.039> like<00:04:58.250> shampoo<00:04:58.880> purposes

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
don't need to feel like shampoo purposes

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.420 
don't need to feel like shampoo purposes
just<00:04:59.660> to<00:05:00.020> do<00:05:00.169> like<00:05:00.349> the<00:05:00.470> roots<00:05:00.710> underneath

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
here and stuff to add volume because it

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.100
