00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
rip apart tear it apart in different

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.669 
rip apart tear it apart in different
areas<00:00:43.250> more<00:00:44.089> random<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:44.750> natural-looking

you<00:00:45.980> can<00:00:46.129> make<00:00:46.249> it<00:00:46.370> look<00:00:46.519> the<00:00:46.670> better

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.650 

here<00:00:58.010> we<00:00:58.100> go<00:00:58.219> pretty<00:00:58.670> simple<00:00:58.969> now<00:00:59.420> for<00:00:59.600> the

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
here we go pretty simple now for the

here we go pretty simple now for the
spray-painting<00:01:00.160> when<00:01:01.160> you<00:01:01.220> spray-paint<00:01:01.670> it's

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
spray-painting when you spray-paint it's

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.700

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
it closer the idea here is to get

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.190 
it closer the idea here is to get
different<00:01:07.490> shades<00:01:07.640> of<00:01:07.909> gray<00:01:13.900> so<00:01:14.900> I'm<00:01:14.990> going

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
different shades of gray so I'm going

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:25.389 
different shades of gray so I'm going
from<00:01:17.259> between<00:01:18.259> 6<00:01:18.619> inches<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.159> foot<00:01:19.400> away<00:01:24.399> if

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
from between 6 inches and foot away if

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:26.859 
from between 6 inches and foot away if
you<00:01:25.610> want<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.850> be<00:01:25.940> a<00:01:25.970> bit<00:01:26.119> darker<00:01:26.479> you<00:01:26.570> just<00:01:26.750> go

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
you want to be a bit darker you just go

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.970 
you want to be a bit darker you just go
