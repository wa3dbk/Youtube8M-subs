look<00:00:45.510> at<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> box<00:00:45.870> because<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.739> thought<00:00:47.219> this

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
look at the box because I thought this

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.060 
look at the box because I thought this
is<00:00:47.460> quite<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> long<00:00:48.000> time<00:00:48.270> ago<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.070> haven't

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
is quite a long time ago and haven't

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.680 
is quite a long time ago and haven't
boxed<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.660> obviously<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:53.239> think<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.360> was<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:54.660> of

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
boxed it obviously I think it was one of

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.099 
boxed it obviously I think it was one of
the<00:00:54.840> first<00:00:55.050> players<00:00:55.410> figures<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.010> bought<00:00:56.219> I

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
the first players figures I bought I

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.209 
the first players figures I bought I
should<00:00:58.109> also<00:00:58.230> mention<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> character

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
should also mention that the character

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.340 
should also mention that the character
comes<00:00:59.489> with<00:00:59.670> alternate<00:01:00.180> hands<00:01:00.449> seen<00:01:01.020> here

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
comes with alternate hands seen here

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.869 
comes with alternate hands seen here
just<00:01:01.680> because<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> don't<00:01:02.100> actually<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.640> them

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
just because I don't actually have them

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.780 
just because I don't actually have them
they're<00:01:03.270> open<00:01:03.750> handed<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.400> you<00:01:05.400> know<00:01:05.549> I'm

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790

articulation<00:02:06.290> we<00:02:07.290> have<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.530> rotating<00:02:08.069> wrist

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
articulation we have a rotating wrist

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.210 
articulation we have a rotating wrist
here<00:02:08.700> there<00:02:09.420> actually<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.170> think

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
here there actually I think

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.660 
here there actually I think
two<00:02:11.820> sets<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.360> alternate<00:02:12.810> hands<00:02:13.080> one<00:02:13.670> open

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
two sets of alternate hands one open

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.910 
two sets of alternate hands one open

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
hand glove one open hand on glove I

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.670 
hand glove one open hand on glove I
believe<00:02:18.290> single<00:02:19.290> point<00:02:19.530> here<00:02:19.710> at<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.860> elbow

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
believe single point here at the elbow

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.620 
believe single point here at the elbow

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
rotation here up deep I set it way

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.090

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
if you want it to the interesting thing

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.570 
if you want it to the interesting thing
is<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.050> outer<00:02:49.050> best<00:02:49.380> portion<00:02:49.770> here's<00:02:50.190> one

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
is the outer best portion here's one

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.610 
is the outer best portion here's one
piece<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:51.060> soft<00:02:51.420> plastic<00:02:51.840> although<00:02:52.500> it's

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
piece of soft plastic although it's

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.250 
piece of soft plastic although it's
harder<00:02:52.950> than<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.280> inner<00:02:54.209> best<00:02:54.480> portion<00:02:54.900> I

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
harder than the inner best portion I

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.040 
harder than the inner best portion I
mean<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.740> actual<00:02:56.010> shirt<00:02:56.310> portion<00:02:56.820> here<00:02:57.150> but

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
mean the actual shirt portion here but

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.050 
mean the actual shirt portion here but
there<00:02:58.170> are<00:02:58.200> two<00:02:58.380> separate<00:02:58.830> things<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.670> you<00:03:00.030> can

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
there are two separate things so you can

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.820 
there are two separate things so you can
actually<00:03:00.330> move<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.080> inner<00:03:01.380> one<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.590> believe

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
actually move the inner one I believe

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.530 
actually move the inner one I believe
but<00:03:02.580> it'd<00:03:03.570> be<00:03:03.600> tough<00:03:05.090> which<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.209> know<00:03:06.360> is<00:03:06.450> a

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
but it'd be tough which you know is a

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.480 
but it'd be tough which you know is a
really<00:03:06.870> nice<00:03:07.050> touch<00:03:07.350> instead<00:03:07.770> of<00:03:07.830> just<00:03:07.980> fusing

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
really nice touch instead of just fusing

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.980 
really nice touch instead of just fusing
the<00:03:08.580> two<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.060> just<00:03:09.480> making<00:03:09.750> this<00:03:09.840> an

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
the two and just making this an

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.720 
the two and just making this an
extension<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.620> down<00:03:13.890> here<00:03:14.130> at<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.280> leg<00:03:14.520> we

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
extension and down here at the leg we

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.840 
extension and down here at the leg we
have<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:14.970> full<00:03:15.630> range<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:16.050> motion<00:03:16.370> see<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> ball

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
have a full range of motion see a ball

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.080 
have a full range of motion see a ball
joint<00:03:18.950> gosh<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.100> thought<00:03:20.280> as<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.459> full<00:03:20.730> range<00:03:20.940> of

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
joint gosh I thought as a full range of

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.460 
joint gosh I thought as a full range of
motion<00:03:21.450> but<00:03:23.300> yeah<00:03:24.300> it<00:03:24.480> looks<00:03:24.720> like<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.080> might

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
motion but yeah it looks like it might

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.479 
motion but yeah it looks like it might
just<00:03:25.500> not<00:03:25.980> go<00:03:26.160> out<00:03:26.310> too<00:03:26.610> far<00:03:26.640> but<00:03:28.190> hey<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.250> can

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
just not go out too far but hey you can

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.810 
just not go out too far but hey you can
still<00:03:29.670> get<00:03:29.850> some<00:03:30.030> kicks<00:03:31.430> which<00:03:32.430> is<00:03:32.519> weird

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
still get some kicks which is weird

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.750 
still get some kicks which is weird
because<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.269> warned<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:34.580> like<00:03:35.580> she's

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
because I just warned that like she's

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.190 
because I just warned that like she's
peeing<00:03:36.000> all<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.330> way<00:03:36.420> out<00:03:36.540> here<00:03:36.570> but<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.050> guess

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
peeing all the way out here but I guess

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.050 
peeing all the way out here but I guess
they<00:03:37.350> probably<00:03:37.620> have<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.040> hip<00:03:38.340> turned<00:03:38.820> out<00:03:39.030> a

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
they probably have the hip turned out a

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.270 
they probably have the hip turned out a
little<00:03:39.269> bit<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:39.540> it's<00:03:39.930> sort<00:03:40.799> of<00:03:40.860> kicking<00:03:41.070> out

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
little bit so it's sort of kicking out

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.229 
little bit so it's sort of kicking out
like<00:03:41.459> this<00:03:41.670> maybe<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.299> don't<00:03:43.019> know

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
like this maybe I don't know

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.759 
like this maybe I don't know
now<00:03:45.239> addition<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:45.959> we<00:03:46.200> also<00:03:46.230> have<00:03:46.530> a

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
now addition to that we also have a

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.810 
now addition to that we also have a
point<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.430> rotation<00:03:47.610> here<00:03:48.269> at<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.450> upper<00:03:48.540> hip

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
point of rotation here at the upper hip

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.770 
point of rotation here at the upper hip
then<00:03:50.820> we<00:03:51.060> have<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.500> hinge<00:03:52.500> here<00:03:52.860> at<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.100> knee<00:03:53.780> in

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
then we have a hinge here at the knee in

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.570 
then we have a hinge here at the knee in
addition<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.350> I<00:03:57.350> guess<00:03:58.350> kind<00:03:58.830> of<00:03:58.980> just<00:03:59.220> back

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
addition to a I guess kind of just back

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.000 
addition to a I guess kind of just back
forward<00:04:00.030> motion<00:04:00.420> here<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.810> ankle<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.769> thought

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
forward motion here the ankle I thought

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.160 
forward motion here the ankle I thought
it<00:04:02.160> had<00:04:02.190> an<00:04:02.640> additional<00:04:03.330> point<00:04:03.720> were<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.959> lot<00:04:04.140> of

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
it had an additional point were a lot of

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.840 
it had an additional point were a lot of
rotate<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.680> was<00:04:04.980> probably<00:04:05.340> just<00:04:05.519> getting<00:04:05.790> it

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
rotate I was probably just getting it

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.920 
rotate I was probably just getting it
mixed<00:04:05.970> up<00:04:06.299> with<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.570> hip<00:04:07.610> so<00:04:08.610> yeah<00:04:08.930> decent

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
mixed up with the hip so yeah decent

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.509 
mixed up with the hip so yeah decent
range<00:04:10.110> of<00:04:10.260> motion<00:04:10.650> unfortunately<00:04:11.370> the

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
range of motion unfortunately the

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.400 
range of motion unfortunately the
clothing<00:04:12.030> does<00:04:12.330> somewhat<00:04:12.840> impede<00:04:13.260> the

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
clothing does somewhat impede the

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.719 
clothing does somewhat impede the
character<00:04:13.920> I<00:04:14.239> mean<00:04:15.239> this<00:04:15.360> is<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.780> costume

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
character I mean this is the costume

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.250 
character I mean this is the costume
kind<00:04:17.729> of<00:04:17.820> has<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.000> whole<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.450> Noah<00:04:18.630> vibe<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.229> it

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
kind of has a whole of Noah vibe to it

fighting poses going on this probably

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.640

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
isn't one of them but you know if you

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
I do need to start using these stands

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.170 
I do need to start using these stands
just<00:04:48.930> because<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:49.440> can't<00:04:49.770> pose<00:04:50.220> these<00:04:50.880> things

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
just because you can't pose these things

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.760 
just because you can't pose these things
really<00:04:51.509> well<00:04:51.660> in<00:04:51.750> felt<00:04:52.139> when<00:04:52.380> you're<00:04:52.500> doing

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
really well in felt when you're doing

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.610 
really well in felt when you're doing
this<00:04:52.889> but<00:04:55.820> final<00:04:56.820> thoughts<00:04:57.150> um<00:04:57.660> you<00:04:58.350> know<00:04:58.470> it's

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
this but final thoughts um you know it's

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.090 
this but final thoughts um you know it's
definitely<00:04:59.100> a<00:04:59.130> pretty<00:04:59.490> solid<00:04:59.850> figure<00:05:00.479> I

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
definitely a pretty solid figure I

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.170 
definitely a pretty solid figure I
suppose<00:05:02.100> that<00:05:02.310> fans<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:02.699> the<00:05:02.760> character

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
suppose that fans of the character

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.920 
suppose that fans of the character
probably<00:05:03.690> will<00:05:03.900> like<00:05:04.139> it<00:05:04.350> quite<00:05:04.590> a<00:05:04.620> bit<00:05:05.930> the

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
probably will like it quite a bit the

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.990 
probably will like it quite a bit the
