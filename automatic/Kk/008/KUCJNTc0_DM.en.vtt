favorite foreign one it went out so oh I

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.270 
favorite foreign one it went out so oh I
think<00:01:16.540> I<00:01:16.600> mean<00:01:16.780> concept<00:01:17.170> that<00:01:17.290> its<00:01:17.710> first<00:01:17.950> only

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
think I mean concept that its first only

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.340 
think I mean concept that its first only
hit<00:01:18.399> there's<00:01:18.700> like<00:01:18.899> 12<00:01:19.899> hours<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.970> yeah<00:01:22.270> so<00:01:23.080> I
