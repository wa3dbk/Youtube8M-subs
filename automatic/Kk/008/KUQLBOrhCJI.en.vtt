00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 good these means still did not live well 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.920
 As you already know today, the 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.080
 playstation now and has made the news 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.639
 before but good with little with little 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.710
 because your information now we have 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.830
 quite quite some more things are 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.929
 good other things are bad logically 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.490
 is what he did not have can be good 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.740
 logically uan precision girlfriend you know 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.539
 which will be a kind of service 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.960
 game via streaming with what then 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.420
 good we can play in games of play 1 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.400
 play 2 and play 3 in our playstation 4 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.109
 our playstation 3 on our dam and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.780
 zombie is in the new sony bravia that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.460
 they will take on the tablets and in the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.670
 smartphones with which we can 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.700
 Enjoy any game in our 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.710
 devices that I have said while they are 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.410
 what I said and consoles I've 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.300
 said an accuracy 1 2 and 3 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.120
 that which will make it possible to return good 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.739
 bring the backward compatibility and again 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.399
 which is pretty news 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.739
 good very very very good but bad what 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.059
 bad comes now everything will depend as 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.289
 you know about our connection 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.969
 It will depend on the graphic quality 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.080
 will depend above all on the connection of how 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.510
 see where you 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.080
 in the game when we press a 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.700
 button 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.560
 until it appears on the screen 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.780
 it will also depend on our connection 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.400
 everything will depend on our connection with 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.800
 which is also a point to have 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.110
 very much in mind to consider also 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.060
 that what I have not done before this seems 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.170
 be that we can buy our 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.140
 game separately we can also 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.870
 buy a kind of subscription and that 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.220
 I would need monthly or yearly and try 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.920
 all the games that we want in fact 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.690
 Well, we have a selection of 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.850
 test evidence without paying we can 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.410
 try almost any game during a 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.000
 limited time and good then we can 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.190
 decide if we want to buy it 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.860
 You can forgive my sister's fucking voice 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.450
 that I can just say if 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.510
 buy it or not buy it but good 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.250
 We have enough free tests to 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.290
 test how about the game and if we like or 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.240
 if we do not like the prices yet 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.590
 are fully determined that yes 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.960
 that you do not know about the subscription and 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.990
 yes you know but the prices 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.290
 not yet another important thing 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.290
 is that 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.630
 for now it has only been in the USA only 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.370
 get to get to the closed beta in 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.420
 January and in summer it will officially come out 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.270
 play season 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.830
 for us the place has in Europe not 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.239
 there is nothing confirmed with which it seems 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.370
 be that it will not come to within 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.319
 enough time or it is possible that even 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.230
 come to us because of the difference in 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.640
 connections that we have here you do not already know 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.440
 it's good that there are countries that have more 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.750
 connection or less the least connection in 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.970
 Europe and Spain is not one of those 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.830
 favorable countries that have connection 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.780
 good good good in many places are 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.390
 many points of our country that do not 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.650
 They have fiber optics 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.750
 and which would be a bitch that late 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.110
 It's been a long time coming or not even 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.280
 I would be running horrible and everything 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.910
 the rest because I what I've done 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.910
 many times 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.250
 is this not that these kinds of things are 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.500
 those that make the difference 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.360
 in this generation and things like that 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.520
 not being able to rent games also that 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.440
 we can rent the power the power 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.240
 try any game for free 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.440
 What can we do? 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.190
 We can try any game too 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.530
 the power to subscribe and play thousands and 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.850
 thousands of games that also seems that 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.640
 we can do it yet not know how 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.709
 I say the amount which results 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.780
 pretty good and above all power 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.840
 do it before, for example our mobile 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.490
 our ps vita in our play 3 e 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.820
 even our 4 movie can not play anymore 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.090
 finally to the games of this generation 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:33.180
 as gta 5 for example playing it in 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.100
 pressure 4 which is very good other 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.239
 of the things that people do not know or 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.970
 unknown or does not know directly is that 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.400
 us this works like a live no 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.340
 whether this is a game via streaming or it 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.080
 act is instantaneous had pulsas that 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.670
 want to play this game and play it 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.709
 Instantly you do not need downloads 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.530
 or nothing because what you're seeing is 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.150
 is premiering from another server that 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.970
 squeeze the game for you or you are not 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.470
 you have to do none of this 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.570
 a video you have the description of 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.400
 see it of joy as a devotee 40 in a sony 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.110
 bravia not without the need for a flex 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.160
 finished by style is what 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.230
 we are talking we can not play 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.910
 directly in a sony bravia of the 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.380
 new ones that you are going to draw are and without 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.209
 need any kind of console or 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.100
 be able to play without a console directly 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.440
 to ppl titles in a play 2 and play 3 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.600
 if they already take it out if they already take out games 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.880
 play 4 on this in this precise not so 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.650
 already directly I suppose that people 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.030
 I would not buy precision 4 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.040
 I would directly buy a television 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.570
 these and have a good connection 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.490
 with which I think they are not going to 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.110
 do for now I do not know what happens good 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.330
 when it spends quite a lot of time 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.000
 when they see that there are many televisions 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.400
 of this sony preview because circulating 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.080
 out there but which is not all of this 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.060
 it is quite interesting important 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.620
 let's hope that in microsoft something 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.970
 like something similar to add 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.680
 our compatibility to the team with 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.690
 because it's something that as I say it marks the 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.630
 quite a difference is pretty 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.790
 important for sales in the USA has 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.040
 put a lot that is going to notice the 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.330
 Unlike this I will see many 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.800
 subscriptions are already and will be coming 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
 pretty good is not quite a hit 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.990
 I think a lot of people who are not 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.730
 aware 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.050
 and they think it's silly but 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.759
 I hate that it is very good 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.830
 and good if the prices adapt well 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.360
 it can be totally this 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.550
 incredible to imagine you being able to play without 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.680
 console on our television or in 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.270
 our TV can play in our 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.139
 smartphone if we have a decent line 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.340
 to any crisis game are three 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.319
 pressing always if they are one or 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.069
 this is very big indeed it is very 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:35.900
 well all this will go through our 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:37.190
 sony entertainment network account 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.550
 well we can we can start 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.720
 that account through the psm process or 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.729
 be our play account as the 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.620
 we can start using with that data 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.539
 the sony entertainment network account 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.310
 with which we will not need to make ourselves 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:50.900
 a different account of the theme of trophies 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.860
 and I do not know if he also sends me 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:57.409
 linked to our psn account ok 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.639
 but more or less I guess so, so 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.620
 well nothing else these are all 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.789
 new details but do not leave me any 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.340
 I think that said everything quite 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:06.379
 detailed I hope I do not leave any if 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.990
 I have said it if you have not said more things than 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.699
 you do not know or I do not know it at least and 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.800
 as I say you have a video those that have 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:15.669
 to go see it and nothing else in the 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.669
 next video will be next
