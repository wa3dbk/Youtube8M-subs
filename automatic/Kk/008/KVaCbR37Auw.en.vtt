00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.599
 competition of the season 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:12.999
 of the 100 bill 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.889
 which in the competition also won from Geleen 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.119
 in the belgian herentals 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.090
 Saturday night in the uithof it was the turn of the Amsterdam service at the 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.089
 heart rate bank 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.089
 nevertheless things went differently 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.679
 Saturday evening of 700 supporters in the grandstand in Eindhoven 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.820
 Amsterdam 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.839
 came to visit when traveling the first chance in the first period beforehand as you 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:38.740
 today's goalkeeper red 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.090
 then still 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.880
 few minutes later 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.720
 but on the loose but behind the goal 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.610
 and that's pretty a day off on which so left with the email we expect a will 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.670
 it arrived in the fifth minute 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.230
 in the first period he severely punished the Amsterdam ones 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.870
 had nothing to say 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.420
 occasionally the Amsterdammers tried to get out 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.450
 every time the hague defense stood by 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.660
 well stop the work of this and this type of rosso 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.660
 eat more constantly can intercept on behalf of the hagen defense 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.720
 we don't know how to wake up an animal 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.890
 Attack from Amsterdam It's easy to get rid of sheep Jordaan 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.890
 what the outage of home 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.090
 disease free 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.050
 the pavert wet which is more radiation bolt for short of just beside he hit the 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.820
 club just not tasty 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.410
 a few minutes later it was hit 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.350
 that attack from backwards 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.300
 good boss and there is levi houkes 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.290
 wonderful and welcoming 0 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.900
 and it is well deserved 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.900
 a he did not let it there he just shoots 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.200
 the first line of heijster on the ice 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.340
 pig blue line back to x indexes and use the free and campos with 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.160
 the 3 0 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.510
 the first goal of the Canadian on behalf of his new employer 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.010
 and the first period was not yet over 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.310
 poor jasper that bloody from dune bloody from amsterdam 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.090
 kept attacking the Amsterdam goal 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.260
 not if you put that with the 4 0 well laid out by his countrymen 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.830
 petty 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.089
 that forest like that 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.989
 Deck Amsterdam the first to give him anything at all well at the end today 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.669
 from the first period the power play situation number of attacks on the target 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:22.639
 from the slowaken thomas pack 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.449
 he kept his goal clean 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.449
 4 0 after the first period 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.609
 journey was in the first two the period until supreme also he was a good one 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.789
 chance for the Amsterdammers but Kelvin is sufficient 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:36.329
 a bit later 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.620
 ronald wurm how well the publisher of stevie from out of reach with 6 0 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.060
 five dolphins previously made by Jaap Wet 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.659
 but that is the 6 0 and 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.659
 a very clear victory is taking place 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.829
 rafael so deep good solo 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.959
 7 0 it is now going very fast at the start of the second period 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.639
 and that was the signal for coach Alexander Selivanov 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.679
 the keeper also hopes to change 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:04.879
 fabian dish replaces the slovak thomas dekker 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.480
 fabian dish last year still has second keeper behind in effect is not 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.029
 kill the second keeper of ajax 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:12.189
 but is unlucky 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.439
 the powerplay situation for the Amsterdammers is the seven one 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.629
 file cross 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.629
 he was completely free the favelas big joke 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:25.199
 fox supreme 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.349
 the man did not relocate the second period, the squatters this one 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.559
 Berkum just next 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:33.729
 at the end of the second period, hague goals were scored 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.589
 radboud jolie nine one 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:41.569
 always ask me to follow a partner this is already the empty event 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.679
 With this state he comes up to the third period 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:46.980
 take it easy 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.180
 the first ten minutes there was not much entertainment a good chance of it all 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.180
 case of Amsterdam but goalie shot came on the table 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:57.759
 and after the idea of ​​maikel of no goals machine running there who is it 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.399
 Jan Jaap wet who forgets about oil cartel notes 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.409
 Amsterdam became despondent by not starting anything 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.219
 coach ron berteling from amsterdam chooses questions such as how 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:12.219
 for the Amsterdam defense was as leaky as a basket 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.590
 Hoofddorp at the new building from the back 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.489
 12 to one 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.099
 incredible punishment for the Amsterdammers 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.809
 it would even become bad 

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:24.809
 in the end it became 14 against one 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.750
 because of this victory he is three points ahead of the competition 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.940
 and with that the frontrunner has approached the friesland flyers to one point 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.939
 this year performs in turin 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:36.219
 Is not fun 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:40.289
 that is nice it is of course very different than always works hard no the 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.789
 Sport four goals in the first period, and follow the lead 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.399
 at a fast pace continue to agree with 14 if we were also exact 

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:50.980
 become a new respect like a rocket 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.080
 we played well so important yes that is easy but the 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.279
 boys played really well and 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:01.870
 the German that was an easy game but above all problems 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.180
 jada tigers goes robert m 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.330
 he himself played 2 3 6 2 nice game 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.039
 every match was the second match to my line with at campos and the 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:11.900
 first set 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.100
 she takes an unusual with jolie and to yes that a week trained and hoisted together 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.680
 i went well and can find each other well we understand each other one that is 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.559
 also important 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:21.729
 for yourself too 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.930
 three goals yes a rubber goals we worry 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.639
 also nice always nice first goal 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.199
 that's why you come to Eindhoven from them very funny, he destroyed 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.569
 what do you think of the ten 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.629
 I think the team all have new guys so maybe already once 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:38.319
 good 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:42.340
 This makes the competition more work than we might want to go a step higher 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:44.370
 an evening with this year 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.310
 and then that is a whole lot different if eindhoven de tu eindhoven has whole 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.430
 many dutch boys you were a little goldman yourself 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.990
 and yes with this 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.669
 thereafter are several but we can all do well with each other then too 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:57.669
 supports 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.099
 the cell of tilborg of the subscribers comes out at the prices 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:02.589
 moreover, the tone 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:04.310
 it is different on participation 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.350
 and yet young people in that way were beasts older teenagers 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.740
 central reservation and the door 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.460
 also my expectations 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.069
 the fifth game before he died five times win 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:15.629
 a nice start to the season 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:20.219
 yes very nice the killing twice won tilburg come out pqr in 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:23.800
 I soon had to get used to it, but heinons were frying that paper 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.800
 expressions 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.650
 but yes it goes so well that they will get used to it tomorrow and then I think one 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.509
 very important weekend at heerenveen at home are eindhoven from the man he 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.619
 Looked at that Friday against Heerenveen were actually standing 

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:39.159
 Have you ever talked to each other with this season's ambition 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:43.669
 there is now known in total the ron berteling scale grabbed the cup and grab 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:44.740
 became champions 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.169
 we are on the right track to parents the line we must continue 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.319
 van marwijk de min I am happy after everything wins
