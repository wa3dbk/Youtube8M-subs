the kids they look at what we do and how
we<00:04:46.860> do<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.400> so<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.300> most<00:04:48.449> important<00:04:49.080> thing<00:04:49.139> is

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
we do it so the most important thing is

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.469 
we do it so the most important thing is
that<00:04:49.860> we<00:04:50.039> should<00:04:50.070> teach<00:04:50.430> them<00:04:50.699> that<00:04:50.820> sport<00:04:51.240> is

not the only important thing they have

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.750 
not the only important thing they have
to<00:04:54.479> study<00:04:54.720> as<00:04:54.900> well<00:04:55.080> grow<00:04:55.800> up<00:04:55.979> and<00:04:56.160> work<00:04:56.520> for

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
to study as well grow up and work for

to study as well grow up and work for
their<00:04:56.880> future<00:04:57.330> not<00:04:58.289> all<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.680> them<00:04:58.770> are<00:04:58.889> going

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
their future not all of them are going

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.800 
their future not all of them are going
to<00:04:59.250> be<00:04:59.370> lucky<00:04:59.669> enough<00:04:59.760> to<00:05:00.060> play<00:05:00.150> football<00:05:00.479> like

to be lucky enough to play football like

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.200 
to be lucky enough to play football like
us<00:05:01.050> because<00:05:02.039> it's<00:05:02.190> very<00:05:02.340> difficult<00:05:02.880> to<00:05:03.060> make

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
us because it's very difficult to make

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.200 
us because it's very difficult to make
it<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:04.470> why<00:05:04.650> they<00:05:04.860> try<00:05:05.190> they<00:05:05.789> should<00:05:05.970> never

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
it so why they try they should never

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.409 
it so why they try they should never
give<00:05:06.570> up<00:05:06.720> on<00:05:06.840> their<00:05:06.990> studies<00:05:08.000> but<00:05:09.000> I<00:05:09.030> give<00:05:09.270> in

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
give up on their studies but I give in

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.080 
give up on their studies but I give in
that<00:05:09.599> law<00:05:09.750> I<00:05:09.780> don't<00:05:10.440> know<00:05:10.710> how<00:05:10.949> allowed<00:05:11.250> us<00:05:11.550> to

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
that law I don't know how allowed us to

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:25.990 
that law I don't know how allowed us to
do

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.080 

so<00:05:27.000> we<00:05:27.450> run<00:05:27.660> 32<00:05:28.230> different<00:05:28.650> projects<00:05:29.090> across

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
so we run 32 different projects across

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.040 
so we run 32 different projects across
five<00:05:30.390> different<00:05:30.420> themes<00:05:31.610> ranging<00:05:32.610> from

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
five different themes ranging from

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.450 
five different themes ranging from
programs<00:05:34.050> that<00:05:34.200> focus<00:05:34.440> on<00:05:34.740> learning<00:05:34.920> through

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
programs that focus on learning through

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.370 
programs that focus on learning through
football<00:05:35.940> so<00:05:36.150> using<00:05:36.450> the<00:05:36.540> club<00:05:36.720> as<00:05:36.810> an<00:05:36.900> example

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
football so using the club as an example

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.230 
football so using the club as an example
to<00:05:37.530> teach<00:05:37.710> kids<00:05:38.040> whether<00:05:38.700> that<00:05:38.910> be<00:05:39.060> about

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
to teach kids whether that be about

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.930 
to teach kids whether that be about
literacy<00:05:39.690> or<00:05:39.990> numeracy<00:05:40.020> or<00:05:40.740> Spanish<00:05:41.610> as<00:05:41.760> we've

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.310 
done today and to business
qualifications<00:05:44.850> and<00:05:45.480> then<00:05:45.750> we<00:05:45.840> run<00:05:45.990> a<00:05:46.050> range

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
qualifications and then we run a range
