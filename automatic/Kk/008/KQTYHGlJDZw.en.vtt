worried<00:00:11.910> about<00:00:12.420> them<00:00:13.130> the<00:00:14.130> first<00:00:14.370> episode

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
worried about them the first episode

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.529 
worried about them the first episode
frankly<00:00:15.740> because<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.100> very<00:00:17.539> complicated

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
frankly because it was very complicated

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.910 
frankly because it was very complicated
and<00:00:19.250> hit<00:00:20.250> or<00:00:20.400> miss<00:00:20.630> and<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.619> think<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
and hit or miss and so the I think the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.800 
and hit or miss and so the I think the
silver<00:00:23.220> lining<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.730> leak<00:00:24.060> was<00:00:25.369> we<00:00:26.539> got<00:00:27.539> to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
silver lining of the leak was we got to

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.450 
silver lining of the leak was we got to
see<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.650> was<00:00:28.769> sort<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.160> soft

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
see the it was sort of like a soft

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.410 
see the it was sort of like a soft
rollout<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.710> I<00:00:31.710> mean<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.059> other<00:00:33.090> make

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
rollout and so I mean and the other make

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.700 
rollout and so I mean and the other make
part<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> mixed<00:00:33.899> blessing<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.500> that

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
part of the mixed blessing is just that

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.010

want your show that bad then it's like
that<00:00:39.780> your<00:00:39.899> trucks<00:00:40.140> are<00:00:40.290> being<00:00:40.440> hijacked<00:00:40.770> on

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
that your trucks are being hijacked on

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.000 
that your trucks are being hijacked on
the<00:00:41.040> way<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.000> city<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.829> mean

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
the way to the to the city so so I mean

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.750 
the way to the to the city so so I mean
that's<00:00:44.750> good<00:00:45.750> morning<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.410> guess<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.670> I

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that's good morning I guess but and I

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.819 
that's good morning I guess but and I
think<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.090> only<00:00:48.270> downside<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.930> Justin

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
think the only downside is that Justin

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.010 
think the only downside is that Justin
like<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.430> still<00:00:50.730> working<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.149> yeah<00:00:51.629> so

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
like is still working on that yeah so

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.979 
like is still working on that yeah so
maybe<00:00:52.530> fix<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.480> still<00:00:54.480> there's<00:00:54.660> still<00:00:54.840> like

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
maybe fix it still there's still like

those versions no other copies had those
words<00:01:43.590> believe<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.190> so<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.330> first<00:01:45.600> thing<00:01:45.720> one

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960

it

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
it

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.820 
it
what<00:03:11.690> about<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.379> I<00:03:14.379> think<00:03:15.379> it<00:03:15.590> would<00:03:15.709> have

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
what about so I think it would have

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.809 
what about so I think it would have
because<00:03:16.129> it<00:03:16.220> would<00:03:16.340> have<00:03:16.430> just<00:03:16.459> been<00:03:16.610> like

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
because it would have just been like

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.809 
because it would have just been like
okay<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:17.360> is<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.840> kid<00:03:18.349> wakes<00:03:18.560> up<00:03:18.799> in<00:03:18.980> bed<00:03:19.190> and

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
okay this is the kid wakes up in bed and

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.820 
okay this is the kid wakes up in bed and
then<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:20.959> would<00:03:21.049> have<00:03:21.140> just<00:03:21.290> gone<00:03:21.409> grand<00:03:21.680> theft

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
then it would have just gone grand theft

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.460 
then it would have just gone grand theft
yeah<00:03:22.400> yeah<00:03:22.610> ill<00:03:23.360> I<00:03:23.480> usually<00:03:23.810> like<00:03:23.930> punched<00:03:24.349> his

the backyard head ultimately it makes

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.880 
the backyard head ultimately it makes
things<00:03:54.920> worse<00:03:55.280> or<00:03:55.670> harder<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.470> think<00:03:57.470> I<00:03:57.590> think<00:03:57.769> I

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
things worse or harder I think I think I

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.430 
things worse or harder I think I think I
think<00:03:57.950> well<00:03:58.670> received<00:03:59.150> or<00:03:59.329> not<00:03:59.569> the<00:04:00.109> actual

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
think well received or not the actual

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.500 
think well received or not the actual
problem<00:04:00.890> I<00:04:01.220> think<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.519> well-received<00:04:02.090> part

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
problem I think the well-received part

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.569 
problem I think the well-received part
the<00:04:02.780> popularity<00:04:03.230> part<00:04:03.590> is<00:04:03.680> actually<00:04:03.829> that<00:04:04.549> I

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
the popularity part is actually that I

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.759 
the popularity part is actually that I
think<00:04:04.879> that<00:04:04.970> helped<00:04:05.269> us<00:04:05.450> relax<00:04:06.109> and<00:04:06.530> have<00:04:06.739> fun

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769
