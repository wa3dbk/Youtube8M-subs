00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.570
 hello everyone is steven and we're 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.309
 found today in this news 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.050
 video for me to present you a dock 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.150
 for apple watch if you have the chance 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.610
 to get an idea of ​​the spiegel brand 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.020
 since apple watch is available that 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.270
 was several months looking for a 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.580
 good doc to introduce you and I wanted 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.900
 really to show you this one so to 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.460
 inside the box we find a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.420
 small leaflet is 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.820
 really quite simple what we will have 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.170
 deal you will see and then we have the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.399
 dock here it is so we will remove the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.759
 little protective films that we are 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.440
 above 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.630
 so you see it's all in 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.190
 self-contained aluminum on the part 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.660
 black where will be placed the charger of 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.430
 the apple watch and on the bottom you see 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.630
 we have small anti-slip 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.850
 although they hold up on the 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.379
 table to put all that in place it's 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.820
 really super simple you are passing 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.950
 the search cable of your apple 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.320
 watch by the hole and set you well 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.969
 like that on the top the part that 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.320
 will serve to place your apple watch you 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.510
 of course, put it on the top 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.219
 otherwise it will not work so that's it 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.780
 30 seconds chrono that's all 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.010
 simple and if you ever go in 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.600
 holidays for example and you have 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.219
 need the cable you can remove it 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.200
 so here once everything is in place 

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.369
 you can take off your apple watch and 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.380
 put it on this dock 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.939
 she will be there in front of you thanks to 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.229
 the good inclination she could also 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.729
 recharge these practices 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.679
 so it's really simple as 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.119
 doc but it makes it do you place it 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.920
 on your desk when you finish 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.659
 your day you place your apple there 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.979
 watch to recharge it or any 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.990
 just to have your notifications 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.939
 face you on your desk when you 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.289
 are sitting I really wanted to you 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.759
 present this model ci because 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:29.999
 now there are none 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.919
 wrong 

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:34.079
 and most importantly they all do more or less 

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:36.270
 the same thing with this one you have 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.889
 the essential it is good to seize on 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.389
 your table thanks to anti slip that 

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.979
 you have below you are sure 

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:42.990
 when you put it on your apple 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.299
 watch will not move and since it has 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.859
 does everything in one piece 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.419
 he will go perfectly with the others 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.729
 apple accessories that you may have 

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:51.749
 at home like for example my doc I 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.759
 find that having an aluminum support 

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:54.959
 it's something really classy 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.219
 and that's why I wanted to 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.669
 to talk to you about this rather than 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.009
 other 

00:01:56.669 --> 00:02:00.749
 but there are also plastic ones in 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.789
 wood you will find them a little bit 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:03.209
 cheaper than the one that costs 25 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.979
 euros 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.799
 but most aluminum docks 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.179
 costs in the 50 70 euros and especially 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.989
 as I told you they serve all 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.069
 to the same thing 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.409
 put your world 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.090
 so avoid paying too much 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.560
 link of this one in descriptions of 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.030
 videos so tell me what you in 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.019
 have thought and I tell you to very 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.010
 soon for a next 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.010
