00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.670
 Nine people I am after the rally and 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.099
 welcome to another 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.820
 little commentary this time alone 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.710
 further hallway 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.130
 and before I actually go to the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.780
 real topic of this fight come 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.490
 I would like to take a quick look at the gameplay 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.619
 go in for a relatively rare and 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.160
 Although I'm getting pretty in the beginning 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.480
 wear with time but after that 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.980
 the sniper will change that already 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.460
 So you always rock a bit 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:34.380
 cleaning layer extra power everything at the start 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.480
 So I'll tell you so much about the gameplay 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.980
 I hope you like that a bit 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.230
 so in the beginning so far only 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.059
 boring for you but after that goes 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.040
 then better is first one 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.649
 Giant score but I'm also straight 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.879
 only come back to the 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.890
 is gaming community that is the true 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.390
 not yet mature and I have mine 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.620
 not too much time now 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.610
 for the gameplay taken because at 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.379
 me always a little bit more in the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.789
 background is the knowledge most 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.680
 I think so 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.840
 yes and now actually a topic and 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.110
 Although I had just colleagues with me and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.040
 He then counted me from Zambia is one 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.659
 certain leon maxi did and that 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.760
 who pays actually should first 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.590
 have a look with our link later 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.850
 cleverly 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.670
 yes and I have to ten minutes 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.939
 looked at in the video is just a guy 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.590
 who then goes to a homeless man 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.580
 and content-only times as a bit 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.380
 says sonja what is his name take it 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.240
 that's just how it works out 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.329
 not really great is not so 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.369
 The industry is homeless and then 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.729
 meant this guy made the video 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.170
 had the lottery hold of it 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.509
 if we have the man for a nice day 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.090
 will make whether salons white as bright as 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.540
 about what do you think was still one 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.470
 a bit confused and the whole 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.390
 surely i will put the video in the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.800
 description partner in any case 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.590
 It's definitely worth it, too 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.210
 to look at the workshop 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.900
 Homeless people grabbed us with it in 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.280
 Rainer bought the clothes and then 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.290
 You can see them at home at the dining table 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.790
 He always has the showers to eat 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.520
 taken along with at the with the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.380
 Barber still with the hairdresser 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.180
 I am still quite looked at by this 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.270
 video really touching so check you on 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.230
 in any case 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.570
 yes I do not want too much 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.489
 really tell what it really is 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.340
 My colleague has been funny as I said it 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.700
 will definitely and yes it is 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.840
 really hard and maybe completely 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.090
 Let's talk to you a little bit about it 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.910
 that yes if you might win 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.530
 Homeless came back and asked 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.470
 you spend your money on me if he wants it 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.239
 always makes it necessary because I have to 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.950
 I honestly admit I do it very much 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.269
 Rare 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.570
 I still can not stand it and 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.160
 they arrive that way and then stop 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.700
 always extremely disabled 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.290
 show off whether with it as succumbing 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.120
 I was actually pretty common 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.970
 to call street musicians even if they are 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.440
 always play very well with me 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.000
 got a gear who makes something for it 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.130
 he tries it out for a bit 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.329
 Also stop what to do that money too 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.489
 get and then I'm still 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:09.570
 often yes but I think that I am 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.280
 personally not that much 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.510
 yes, give it why is it so me 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.000
 One has the child of parents 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.890
 So a homeless guy came along 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.160
 more are also mali give to the master 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.989
 came as not always you can the case 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.700
 yes but the purchase is likely 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.590
 but only alcohol for it and maybe 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.150
 should one then you could always 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.459
 that you really have the money 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.829
 give and have on one side 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.390
 of course also on the right and many think 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.420
 the homeless will be what we money 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.520
 then they also give for alcohol 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.930
 consume 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.070
 but I had it for example 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.320
 maybe they just made that 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.380
 once a month or so then so im 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.330
 Place for loose as what gifts like 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.080
 always and that he does not 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.450
 give money but actually 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.190
 helicopter the grinder actually 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.260
 then yes I do not know in the bun or 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.530
 just something small to eat 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:08.240
 maybe a pack of gripping fruit 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:10.010
 or bread or something like that me 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.810
 find that would be a case in it that's yes 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.580
 Also ge here multi as 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.930
 line 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.370
 there is also ensured that just 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.520
 It's not about alcohol then that is 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.320
 keep his life safe and yes 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.800
 maybe just get that one yourself 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.200
 that one day a simple good one 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.090
 piece should not always have to be around 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.250
 Go or measure money is material 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.260
 but maybe just nice too 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.150
 He does not have to be a homeless man either 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.910
 maybe somehow the intern of the 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.320
 new intern at the store opposite the 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.550
 then uncertain bar is so 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.300
 maybe just once friendly to the 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.110
 should be 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.640
 yes, what I was the nice day somehow 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.850
 like this 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.670
 I mean I have seen so many times where 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.020
 I also thought so yes 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.580
 goes to for it is a 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.900
 homeless in the train stop bed 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.850
 it's always a bit gone 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.370
 annoying it is to but then there's just 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.180
 also often just older people theirs 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.410
 Because of that, they complain 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.120
 actually form all is in the train 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.660
 also to make the road also 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.550
 throw 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.740
 I once experienced that and was there 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.480
 I already pretty 42 these people in 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.670
 a plight and that's what they do then 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.800
 we can already check it out 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.120
 in my opinion but there you can 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.200
 Let me tell the chamber what you think about it 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.700
 So, I think I would be a bit too 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.850
 that he might call one 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.320
 little bit on the edge of the plate 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.840
 Looks I'll be in 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.220
 make future as well because it too 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.380
 I find a lot going on in life 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.770
 had luck and just in the medium 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:44.420
 you do not know if it's true he thinks 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:46.100
 now he has said he would have stopped 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.720
 had work as a carpenter and then 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.300
 If they had something to tell bend 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.500
 winter break again been homeless and 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.630
 no idea and just live here 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.680
 almost 31 more dangerous but nervous 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.630
 the rings beat yes so you can yes 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.640
