00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.230
 plus a square sheet in half 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.380
 open there and then alas in the other 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.380
 meaning 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.750
 open there went back there 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.270
 fold diagonally 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.390
 fold diagonally in the other 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.390
 meaning 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.160
 then folded there like this to get 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.160
 a triangle 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.130
 now you have to pay this part in 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.130
 along this line 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.090
 fold on the other side on the mark that 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.090
 you have just created to mark the case 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.930
 once these parties have limits and there are 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.320
 again the tip of the top like 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.320
 this 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.920
 then slide there for this line 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.920
 in the continuity of the brand 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.880
 then directly the other side over 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.880
 like this 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.730
 lift this part 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.120
 then folded this side on this fold 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.349
 this will create the fin that goes beyond 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.349
 right here 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.540
 then and on the other side so as to 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.250
 get a fin coming out of 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.610
 the other side the same size as the 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.610
 first 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.069
 you have to get this form 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.920
 now who is this part as much 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.750
 as possible as these then 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.080
 folded in the other direction until this 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.080
 part 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.610
 then slightly slipped the fold for 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.189
 let the tip pass like these 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.189
 which is perpendicular to this side 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.820
 you have to do the third fins 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.290
 folded in the other direction and slip the 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.400
 fold until this part is 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.400
 parallel to that one 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.849
 now you have to do the same thing 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:02.040
 on the other side the seven parties to 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:04.370
 maximum foot in the opposite direction up 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.370
 the brand 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.690
 plunder the tip down by trying 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.020
 to get the same length as the other 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.020
 side 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.440
 now you have to do the head 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.210
 then this part a first time towards 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.210
 the bottom 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.470
 then fold upwards leaving a 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.470
 space 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.350
 it is only necessary to finalize the carapace 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.080
 to finish your turtle origami 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.970
 sea â€‹â€‹for that we must fold the two 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.139
 small lateral tips under the shell 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.139
 like this
