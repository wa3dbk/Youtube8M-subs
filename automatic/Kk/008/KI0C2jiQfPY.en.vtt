so<00:00:17.580> come<00:00:18.030> on<00:00:18.150> inside<00:00:21.199> today<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.619> are<00:00:22.650> going<00:00:22.890> to

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
so come on inside today we are going to

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.950 
so come on inside today we are going to
be<00:00:23.099> talking<00:00:23.279> about<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.970> convergent<00:00:24.630> design

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
be talking about the convergent design

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.620 
be talking about the convergent design

couple of the features that this box
offers<00:00:29.849> us<00:00:30.210> but<00:00:30.750> basically<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> portable

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
offers us but basically it is a portable

what<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.820> offers<00:00:45.300> us<00:00:45.450> as<00:00:45.600> far<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> benefit

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
what this offers us as far as a benefit

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.500 
what this offers us as far as a benefit
to<00:00:46.379> our<00:00:46.559> production<00:00:46.920> or<00:00:47.460> editing<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.120> we're

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
to our production or editing is we're

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.100 
to our production or editing is we're
bypassing<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.320> internal<00:00:50.010> compression<00:00:50.789> on

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
bypassing the internal compression on

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.040 
bypassing the internal compression on
for<00:00:52.110> example<00:00:52.199> rh<00:00:52.770> DV<00:00:53.190> cameras<00:00:53.820> or<00:00:54.059> even<00:00:54.809> our

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
for example rh DV cameras or even our

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.410 
for example rh DV cameras or even our
xdcam<00:00:55.800> cameras<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.609> allowing<00:00:57.030> us<00:00:57.239> to

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
xdcam cameras and it's allowing us to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.709 
xdcam cameras and it's allowing us to
take<00:00:57.989> advantage<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.980> cameras<00:00:59.489> chips<00:01:00.480> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
take advantage of the cameras chips and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.150 
take advantage of the cameras chips and
what<00:01:00.809> they're<00:01:00.960> actually<00:01:01.079> capable<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.800> doing

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
what they're actually capable of doing

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.009

and the optics and everything we're

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.960 
and the optics and everything we're
avoiding<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.680> heavy<00:01:04.920> compression<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.850> is

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
avoiding the heavy compression that is

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.360 
avoiding the heavy compression that is
inherent<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.510> any<00:01:06.780> onboard<00:01:07.530> recording<00:01:08.040> system

camera<00:01:12.230> for<00:01:13.230> example<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:14.010> now<00:01:14.250> go<00:01:14.790> from<00:01:15.060> a

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
camera for example we can now go from a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
its mpeg-2 compression on this but

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.590 
its mpeg-2 compression on this but
because<00:01:26.160> we<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.550> that<00:01:27.440> flexibility<00:01:28.440> in<00:01:28.770> our

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
because we have that flexibility in our

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.290 
because we have that flexibility in our
bitrate<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.870> allows<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:32.070> better<00:01:33.060> picture

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
bitrate it allows for a better picture

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.030 
bitrate it allows for a better picture
at<00:01:33.480> the<00:01:33.600> end<00:01:33.690> of<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.870> day<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.230> ran<00:01:34.500> some<00:01:34.710> tests

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
at the end of the day we ran some tests

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.310 
at the end of the day we ran some tests
and<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.310> does<00:01:35.520> make<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.850> difference<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:37.020> for

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
and it does make a difference so for

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.460 
and it does make a difference so for
example<00:01:37.730> hdv<00:01:38.730> which<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.390> lot<00:01:39.660> of<00:01:39.690> us<00:01:39.870> shoot<00:01:40.200> to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
example hdv which a lot of us shoot to

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.880 
example hdv which a lot of us shoot to
is<00:01:41.400> an<00:01:41.670> MPEG<00:01:42.090> 2<00:01:42.300> 25<00:01:42.840> megabit<00:01:43.290> compression

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
is an MPEG 2 25 megabit compression

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.120 
is an MPEG 2 25 megabit compression
which<00:01:44.550> is<00:01:45.000> does<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> great<00:01:46.290> job<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.560> what<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.010> is

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
which is does a great job for what it is

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.610 
which is does a great job for what it is
but<00:01:47.690> sometimes<00:01:48.690> we<00:01:48.840> end<00:01:48.870> up<00:01:49.050> with<00:01:49.080> mosquito

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
but sometimes we end up with mosquito

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.060 
but sometimes we end up with mosquito
noise<00:01:49.830> hi<00:01:50.190> motion<00:01:51.320> scenes<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.710> end<00:01:52.980> up

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
noise hi motion scenes can end up

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.440 
noise hi motion scenes can end up
getting<00:01:53.280> blocking<00:01:53.790> because<00:01:54.030> there's<00:01:54.180> not

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
getting blocking because there's not

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.630 
getting blocking because there's not
enough<00:01:54.800> bitstream<00:01:55.800> there's<00:01:56.130> now<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.430> our

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
enough bitstream there's now that our

compression<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.040> what<00:01:59.160> they<00:01:59.280> call<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.490> so

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
compression is what they call that so

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.600 
compression is what they call that so
the<00:02:00.750> Nano<00:02:00.960> flash<00:02:01.410> allows<00:02:01.800> us<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.160> bypass<00:02:02.550> that
