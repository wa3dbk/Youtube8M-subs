hey<00:00:00.659> guys<00:00:00.900> this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.199> fuzzy<00:00:01.589> crafter<00:00:02.040> and<00:00:02.310> I

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
hey guys this is fuzzy crafter and I

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.770 
hey guys this is fuzzy crafter and I
want<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.790> share<00:00:03.000> with<00:00:03.179> you<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.389> cool<00:00:03.750> new

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
want to share with you a cool new

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.079 
want to share with you a cool new
redstone<00:00:04.140> concept<00:00:04.890> that<00:00:05.640> I've<00:00:05.790> been<00:00:05.940> looking

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
redstone concept that I've been looking

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.610 
redstone concept that I've been looking
at<00:00:06.420> recently<00:00:06.450> after<00:00:07.109> they<00:00:07.319> were<00:00:07.379> playing

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
at recently after they were playing

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.400 
at recently after they were playing
around<00:00:07.859> now<00:00:08.760> here<00:00:09.240> we<00:00:09.389> have<00:00:09.599> three<00:00:09.929> circuits

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
around now here we have three circuits

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.080 
around now here we have three circuits
we<00:00:10.620> have<00:00:10.740> this<00:00:10.920> lapis<00:00:11.160> surface<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.910> gold

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
we have this lapis surface the gold

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.480 
we have this lapis surface the gold
circuit<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.780> diamond<00:00:13.139> circuit<00:00:13.559> fairly

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
circuit and the diamond circuit fairly

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.890 
circuit and the diamond circuit fairly
simple<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.120> pull<00:00:15.389> one<00:00:15.599> lever<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:17.240> we<00:00:18.240> get<00:00:18.570> the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
simple you pull one lever and we get the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.779 
simple you pull one lever and we get the
respected<00:00:19.410> output<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.010> pull<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.400> gold<00:00:20.580> lever

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
respected output so pull the gold lever

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.910 
respected output so pull the gold lever
get<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.539> gold<00:00:21.720> output<00:00:22.080> same<00:00:22.380> would<00:00:22.650> obviously

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
get the gold output same would obviously

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.849 
get the gold output same would obviously
happen<00:00:23.460> for<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.910> diamond<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.600> lapis<00:00:24.859> now

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
happen for the diamond and the lapis now

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.120 
happen for the diamond and the lapis now
if<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:27.060> had<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.810> lot<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.199> different<00:00:28.470> circuits

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
if you had a lot of different circuits

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.519 
if you had a lot of different circuits
and<00:00:29.340> they<00:00:29.580> ran<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:30.150> long<00:00:30.480> way<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.109> you're<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
and they ran a long way and you're in a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.170 
and they ran a long way and you're in a
survival<00:00:32.070> world<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.669> want<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.910> conserve

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
survival world and you want to conserve

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.840 
survival world and you want to conserve
on<00:00:33.360> redstone<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.079> really<00:00:34.829> useful<00:00:35.100> concept

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
on redstone a really useful concept

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.389 
on redstone a really useful concept
would<00:00:36.059> be<00:00:36.239> sending<00:00:36.960> multiple<00:00:37.500> signals<00:00:38.219> in

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
would be sending multiple signals in

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.910 
would be sending multiple signals in
this<00:00:38.489> case<00:00:38.730> three<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.170> wire<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.770> that's

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
this case three with one wire and that's

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.590 
this case three with one wire and that's
exactly<00:00:41.430> what<00:00:41.550> I've<00:00:41.670> done<00:00:41.700> here<00:00:42.180> as<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.570> can

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
exactly what I've done here as you can

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.410 
exactly what I've done here as you can
see<00:00:42.750> all<00:00:43.290> three<00:00:43.890> circuits<00:00:44.789> share<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> same

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
see all three circuits share the same

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.080 
see all three circuits share the same
redstone<00:00:45.840> wire<00:00:46.190> they<00:00:47.190> use<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> same<00:00:47.670> number

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
redstone wire they use the same number

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.569 
redstone wire they use the same number
of<00:00:48.120> repeaters<00:00:48.570> as<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.430> not

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
of repeaters as you can see so it's not

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.639 
of repeaters as you can see so it's not
like<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.030> need<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.329> spend<00:00:51.570> more<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.500> that

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
like you need to spend more in that

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.250 
like you need to spend more in that
respect<00:00:53.129> every<00:00:54.090> 15<00:00:54.449> blocks<00:00:54.690> you'll<00:00:55.050> need<00:00:55.199> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
respect every 15 blocks you'll need to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.959 
respect every 15 blocks you'll need to
have<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.649> these<00:00:55.800> stations<00:00:56.129> which<00:00:56.670> I'll<00:00:56.820> go

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
have one of these stations which I'll go

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.330 
have one of these stations which I'll go
into<00:00:57.000> more<00:00:57.390> detail<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.020> future<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.680> then

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
into more detail in the future and then

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.099 
into more detail in the future and then
at<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> very<00:00:59.730> end<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.420> your<00:01:00.480> line<00:01:00.750> you'll<00:01:01.079> have

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
at the very end of your line you'll have

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.110 
at the very end of your line you'll have
one<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.710> these<00:01:01.859> decoders<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.670> guess<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.940> could

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
one of these decoders I guess you could

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.299 
one of these decoders I guess you could
call<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.329> which<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.260> 2<00:01:04.439> XOR<00:01:04.739> gates<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
call it which is just 2 XOR gates and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.899 
call it which is just 2 XOR gates and
I'll<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.390> more<00:01:06.630> into<00:01:06.689> detail<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.159> in

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
I'll get more into detail with that in

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.710 
I'll get more into detail with that in
the<00:01:09.210> future<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:11.070> works<00:01:11.430> similarly<00:01:12.360> you

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the future so this works similarly you

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.390 
the future so this works similarly you
pull<00:01:13.020> say<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:14.280> gold<00:01:14.610> lever<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:16.130> over<00:01:17.130> here

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
pull say the gold lever and over here

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.370 
pull say the gold lever and over here
you<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.729> see<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.360> receive<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.140> gold

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
you can see that we receive the gold

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.649 
you can see that we receive the gold
output<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.920> only<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> gold<00:01:20.460> output<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.420> same

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
output and only the gold output the same

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.640 
output and only the gold output the same
works<00:01:21.990> for<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.799> diamond<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:25.020> lapis<00:01:25.439> as

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
works for the diamond and the lapis as

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.990 
works for the diamond and the lapis as
I'll<00:01:25.860> show<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.070> now<00:01:27.380> lapis<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.700> see

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
I'll show you now lapis as you can see

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.609 
I'll show you now lapis as you can see
all<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.750> way<00:01:30.840> down<00:01:30.869> there<00:01:31.759> and<00:01:33.079> lastly<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
all the way down there and lastly the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.620 
all the way down there and lastly the
diamond<00:01:36.619> this<00:01:37.619> takes<00:01:37.890> advantage<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.360> fact

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
diamond this takes advantage of the fact

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.859 
diamond this takes advantage of the fact
that<00:01:39.780> redstone<00:01:40.140> only<00:01:40.829> travels<00:01:41.280> 15<00:01:41.700> blocks<00:01:41.970> so

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
that redstone only travels 15 blocks so

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.620 
that redstone only travels 15 blocks so
when<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> turn<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.220> lever<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.939> block

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
when I turn on this lever this block

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.920 
when I turn on this lever this block
being<00:01:45.960> number<00:01:46.350> 1<00:01:46.590> 2<00:01:47.040> 3<00:01:47.430> all<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.270> way<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.420> 15

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
being number 1 2 3 all the way to 15

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.170 
being number 1 2 3 all the way to 15
over<00:01:49.259> here<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.770> then<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.460> repeater<00:01:50.790> renews

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
over here and then the repeater renews

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.260 
over here and then the repeater renews
the<00:01:51.360> signal<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.079> since<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.280> dust<00:01:53.820> only

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the signal and since the dust only

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.510 
the signal and since the dust only
reaches<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:54.990> block<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.740> over<00:01:56.189> here

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
reaches to this block and not over here

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.730 
reaches to this block and not over here
this<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> only<00:01:57.270> repeater<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.229> active

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
this is the only repeater that is active

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.550 
this is the only repeater that is active
so<00:01:59.340> therefore<00:01:59.850> all<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.750> redstone<00:02:01.170> is

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
so therefore all this redstone is

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.219 
so therefore all this redstone is
emanating<00:02:02.189> from<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.909> block<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.840> counter

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
emanating from this block so the counter

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.330 
emanating from this block so the counter
resets<00:02:04.590> here<00:02:04.890> 1<00:02:05.460> 2<00:02:05.939> 3<00:02:06.360> etc<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:08.039> just

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
resets here 1 2 3 etc and this just

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.030 
resets here 1 2 3 etc and this just
repeats<00:02:08.899> until<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.200> get<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.280> final

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
repeats until you get to the final

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.830 
repeats until you get to the final
repeater<00:02:13.700> station<00:02:14.209> I<00:02:14.299> guess<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.629> could<00:02:14.810> call

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
repeater station I guess you could call

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.089 
repeater station I guess you could call
it<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.890> 1<00:02:16.250> 2<00:02:16.519> 3<00:02:16.549> all<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.599> way<00:02:17.629> to<00:02:17.780> 15<00:02:18.349> and<00:02:18.620> the

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
it so 1 2 3 all the way to 15 and the

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.709 
it so 1 2 3 all the way to 15 and the
dust<00:02:19.280> is<00:02:19.430> powered<00:02:19.760> up<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:20.000> here<00:02:20.269> not<00:02:20.510> quite

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:20.719 
dust is powered up to here not quite

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.809 
dust is powered up to here not quite
enough<00:02:21.079> to<00:02:21.140> enter<00:02:21.859> the<00:02:22.010> gold<00:02:22.250> or<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.640> diamond

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
enough to enter the gold or the diamond

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.720 
enough to enter the gold or the diamond
circuit<00:02:23.329> definitely<00:02:24.049> enough<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.620> enter<00:02:25.010> this

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
circuit definitely enough to enter this

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.410 
circuit definitely enough to enter this
lapis<00:02:26.209> circuit<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:26.989> what<00:02:27.140> happens<00:02:27.590> here<00:02:27.680> is

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
lapis circuit so what happens here is

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.020 
lapis circuit so what happens here is
this<00:02:29.420> dust<00:02:29.810> turns<00:02:30.439> off<00:02:30.650> this<00:02:30.890> torch<00:02:31.250> allowing

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
this dust turns off this torch allowing

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.330 
this dust turns off this torch allowing
the<00:02:32.150> store<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.599> turn<00:02:32.780> on<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.739> an<00:02:33.890> XOR

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
the store to turn on and this is an XOR

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.559 
the store to turn on and this is an XOR
gate<00:02:34.549> and<00:02:34.730> for<00:02:34.849> those<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.239> who<00:02:35.299> don't<00:02:35.510> know

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
gate and for those of you who don't know

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.960 
gate and for those of you who don't know
an<00:02:35.840> XOR<00:02:36.230> gate<00:02:36.439> basically<00:02:37.310> whenever<00:02:37.549> these<00:02:37.909> two

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
an XOR gate basically whenever these two

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.000 
an XOR gate basically whenever these two
torches<00:02:38.569> are<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:38.900> an<00:02:39.019> unequal<00:02:39.319> state<00:02:39.769> like

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
torches are in an unequal state like

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.699 
torches are in an unequal state like
they<00:02:40.159> are<00:02:40.310> now<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:41.780> will<00:02:41.930> get<00:02:42.109> an<00:02:42.200> output<00:02:42.379> this

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
they are now you will get an output this

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.530 
they are now you will get an output this
redstone<00:02:43.040> will<00:02:43.280> be<00:02:43.370> turned<00:02:43.639> on<00:02:43.790> when<00:02:44.060> they<00:02:44.359> are

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
redstone will be turned on when they are

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.140 
redstone will be turned on when they are
both<00:02:44.750> on<00:02:45.290> or<00:02:45.920> both<00:02:46.069> off<00:02:46.370> as<00:02:46.700> long<00:02:46.819> as<00:02:46.879> they<00:02:47.060> have

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
both on or both off as long as they have

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.210 
both on or both off as long as they have
equal<00:02:47.359> states<00:02:47.870> this<00:02:48.409> redstone<00:02:48.829> will<00:02:49.099> be

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
equal states this redstone will be

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.729 
equal states this redstone will be
turned<00:02:49.489> off<00:02:49.760> but<00:02:50.450> right<00:02:50.840> now<00:02:50.989> they're<00:02:51.319> unequal

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
turned off but right now they're unequal

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.089 
turned off but right now they're unequal
so<00:02:52.489> we<00:02:53.269> have<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.689> redstone<00:02:54.079> output<00:02:54.620> now<00:02:54.889> that<00:02:55.069> I

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
so we have a redstone output now that I

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.580 
so we have a redstone output now that I
flipped<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.639> gold<00:02:55.879> lever<00:02:56.239> you<00:02:56.510> can<00:02:56.540> see<00:02:57.049> that

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
flipped the gold lever you can see that

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.589 
flipped the gold lever you can see that
it<00:02:57.769> travels<00:02:58.189> one<00:02:58.400> extra<00:02:58.760> space<00:02:59.000> because<00:02:59.389> it's

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
it travels one extra space because it's

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.569 
it travels one extra space because it's
just<00:02:59.840> one<00:03:00.079> closer<00:03:00.349> than<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.829> lapis<00:03:01.189> so<00:03:01.370> both

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
just one closer than the lapis so both

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.460 
just one closer than the lapis so both
repeaters<00:03:02.030> are<00:03:02.209> active<00:03:02.599> so<00:03:02.750> now<00:03:03.169> all<00:03:03.319> this

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
repeaters are active so now all this

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.440 
repeaters are active so now all this
redstone<00:03:03.859> instead<00:03:04.400> of<00:03:04.519> coming<00:03:04.819> from<00:03:05.000> this

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
redstone instead of coming from this

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.539 
redstone instead of coming from this
block<00:03:05.750> are<00:03:06.019> now<00:03:06.139> going<00:03:06.620> from<00:03:06.799> this<00:03:07.099> block<00:03:07.310> so

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
block are now going from this block so

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.899 
block are now going from this block so
this<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:08.060> 1<00:03:08.419> 2<00:03:08.870> 3<00:03:09.189> cetera<00:03:10.189> which<00:03:10.370> allows<00:03:10.700> the

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
this is 1 2 3 cetera which allows the

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.699 
this is 1 2 3 cetera which allows the
redstone<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.359> travel<00:03:11.659> 1<00:03:11.810> further<00:03:12.049> into<00:03:12.530> this

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
redstone to travel 1 further into this

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.089 
redstone to travel 1 further into this
and<00:03:13.010> that<00:03:13.879> pattern<00:03:14.269> just<00:03:14.540> repeats<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.409> this

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
and that pattern just repeats and this

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.430 
and that pattern just repeats and this
time<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.760> goes<00:03:17.090> far<00:03:17.629> enough<00:03:17.659> to<00:03:18.049> make<00:03:18.199> it<00:03:18.349> in

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
time it goes far enough to make it in

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.800 
time it goes far enough to make it in
both<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:19.129> lapis<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:19.699> the<00:03:19.970> gold<00:03:20.209> circuit<00:03:20.599> but

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
both the lapis and the gold circuit but

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.140 
both the lapis and the gold circuit but
not<00:03:21.109> the<00:03:21.409> diamond<00:03:21.859> so<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.579> same<00:03:22.790> thing<00:03:23.000> from

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
not the diamond so the same thing from

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.229 
not the diamond so the same thing from
before<00:03:23.329> happens<00:03:23.989> when<00:03:24.319> the<00:03:24.889> torch<00:03:25.729> turns<00:03:25.940> off

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
before happens when the torch turns off

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.860 
before happens when the torch turns off
this<00:03:26.540> one<00:03:26.780> turns<00:03:26.989> on<00:03:27.290> but<00:03:28.040> now<00:03:28.359> similarly<00:03:29.359> this

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
this one turns on but now similarly this

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.080 
this one turns on but now similarly this
torch<00:03:30.229> turns<00:03:30.470> off<00:03:30.739> because<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.699> redstone

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
torch turns off because the redstone

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.000 
torch turns off because the redstone
reaches<00:03:32.419> 1<00:03:32.599> walk<00:03:32.810> further<00:03:33.169> I'm<00:03:33.530> just<00:03:33.799> going<00:03:33.919> to

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
reaches 1 walk further I'm just going to

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.979 
reaches 1 walk further I'm just going to
come<00:03:34.159> over<00:03:34.190> here<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:34.849> if<00:03:35.000> this<00:03:35.120> torch<00:03:35.419> off<00:03:35.659> this

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
come over here so if this torch off this

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.710 
come over here so if this torch off this
allows<00:03:36.349> this<00:03:37.040> one<00:03:37.280> to<00:03:37.430> turn<00:03:37.579> on<00:03:37.819> since<00:03:38.569> they

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
allows this one to turn on since they

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.710 
allows this one to turn on since they
are<00:03:38.810> on<00:03:38.930> an<00:03:39.079> equal<00:03:39.729> state<00:03:40.729> there<00:03:41.449> is<00:03:41.479> no

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
are on an equal state there is no

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.140 
are on an equal state there is no
redstone<00:03:42.470> output<00:03:42.979> and<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.370> lapis<00:03:43.699> doesn't

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
redstone output and the lapis doesn't

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.849 
redstone output and the lapis doesn't
turn<00:03:44.359> on<00:03:44.569> which<00:03:44.750> is<00:03:44.900> good<00:03:45.109> because<00:03:45.260> remember

to make it into all three circuits so as

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.649

we saw before with gold since these two
are<00:04:20.690> both<00:04:20.989> on<00:04:21.260> we<00:04:22.159> don't<00:04:22.490> get<00:04:22.729> an<00:04:23.000> output<00:04:23.500> or

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
are both on we don't get an output or

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.980 
are both on we don't get an output or
rather<00:04:24.710> a<00:04:24.889> negative<00:04:25.310> output

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
and over here same thing as before since

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.830

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
misc repeater and you could pretty much

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.890 
misc repeater and you could pretty much
take<00:04:54.190> from<00:04:54.400> anywhere<00:04:54.880> I<00:04:54.910> just<00:04:55.090> decided<00:04:55.630> to

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
take from anywhere I just decided to

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.510 
take from anywhere I just decided to
bring<00:04:56.199> it<00:04:56.319> around<00:04:56.410> just<00:04:56.770> so<00:04:56.949> the<00:04:57.039> Pistons<00:04:57.370> are

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
bring it around just so the Pistons are

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.580 
bring it around just so the Pistons are
all<00:04:57.610> close<00:04:57.789> to<00:04:57.970> each<00:04:58.090> other<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:58.960> lapis<00:04:59.380> and

all close to each other the lapis and
the<00:04:59.830> gold<00:05:00.039> however<00:05:00.280> these<00:05:01.120> two<00:05:01.449> need<00:05:01.720> to<00:05:01.900> be

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
the gold however these two need to be

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.570 
the gold however these two need to be
here<00:05:02.319> you<00:05:02.500> can<00:05:02.530> then<00:05:02.800> take<00:05:03.039> this<00:05:03.220> redstone

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
here you can then take this redstone

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.159 
here you can then take this redstone
dust<00:05:03.819> do<00:05:04.030> whatever<00:05:04.210> you<00:05:04.419> want<00:05:04.630> with<00:05:04.780> it<00:05:04.810> and

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
dust do whatever you want with it and

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.050 
dust do whatever you want with it and
the<00:05:05.710> diamond<00:05:06.039> I<00:05:06.130> like<00:05:06.310> to<00:05:06.430> take<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:06.729> output

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
the diamond I like to take the output

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.149 
the diamond I like to take the output
from<00:05:07.270> here<00:05:07.470> now<00:05:08.470> this<00:05:08.620> system<00:05:08.800> can<00:05:09.130> be

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
from here now this system can be

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.010 
from here now this system can be
expanded<00:05:09.610> as<00:05:09.909> far<00:05:10.150> as<00:05:10.240> you<00:05:10.389> like<00:05:10.599> as<00:05:10.810> long<00:05:10.840> as

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
expanded as far as you like as long as

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.409 
expanded as far as you like as long as
you<00:05:11.229> have<00:05:11.380> these<00:05:11.590> stations<00:05:12.250> every<00:05:12.580> 15<00:05:13.090> blocks

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
you have these stations every 15 blocks

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.659 
you have these stations every 15 blocks
and<00:05:13.750> this<00:05:13.900> decoder<00:05:14.380> of<00:05:14.650> XOR<00:05:15.009> gates<00:05:15.220> at<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:15.520> end

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
and this decoder of XOR gates at the end

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.270 
and this decoder of XOR gates at the end
you<00:05:16.330> can<00:05:16.479> do<00:05:16.599> this<00:05:16.750> with<00:05:16.900> any<00:05:17.139> number<00:05:17.620> I<00:05:17.889> just

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
you can do this with any number I just

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.029 
you can do this with any number I just
chose<00:05:18.490> 3<00:05:18.970> what<00:05:19.479> you<00:05:19.630> would<00:05:19.780> do<00:05:20.020> obviously<00:05:20.800> is

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
chose 3 what you would do obviously is

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.469 
chose 3 what you would do obviously is
just<00:05:21.610> add<00:05:21.849> another<00:05:22.150> one<00:05:22.389> over<00:05:22.659> here<00:05:22.690> and<00:05:24.479> when

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
just add another one over here and when

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.230 
just add another one over here and when
you<00:05:25.630> have<00:05:25.840> your<00:05:26.050> lever<00:05:26.409> for<00:05:26.830> your<00:05:26.979> input<00:05:27.430> you

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
you have your lever for your input you

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.480 
you have your lever for your input you
would<00:05:28.389> just<00:05:28.539> make<00:05:28.690> it<00:05:28.900> one<00:05:29.050> closer<00:05:29.349> and<00:05:29.710> you

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
would just make it one closer and you

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.550 
would just make it one closer and you
just<00:05:30.729> repeat<00:05:31.090> that<00:05:31.120> and<00:05:31.539> you<00:05:31.930> would<00:05:32.080> need<00:05:32.289> an

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
just repeat that and you would need an

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.490 
just repeat that and you would need an
additional<00:05:32.830> xor<00:05:33.550> gate<00:05:33.580> so<00:05:34.389> I<00:05:34.780> think<00:05:35.080> how<00:05:35.380> it

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
additional xor gate so I think how it

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.320 
additional xor gate so I think how it
works<00:05:35.680> is<00:05:35.979> you<00:05:36.009> just<00:05:36.310> count<00:05:36.550> the<00:05:36.759> number<00:05:37.090> you

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
works is you just count the number you

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.540 
works is you just count the number you

just go to the Minecraft Wiki but just a

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:47.370 
just go to the Minecraft Wiki but just a
quick<00:05:45.460> look<00:05:45.909> over<00:05:46.210> here<00:05:46.690> this<00:05:46.810> is<00:05:47.020> how<00:05:47.169> it's

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
quick look over here this is how it's

torches turned off similar to how it was
over<00:06:02.469> here<00:06:02.770> and<00:06:03.099> since<00:06:03.849> they<00:06:04.000> are<00:06:04.060> in<00:06:04.150> an

over here and since they are in an
unequal<00:06:04.539> state<00:06:05.699> we<00:06:06.699> get<00:06:06.940> an<00:06:07.419> output<00:06:08.610> gold

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
unequal state we get an output gold

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.180 
unequal state we get an output gold
however<00:06:09.880> will<00:06:10.270> turn<00:06:10.449> on<00:06:10.599> both<00:06:10.840> torches<00:06:11.440> since

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
however will turn on both torches since

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.040 
however will turn on both torches since

can be useful to you too if you have to

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:20.879 
can be useful to you too if you have to
run<00:06:18.969> redstone<00:06:19.449> long<00:06:19.719> distances<00:06:20.349> and<00:06:20.620> want<00:06:20.770> to

much redstone over here you can now have
them<00:06:25.330> share<00:06:25.930> redstone<00:06:26.469> line<00:06:26.680> making<00:06:27.430> it<00:06:27.610> a<00:06:27.729> lot

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
them share redstone line making it a lot

them share redstone line making it a lot
more<00:06:28.120> efficient<00:06:28.539> to<00:06:28.690> build<00:06:28.870> big<00:06:29.050> projects

this<00:06:30.310> is<00:06:30.460> also<00:06:30.639> good<00:06:30.940> in<00:06:31.090> conjunction<00:06:31.479> with

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719 
this is also good in conjunction with

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:34.050 
this is also good in conjunction with
the<00:06:32.110> new<00:06:32.259> feature<00:06:32.500> in<00:06:32.830> Minecraft<00:06:33.310> 1.3

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
the new feature in Minecraft 1.3

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.969 
the new feature in Minecraft 1.3
redstone<00:06:34.690> is<00:06:34.870> now<00:06:35.050> able<00:06:35.320> to<00:06:35.500> travel<00:06:35.830> through

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
redstone is now able to travel through

redstone is now able to travel through
unloaded<00:06:36.669> chunks<00:06:36.699> and<00:06:37.180> work<00:06:37.300> properly<00:06:37.510> so<00:06:38.020> I

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
unloaded chunks and work properly so I

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.690 
unloaded chunks and work properly so I
think<00:06:38.889> this<00:06:39.010> project<00:06:39.250> work

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
think this project work

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.570 
think this project work
very<00:06:39.970> well<00:06:40.210> with<00:06:40.390> that<00:06:40.570> now<00:06:41.290> this<00:06:42.160> will<00:06:42.370> help

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
very well with that now this will help

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.820 
very well with that now this will help
me<00:06:42.760> in<00:06:42.940> future<00:06:43.270> projects<00:06:43.750> and<00:06:43.960> I<00:06:44.290> hope<00:06:44.530> it<00:06:44.740> will

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830 
me in future projects and I hope it will

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.050 
me in future projects and I hope it will
help<00:06:45.100> you<00:06:45.430> in<00:06:45.790> your<00:06:46.090> future<00:06:46.300> projects
