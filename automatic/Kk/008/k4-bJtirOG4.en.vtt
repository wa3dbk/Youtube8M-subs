00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.980
 ah 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.359
 what's up my friends from youtube 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.939
 today I bring a criticism to one of my 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.690
 favorite video games of the ps2 dragon 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.670
 Volvo Ducay Tenkaichi 3 Let's start as 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.320
 we know this game has been the best 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.850
 all deliveries of the games of 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.850
 dragon ball that was what 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.290
 He differentiated as other deliveries 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.570
 the characters would be the same 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.640
 graphic but the thing is that it has more 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.370
 clothes to choose for the characters 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.229
 you will be able to record the fights both in the ps2 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.540
 and the guild to make you more 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:59.090
 fun the game you can play online 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.480
 with the wii has 32 characters 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.879
 new that in total are 161 and the good 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.990
 is that these can be unlocked 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.179
 easily the story mode is 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.640
 fantastic at times when 

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:12.890
 you lost so much life to your rival tells you 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.289
 press a button that puts a scene 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.659
 some attack or a transformation has 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.610
 all of 'dragon ball' from the cet to the people 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.399
 and the ovas all the transformations 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.950
 they are faithful to game the techniques of all 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.110
 the characters are more realistic is like 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.060
 if you were watching the series and also 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.900
 you can pass files of the others 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.000
 games 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.850
 the game has to be original sorry 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.340
 for disillusioning the gameplay is 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.860
 great so different from vodka but it's 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.780
 something similar to the backs is now easier 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.850
 grab the dragonballs in the 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.920
 story mode in the other games the 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.810
 you had to pick up what was a 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.030
 so difficult and in this alone with 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.220
 destroy the object you already have the sphere 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.130
 their game modes are very funny 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.590
 what are the mode mode the mode 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.110

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.820

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.030
