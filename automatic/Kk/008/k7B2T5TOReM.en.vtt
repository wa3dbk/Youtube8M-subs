00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.269
 you have described we are going to show you all the steps for the creation of a 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.109
 printer on networks 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.529
 under the world protocol ur 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.519
 in sea equipment 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.910
 and in world teams 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.059
 pink system preferences 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.780
 to add the company added are network 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.980
 - we go to the printing and fax option we mark 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.770
 as simple as the Spanish delegation also a printer 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.100
 By default, she shows up 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.950
 we have detected by forrest 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.620
 - share it 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.480
 the printer 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.630
 through this medium then here we can tan 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.120
 the box well the man's locker 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.880
 special 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.050
 we can put the man 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.310
 that we want 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.160
 to identify 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.340
 cd the printer the text is not easy is a label to identify even the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.649
 coj 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.870
 the business model 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.870
 ip him danger 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.710
 a little joy 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.630
 The ubication 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.630
 on that day where the moment the machine computer the computer man 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.580
 server 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.810
 merkel to illustrate 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.810
 and at the time of between honey 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.550
 the default option that does not know 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.320
 will no longer use the trailers 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.040
 necessary is that they are in another team 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.670
 as simple as this add 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.890
 and we will have the printer 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.670
 directly in our new names for no further complications 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.650
 it's a way 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.860
 hugo morros to the best of taking advantage of the old devices 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.339
 it's worth the January operator the 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:16.399
 the teams are trying to read more 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.590
 we will update the drivers 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.900
 customers that I do not count on them device we only take the traitors 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.620
 i can continue to use behind these printers cobos goals 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.649
 scored the two goals of the Argentine 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:34.889
 well up here percent he 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.279
 the mer simple tik tok the entity 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.279
 a network printer 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.769
 Now let's do it blindly simulate inverter up to our dance server 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.920
 disputed four then let's do it for what the government 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:56.779
 finally we have our local network 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:00.479
 mac computers and windows computers good now let's see how it works 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.319
 I can create very alive 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.649
 there were no injuries 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:07.789
 sorry but aspires to peace once of apple 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:14.879
 and there we will download the dislike of the module for nothing for windows 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:22.399
 buenos aires 2 percent on the salaries of loans other desk 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:23.260
 remote 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.229
 as we have also seen 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.430
 in the previous points lives the premiere no 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.659
 then we go to the website 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.169
 from Apple 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.609
 we will download bonjour 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.609
 the gnomes concluded their demeanor 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.529
 twenty-one 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.529
 a drawing 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.699
 peterson 

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:10.929
 in downloads 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.719
 we will see 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:21.719
 trome cooper knew with vigor 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.229
 here directly 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.050
 it appears 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.169
 to download 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.219
 the union option for windows the 1 points 3 6 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.949
 in this case the entity 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.949
 the latest version of bouquets a click 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.659
 and give us, it will escape us 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.279
 The width 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:48.279
 don lolo 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.080
 let us address 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.069
 Alonso say no with a desk cap 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.069
 the application 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:03.419
 we already have our clients 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.419
 close 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.080
 it's as simple as 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.080
 tuxpan application 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:18.309
 against 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:24.219
 Llanos comes in Spanish language 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.520
 following 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.789
 following 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.789
 one hundred by one hundred 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.289
 hundreds of injured 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.710
 and we finished the installation 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.059
 so 

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:54.930
 we already have direct access 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.479
 that has created us in pumping stations - double click 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.509
 now I will look for a printer and effectively, although they do not disappear 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.699
 just dictated the printer that reported the network through 2001 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.270
 next goose 

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:17.999
 we mark jeanneret 

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:19.319
 we mark 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:21.960
 and weak post-peak 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.379
 in agreement 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.869
 if the client 

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:29.869
 Finalize 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:34.550
 before 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.960
 Chinese folders are not necessary 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.400
 i already have nothing installed on the printer 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:47.909
 our team 

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:50.789
 with its start 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:53.789
 control Panel 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.300
 and so we will see 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.169
 the notion of printers and faxes 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:02.990
 the research folder we will see 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.119
 our company 

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:07.110
 correctly 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.620
