00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
powder which I would form creatine it is

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.449 
powder which I would form creatine it is
I<00:02:27.900> tend<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:28.990> try<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.530> take<00:02:29.770> it<00:02:29.890> grape<00:02:30.190> juice

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.150 
I tend to try it take it grape juice
because<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.090> got<00:02:31.300> sugar<00:02:31.510> in<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.890> because<00:02:32.890> sugar

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
because it got sugar in it because sugar

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.860 
because it got sugar in it because sugar
helps<00:02:33.520> bring<00:02:33.730> up<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:33.970> creatine<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.600> helps<00:02:34.780> it

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
helps bring up the creatine it helps it

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.040
