for<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.619> by<00:00:29.460> valuing<00:00:30.119> all<00:00:30.300> my<00:00:30.570> numbers<00:00:30.750> based

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
for that by valuing all my numbers based

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.200 
for that by valuing all my numbers based
between<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> cellular<00:00:32.160> value<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
buyers value an example if you don't

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.130 
buyers value an example if you don't
know<00:00:35.489> what<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.640> mean<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.030> people<00:00:36.690> buy<00:00:36.870> bling

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
pulling them towards the bosses I am

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.660 
pulling them towards the bosses I am
also<00:01:33.930> skipping<00:01:34.439> any<00:01:34.619> recipe<00:01:35.040> dungeons<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.490> see

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
also skipping any recipe dungeons I see

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.999 
also skipping any recipe dungeons I see
even<00:01:36.299> if<00:01:36.390> they<00:01:36.540> are<00:01:36.659> legitimately<00:01:37.229> next<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.890> me

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
even if they are legitimately next to me

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.160 
even if they are legitimately next to me
so<00:01:38.460> people<00:01:38.759> don't<00:01:38.939> think<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.210> favor<00:01:39.420> them<00:01:39.659> for

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
so people don't think I favor them for

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.719 
so people don't think I favor them for
the<00:01:40.259> purpose<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.890> section<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.549> guide

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.660 
take the edge time to sell them as
straight<00:03:00.180> recipes<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.440> low<00:03:01.800> value<00:03:02.220> will

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.760 
straight recipes so this low value will
be<00:03:02.790> 30<00:03:03.090> bucks<00:03:03.300> each<00:03:03.540> which<00:03:03.990> turn<00:03:04.230> out<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.410> be

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
be 30 bucks each which turn out to be

eight hundred and ten in flux for the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.960 
eight hundred and ten in flux for the
hour<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.440> high<00:03:07.620> value<00:03:07.650> would<00:03:08.190> be<00:03:08.250> at

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
hour and the high value would be at
