00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
because every time someone said even

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.980 
because every time someone said even
some<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.400> was<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.640> joke<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.180> would<00:02:37.600> think<00:02:37.780> they

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
feelings push down the fact that I has a

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.710 
feelings push down the fact that I has a
slight<00:02:42.550> form<00:02:42.940> voluntarism<00:02:43.480> called

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720

Asperger's<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:45.130> makes<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.580> so<00:02:45.850> it's

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
Asperger's that that makes it so it's

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.090 
Asperger's that that makes it so it's
even<00:02:46.390> harder<00:02:46.930> for<00:02:47.170> me<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.290> understand<00:02:47.950> that

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
even harder for me to understand that

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.980 
even harder for me to understand that
