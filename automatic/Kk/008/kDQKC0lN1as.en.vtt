00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
become such a nuisance on the road

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.259 
become such a nuisance on the road
drivers<00:03:08.110> who<00:03:08.230> are<00:03:08.319> trying<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.739> constantly<00:03:09.269> our

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
gate and get past him so my point I

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.150 
gate and get past him so my point I
suppose<00:03:14.170> is<00:03:15.450> why<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.510> 50cc<00:03:17.260> restriction<00:03:18.099> I

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
suppose is why the 50cc restriction I

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.800 
suppose is why the 50cc restriction I
can<00:03:18.370> understand<00:03:18.760> people<00:03:19.030> that<00:03:19.180> want<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.569> ride

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
can understand people that want to ride

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.160 
can understand people that want to ride
thickness<00:03:20.319> easy<00:03:21.150> some<00:03:22.150> people<00:03:22.599> are<00:03:22.989> not

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
thickness easy some people are not

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.199 
thickness easy some people are not
interested<00:03:23.200> in<00:03:23.859> going<00:03:23.980> any<00:03:24.190> faster<00:03:24.459> than<00:03:24.910> a

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
interested in going any faster than a

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.349 
interested in going any faster than a
50cc<00:03:26.109> goes<00:03:26.530> but<00:03:28.260> for<00:03:29.260> me<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.799> 125<00:03:30.609> is<00:03:30.849> safer<00:03:31.329> than

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
50cc goes but for me a 125 is safer than

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.930 
50cc goes but for me a 125 is safer than
a<00:03:31.540> 50cc<00:03:34.319> so<00:03:35.319> that<00:03:35.799> that's<00:03:36.040> really<00:03:36.340> all<00:03:36.669> I<00:03:36.700> was

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
a 50cc so that that's really all I was

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.059 
a 50cc so that that's really all I was
always<00:03:37.150> trying<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.599> say<00:03:37.780> is<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.079> that's<00:03:38.829> one

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
always trying to say is that that's one

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.910 
always trying to say is that that's one
thing<00:03:39.099> I<00:03:39.430> think<00:03:39.669> that's<00:03:40.530> that's<00:03:41.530> quite

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
thing I think that's that's quite

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.500 
thing I think that's that's quite
dangerous<00:03:43.920> i<00:03:44.069> believe<00:03:44.310> this<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:44.939> fun<00:03:45.150> behind<00:03:45.450> a

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
dangerous i believe this is fun behind a

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.059 
dangerous i believe this is fun behind a
bus<00:03:45.689> and<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:45.989> must<00:03:46.200> be<00:03:46.319> a<00:03:46.349> great<00:03:46.560> view<00:03:46.769> for<00:03:47.010> you

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
bus and it must be a great view for you

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:54.930 
bus and it must be a great view for you
guys<00:03:47.329> let<00:03:48.329> me<00:03:48.420> see<00:03:48.540> if<00:03:48.599> i<00:03:48.659> can<00:03:48.810> get<00:03:48.900> past<00:03:49.140> it

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.200 

there<00:03:55.940> we<00:03:56.060> go<00:03:56.680> yeah<00:03:57.680> so

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.660 

that<00:04:01.210> is<00:04:01.600> one<00:04:01.900> thing<00:04:02.170> where<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.380> think

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
that is one thing where I think

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.590 
that is one thing where I think

pestering them
and

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
and

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.509 
and
it<00:04:16.470> is<00:04:16.709> no<00:04:16.980> idea

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.270 

and<00:04:20.519> some<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.150> them<00:04:21.500> naturally<00:04:22.500> don't<00:04:23.040> feel

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
and some of them naturally don't feel

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.750 
and some of them naturally don't feel
safe<00:04:23.550> they<00:04:23.820> go<00:04:24.030> out<00:04:24.270> they<00:04:24.480> ride<00:04:24.810> around<00:04:24.840> and

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
safe they go out they ride around and

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.460

prayed their first few experiences on

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.180 
prayed their first few experiences on
the<00:04:28.500> bike<00:04:29.390> is<00:04:30.390> of<00:04:30.690> being<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.050> hazard<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:34.190> also

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
the bike is of being a hazard I also

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.040 
the bike is of being a hazard I also
think<00:04:35.640> that<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.060> cbt<00:04:36.540> even<00:04:37.350> as<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.470> is<00:04:37.740> now

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
think that the cbt even as it is now

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.640 
think that the cbt even as it is now
getting<00:04:40.050> people<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.680> ride<00:04:40.890> round<00:04:41.220> on
