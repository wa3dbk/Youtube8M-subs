00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
a big deal but basically overall all the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.229 
a big deal but basically overall all the
mimics<00:00:43.050> spells<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.860> her<00:00:44.489> are<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:45.090> been

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.060 
lowered so that when you cast a spell a
second<00:00:47.370> time<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.700> her<00:00:47.789> all<00:00:47.969> T<00:00:48.180> thing<00:00:49.070> gather

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
significantly lower now person I don't

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.740 
significantly lower now person I don't
play<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.070> Blanc<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.120> mean<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.390> don't<00:00:54.570> really

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
play the Blanc so I mean I don't really

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.010 
play the Blanc so I mean I don't really
know<00:00:55.680> how<00:00:55.710> big<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:57.059> bigger<00:00:57.570> change<00:00:57.870> that

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
know how big that a bigger change that

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.630 
know how big that a bigger change that
is<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.289> looks<00:00:58.559> big<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:59.100> looking<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
is it looks big just looking at the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.299 
is it looks big just looking at the
numbers<00:01:00.199> because<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.530> nearly<00:01:02.010> half

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
numbers because it's like nearly half

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.770 
numbers because it's like nearly half
every<00:01:02.910> time<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.390> half<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.840> damage<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.630> yeah

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
every time like half the damage so yeah

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.030 
every time like half the damage so yeah
like<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> said<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.470> early<00:01:07.680> experimental

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
like I said this is early experimental

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.440 
like I said this is early experimental
stuff<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.580> why<00:01:08.790> don't<00:01:08.939> maybe<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.270> not<00:01:09.330> going

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
stuff so why don't maybe it's not going

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.330 
stuff so why don't maybe it's not going
to<00:01:09.540> go<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.080> didn't<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.560> mean<00:01:11.070> but

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
to go in like that I didn't I mean but

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.500 
to go in like that I didn't I mean but
the<00:01:11.430> fact<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.670> blocks<00:01:12.000> being<00:01:12.240> nerfed

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the fact that blocks being nerfed

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.660 
the fact that blocks being nerfed
doesn't<00:01:12.930> surprise<00:01:13.500> me<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:14.010> general<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.549> I

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
doesn't surprise me in general like I

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.609 
doesn't surprise me in general like I
said<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.850> don't<00:01:15.000> play<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.360> character<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.590> I

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
said I don't play the character but I

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.080 
said I don't play the character but I
have<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> pretty<00:01:17.070> good<00:01:17.310> feel<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.729> how<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.909> know

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
have a pretty good feel of how you know

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.480 
have a pretty good feel of how you know
the<00:01:18.180> game<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.390> flowing<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.220> it's<00:01:20.220> basically

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the game is flowing and it's basically

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.210 
the game is flowing and it's basically
ever<00:01:20.670> since<00:01:21.140> kassadin<00:01:22.140> was<00:01:22.320> changed<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.040> just

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
ever since kassadin was changed and just

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.090 
ever since kassadin was changed and just
sort<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.400> those<00:01:23.520> really<00:01:24.060> heavy<00:01:24.830> mid<00:01:25.830> burst

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
sort of those really heavy mid burst

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.460 
sort of those really heavy mid burst
champions<00:01:26.640> were<00:01:27.119> kind<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.450> nerve<00:01:27.570> down<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
champions were kind of nerve down the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.319 
champions were kind of nerve down the
block<00:01:28.650> wasn't<00:01:29.130> really<00:01:29.579> an<00:01:29.640> issue<00:01:29.759> before<00:01:30.060> it

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
block wasn't really an issue before it

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.760 
block wasn't really an issue before it
didn't<00:01:30.509> seem<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.990> because<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.680> you

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
didn't seem like it because you know you

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.469 
didn't seem like it because you know you
had<00:01:31.890> stuff<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.400> Kassadin<00:01:32.909> midna<00:01:33.210> which<00:01:33.329> was

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
had stuff like Kassadin midna which was

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.050 
had stuff like Kassadin midna which was
basically<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.560> better<00:01:34.710> lock<00:01:35.070> well<00:01:35.670> not

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
basically just a better lock well not

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.819 
basically just a better lock well not
better<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.049> know<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.500> scaled

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
better but you know it's scaled

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.410 
better but you know it's scaled
differently<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.700> know<00:01:38.790> ultimately<00:01:38.939> it

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
differently but you know ultimately it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.100 
differently but you know ultimately it
would<00:01:39.479> end<00:01:39.659> up<00:01:39.750> doing<00:01:39.990> more<00:01:40.140> damage<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:42.110> now

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
would end up doing more damage and now

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.200 
would end up doing more damage and now
there's<00:01:43.350> LeBlanc<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.670> she's<00:01:44.939> sort<00:01:45.180> of

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
there's LeBlanc and so she's sort of

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.999 
there's LeBlanc and so she's sort of
taken<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.659> place<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.409> problematic

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
taken the place of that problematic

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.859 
taken the place of that problematic
teleporting<00:01:47.759> brush<00:01:47.939> down<00:01:48.299> before<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.750> do

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
teleporting brush down before you can do

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.109 
teleporting brush down before you can do
anything<00:01:49.110> kind<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.500> champion<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:51.000> I've

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
anything kind of champion and I've

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.550 
anything kind of champion and I've
noticed<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.750> because<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.020> lot<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.200> people<00:01:52.320> are

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
noticed this because a lot of people are

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.230 
noticed this because a lot of people are
playing<00:01:52.799> are<00:01:53.009> quite<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> bit<00:01:53.460> now<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.700> soloq

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
playing are quite a bit now in soloq

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.380 
playing are quite a bit now in soloq
tricky<00:01:54.750> aren't<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.149> kind<00:01:57.329> of

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
tricky aren't you and it just kind of

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.240 
tricky aren't you and it just kind of
this<00:01:57.540> thing<00:01:57.810> where<00:01:58.049> early<00:01:58.469> game<00:01:58.649> she<00:01:58.890> gets<00:01:59.040> any

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
this thing where early game she gets any

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.330

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
kills at all in in you know the mid lane

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.499

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
percent 20 min is sort of like there

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.460 
percent 20 min is sort of like there
wasn't<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.300> mean<00:02:18.450> there<00:02:18.570> are<00:02:18.720> things<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.110> can

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
wasn't I mean there are things you can

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.040 
wasn't I mean there are things you can
do<00:02:20.060> but<00:02:21.060> it's<00:02:21.240> kind<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.450> like<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.660> forget<00:02:22.020> she

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
do but it's kind of like you forget she

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.510 
do but it's kind of like you forget she
exists<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:22.770> half<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.040> second<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.460> just

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
exists for half a second and just

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.040 
exists for half a second and just
suddenly<00:02:23.730> she<00:02:23.970> jumps<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.690> you're<00:02:24.900> dead

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
suddenly she jumps on you you're dead

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.040 
suddenly she jumps on you you're dead
and<00:02:25.550> in<00:02:26.550> general<00:02:26.880> riot<00:02:27.420> doesn't<00:02:27.780> like<00:02:27.870> that

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
and in general riot doesn't like that

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.630 
and in general riot doesn't like that
thing<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.560> think<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.950> lot<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.160> people<00:02:29.250> don't

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
thing and I think a lot of people don't

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.330 
thing and I think a lot of people don't
like<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:30.030> kind<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.390> thing<00:02:30.630> where<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.930> sits

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
like that kind of thing where it sits

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.710 
like that kind of thing where it sits
there's<00:02:32.340> not<00:02:32.820> too<00:02:33.000> much<00:02:33.090> counter<00:02:33.510> play

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
there's not too much counter play

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.060 
there's not too much counter play
towards<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.320> suppose<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.650> mean<00:02:34.800> there<00:02:34.920> is

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
towards that I suppose I mean there is

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.680 
towards that I suppose I mean there is
but<00:02:35.430> it's<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:36.090> know<00:02:36.120> it's<00:02:36.240> kind<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.540> like<00:02:36.630> a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
but it's you know it's kind of like a

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.450 
but it's you know it's kind of like a
are<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.020> paying<00:02:37.230> attention<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.680> entire<00:02:38.040> time

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
are you paying attention the entire time

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.330 
are you paying attention the entire time
and<00:02:38.810> it's<00:02:39.810> kind<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.170> irritating<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:40.890> like<00:02:41.220> I

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
and it's kind of irritating so like I

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.700 
and it's kind of irritating so like I
was<00:02:41.370> saying<00:02:41.460> she<00:02:42.450> sort<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.870> new<00:02:43.080> Kassadin

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
was saying she sort of the new Kassadin

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.610 
was saying she sort of the new Kassadin
so<00:02:43.980> these<00:02:44.430> nerfs<00:02:44.820> don't<00:02:45.210> surprise<00:02:45.420> me<00:02:45.630> how<00:02:46.230> big

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
so these nerfs don't surprise me how big

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.410 
so these nerfs don't surprise me how big
they<00:02:46.830> are<00:02:46.860> kind<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.550> does<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:47.790> I'm<00:02:48.210> not<00:02:48.330> really

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
they are kind of does but I'm not really

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.820 
they are kind of does but I'm not really
sure<00:02:48.540> what<00:02:48.780> else<00:02:48.870> they<00:02:49.020> can<00:02:49.080> do<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.380> or<00:02:49.470> so

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
sure what else they can do it or so

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.220 
sure what else they can do it or so
we'll<00:02:50.670> see<00:02:50.850> how<00:02:50.880> this<00:02:51.360> nerf<00:02:51.630> evolves<00:02:52.170> over

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
we'll see how this nerf evolves over

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.870 
we'll see how this nerf evolves over
time<00:02:52.380> like<00:02:52.710> I<00:02:52.800> said<00:02:52.860> again<00:02:53.220> it's<00:02:53.400> not<00:02:53.580> coming

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
time like I said again it's not coming

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.790 
time like I said again it's not coming
for<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.120> next<00:02:54.360> patch<00:02:54.540> don't<00:02:54.870> freaking<00:02:55.650> out

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
for the next patch don't freaking out

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.070 
for the next patch don't freaking out
because<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.970> suspect<00:02:57.390> this<00:02:57.480> will<00:02:57.600> be<00:02:57.720> changed

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
because I suspect this will be changed

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.540 
because I suspect this will be changed
to<00:02:58.200> an<00:02:58.290> extent<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.770> know<00:02:58.860> there's<00:02:59.310> kind<00:02:59.520> of

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
to an extent you know there's kind of

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.880 
to an extent you know there's kind of
messing<00:02:59.910> with<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.150> for<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.360> time<00:03:00.570> being<00:03:00.890> but
