names<00:00:13.410> Oh<00:00:17.390> shiny

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.480 

I<00:00:22.539> guess<00:00:23.170> what<00:00:23.320> we<00:00:23.410> have<00:00:23.560> here<00:00:23.770> is<00:00:23.920> an<00:00:24.070> undead

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
I guess what we have here is an undead

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.580 
I guess what we have here is an undead
druid<00:00:24.939> which<00:00:25.180> we<00:00:25.840> are<00:00:25.960> not<00:00:26.109> officially

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
druid which we are not officially

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.290 
druid which we are not officially
announcing<00:00:27.009> in<00:00:27.310> any<00:00:27.430> way<00:00:27.580> shape<00:00:27.789> or<00:00:27.910> form<00:00:30.300> so

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
announcing in any way shape or form so

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.150 
announcing in any way shape or form so
in<00:00:31.419> the<00:00:31.509> middle<00:00:31.779> are<00:00:31.990> your<00:00:32.199> class<00:00:32.470> glyphs<00:00:32.920> and

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
in the middle are your class glyphs and

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.080 
in the middle are your class glyphs and
we<00:00:33.340> think<00:00:33.460> we're<00:00:33.610> going<00:00:33.699> to<00:00:33.790> go<00:00:33.850> ahead<00:00:33.879> and

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
we think we're going to go ahead and

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.720 
we think we're going to go ahead and
change<00:00:34.239> the<00:00:34.480> UI<00:00:34.600> to<00:00:34.750> actually<00:00:35.260> reinforce<00:00:35.770> what

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
change the UI to actually reinforce what

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
talents our abilities the glyphs are

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.509 
talents our abilities the glyphs are
affecting<00:00:38.680> we<00:00:38.800> know<00:00:38.890> can<00:00:39.100> sometimes<00:00:39.400> be

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
affecting we know can sometimes be

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.310 
affecting we know can sometimes be
confusing<00:00:39.640> to<00:00:40.030> look<00:00:40.570> at<00:00:40.690> a<00:00:40.780> really

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
confusing to look at a really

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.110 
confusing to look at a really
cool-looking<00:00:41.710> artistic<00:00:42.489> symbol<00:00:42.850> but<00:00:43.000> not

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
cool-looking artistic symbol but not

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.880 
cool-looking artistic symbol but not
necessarily<00:00:43.510> know<00:00:43.720> if<00:00:43.870> that<00:00:44.050> is<00:00:44.080> your<00:00:44.350> glyph

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
necessarily know if that is your glyph

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.500 
necessarily know if that is your glyph
of<00:00:45.040> lacerating<00:00:45.670> your<00:00:45.760> glyph<00:00:45.940> of<00:00:46.059> swipe<00:00:46.300> or

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
of lacerating your glyph of swipe or

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.140 
of lacerating your glyph of swipe or
whatever<00:00:46.750> so<00:00:47.050> I<00:00:47.640> don't<00:00:48.640> know<00:00:48.699> that<00:00:48.820> this<00:00:48.910> color

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
whatever so I don't know that this color

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.549 
whatever so I don't know that this color
palette<00:00:49.540> is<00:00:49.629> final<00:00:49.960> it's<00:00:50.110> probably<00:00:50.320> not<00:00:50.470> but

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
palette is final it's probably not but

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:51.869 
palette is final it's probably not but
you<00:00:50.650> get<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.860> basic<00:00:51.129> idea<00:00:51.220> there's<00:00:51.640> a<00:00:51.699> big

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
you get the basic idea there's a big

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.000 
you get the basic idea there's a big
claw<00:00:52.420> in<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:52.629> middle<00:00:52.870> because<00:00:53.019> your<00:00:53.680> feral

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
claw in the middle because your feral

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.029 
claw in the middle because your feral
druid<00:00:54.309> and<00:00:54.460> you<00:00:54.820> have<00:00:54.969> six<00:00:55.510> of<00:00:56.230> your<00:00:56.379> class<00:00:56.620> the

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
druid and you have six of your class the

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.950 
druid and you have six of your class the
gold<00:00:57.730> ones<00:00:57.940> of<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.120> major<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.660> blue<00:00:58.809> ones

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
gold ones of the major and the blue ones

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.080 
gold ones of the major and the blue ones
of<00:00:59.079> the<00:00:59.140> minor<00:00:59.289> glyphs<00:00:59.590> and<00:00:59.920> now<00:01:00.670> around<00:01:01.000> the

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
of the minor glyphs and now around the

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.279 
of the minor glyphs and now around the
outside<00:01:01.539> are<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:02.680> new<00:01:02.800> path<00:01:03.070> glyphs<00:01:04.199> when<00:01:05.199> you

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289 
outside are the new path glyphs when you

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:07.590 
outside are the new path glyphs when you
start<00:01:05.560> out<00:01:05.710> at<00:01:06.460> level<00:01:06.700> 80<00:01:06.880> you<00:01:07.090> won't<00:01:07.270> have<00:01:07.479> any

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
start out at level 80 you won't have any

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.420 
start out at level 80 you won't have any
path<00:01:07.930> glyphs<00:01:08.289> you<00:01:08.680> won't<00:01:08.830> get<00:01:08.979> any<00:01:09.160> of<00:01:09.310> them

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
path glyphs you won't get any of them

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.370 
path glyphs you won't get any of them
all<00:01:09.520> into<00:01:09.670> level<00:01:10.000> 85<00:01:10.420> this<00:01:10.690> is<00:01:10.780> all<00:01:10.869> maximum

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
all into level 85 this is all maximum

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.139 
all into level 85 this is all maximum
character<00:01:11.710> level<00:01:12.070> progression<00:01:12.460> stuff<00:01:12.729> and

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
character level progression stuff and

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.060 
character level progression stuff and
then<00:01:13.690> slowly<00:01:13.929> over<00:01:14.170> time<00:01:14.289> you<00:01:14.710> learn<00:01:14.740> these

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
then slowly over time you learn these

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.130 
then slowly over time you learn these
new<00:01:15.280> glyphs<00:01:15.520> you<00:01:15.640> can<00:01:15.789> see<00:01:16.000> we<00:01:16.720> go<00:01:16.869> all<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.110> way

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
new glyphs you can see we go all the way

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.169 
new glyphs you can see we go all the way
up<00:01:17.289> to<00:01:17.320> rank<00:01:17.619> 10<00:01:17.890> I<00:01:18.190> don't<00:01:18.610> think<00:01:18.700> we'll<00:01:18.970> offer

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
up to rank 10 I don't think we'll offer

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.270 
up to rank 10 I don't think we'll offer
rank<00:01:19.509> 10<00:01:19.750> when<00:01:19.990> cataclysm<00:01:20.380> first<00:01:20.800> ships<00:01:21.039> but

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
rank 10 when cataclysm first ships but

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.070 
rank 10 when cataclysm first ships but
one<00:01:21.700> of<00:01:21.789> the<00:01:21.850> things<00:01:21.880> we<00:01:22.090> think<00:01:22.210> is<00:01:22.360> cool<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.869> to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
one of the things we think is cool is to

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.800 
one of the things we think is cool is to
gradually<00:01:23.530> unlock<00:01:24.009> new<00:01:24.490> ranks<00:01:24.789> over<00:01:24.970> time<00:01:25.210> so

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
gradually unlock new ranks over time so

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.109 
gradually unlock new ranks over time so
in<00:01:25.990> patch<00:01:26.200> I<00:01:26.470> guess<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:26.679> would<00:01:26.770> be<00:01:26.910> 4.1<00:01:27.910> or<00:01:27.940> 4.2

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
in patch I guess it would be 4.1 or 4.2

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.210 
in patch I guess it would be 4.1 or 4.2
and<00:01:28.660> come<00:01:28.959> out<00:01:29.110> one<00:01:29.590> of<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.740> bullet<00:01:29.950> points

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
and come out one of the bullet points

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.919 
and come out one of the bullet points
might<00:01:30.369> be<00:01:30.550> now<00:01:30.759> you<00:01:30.819> can<00:01:31.090> achieve<00:01:31.179> ranked<00:01:31.660> 8th

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
might be now you can achieve ranked 8th

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.550 
might be now you can achieve ranked 8th
in<00:01:31.959> your<00:01:32.709> ear<00:01:32.860> path<00:01:33.869> will<00:01:34.869> also<00:01:35.110> theme<00:01:35.319> the<00:01:35.440> UI

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
in your ear path will also theme the UI

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.139 
in your ear path will also theme the UI
and<00:01:35.890> maybe<00:01:36.009> even<00:01:36.160> the<00:01:36.280> path<00:01:36.580> itself<00:01:36.789> will

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
and maybe even the path itself will

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.820 
and maybe even the path itself will
change<00:01:37.390> shape<00:01:37.630> depending<00:01:38.020> on<00:01:38.319> which<00:01:38.440> tighten

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.529 
class specific they're not going to be
modifying<00:01:54.520> your<00:01:54.640> sinister<00:01:55.030> strike<00:01:55.360> for

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
modifying your sinister strike for

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:56.850 
modifying your sinister strike for
example<00:01:55.929> they<00:01:56.229> have<00:01:56.319> to<00:01:56.470> be<00:01:56.500> things<00:01:56.800> that

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
example they have to be things that

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.440 
example they have to be things that
might<00:01:57.069> benefit<00:01:57.429> different<00:01:57.729> types<00:01:57.910> of<00:01:58.060> classes

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
might benefit different types of classes

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.779 
might benefit different types of classes
so<00:01:59.259> an<00:01:59.349> example<00:01:59.440> of<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.890> rank<00:02:00.069> one<00:02:00.280> glyph<00:02:00.550> here

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
so an example of a rank one glyph here

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.580 
so an example of a rank one glyph here
is<00:02:00.910> reducing<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.899> duration<00:02:01.989> of<00:02:02.289> bleed<00:02:02.470> and

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
is reducing the duration of bleed and

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.320 
is reducing the duration of bleed and
stun<00:02:02.800> effects<00:02:03.099> which<00:02:03.399> can<00:02:04.000> obviously<00:02:04.179> be

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
stun effects which can obviously be

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.190 
stun effects which can obviously be
useful<00:02:04.660> in<00:02:04.750> certain<00:02:04.869> situations<00:02:07.110> here's<00:02:08.110> a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
useful in certain situations here's a

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.949 
useful in certain situations here's a
rank<00:02:08.410> two<00:02:08.590> example<00:02:09.360> bandages<00:02:10.360> heal<00:02:10.539> targets

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
rank two example bandages heal targets

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.020 
rank two example bandages heal targets
by<00:02:11.110> additional<00:02:11.500> amount

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.949 

but<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.209> don't<00:02:15.360> like<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.480> one<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.840> can

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
but if you don't like that one you can

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.509 
but if you don't like that one you can
take<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.200> fortification<00:02:16.860> talent<00:02:17.190> instead

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
take the fortification talent instead

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.339 
take the fortification talent instead
which<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:20.069> clicky<00:02:21.060> ability<00:02:21.450> with<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> longer

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
which is a clicky ability with a longer

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.170 
which is a clicky ability with a longer
cool<00:02:22.620> down<00:02:22.799> but<00:02:22.950> instant<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.489> lets<00:02:23.700> nearby

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
cool down but instant that lets nearby

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.289 
cool down but instant that lets nearby
allies<00:02:24.480> take<00:02:24.690> less<00:02:24.840> damage<00:02:24.870> for<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> little<00:02:25.769> bit

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
allies take less damage for a little bit

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.670 
allies take less damage for a little bit
so<00:02:27.299> you<00:02:27.390> can<00:02:27.420> see<00:02:27.510> these<00:02:27.780> are<00:02:27.840> game-changing

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
so you can see these are game-changing

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.009 
so you can see these are game-changing
in<00:02:28.799> Sun<00:02:28.980> sansom<00:02:29.459> once<00:02:30.239> you<00:02:30.390> get<00:02:30.540> these<00:02:30.750> you're

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
in Sun sansom once you get these you're

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.149 
in Sun sansom once you get these you're
going<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.200> be<00:02:31.260> you're<00:02:31.650> gonna<00:02:31.769> have<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:31.980> couple

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
going to be you're gonna have a couple

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.500 
going to be you're gonna have a couple
more<00:02:32.340> abilities<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.819> didn't<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.090> before<00:02:33.120> it

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
more abilities you didn't have before it

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.729 
more abilities you didn't have before it
could<00:02:33.629> have<00:02:33.750> access<00:02:34.049> to<00:02:34.140> different<00:02:34.260> power<00:02:34.530> you

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
could have access to different power you

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.830 
could have access to different power you
had<00:02:34.860> before<00:02:35.159> but<00:02:35.610> not<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.180> whole<00:02:36.269> new<00:02:36.690> level<00:02:37.049> I

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
had before but not a whole new level I

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.240 
had before but not a whole new level I
mean<00:02:39.840> here's<00:02:39.989> example<00:02:40.379> of<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.500> rank<00:02:40.709> 3<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.190> can

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
mean here's example of a rank 3 you can

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.050 
mean here's example of a rank 3 you can
see<00:02:41.430> they're<00:02:41.549> getting<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> little<00:02:41.879> more

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
see they're getting a little more

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.930 
see they're getting a little more
powerful<00:02:42.480> here<00:02:43.159> increases<00:02:44.159> the<00:02:44.459> damage<00:02:44.579> dealt

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
powerful here increases the damage dealt

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.479 
powerful here increases the damage dealt
following<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.660> critical<00:02:46.049> strike<00:02:46.319> so<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.340> can

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
following a critical strike so you can

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.280 
following a critical strike so you can
see<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.670> lot<00:02:47.849> of<00:02:47.879> dps<00:02:48.329> classes<00:02:48.750> might<00:02:48.900> want<00:02:49.109> this

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
see a lot of dps classes might want this

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.229 
see a lot of dps classes might want this
but<00:02:49.739> those<00:02:49.980> with<00:02:50.190> high<00:02:50.340> crit<00:02:50.670> might<00:02:50.879> want<00:02:51.150> it

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
but those with high crit might want it

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.229 
but those with high crit might want it
more<00:02:51.690> than<00:02:52.079> others<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.500> say<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.010> healer<00:02:54.000> tank

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
more than others and say a healer tank

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.729 
more than others and say a healer tank
might<00:02:54.569> not<00:02:54.690> find<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:55.019> one<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.260> attractive

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
might not find this one is attractive

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.650 
might not find this one is attractive
they<00:02:56.160> might<00:02:56.340> have<00:02:56.489> another<00:02:56.670> glyph<00:02:57.060> they<00:02:57.510> can

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
they might have another glyph they can

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.330 
they might have another glyph they can
pick<00:02:57.810> instead<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.319> rank<00:02:58.470> 3<00:02:58.769> or<00:02:58.980> they<00:02:59.220> may

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
pick instead and rank 3 or they may

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.890 
pick instead and rank 3 or they may
choose<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.549> whole<00:02:59.760> new<00:02:59.909> path<00:03:00.120> instead<00:03:05.120> now<00:03:06.120> one

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
choose a whole new path instead now one

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.789 
choose a whole new path instead now one
of<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.049> things<00:03:07.079> that's<00:03:07.260> important<00:03:07.709> is

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
of the things that's important is

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.289 
of the things that's important is
everyone<00:03:08.099> eventually<00:03:08.280> gets<00:03:08.760> their<00:03:08.970> their

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
everyone eventually gets their their

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.330 
everyone eventually gets their their
ancient<00:03:09.810> glyphs<00:03:09.989> this<00:03:10.560> isn't<00:03:10.859> supposed<00:03:11.069> to<00:03:11.190> be

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
ancient glyphs this isn't supposed to be

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.770 
ancient glyphs this isn't supposed to be
the<00:03:11.430> kind<00:03:11.579> of<00:03:11.700> thing<00:03:11.940> we're<00:03:12.150> really<00:03:12.599> really

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
the kind of thing we're really really

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.240 
the kind of thing we're really really
hardcore<00:03:13.140> players<00:03:13.440> have<00:03:13.769> access<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.159> the

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
hardcore players have access to the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.690 
hardcore players have access to the
feature<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:15.829> more<00:03:16.829> casual<00:03:17.250> players<00:03:17.489> never

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
feature and more casual players never

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.250 
feature and more casual players never
get<00:03:17.910> there<00:03:18.120> we<00:03:18.329> want<00:03:18.510> everyone<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.810> eventually

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
get there we want everyone to eventually

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.409 
get there we want everyone to eventually
get<00:03:19.380> there<00:03:19.620> get<00:03:20.040> there<00:03:20.099> glyphs<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:21.180> may<00:03:21.359> be

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
get there get there glyphs it may be

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.150 
get there get there glyphs it may be
more<00:03:21.630> like<00:03:21.690> raid<00:03:21.989> progression<00:03:22.230> where<00:03:22.680> the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
more like raid progression where the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.129 
more like raid progression where the
very<00:03:23.609> dedicated<00:03:23.880> hardcore<00:03:24.540> players<00:03:24.660> get<00:03:24.989> them

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
very dedicated hardcore players get them

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.870 
very dedicated hardcore players get them
faster<00:03:25.620> but<00:03:25.980> everyone<00:03:26.220> could<00:03:26.370> eventually<00:03:26.579> get

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
faster but everyone could eventually get

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.559 
faster but everyone could eventually get
there<00:03:28.669> the<00:03:29.669> goal<00:03:29.849> is<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.090> we<00:03:30.180> want<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.389> gate

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
there the goal is that we want to gate

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.240 
there the goal is that we want to gate

cool things is the concept of titans is

cool things is the concept of titans is
kind<00:04:16.810> of<00:04:16.870> expandable<00:04:17.440> we've<00:04:17.590> never<00:04:17.709> said

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
kind of expandable we've never said

kind of expandable we've never said
exactly<00:04:18.070> how<00:04:18.519> many<00:04:18.700> there<00:04:18.790> are<00:04:18.970> and<00:04:19.000> very<00:04:19.239> easy

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
exactly how many there are and very easy

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.330 
exactly how many there are and very easy
for<00:04:19.690> us<00:04:19.840> to<00:04:19.930> add<00:04:20.079> more<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.410> them<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:20.769> we<00:04:21.160> might

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
for us to add more of them so we might

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.520 
for us to add more of them so we might
add<00:04:21.489> whole<00:04:21.730> additional<00:04:22.210> paths<00:04:22.450> in<00:04:22.930> actual

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
add whole additional paths in actual

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.409 
add whole additional paths in actual
content<00:04:23.919> patches<00:04:24.280> so<00:04:24.820> maybe<00:04:25.000> when<00:04:25.150> cataclysm

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
content patches so maybe when cataclysm

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.420 
content patches so maybe when cataclysm
ships<00:04:25.900> you'll<00:04:26.110> get<00:04:26.260> three<00:04:26.950> paths<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.400> choose

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
ships you'll get three paths to choose

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.700 
ships you'll get three paths to choose
from<00:04:27.820> but<00:04:28.060> then<00:04:28.210> when<00:04:28.480> 4.1<00:04:29.110> comes<00:04:29.350> out<00:04:29.500> there's

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
from but then when 4.1 comes out there's

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.350 
from but then when 4.1 comes out there's
a<00:04:29.740> whole<00:04:29.860> new<00:04:30.010> path<00:04:30.220> you<00:04:30.639> can<00:04:30.820> choose<00:04:30.970> instead

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
a whole new path you can choose instead

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.920 
a whole new path you can choose instead
you<00:04:31.570> can<00:04:31.720> respect<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.230> that<00:04:32.320> path<00:04:33.900> thanks<00:04:34.900> a

you can respect to that path thanks a

you can respect to that path thanks a
lot
