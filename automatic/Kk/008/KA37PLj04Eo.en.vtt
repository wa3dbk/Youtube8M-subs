scrape target list is the result of a
footprint<00:00:16.240> factory<00:00:16.720> analysis<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:18.400> far<00:00:18.640> I've

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
footprint factory analysis so far I've

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.279 
footprint factory analysis so far I've
made<00:00:20.610> 95,000<00:00:21.610> almost<00:00:22.210> ninety<00:00:22.539> six<00:00:22.780> thousand

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
made 95,000 almost ninety six thousand

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.200 
made 95,000 almost ninety six thousand
submissions<00:00:23.470> and<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:25.090> have<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.980> over<00:00:27.210> 61,000

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
submissions and I have just over 61,000

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.929 
submissions and I have just over 61,000
verified<00:00:28.690> things<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:30.220> reason<00:00:30.490> this<00:00:30.760> is<00:00:30.820> so

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
verified things the reason this is so

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.819 
verified things the reason this is so
exciting<00:00:31.300> is<00:00:31.570> because<00:00:31.840> the<00:00:31.990> raw<00:00:32.169> scraped<00:00:32.559> list

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
exciting is because the raw scraped list

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.719 
exciting is because the raw scraped list
I'm<00:00:33.039> running<00:00:33.429> had<00:00:34.089> about<00:00:35.069> 830,000<00:00:36.069> URLs<00:00:36.519> in<00:00:36.579> it

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:36.729 
I'm running had about 830,000 URLs in it

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:39.029 
I'm running had about 830,000 URLs in it
so<00:00:37.210> that<00:00:37.569> means<00:00:37.870> that<00:00:38.079> about<00:00:38.559> eight<00:00:38.829> percent

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
so that means that about eight percent

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.250 
so that means that about eight percent
of<00:00:39.370> the<00:00:39.429> URLs<00:00:39.850> and<00:00:39.940> scraping<00:00:40.479> give<00:00:41.109> me

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
of the URLs and scraping give me

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.759 
of the URLs and scraping give me
verified<00:00:41.969> backlinks<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:44.559> that<00:00:44.710> in

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
verified backlinks for that in

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.529 
verified backlinks for that in
perspective<00:00:44.979> a<00:00:45.370> lot<00:00:45.519> of<00:00:45.639> people<00:00:45.969> only<00:00:46.299> get

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
perspective a lot of people only get

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.709 
perspective a lot of people only get
about<00:00:46.659> one<00:00:47.049> percent<00:00:47.499> with<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.399> raw<00:00:48.670> list<00:00:48.999> so

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
about one percent with a raw list so

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.469 
about one percent with a raw list so
eight<00:00:49.960> percent<00:00:50.289> is<00:00:50.379> pretty<00:00:50.829> amazing

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
eight percent is pretty amazing

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.459 
eight percent is pretty amazing
fortunately<00:00:52.479> I<00:00:52.569> do<00:00:52.629> record<00:00:53.049> a<00:00:53.109> lot<00:00:53.319> of<00:00:53.409> the

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
fortunately I do record a lot of the

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.949 
fortunately I do record a lot of the
process<00:00:53.889> I<00:00:54.039> followed<00:00:54.459> in<00:00:55.089> order<00:00:55.209> to<00:00:55.510> get<00:00:55.719> here

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:55.959 
process I followed in order to get here

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:58.079 
process I followed in order to get here
and<00:00:56.109> the<00:00:56.739> rest<00:00:56.920> of<00:00:56.979> the<00:00:57.069> tutorial<00:00:57.249> is<00:00:57.819> made<00:00:57.969> up

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
and the rest of the tutorial is made up

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.609 
and the rest of the tutorial is made up
of<00:00:58.179> different<00:00:58.329> recordings<00:00:58.929> I've<00:00:59.170> made<00:00:59.409> along

00:00:59.609 --> 00:00:59.619 
of different recordings I've made along

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:01.079 
of different recordings I've made along
the<00:00:59.679> way<00:00:59.799> here<00:01:00.489> the<00:01:00.639> some<00:01:00.850> of<00:01:00.909> the<00:01:00.940> results

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
the way here the some of the results

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.049 
the way here the some of the results
I've<00:01:01.449> got<00:01:01.690> from<00:01:02.079> using<00:01:02.589> this<00:01:02.679> strategy<00:01:03.059> it's

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
I've got from using this strategy it's

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.270 
I've got from using this strategy it's
pretty<00:01:04.570> much<00:01:04.720> all<00:01:04.930> GSA<00:01:05.379> links<00:01:05.770> there<00:01:05.920> are<00:01:06.040> some

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
pretty much all GSA links there are some

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.610 
pretty much all GSA links there are some
blog<00:01:07.120> network<00:01:07.480> links<00:01:07.810> in<00:01:07.900> there<00:01:08.080> as<00:01:08.230> well<00:01:08.260> but

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
blog network links in there as well but

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.890 
blog network links in there as well but
most<00:01:09.400> of<00:01:09.490> its<00:01:09.610> gsa<00:01:10.030> so<00:01:10.840> it's<00:01:11.080> this<00:01:12.180> 826<00:01:13.180> links

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
most of its gsa so it's this 826 links

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.790 
most of its gsa so it's this 826 links
and<00:01:14.310> these<00:01:15.480> 61,000<00:01:16.480> linking<00:01:16.960> to<00:01:17.110> it<00:01:17.140> this<00:01:17.680> is<00:01:17.770> a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
and these 61,000 linking to it this is a

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.740 
and these 61,000 linking to it this is a
new<00:01:18.040> website<00:01:18.250> and<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:19.120> rankings<00:01:19.480> will<00:01:19.570> check

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
new website and the rankings will check

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.510 
new website and the rankings will check
today<00:01:20.020> so<00:01:20.800> as<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:21.010> can<00:01:21.100> see<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.340> strategy

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
today so as you can see the strategy

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.900 
today so as you can see the strategy
does<00:01:21.910> work<00:01:22.260> even<00:01:23.260> though<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.980> general

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
does work even though the general

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.780 
does work even though the general
consensus<00:01:25.090> these<00:01:25.780> days<00:01:26.080> is<00:01:26.470> that<00:01:26.800> tiered<00:01:27.610> link

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
consensus these days is that tiered link

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.850 
consensus these days is that tiered link
building<00:01:27.910> and<00:01:28.480> gsa<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:29.260> not<00:01:29.440> effective

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
building and gsa and not effective

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.410 
building and gsa and not effective
anymore<00:01:29.950> you<00:01:30.760> can<00:01:30.880> see<00:01:30.970> they're<00:01:31.090> simply<00:01:31.390> not

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
anymore you can see they're simply not

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.280 
anymore you can see they're simply not
true<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.460> it's<00:01:33.700> early<00:01:33.970> days<00:01:34.120> yet<00:01:34.180> I<00:01:34.690> started

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
true so it's early days yet I started

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.080 
true so it's early days yet I started
less<00:01:35.440> than<00:01:35.470> two<00:01:35.770> weeks<00:01:35.920> ago<00:01:36.100> but<00:01:36.730> I<00:01:36.760> think<00:01:36.820> it's

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
less than two weeks ago but I think it's

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.520 
less than two weeks ago but I think it's
fair<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.330> say<00:01:37.480> that<00:01:37.660> this<00:01:37.960> strategy<00:01:38.500> is

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
fair to say that this strategy is

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.580 
fair to say that this strategy is
promising<00:01:39.900> there<00:01:40.900> are<00:01:40.960> several<00:01:41.140> ways<00:01:41.320> you<00:01:41.470> can

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
promising there are several ways you can

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.200 
promising there are several ways you can
approach<00:01:41.710> this<00:01:42.100> depending<00:01:42.670> what<00:01:42.820> tools<00:01:43.090> you

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
approach this depending what tools you

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.780 
approach this depending what tools you
have<00:01:43.270> you'll<00:01:43.870> need<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.409> web<00:01:44.650> scraper<00:01:45.040> so

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
have you'll need a web scraper so

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.980 
have you'll need a web scraper so
scrapebox<00:01:46.240> each<00:01:46.810> reference<00:01:47.370> Reaper<00:01:48.990> proxies

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
scrapebox each reference Reaper proxies

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.080 
scrapebox each reference Reaper proxies

and<00:02:05.759> finally<00:02:06.759> footprint<00:02:07.659> factory<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.500> can<00:02:08.649> do

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
and finally footprint factory you can do

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.620 
and finally footprint factory you can do
this<00:02:08.890> with<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:09.100> free<00:02:09.280> version<00:02:09.459> but<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.270> pro

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
this with a free version but the pro

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.930 
this with a free version but the pro
version<00:02:10.660> also<00:02:11.350> allows<00:02:11.740> you<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.190> create

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
version also allows you to create

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.300 
version also allows you to create
additional<00:02:13.330> filters<00:02:14.080> which<00:02:14.350> is<00:02:14.500> useful<00:02:14.680> if

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
additional filters which is useful if

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.080 
additional filters which is useful if
you're<00:02:15.610> using<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:16.090> trefor<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:17.050> am<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:18.190> what

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
you're using a trefor like I am so what

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.960 
you're using a trefor like I am so what
I'm<00:02:19.209> using<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.660> href<00:02:20.170> are<00:02:20.380> 300<00:02:21.280> free<00:02:21.489> proxies

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
I'm using is href are 300 free proxies

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.920 
I'm using is href are 300 free proxies

step<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.260> find<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.800> good<00:02:27.100> platform<00:02:27.430> or<00:02:27.850> CMS

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
step is to find a good platform or CMS

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.110 
step is to find a good platform or CMS
for<00:02:28.510> scraping<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.860> second<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.310> importing<00:02:30.970> and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
for scraping the second is importing and

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.300 
for scraping the second is importing and
running<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.450> list<00:02:31.660> in<00:02:31.840> footprint<00:02:32.620> factory<00:02:33.040> and

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
running a list in footprint factory and

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.979 
running a list in footprint factory and
then<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.060> third<00:02:34.180> step<00:02:34.420> is<00:02:34.510> filtering<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
then the third step is filtering the

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.630 
then the third step is filtering the
footprints<00:02:35.380> that<00:02:35.470> we<00:02:35.560> find<00:02:35.830> with<00:02:36.190> footprint

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
footprints that we find with footprint

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.690 
footprints that we find with footprint
factory<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.900> fourth<00:02:38.890> step<00:02:39.130> is<00:02:39.310> deciding

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
factory and the fourth step is deciding

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.270 
factory and the fourth step is deciding
on<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.600> footprint<00:02:41.530> strategy<00:02:42.040> because<00:02:42.190> as

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
on the footprint strategy because as

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.710 
on the footprint strategy because as
different<00:02:42.580> ways<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.760> can<00:02:42.940> combine<00:02:43.239> foot

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
different ways you can combine foot

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.220 
different ways you can combine foot
footprints<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.650> also<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.910> keywords<00:02:46.510> or<00:02:46.780> so

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
footprints and also the keywords or so

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.729 
footprints and also the keywords or so
exporting<00:02:48.040> options<00:02:48.630> step<00:02:49.630> 5<00:02:49.870> is<00:02:50.170> using<00:02:50.620> your

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
exporting options step 5 is using your

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.440 
exporting options step 5 is using your
footprint<00:02:51.160> list<00:02:51.340> with<00:02:51.519> your<00:02:51.640> web<00:02:51.790> scraper<00:02:52.120> i'm

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
footprint list with your web scraper i'm

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.990 
footprint list with your web scraper i'm
using<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.650> prefer<00:02:54.100> but<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.489> can<00:02:54.640> use<00:02:54.760> scrapebox

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
using a prefer but you can use scrapebox

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.949 
using a prefer but you can use scrapebox
and<00:02:55.450> then<00:02:56.049> step<00:02:57.040> 6<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.790> run<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.600> list<00:02:58.750> and

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
and then step 6 is to run the list and

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.259 
and then step 6 is to run the list and
test<00:02:59.260> for<00:02:59.470> successes<00:02:59.950> that<00:03:00.160> seems<00:03:01.090> like<00:03:01.209> a

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
test for successes that seems like a

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.390 
test for successes that seems like a
pretty<00:03:01.360> obvious<00:03:01.930> last<00:03:02.200> step<00:03:02.500> but<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.250> is

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
pretty obvious last step but it is

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.860 
pretty obvious last step but it is
somewhat<00:03:03.819> important<00:03:04.150> how<00:03:04.269> you<00:03:04.330> do<00:03:04.630> this

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
somewhat important how you do this

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.360 
somewhat important how you do this
because<00:03:05.140> that's<00:03:05.620> how<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:05.890> know<00:03:06.190> how

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
because that's how you know how

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.819 
because that's how you know how
successful<00:03:06.819> your<00:03:07.090> scrape<00:03:07.360> was<00:03:07.660> so<00:03:08.500> if<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.739> get

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
successful your scrape was so if you get

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.440 
successful your scrape was so if you get
the<00:03:08.950> last<00:03:09.130> bit<00:03:09.250> wrong<00:03:09.610> you<00:03:09.820> may<00:03:09.940> think<00:03:10.000> that

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
the last bit wrong you may think that

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.840 
the last bit wrong you may think that
you<00:03:10.660> had<00:03:10.840> poor<00:03:11.620> results<00:03:12.070> with<00:03:12.220> an<00:03:12.310> actual<00:03:12.549> fact

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
you had poor results with an actual fact

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.759 
you had poor results with an actual fact
you<00:03:13.420> did<00:03:13.600> everything<00:03:13.720> right<00:03:14.200> up<00:03:14.440> until<00:03:14.590> the

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
you did everything right up until the

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.300 
you did everything right up until the
last<00:03:15.010> stage<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:16.690> next<00:03:16.959> video<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.440> about<00:03:17.680> step

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
last stage the next video is about step

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.130 
last stage the next video is about step
one<00:03:18.340> which<00:03:18.910> is<00:03:18.970> choosing<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.450> single<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.900> MS

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
one which is choosing a single to the MS

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.930 
one which is choosing a single to the MS
and<00:03:20.350> as<00:03:20.739> a<00:03:20.980> whole<00:03:21.220> video<00:03:21.370> on<00:03:21.519> this<00:03:21.760> because

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
and as a whole video on this because

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.720 
and as a whole video on this because
it's<00:03:22.600> kind<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:23.049> open-ended<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.980> lot<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.489> people

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
it's kind of open-ended a lot of people

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.180 
it's kind of open-ended a lot of people
will<00:03:25.030> just<00:03:25.209> not<00:03:25.420> know<00:03:25.630> where<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:26.049> start<00:03:26.380> so<00:03:27.070> if

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
will just not know where to start so if

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.729 
will just not know where to start so if
you're<00:03:27.280> not<00:03:27.430> experienced<00:03:28.180> in<00:03:28.359> math<00:03:29.170> scraping

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
you're not experienced in math scraping

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.860 
you're not experienced in math scraping
and<00:03:29.859> mass<00:03:30.280> link<00:03:30.609> building<00:03:30.910> then<00:03:31.480> you'll<00:03:31.660> find

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
and mass link building then you'll find

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.640 
and mass link building then you'll find
it<00:03:32.019> really<00:03:32.200> useful<00:03:32.370> see<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.459> next<00:03:33.609> video
