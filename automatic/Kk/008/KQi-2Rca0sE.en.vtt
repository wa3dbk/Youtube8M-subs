00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
is a long long lens and the really

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.639 
is a long long lens and the really
unique<00:00:41.370> thing<00:00:41.760> about<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.120> SX<00:00:42.420> 50<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.350> lens

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
unique thing about the SX 50 is the lens

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.270 
unique thing about the SX 50 is the lens
is<00:00:43.860> very<00:00:44.340> good<00:00:44.940> both<00:00:45.539> at<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> wide<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.620> at

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
is very good both at the wide and at

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.209 
is very good both at the wide and at
that<00:00:47.640> long<00:00:48.030> 1200<00:00:48.780> millimeters<00:00:49.200> which<00:00:49.350> you'd<00:00:49.980> I

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
that long 1200 millimeters which you'd I

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.279 
that long 1200 millimeters which you'd I
wouldn't<00:00:50.730> have<00:00:50.820> thought<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.020> would<00:00:52.170> be

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
wouldn't have thought but that would be

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.080 
wouldn't have thought but that would be
the<00:00:52.410> case<00:00:52.590> prior<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.920> buying<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.430> SX<00:00:53.730> 50

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
the case prior to buying the SX 50

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.220 
the case prior to buying the SX 50
because<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.840> would<00:00:54.960> think<00:00:55.110> you

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
because you just you would think you

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.760 
because you just you would think you
can't<00:00:55.530> get<00:00:56.059> that<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.050> price<00:00:58.289> you

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
can't get that for that price you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.069 
can't get that for that price you
wouldn't<00:00:59.640> think<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.719> know<00:01:00.780> usually<00:01:01.050> you

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
wouldn't think that you know usually you

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.020 
wouldn't think that you know usually you
give<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.410> pay<00:01:01.559> for<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.100> actually<00:01:02.579> you

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
give it you pay for it and actually you

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.630 
give it you pay for it and actually you
don't<00:01:03.180> here<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.690> more<00:01:03.960> than<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.439> pay<00:01:04.589> for

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
don't here you get more than you pay for

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.280 
don't here you get more than you pay for

reasons why I think I want the Fuji s1
over<00:01:14.400> my<00:01:14.580> SX<00:01:14.970> 50<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.570> think<00:01:15.990> I'm<00:01:16.049> gonna<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.320> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
over my SX 50 I think I'm gonna have to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.130 
over my SX 50 I think I'm gonna have to
test<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.130> s-1<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.720> buy<00:01:18.869> one

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
test out the s-1 and I have to buy one

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.399 
test out the s-1 and I have to buy one
shoot<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.619> against<00:01:19.950> my<00:01:20.070> SX<00:01:20.580> 50<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:22.080> my

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
shoot it against my SX 50 but I think my

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.249 
shoot it against my SX 50 but I think my
SX<00:01:23.009> 50<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.689> auction<00:01:24.840> block

is<00:01:28.710> getting<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.130> little<00:01:29.310> old<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> tooth

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
is getting a little old in the tooth

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.260 
is getting a little old in the tooth
it's<00:01:31.259> actually<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:31.740> very<00:01:31.770> old<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.939> it's

it's actually not very old it's it's

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.940 
it's actually not very old it's it's
like<00:01:33.930> what's<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.290> been<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.770> little

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
like what's it been out for a little

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.510 
like what's it been out for a little
over<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.159> year<00:01:35.250> maybe<00:01:36.049> but<00:01:37.280> in<00:01:38.280> these<00:01:38.460> days

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
over a year maybe but in these days

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.230 
over a year maybe but in these days
that's<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.360> long<00:01:39.540> time<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.500> we've<00:01:41.040> got<00:01:41.280> eight

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
that's a long time so we've got eight

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.710 
that's a long time so we've got eight
reasons<00:01:42.950> first<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.100> all<00:01:44.250> we've<00:01:44.610> got<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:45.149> being

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
reasons first of all we've got one being

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.340 
reasons first of all we've got one being
the<00:01:46.290> sensor<00:01:46.799> we've<00:01:47.640> got<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> newer<00:01:48.180> sensor<00:01:48.750> 16

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the sensor we've got a newer sensor 16

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.289 
the sensor we've got a newer sensor 16
megapixels<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.399> 1<00:01:50.750> over<00:01:51.750> 2/3<00:01:52.200> inch<00:01:52.439> sensor

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
megapixels it's a 1 over 2/3 inch sensor

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.649 
megapixels it's a 1 over 2/3 inch sensor
versus<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.450> 12<00:01:54.780> megapixel<00:01:55.020> same<00:01:55.649> size<00:01:55.860> sensor

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
versus the 12 megapixel same size sensor

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.840 
versus the 12 megapixel same size sensor
for<00:01:57.659> physical<00:01:57.990> size<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.649> SX<00:01:58.979> 50<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.640> we<00:01:59.670> got

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
for physical size in the SX 50 so we got

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.010 
for physical size in the SX 50 so we got
4<00:02:00.060> more<00:02:00.210> megapixels<00:02:00.600> out<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:02.159> fuji<00:02:02.700> s1<00:02:03.299> but

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
4 more megapixels out of the fuji s1 but

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.709 
4 more megapixels out of the fuji s1 but
with<00:02:04.380> Fugees

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
with Fugees

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.290 
with Fugees
sensors<00:02:06.719> they<00:02:06.960> tend<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> get<00:02:07.530> really<00:02:07.710> nice<00:02:08.429> low

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
sensors they tend to get really nice low

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.660 
sensors they tend to get really nice low
light<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.750> really<00:02:10.170> fine<00:02:10.440> detail<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.550> I'm

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
light and really fine detail so I'm

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.370 
light and really fine detail so I'm
expecting<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.360> not<00:02:12.510> only<00:02:12.660> are<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:12.930> getting

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
expecting that not only are we getting

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.470 
expecting that not only are we getting
for<00:02:13.590> more<00:02:13.770> megapixels<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.610> think<00:02:15.150> we're<00:02:15.300> gonna

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
for more megapixels I think we're gonna

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.020 
for more megapixels I think we're gonna
see<00:02:15.840> better<00:02:16.680> performance<00:02:17.340> out<00:02:17.490> of<00:02:17.670> those<00:02:17.730> 4

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
see better performance out of those 4

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.330 
see better performance out of those 4
that's<00:02:18.570> 16<00:02:18.780> megapixel<00:02:19.560> sensor<00:02:19.860> then<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.100> get

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
that's 16 megapixel sensor then I get

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.240 
that's 16 megapixel sensor then I get
out<00:02:20.460> of<00:02:20.550> my<00:02:20.670> my<00:02:21.150> canon<00:02:21.720> sx<00:02:22.140> v<00:02:22.380> ii<00:02:22.590> which<00:02:23.040> i've

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
out of my my canon sx v ii which i've

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.890 
out of my my canon sx v ii which i've
been<00:02:23.280> i've<00:02:23.610> been<00:02:23.670> quite<00:02:24.000> happy<00:02:24.150> with<00:02:24.420> they

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
been i've been quite happy with they

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.550 
been i've been quite happy with they
both<00:02:25.140> shoot<00:02:25.380> RAW<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.010> s-1<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:27.210> SX<00:02:27.600> 50<00:02:28.020> so

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
both shoot RAW the s-1 and the SX 50 so

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.860 
both shoot RAW the s-1 and the SX 50 so
we<00:02:29.070> both<00:02:29.310> got<00:02:29.550> both<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.060> them<00:02:30.180> have<00:02:30.360> the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
we both got both of them have the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.780 
we both got both of them have the
advantage<00:02:31.320> there<00:02:31.590> over<00:02:31.950> other<00:02:32.190> cameras<00:02:32.670> in

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
advantage there over other cameras in

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.010 
advantage there over other cameras in
the<00:02:32.850> sense<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.210> shoot<00:02:33.420> raw<00:02:33.660> which<00:02:33.900> I

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
the sense of the shoot raw which I

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.620 
the sense of the shoot raw which I
really<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:34.380> about<00:02:34.410> my<00:02:34.680> SX<00:02:35.070> 50<00:02:35.400> but<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.210> s-1

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
really like about my SX 50 but the s-1

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.880 
really like about my SX 50 but the s-1
does<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.260> think<00:02:37.530> we're<00:02:37.620> gonna<00:02:37.710> have<00:02:37.830> a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
does it and I think we're gonna have a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.510 
does it and I think we're gonna have a
better<00:02:38.040> sensor<00:02:38.600> lens<00:02:39.600> quality<00:02:40.250> remains<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.490> be

better sensor lens quality remains to be

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.150 
better sensor lens quality remains to be

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
the ISO range that this tells us they're

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.240 
the ISO range that this tells us they're
more<00:04:06.210> comfortable<00:04:06.540> with<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.650> performance<00:04:08.160> of

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
the sensor meaning that I think it will

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.730 
the sensor meaning that I think it will
be<00:04:10.370> better<00:04:11.370> than<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:12.210> SX<00:04:12.630> 50<00:04:13.080> not<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:13.710> I

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
be better than the SX 50 not that I

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.470 
be better than the SX 50 not that I

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
would use it at those high-end ranges

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.390 
would use it at those high-end ranges
but<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:15.990> it'll<00:04:16.200> have<00:04:16.320> better<00:04:16.590> detail<00:04:17.100> and

just<00:05:48.990> by<00:05:49.020> looking<00:05:49.440> at<00:05:49.500> it<00:05:49.680> and<00:05:50.400> I've<00:05:50.910> always

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
just by looking at it and I've always

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.030 
just by looking at it and I've always
been<00:05:51.360> very<00:05:51.660> very<00:05:51.870> careful<00:05:52.680> with<00:05:52.800> it<00:05:53.010> and

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
been very very careful with it and

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.860 
been very very careful with it and
apprehensive<00:05:53.580> to<00:05:53.880> take<00:05:54.030> it<00:05:54.180> out<00:05:54.270> in<00:05:54.420> any<00:05:54.540> type

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
apprehensive to take it out in any type

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.530 
apprehensive to take it out in any type
of<00:05:54.900> precipitation<00:05:55.800> but<00:05:55.980> we've<00:05:56.700> got<00:05:56.880> a<00:05:56.910> dust

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
of precipitation but we've got a dust

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.090 
of precipitation but we've got a dust
and<00:05:57.750> weather<00:05:57.930> resistant<00:05:58.440> body<00:05:58.560> on<00:05:58.830> the<00:05:58.980> ass

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
and weather resistant body on the ass

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.120 
and weather resistant body on the ass
one<00:05:59.580> so<00:06:00.150> that<00:06:00.360> is<00:06:00.630> very<00:06:00.990> nice<00:06:01.320> lots<00:06:01.800> I<00:06:01.980> think

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
one so that is very nice lots I think

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.740 
one so that is very nice lots I think
that<00:06:02.220> over<00:06:02.400> 70<00:06:02.820> weather<00:06:03.030> seals<00:06:03.330> or<00:06:03.510> something

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
that over 70 weather seals or something

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.120 
that over 70 weather seals or something
they<00:06:03.870> said<00:06:04.050> so<00:06:04.260> that<00:06:04.440> that's<00:06:04.740> something<00:06:04.980> to

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
they said so that that's something to

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.670 
they said so that that's something to
look<00:06:05.220> forward<00:06:05.490> to<00:06:05.670> also<00:06:06.570> number<00:06:07.110> eight<00:06:07.350> on<00:06:07.650> the

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
look forward to also number eight on the

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.880

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
on the SX 50 these days I think

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.510 
on the SX 50 these days I think
everybody<00:06:13.500> should<00:06:13.590> be<00:06:13.800> putting<00:06:13.980> built-in

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
everybody should be putting built-in

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.370 
everybody should be putting built-in
Wi-Fi<00:06:14.970> into<00:06:15.390> their<00:06:15.510> cameras<00:06:15.900> it's<00:06:16.080> just<00:06:16.290> the

Wi-Fi into their cameras it's just the

didn't happen to have the card and you
could<00:06:38.430> catch<00:06:38.610> them

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 
could catch them

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:40.829 
could catch them

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
but you can on the SX 50 a lot of memory

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:44.760 
but you can on the SX 50 a lot of memory
but<00:06:43.629> it<00:06:43.779> might<00:06:43.900> save<00:06:44.169> you<00:06:44.319> and<00:06:44.409> that<00:06:44.559> that

but it might save you and that that

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.140 
but it might save you and that that
thing<00:06:45.039> that's<00:06:45.249> why<00:06:45.339> I'm<00:06:45.460> gonna<00:06:45.550> count<00:06:45.819> it<00:06:45.909> as<00:06:46.029> a

full point anyways there's eight good
points<00:06:49.270> why<00:06:49.569> I<00:06:49.990> want<00:06:50.889> to<00:06:51.219> get<00:06:51.669> the<00:06:51.789> s-1<00:06:52.199> over<00:06:53.199> my

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:53.379

SX<00:06:53.710> fifty<00:06:54.069> want<00:06:54.610> to<00:06:54.669> try<00:06:54.879> it<00:06:54.939> out<00:06:55.059> against<00:06:55.479> it

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:55.569 
SX fifty want to try it out against it

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:57.869 
SX fifty want to try it out against it
make<00:06:55.779> sure<00:06:55.809> because<00:06:56.379> the<00:06:57.069> one<00:06:57.309> thing<00:06:57.520> I<00:06:57.610> really

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879 
make sure because the one thing I really

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:00.149 
make sure because the one thing I really
like<00:06:58.059> about<00:06:58.089> my<00:06:58.360> SX<00:06:58.779> 50<00:06:59.139> is<00:06:59.319> that<00:06:59.680> it's<00:06:59.830> very

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:00.159 
like about my SX 50 is that it's very

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:02.399 
like about my SX 50 is that it's very
good<00:07:00.460> lens<00:07:00.939> quality<00:07:01.449> on<00:07:01.629> both<00:07:01.809> the<00:07:01.960> long<00:07:02.169> end

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:02.409 
good lens quality on both the long end

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:04.559 
good lens quality on both the long end
and<00:07:02.559> the<00:07:02.649> wide<00:07:02.830> end<00:07:03.159> making<00:07:03.699> it<00:07:03.909> a<00:07:03.999> very<00:07:04.330> nice

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:04.569 
and the wide end making it a very nice

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:07.139 
and the wide end making it a very nice
ultrazoom<00:07:05.259> as<00:07:05.499> long<00:07:05.889> as<00:07:06.069> that<00:07:06.249> is<00:07:06.460> equivalent

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:07.149 
ultrazoom as long as that is equivalent

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:09.689 
ultrazoom as long as that is equivalent
on<00:07:07.509> the<00:07:07.569> s1<00:07:08.169> all<00:07:08.529> these<00:07:08.889> other<00:07:09.069> factors<00:07:09.339> are

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:09.699 
on the s1 all these other factors are

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:12.089 
on the s1 all these other factors are
gonna<00:07:09.789> trump<00:07:10.360> the<00:07:10.599> SX<00:07:10.930> 50<00:07:11.349> terribly<00:07:11.830> so<00:07:11.979> I'm

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:12.099 
gonna trump the SX 50 terribly so I'm

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:14.790 
gonna trump the SX 50 terribly so I'm
probably<00:07:12.399> gonna<00:07:12.969> sell<00:07:13.270> it<00:07:13.419> what<00:07:14.349> do<00:07:14.409> you<00:07:14.469> think

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
probably gonna sell it what do you think

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.529 
probably gonna sell it what do you think
you<00:07:14.949> have<00:07:15.039> and<00:07:15.189> SX<00:07:15.490> fifty<00:07:15.879> interested<00:07:16.389> in<00:07:16.449> the
