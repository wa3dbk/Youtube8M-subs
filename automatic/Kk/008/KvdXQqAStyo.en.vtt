00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.350
 today 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:16.250
 today, hello everybody, I 've been daniel ferreira 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:22.060
 the body and today would be teaching 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:25.699
 for you a magic with par 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.670
 so people here is the revelation of 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.609
 magic the drunken deck 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.489
 If you did not see what magic is, I will. 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.530
 leaving the link up here gives a 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.499
 look there in that magic 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.780
 This video here will be paused after 

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:47.569
 You come back to learn the beauty effect. 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.120
 this magic is the following you get the 

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:53.239
 normal packing pack even does not have 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.359
 mystery is an ordinary deck you go 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.889
 give the cards to a person to choose 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:08.060
 opening a mac or moving the cards 

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:15.230
 simply passing the person 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:22.070
 speak for so here you go and give 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:24.230
 letter to person see what is iacc you 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.760
 will control the person's letter to the 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.340
 top of the deck 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.290
 If you do not know how to control the 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.430
 person to the top of the deck 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:38.210
 I'll leave the link here teaching how 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.800
 control the person's card up or down. 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.880
 down from the deck 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.190
 The technique I used was this here. 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.470
 person chose the letter 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.659
 I pick up the letter and let it begin. 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.620
 so the first letter pulls it away. 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.840
 stay here a little far 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.660
 and the others I'm putting in the same 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.280
 place as if it had shuffled that 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.600
 is a technique that teaching in this video 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.090
 there after having seized 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.850
 team after you have shuffled you 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.060
 put everything together and this letter you put 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.570
 first it will stay a little apart 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:25.700
 O then here you come and pull to 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:28.040
 Up doing this gives a cut and you have 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.250
 automatically the letter from the person 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.290
 top of the deck 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.930
 after passing the letter to the top you go 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.290
 pass down the deck 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.110
 just pull it here 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:47.210
 and does it as if he had and 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.650
 shuffling the deck making beauty of 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.260
 quick way 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.480
 the deck doing it quickly 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.420
 going to stay really gives the impression of 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.430
 that you're messing with and after 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.540
 to have done that the person's house comes to 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.570
 the top 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.420
 if you want to continue shuffling 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.130
 hold here and pull the rest of the pack 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.120
 You'll be leaving her house. 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.459
 always down 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.360
 so she will never leave here because 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:21.340
 You'll be holding on she's always 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.930
 here and there you keep scrambling 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.400
 can you bluntly scold 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.320
 to prefer 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.470
 She'll be here, you'll go home. 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.850
 her and there you intertwine the other 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.739
 letters and no matter what shape you 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.290
 You'll always be against a 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:44.380
 person's house to the bottom of the deck 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:47.239
 after you finish shuffling 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.000
 Are you going to do the following? 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.690
 show that the deck is normal and will 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.080
 start making it difficult to scramble 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:01.370
 will start shuffling the deck of this 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.390
 The way you are going 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.799
 We took a cookie meat on top and 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.250
 turning the rest of the deck 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:13.250
 take a little letter to come and go 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.549
 rest of the pack on top of the hill always 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:21.949
 I saw her a little bit more. 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:24.979
 and passes via a little and turn passes 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:28.040
 a little more and turns coming at the end 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:31.220
 you spend all but the last when 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.039
 to turn does not come from above will come down 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.130
 and places this letter as that of the person in 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:40.810
 What did you end up doing in the 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:44.389
 truth did you actually do 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.760
 only two things you left a little 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.660
 hunting down and a little bit of 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:55.360
 letter writes up 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:58.840
 here the loads are turned 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.930
 I work from here up the letters are 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:07.280
 face up and this one is the only one 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.560
 letter that is face down 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.930
 together with the letter face up to 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.510
 Only thing you will do is come 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.380
 here in some cookie from above and show 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.740
 that you have the cards in front of you 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.770
 there you go there at the end and it shows that you have 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.220
 coast load with front and then you 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.680
 seek the medium that is not so difficult to 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.930
 looking for the medium you show that neither 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.449
 letters shore a coast 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.599
 at this moment the only thing you have 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:41.060
 to do is drive to the deck when you 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.610
 show that you only have a car that also has 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.440
 letters back to back you do not 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.630
 return the deck that way you 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.660
 give it back like this 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:54.139
 so you will be automatically 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.699
 unpacking all this deck that the 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.460
 person's letter is 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:02.690
 you will be diverting all the deck and 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.599
 leaving one's home being the only 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:08.240
 instead 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:10.460
 ready the whole deck is back to normal 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.360
 so if you start looking for the 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.940
 letters 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.680
 you will see 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:20.310
 the jack of gold is the only card to the 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.310
 contrary 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:28.150
 so when you do this you make a 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.050
 The maid's suspense in the deck is in the 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.910
 finger 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:35.320
 if you know how to do it here you do 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:38.350
 too and that's it goes your imagination 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:42.490
 then shows that the only letter to the 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:48.310
 contrary the person had chosen in the 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:49.960
 beginning and this is how the magic of 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:56.500
 pack 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:57.310
 Thanks for watching. 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.450
