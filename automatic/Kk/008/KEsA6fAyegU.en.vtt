00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello youtube meinersmann orange helps 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.940
 and I have a question for you what to do 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.710
 you look for one 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.679
 had to prepare similar examination and 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.599
 no bock it has right to it 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.859
 the woman is already doing more testing in 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.330
 minecraft like i have a 7 segment 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.160
 So it's not quite seven segment 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.539
 taken to the display accuracy is 80 times calls 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.650
 Display that I have built here 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:30.060
 from the normal 8 421 code as well 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.510
 4 bit binary code is known there 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.550
 behind a number represented and the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.680
 runs as follows so i want to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.780
 do not explain how the whole thing 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.730
 how it is structured but not so 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.050
 go into detail that is everyone understands 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.539
 So I just want to show it 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.940
 because it might be interesting 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.890
 is interesting for you too is that 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.600
 But it will be here right now 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.010
 totally no matter when you get the number back there 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.079
 can still recognize 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.550
 here we have the 84 the two and the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.379
 once that means every switch has one 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.109
 certain value if I the switch 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.159
 press the two eg then appears there 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.900
 2 on the front of the board how great we are 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.760
 See the two so little I hope you can 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.850
 can recognize if I now the four 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.880
 to press then I calculate quasi or 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.720
 The pc counts four plus two are six 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.659
 or 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.549
 it is not calculated but that is 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.920
 just so you can not somehow here 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.080
 day make wonderful day is set 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.270
 I can not say more about it now 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.640
 Can I give another 1 then 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.140
 So we would have the 7 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.150
 Now if I get the two back the way 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.270
 take and the eight should then lead 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.880
 we have to come at 13 and when I 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.310
 All stop and then come 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.950
 we on the nice number 15 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.229
 that means we have exactly four son 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.009
 switches have exactly 16 options 0 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.229
 to 15 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.689
 and all around you to show the times 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.610
 how that is constructed then looks like 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.470
 follows out I have tried the whole 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.430
 not over each other but next to each other 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.950
 to build 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.530
 I think I'll start with it 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.420
 the the whole technique here 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.170
 to explain pay display 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.629
 So fact, the 1 is the one before that 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.350
 the than 10 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:14.200
 yes, the tens of quasi applies 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.030
 then there is nothing but 1 and the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.650
 once either there or not there 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.750
 The whole thing is about a signal 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.950
 controlled he has a signal for 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.890
 the 1 and there are just the slopes 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.400
 pulled out then we have one 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.500
 signal for the 21 somehow the two go 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.360
 exactly one signal for the two for the 3d 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.670
 4d 5d 6 7 and 8 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.870
 I have defined myself and 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.390
 Although I had to go in there now 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.480
 For us we have the once that 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.160
 Of course, the only one stands in front 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.970
 we have the two these are those three 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.030
 blocks of flats here we have the four the 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.280
 three that is that the four would be there the 5 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.780
 Do we have the six there is the seven? 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.640
 minister and the eight is there that is 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.350
 a definitional thing son now 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.990
 I set myself and settled 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.730
 I can see here right now 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.170
 is somehow missing a strip of wolbecker 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.690
 segal I have back later to 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.310
 sets expected billed expected 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.620
 have completely reckoned on her sheet sequence 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.630
 just to find out which ones 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.000
 logical circuit i need from around 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.690
 four switches to get 8 signals 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.610
 and somehow something came out of here 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.240
 and then I have it as logical 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.950
 I also implemented it 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.740
 try the note here somewhere 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.780
 I have heard here are ok 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.360
 she quickly determines her mind 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.310
 chit gedÃ¶ns and although I have 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.860
 get out that the logical 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.630
 circuits so the logical ones 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.470
 logical circuits for the first 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:49.780
 segment is quasi a and b or a and c 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:54.370
 we assume that the switch 8 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.750
 is b 4 c 2 and d 1 i wanted now 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.380
 not pay even more about 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.180
 handling 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.830
 I probably would have different 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.170
 but it does not matter 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.330
 I have virtually the inputs as abcd 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.920
 denoted and the outputs as 1 to 8 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:13.600
 so have said that a and b or a and c 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.850
 are to be taken together or in parentheses 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.180
 close and in brackets b or c 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.940
 that means I have alone and once 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.540
 I once have b and c and the whole 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.730
 is and linked and linked 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.350
 Here I come through exactly and 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.600
 linkage we have as we first 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.450
 we invert both signals 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.150
 here and the whole on an inverted 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.250
 signal lead and that is the case here 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.880
 We'll take a look here below 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.840
 why does this exist here at all 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.600
 I do not know why I roll it 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.650
 has sat down okay here is again 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.120
 well it does not matter that's just awesome 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.360
 maybe music would not have 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.670
 I hope we have this signal 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.340
 that comes from the aaa and then we have 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.870
 the b or c signal what is coming there what 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.420
 each is invested and only if 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:09.090
 both signals are on, too 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.380
 exactly because they are then invested as 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.700
 the whole thing works with the 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.200
 I have already explained switching 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.630
 in another video 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.040
 I wanted it as I said only show times 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.480
 as well as I have that a bit 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.880
 of course I have labeled here 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:25.910
 also masses over there 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:29.670
 laid and age the music goes off yes 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.460
 because you have to grow music the music grows 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:35.910
 fix that is not possible 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.380
 thanks that was just so and 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.300
 Accordingly, you have one here 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.590
 giant circuit good giant circuit 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.500
 is that not yet there are people too 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.180
 they have built a calculator 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.680
 minecraft will probably do that 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.060
 his next thing I take in attack 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.770
 If I then test my technique 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.060
 I just wanted to finish 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.910
 show that this is possible 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.560
 Anything is possible if you want is 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.820
 Of course partly 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.650
 you could also tell me that I 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.050
 partly really stupid solved and that 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.740
 I could have done better 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.510
 but then I think about you doing 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.220
 even if I do as I do 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.710
 do then I do so and now but 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.780
 eight +1 is 9 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.730
 the funny thing is that's five or six 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.930
 took hours in this sense 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.550
 I say goodbye again 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.050
 I tell you paint from the half 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.550
 Maybe I could not help today 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.500
 but I was able to show you what she did 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.250
 everything goes in minecraft and how cool that 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.690
 whole is actually if you are bock 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.340
 then subscribe me or then 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.440
 click on like on facebook and so on 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.370
 while you are here the nice bats 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.590
 squealing stops 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.699
 The reason now they have just got up in 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.940
 this sense until next time 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:40.940
 bye
