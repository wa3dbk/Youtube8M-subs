00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
p.m. 30 all right so the next device

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.420 
p.m. 30 all right so the next device
that<00:04:29.050> I'm<00:04:29.169> going<00:04:29.530> to<00:04:29.560> set<00:04:30.490> up<00:04:30.669> is<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.360> Patriot

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
that I'm going to set up is the Patriot

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.080 
that I'm going to set up is the Patriot
wireless<00:04:33.430> and<00:04:33.639> USB<00:04:33.970> adapter<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:35.020> so<00:04:35.880> this<00:04:36.880> is

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
wireless and USB adapter and so this is

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.230 
wireless and USB adapter and so this is
a<00:04:37.120> fairly<00:04:37.720> inexpensive<00:04:38.639> device<00:04:39.639> and<00:04:40.030> it<00:04:40.150> was

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
a fairly inexpensive device and it was

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.680 
a fairly inexpensive device and it was
really<00:04:40.449> meant<00:04:40.750> for<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:41.940> Patriot<00:04:42.940> box<00:04:43.240> office
