to create a nice circle next I'm going
to<00:00:32.520> come<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.880> here<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.300> draw<00:00:33.630> four<00:00:34.440> lines

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
to come in here and draw four lines

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:45.010 
to come in here and draw four lines
these<00:00:36.510> lines<00:00:36.780> will<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.020> curved<00:00:37.620> one<00:00:39.770> two<00:00:42.680> three

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
these lines will be curved one two three

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.560 
these lines will be curved one two three
four<00:00:46.370> so<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.520> these<00:00:47.670> four<00:00:48.000> lines<00:00:48.180> notice

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
four so I have these four lines notice

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.110 
four so I have these four lines notice
that<00:00:48.780> these<00:00:48.960> ones<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:50.100> one<00:00:50.309> here<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that these ones this one here it's a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.340 
that these ones this one here it's a
little<00:00:51.270> bit<00:00:51.390> thicker<00:00:51.690> then<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> get<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> little

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
little bit thicker then I get a little

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.229 
little bit thicker then I get a little
bit<00:00:52.469> thinner<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.160> little<00:00:53.309> bit<00:00:53.579> thinner<00:00:53.850> yet

bit thinner and a little bit thinner yet

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.170 
bit thinner and a little bit thinner yet
it<00:00:55.110> moves<00:00:55.620> away<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.250> near<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.879> one's<00:00:57.120> a

it moves away this is near this one's a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.139 
it moves away this is near this one's a
little<00:00:57.239> bit<00:00:57.420> further<00:00:58.079> away<00:00:58.699> now<00:00:59.699> from<00:00:59.910> this

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
little bit further away now from this

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.700 
little bit further away now from this
line<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.750> line<00:01:00.899> we're<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> draw

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
line to this line we're going to draw

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.179 
line to this line we're going to draw
another<00:01:02.520> curved<00:01:03.270> line<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.660> curved<00:01:04.110> line

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
another curved line this curved line

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.359 
another curved line this curved line
dips<00:01:05.189> down<00:01:05.580> notice<00:01:06.090> how<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.570> curves<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.740> this

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
dips down notice how it curves in this

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.109 
dips down notice how it curves in this
direction

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
direction

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.109 
direction
these<00:01:10.110> ones<00:01:10.439> curved<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.040> your<00:01:11.189> right<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:14.119> want

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
these ones curved to your right I want

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.190 
these ones curved to your right I want
to<00:01:15.180> make<00:01:15.270> sure<00:01:15.299> these<00:01:15.540> lines<00:01:15.750> come<00:01:15.960> all<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
to make sure these lines come all the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.890 
to make sure these lines come all the
way<00:01:16.229> down<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.850> line<00:01:20.000> now<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.299> will<00:01:21.570> come<00:01:21.780> in

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
way down to this line now I will come in

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.310 
way down to this line now I will come in
here<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.350> draw<00:01:22.880> two<00:01:23.880> lines<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:25.110> line

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
here and draw two lines I have one line

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.890 
here and draw two lines I have one line
here<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:26.970> how<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.119> curves<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
here you can see how that curves and

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.380 
here you can see how that curves and
another<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.159> other<00:01:29.280> ones<00:01:29.549> peak<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.270> on

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
another one the other ones peak right on

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.149 
another one the other ones peak right on
the<00:01:30.540> other<00:01:30.659> side<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.229> don't<00:01:31.380> really<00:01:31.740> you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the other side you don't really you

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.640 
the other side you don't really you
don't<00:01:32.310> see<00:01:32.520> these<00:01:32.700> lines<00:01:32.909> they<00:01:33.259> go<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
don't see these lines they go to the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.270 
don't see these lines they go to the
other<00:01:34.770> side<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.490> volleyball<00:01:37.220> now<00:01:38.220> we

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
other side of this volleyball now we

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.920 
other side of this volleyball now we
need<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.670> draw<00:01:39.920> two<00:01:40.920> lines<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.600> one

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
need to draw two lines it's really one

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.130 
need to draw two lines it's really one
line<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.590> then<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.280> line<00:01:44.520> here<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.140> see

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
line and then this line here you see

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.969 
line and then this line here you see
just<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.560> little<00:01:46.860> bit<00:01:47.189> don't<00:01:47.310> see<00:01:47.579> all<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.820> it

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
just a little bit don't see all of it

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.100 
just a little bit don't see all of it
and<00:01:49.979> then<00:01:50.610> from<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.060> end<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.540> need<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.780> draw

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
and then from this end you need to draw

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.300 
and then from this end you need to draw
a<00:01:52.439> few<00:01:53.430> more<00:01:53.490> curved<00:01:53.880> lines<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.390> curved<00:01:54.720> line

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
a few more curved lines this curved line

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.780 
a few more curved lines this curved line
curves<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.520> your<00:01:56.640> left

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
curves to your left

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.810 
curves to your left
too

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.609 

three<00:02:03.289> and<00:02:04.289> we<00:02:04.859> are<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.340> draw<00:02:05.609> one<00:02:06.030> more

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.470 

and<00:02:10.619> then<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.099> line<00:02:11.879> right<00:02:12.060> here<00:02:12.269> at<00:02:12.360> this

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
and then this line right here at this

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.070 
and then this line right here at this
corner<00:02:12.780> curves<00:02:13.530> in<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.099> direction<00:02:15.080> and

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
corner curves in this direction and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.449 
corner curves in this direction and
there's<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.379> line<00:02:16.739> that<00:02:16.980> we're<00:02:17.129> going<00:02:17.280> to

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
there's this line that we're going to

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.830 
there's this line that we're going to
erase<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:18.209> don't<00:02:18.360> need<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.690> line<00:02:18.930> anymore

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
erase we don't need that line anymore

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.890 
erase we don't need that line anymore
