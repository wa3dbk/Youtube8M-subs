progress the first boot is going to take

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.850 
progress the first boot is going to take
a<00:03:27.490> little<00:03:27.760> while<00:03:27.970> at<00:03:28.960> this<00:03:29.170> point<00:03:29.470> it's<00:03:29.650> going

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
a little while at this point it's going

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.850 
a little while at this point it's going
through<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:31.080> setting<00:03:32.080> everything<00:03:32.290> up<00:03:32.530> fresh
