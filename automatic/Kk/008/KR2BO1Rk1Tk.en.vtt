I<00:00:03.360> am<00:00:03.930> Jerry<00:00:04.290> doing<00:00:04.740> 36<00:00:05.729> years<00:00:05.970> old<00:00:06.180> I<00:00:06.539> have

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
I am Jerry doing 36 years old I have

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.499 
I am Jerry doing 36 years old I have
been<00:00:07.379> telling<00:00:07.620> his<00:00:07.919> land<00:00:08.220> for<00:00:08.490> about<00:00:08.730> 14<00:00:09.480> years

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:09.509 
been telling his land for about 14 years

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.339 
been telling his land for about 14 years
now<00:00:10.290> we<00:00:11.129> are<00:00:11.309> using<00:00:11.519> this<00:00:11.910> BT<00:00:12.389> corn<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:13.049> same

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
now we are using this BT corn the same

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.160 
now we are using this BT corn the same
way<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:13.860> used<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.219> do<00:00:14.400> conventionally<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:16.049> as

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
way we used to do conventionally just as

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.439 
way we used to do conventionally just as
we<00:00:16.350> planned<00:00:16.530> other<00:00:16.890> seats<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:18.180> only

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
we planned other seats the only

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.720 
we planned other seats the only
difference<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:19.050> how<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.439> cultivated<00:00:20.279> on<00:00:20.550> it

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
difference is how we cultivated on it

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.810 
difference is how we cultivated on it
with<00:00:21.210> BT<00:00:21.630> corn<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:22.740> are<00:00:22.949> quite<00:00:23.279> sure<00:00:23.580> that

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
with BT corn we are quite sure that

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.029 
with BT corn we are quite sure that
after<00:00:24.060> planting<00:00:24.599> an<00:00:24.929> irrigation<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.890> guy

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
after planting an irrigation in the guy

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.730 
after planting an irrigation in the guy
we<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.550> now<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:27.359> leave<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.019> wait<00:00:28.410> for

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
we can now just leave it and wait for

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.829 
we can now just leave it and wait for
the<00:00:28.859> harvest<00:00:29.369> time<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:30.330> no<00:00:30.480> longer<00:00:30.509> use

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:30.839 
the harvest time we no longer use

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.799 
the harvest time we no longer use
pesticides<00:00:31.700> then<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.059> more<00:00:33.270> time<00:00:33.540> to

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
pesticides then we have more time to

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.680 
pesticides then we have more time to
attend<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.350> other<00:00:34.559> work<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.010> at<00:00:35.670> times<00:00:36.000> visit

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
attend to other work and at times visit

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.770 
our friends in their houses we have been
using<00:00:40.289> it<00:00:40.530> for<00:00:40.559> two<00:00:40.950> years<00:00:41.280> now<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.879> has<00:00:42.539> been

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
using it for two years now it has been

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.779 
using it for two years now it has been
about<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.110> twenty<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.980> thirty<00:00:44.309> percent

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
about a twenty to thirty percent

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.260 
about a twenty to thirty percent
increase<00:00:45.480> from<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.870> previous<00:00:45.989> yield<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.270> want

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
increase from the previous yield I want

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.779 
increase from the previous yield I want
my<00:00:48.360> son<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.899> take<00:00:49.140> education<00:00:49.379> seriously<00:00:50.340> an

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
my son to take education seriously an

my son to take education seriously an
increased<00:00:51.539> yield<00:00:51.870> will<00:00:52.230> make<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.649> possible

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
increased yield will make that possible

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.330 
increased yield will make that possible
he<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.000> just<00:00:54.270> three<00:00:54.660> years<00:00:54.690> old<00:00:55.109> now<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.680> by

the time he goes to school he will have

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.400 
the time he goes to school he will have
enough<00:00:58.890> money<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.430> stay<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.699> school<00:01:00.410> another

enough money to stay in school another
benefit<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.980> biotech<00:01:02.670> corn<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:03.750> do

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
benefit of biotech corn is that we do

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.900 
benefit of biotech corn is that we do
not<00:01:04.050> have<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.620> burn<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> residue<00:01:05.520> in<00:01:05.790> our

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
not have to burn the residue in our

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.300 
not have to burn the residue in our
harvest<00:01:06.360> anymore<00:01:06.870> we<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.920> allow<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
harvest anymore we just allow the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.880 
harvest anymore we just allow the
residue<00:01:08.940> to<00:01:09.210> decompose<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> field<00:01:10.560> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
residue to decompose in the field to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.940 
residue to decompose in the field to
become<00:01:11.250> fertilizers<00:01:12.120> our<00:01:12.990> former<00:01:13.410> practice

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
become fertilizers our former practice

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.340 
become fertilizers our former practice
was<00:01:14.190> to<00:01:14.220> burn<00:01:14.670> them<00:01:14.940> with<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.510> help<00:01:15.690> of<00:01:15.810> VT

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
was to burn them with the help of VT

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.200 
was to burn them with the help of VT
this<00:01:16.650> will<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:17.010> have<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> same<00:01:17.580> adverse

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
this will not have the same adverse

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.900 
this will not have the same adverse
effects<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.990> our<00:01:19.110> environment<00:01:19.520> if<00:01:20.520> there<00:01:20.820> were

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
effects in our environment if there were

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.650 
effects in our environment if there were
no<00:01:21.120> BT<00:01:21.480> corn<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.050> would<00:01:22.590> not<00:01:22.770> plant<00:01:23.100> again<00:01:23.660> after

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
no BT corn I would not plant again after

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.630 
no BT corn I would not plant again after
realizing<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.440> difference<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.040> makes<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.520> our

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
realizing the difference it makes in our

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.300 
realizing the difference it makes in our
harvest<00:01:27.090> why<00:01:27.900> would<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.230> use<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.650> conventional

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
harvest why would I use the conventional

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.820 
harvest why would I use the conventional
way<00:01:29.520> when<00:01:29.850> there<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.210> BT<00:01:30.480> corn<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.290> give<00:01:31.470> us<00:01:31.650> a

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
way when there is BT corn to give us a

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.370 
way when there is BT corn to give us a
good<00:01:32.010> harvest<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.850> would<00:01:33.480> borrow<00:01:33.750> money<00:01:34.050> or

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
good harvest I would borrow money or

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.650 
good harvest I would borrow money or
sell<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.830> land<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.370> there<00:01:35.580> was<00:01:35.730> no<00:01:35.910> BT<00:01:36.210> corn

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
sell the land and there was no BT corn

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.770 
sell the land and there was no BT corn
to<00:01:37.080> make<00:01:37.230> ends<00:01:37.500> meet<00:01:37.860> maybe<00:01:38.700> those<00:01:39.000> people<00:01:39.510> who

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
to make ends meet maybe those people who

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.010 
to make ends meet maybe those people who
oppose<00:01:40.400> biotechnology<00:01:41.400> do<00:01:42.120> not<00:01:42.300> know<00:01:42.480> all<00:01:42.690> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
oppose biotechnology do not know all the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.140 
oppose biotechnology do not know all the
good<00:01:43.200> things<00:01:43.440> it<00:01:43.710> has<00:01:43.830> done<00:01:44.160> for<00:01:44.430> us<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:44.940> we

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
good things it has done for us but we

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.690 
good things it has done for us but we
can<00:01:45.360> never<00:01:45.660> questioned<00:01:46.350> their<00:01:46.500> principles<00:01:47.070> we

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
can never questioned their principles we

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
can never questioned their principles we
should<00:01:47.910> respect<00:01:48.330> their<00:01:48.540> principles<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.560> at

should respect their principles but at

should respect their principles but at
the<00:01:49.920> same<00:01:50.160> time<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:51.120> can<00:01:51.150> also<00:01:51.450> fight<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.320> ours

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the same time we can also fight for ours

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.270 
the same time we can also fight for ours
but<00:01:53.100> then<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.280> know<00:01:53.400> you<00:01:53.490> put<00:01:53.640> melanotan
