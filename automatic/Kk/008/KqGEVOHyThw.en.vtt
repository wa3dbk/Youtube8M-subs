00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.150 
know trash cans will have mold around it
this<00:04:06.030> is<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.209> boil<00:04:06.480> water<00:04:06.720> with<00:04:06.900> tea<00:04:07.590> bags<00:04:07.829> in<00:04:08.040> it

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
this is a boil water with tea bags in it

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.940 
this is a boil water with tea bags in it
and<00:04:08.609> I<00:04:08.760> added<00:04:08.970> 1<00:04:09.359> cup<00:04:09.389> sugar<00:04:09.959> in<00:04:10.200> this<00:04:10.350> and<00:04:10.829> I'm

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
and I added 1 cup sugar in this and I'm

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.099 
and I added 1 cup sugar in this and I'm
going<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.370> squeeze<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.209> tea<00:04:12.389> bag<00:04:12.569> salt<00:04:12.900> and

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
going to squeeze the tea bag salt and

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:21.500 
going to squeeze the tea bag salt and
pour<00:04:13.260> it<00:04:13.440> in<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.590> container<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:19.310> once<00:04:20.310> that<00:04:21.299> is

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
pour it in a container and once that is

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:29.070 
pour it in a container and once that is
the<00:04:21.630> recipe

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:06:00.250 

I'm<00:04:30.080> going<00:04:30.350> to<00:04:41.080> and<00:04:42.080> I'm<00:05:30.460> going<00:05:31.460> to<00:05:37.660> so<00:05:59.260> that's

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
I'm going to and I'm going to so that's

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
important you know how calm project is

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.300 
important you know how calm project is
so<00:06:02.510> you<00:06:02.600> can<00:06:02.780> find<00:06:03.290> out<00:06:03.410> when<00:06:03.620> it<00:06:03.710> is<00:06:03.830> done<00:06:04.070> it

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
so you can find out when it is done it

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.370 
so you can find out when it is done it
usually<00:06:04.910> takes<00:06:05.180> about<00:06:05.300> seven<00:06:05.840> to<00:06:05.960> eight<00:06:05.990> days

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
usually takes about seven to eight days

temperature in winter it takes a little
longer

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.210

any a bit of lips or anything and
insects<00:06:42.110> like<00:06:42.410> this<00:06:42.620> so<00:06:42.830> you<00:06:42.890> have<00:06:42.980> to<00:06:43.160> cover

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:43.820 
insects like this so you have to cover

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.670 
insects like this so you have to cover
with<00:06:44.120> this<00:06:44.300> after<00:06:44.870> five<00:06:45.110> days<00:06:45.320> you<00:06:45.380> should

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
with this after five days you should

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.880 
with this after five days you should
start<00:06:45.980> tasting<00:06:46.250> it<00:06:47.050> if<00:06:48.050> you<00:06:48.200> don't<00:06:48.410> have<00:06:48.500> any

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
start tasting it if you don't have any

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.070 
start tasting it if you don't have any
experience<00:06:49.370> in<00:06:50.060> combat<00:06:50.330> yeah<00:06:50.660> but<00:06:50.810> the<00:06:50.900> best

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
experience in combat yeah but the best

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.750 
experience in combat yeah but the best
thing<00:06:51.290> to<00:06:51.320> do<00:06:51.530> is<00:06:51.680> probably<00:06:51.950> check<00:06:52.460> the<00:06:52.580> pee

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:52.760 
thing to do is probably check the pee

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.970 
thing to do is probably check the pee
which<00:06:52.970> the<00:06:53.510> ideal<00:06:53.840> pH<00:06:54.140> for<00:06:54.530> the<00:06:54.590> computer

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:54.980 
which the ideal pH for the computer

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.600 
which the ideal pH for the computer
should<00:06:55.430> be<00:06:55.580> between<00:06:56.090> 2.5<00:06:56.630> and<00:06:57.260> 3.1<00:06:58.010> so<00:06:58.370> it's

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
should be between 2.5 and 3.1 so it's

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.580 
should be between 2.5 and 3.1 so it's
very<00:06:58.730> easy<00:06:58.880> to<00:06:59.150> taste<00:06:59.600> it<00:06:59.870> and<00:07:00.080> never<00:07:00.380> actually

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:00.590 
very easy to taste it and never actually

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.030 
very easy to taste it and never actually
said<00:07:01.100> the<00:07:01.280> players<00:07:01.520> because<00:07:01.940> I<00:07:01.970> was<00:07:02.180> able<00:07:02.330> to

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.040 
said the players because I was able to

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:12.730 
said the players because I was able to
taste<00:07:04.040> it<00:07:04.520> all<00:07:04.670> comes<00:07:04.970> with<00:07:05.150> experience<00:07:11.740> 0.5%

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:12.740 
taste it all comes with experience 0.5%

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.740
