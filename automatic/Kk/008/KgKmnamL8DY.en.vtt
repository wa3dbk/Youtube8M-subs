00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.919
 all listeners get their order warned 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.199
 Euro too 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.659
 following wife Ursel to body 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.350
 about him on the Internet is the exchange 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.350
 and replaced by a higher capacity 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.680
 We need many things for the conversion 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.660
 1 2 cents piece a small cross piece of screwdriver one 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.930
 Screwdriver Trox p8 and a new hard drive in the format 2 come 5 inches 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.640
 Destination year 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.080
 Before the conversion you should secure the entire content of the internal hard drive 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.530
 an external hard drive can be used, for example, via USB or via 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.670
 Firewire years closed with the help of the Migration Assistant of the Mac OS 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.860
 let's play the old data on the new record but now to work 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.240
 So that the surface of the MacBook does not scratch you should put it on a soft 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.540
 For example, place a cloth under the base 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.400
 First you have to remove the battery, we need the coin 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.740
 Now the screwdriver is used 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.670
 Loosen the three small screws in the battery compartment. The screws are fixed 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.270
 can not be completely removed 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.270
 If all three screws are loosened you can remove the metal cover 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.310
 the hard disk is located on the side of the device 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.560
 she is just plugged in with the help of the white plastic table app you can get her 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.630
 simply pull out the hard drive is on a metal mounting 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.539
 Frame he serves as a mechanical protection for the hard disk as a shield and 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.189
 As a holder for the plastic bottle the frame comes with four Trox screws 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.620
 attached to the disk with the death shrub with real one turns all four 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.739
 Screw out completely 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.480
 give them 8 that they will not lose any of the rascals they are very small 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.989
 now one can divine from the hard drive 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.379
 the new hard disk and you can now hear in reverse order it can be 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.409
 use every two and a half inches of SATA disks 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.560
 even those with 7200 revolutions per minute 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.969
 these are faster but are a bit warmer 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.969
 However, the heat development is limited 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.129
 When installing the new plate make sure that the white Plastic Logic 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.129
 points upwards 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:55.339
 There is still a small hurdle when mounting the message cover too 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:57.099
 overcome 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.409
 The cover is provided on the back with small foam padding 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.489
 all too easily you can pinch this during assembly 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.010
 Use the small screwdriver around the upholstery during assembly 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.010
 to press something down 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.639
 after they have tightened the three small screws they can 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.639
 also insert the battery again 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.559
 That's all for today 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:43.119
