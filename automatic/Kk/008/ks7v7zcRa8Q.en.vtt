scratch<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:26.100> mean<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.420> kind<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.750> just<00:02:27.900> common

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
scratch I mean it's kind of just common

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.260 
scratch I mean it's kind of just common
sense<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.010> if<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.760> put<00:02:29.970> all<00:02:30.090> those<00:02:30.209> things

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
sense and if you put all those things

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.699 
sense and if you put all those things
together<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:31.800> can<00:02:31.950> run<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.160> lot<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.459> balls<00:02:33.709> what

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
together you can run a lot of balls what

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.320

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
I like about that you had a nice simple

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.540 
I like about that you had a nice simple
shot<00:02:36.690> then<00:02:36.959> go<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.470> break<00:02:37.650> ball<00:02:37.950> which<00:02:38.250> is

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
shot then go to the break ball which is

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.790 
shot then go to the break ball which is
the<00:02:39.270> key<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.480> straight<00:02:39.870> pull<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.380> last<00:02:40.560> few

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
balls you definitely don't want to be

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.910
