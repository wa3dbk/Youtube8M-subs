00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.430
 and good to all those commenting 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.160
 distracted gameplay of modern warfare 3 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.700
 but nevertheless today I do not come at all 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.830
 to speak so by fher 3 but from 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.429
 all the previous cases concretely 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.070
 of the chorus z and 4 and the color 25 which 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:22.130
 right now they are practically unplayable 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.249
 I do not know if you have seen the video that goes 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.749
 for a couple of days for portu no 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.489
 I had started doing nothing about it 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:31.369
 nothing about in terms of making a 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.840
 video but good I think it is 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.050
 well that we realize and above all 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.120
 that we can do anything to 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.829
 fix and that this after all 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.000
 back up will end up happening in all 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.829
 games that are falling behind is 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.809
 say in all with the videos that remain 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.530
 obsolete that are outdated that 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.679
 let's say so much forgotten then 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.469
 then it's with the vitis and the people are going 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:57.710
 to start cheating tricks hacks 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.999
 etcetera and in this way will prevent 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.679
 that people can enjoy the game 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:04.309
 I do not know if you have played the color once 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:06.290
 24 or 5 but if you played two years ago 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.770
 or three years and now you want to go back to 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.750
 to play 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.399
 you will realize that you can not 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.909
 play is full of hacks it was full 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.310
 from practically 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.689
 people that I do not know what the list does because 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.950
 I dont know 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.439
 I do not see the grace that people make 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.390
 that this guy who is here looking at me 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.909
 will lock in truth is that I do not know what it does 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.560
 people do not know what is the intention of 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.600
 people when it comes to annoying 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.810
 bother if the team gives life in 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.259
 it or they enjoy the truth bothering 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.509
 to people I do not know I personally do not 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.969
 I have fun like that and I think that a lot of 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.950
 normal people do not do it so nothing 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:45.310
 I leave you in the description of the video 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.000
 to which I refer anyone who 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.010
 carry playing 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.140
 a considerable number of years to this 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.080
 fire even a couple of years 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.170
 I would know that it's not okay to leave 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.420
 thrown away the games and more than 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.040
 they are not games which companies 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.500
 have gone bankrupt or the companies 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.479
 directly can not cope 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.310
 those games but they are simply 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.050
 deliveries prior to these charges that 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.970
 we are playing that is the call of duty 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.320
 4 is the same company which I believe 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.140
 the reflector model and the modern 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.300
 warfare 3 and at the same time also the same 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.160
 move between the black ops and the 105 are 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.200
 practically the same companies the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.210
 which is not worth investing in 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.530
 previous games which continue 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.640
 having players because points to a 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.280
 previous game 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.660
 despite being hacked the game still 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.010
 having people and still there 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.440
 players that are playing so I 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.110
 I do not see the truth read why not 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.250
 fix them so the truth give you a 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.700
 eye to the video 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.040
 basically it's summed up in making a 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.290
 appeal to the whole community of people 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.390
 who plays to try to fix this and 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.390
 it's good if you look a little more for the 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.370
 people that we played and I think it was a 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.950
 the video After you thinking 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.980
 making scarce and that was necessary as well 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.410
 that with this I say goodbye to the clown 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.330
 that is here behind me playing the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.570
 noses to see if they leave me locked in 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.850
 with a streak of 32 33 34 I do not know when 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.020
 put on exactly but good with this 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.459
 They say goodbye I hope you liked it 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.560
 the video that you vote, I like it 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.200
 favorites I want to spend friends and 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.890
 also the video below 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.890
 goodbye
