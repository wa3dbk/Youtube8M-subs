load and shoot it is web there web there

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.329 
load and shoot it is web there web there
and<00:00:47.489> then<00:00:48.210> place<00:00:48.809> your<00:00:48.839> sand<00:00:50.569> there<00:00:51.569> so<00:00:52.339> webs

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
and then place your sand there so webs

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.610 
and then place your sand there so webs
on<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> bottom<00:00:53.850> row<00:00:54.059> webs<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.019> top<00:00:55.229> row<00:00:55.469> and

on the bottom row webs in top row and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.649 
on the bottom row webs in top row and
then<00:00:55.710> sand<00:00:56.030> make<00:00:57.030> sure<00:00:57.179> you<00:00:57.269> have<00:00:57.449> whatever

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
then sand make sure you have whatever

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.059 
then sand make sure you have whatever
you're<00:00:57.870> stacking<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.409> cannons<00:00:58.769> should<00:00:58.889> work

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069 
you're stacking this cannons should work

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:01.489 
you're stacking this cannons should work
up<00:00:59.249> to<00:00:59.370> about<00:00:59.399> eighty<00:00:59.839> and<00:01:00.839> then<00:01:00.899> it'll<00:01:01.170> start

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
up to about eighty and then it'll start

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:03.500 
up to about eighty and then it'll start
to<00:01:01.620> screw<00:01:01.859> up<00:01:01.979> if<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.879> want<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.089> upgrade<00:01:03.210> it

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
to screw up if you want to upgrade it

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.460 
to screw up if you want to upgrade it
just<00:01:03.659> add<00:01:03.839> more<00:01:04.229> dispensers<00:01:04.949> here<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.780> it

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
just add more dispensers here and it

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.830 
just add more dispensers here and it
doesn't<00:01:07.740> use<00:01:07.860> any<00:01:07.890> torches<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.660> actually

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
doesn't use any torches so it actually

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.720 
doesn't use any torches so it actually
it<00:01:10.260> uses<00:01:10.620> three<00:01:10.860> torches<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:11.340> that's<00:01:11.550> the

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.730 
it uses three torches but that's the

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.220 
it uses three torches but that's the
only<00:01:11.910> place<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.330> uses<00:01:12.540> torches<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.110> whole

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
only place it uses torches on the whole

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.900 
only place it uses torches on the whole
cannon<00:01:13.910> so<00:01:14.910> everything<00:01:15.720> else<00:01:15.870> here<00:01:16.910> timings

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
cannon so everything else here timings

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.640 
cannon so everything else here timings
are<00:01:18.030> perfect<00:01:18.420> timings<00:01:18.780> are<00:01:18.960> all<00:01:19.110> fully<00:01:19.320> set

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
are perfect timings are all fully set

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.710 
are perfect timings are all fully set
everything's<00:01:20.280> fine<00:01:20.640> let's<00:01:21.420> shoot<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.600> one

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
everything's fine let's shoot it one

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:34.330 
everything's fine let's shoot it one
more<00:01:21.870> time

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.050 

perfect<00:01:35.149> and<00:01:35.890> if<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:37.159> need<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.340> modify<00:01:37.939> for

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
perfect and if you need to modify for

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.109 
perfect and if you need to modify for
distance<00:01:39.189> just<00:01:40.189> go<00:01:40.430> over<00:01:40.610> here<00:01:40.759> and<00:01:40.820> add<00:01:41.060> a

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
distance just go over here and add a

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.120 
distance just go over here and add a
tick<00:01:41.450> here<00:01:41.689> if<00:01:42.140> it's<00:01:42.320> not<00:01:42.500> working<00:01:42.890> at<00:01:43.100> a

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
tick here if it's not working at a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.010 
tick here if it's not working at a
longer<00:01:43.490> distance<00:01:43.610> like<00:01:44.000> if<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.299> TNT<00:01:44.630> blows<00:01:44.840> up

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
longer distance like if the TNT blows up

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.149 
longer distance like if the TNT blows up
before<00:01:45.229> hits<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.500> wall<00:01:45.649> that<00:01:45.710> kind<00:01:45.890> of<00:01:45.979> things

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
before hits the wall that kind of things

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.639 
before hits the wall that kind of things
to<00:01:46.310> out<00:01:46.369> of<00:01:46.520> tick<00:01:46.640> here<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.930> slab<00:01:48.170> bust<00:01:48.470> is

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
to out of tick here the slab bust is

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.630 
to out of tick here the slab bust is
right<00:01:48.829> here<00:01:49.070> and<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:51.439> hammer<00:01:51.649> is<00:01:51.890> here<00:01:52.100> this

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
right here and the hammer is here this

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.149 
right here and the hammer is here this
is<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:52.850> hammer<00:01:53.030> propulsion<00:01:53.689> this<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.679> all<00:01:55.039> the

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
is the hammer propulsion this is all the

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.120 
is the hammer propulsion this is all the
booster<00:01:55.520> for<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.700> TNT<00:01:56.200> this<00:01:57.200> is<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.619> sand

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
booster for the TNT this is the sand

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.060 
booster for the TNT this is the sand
compression<00:01:58.840> puts<00:01:59.840> it<00:01:59.960> right<00:02:00.110> here<00:02:00.320> falls<00:02:00.890> on

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
compression puts it right here falls on

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.020 
compression puts it right here falls on
that<00:02:01.100> web<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:02.500> this<00:02:03.500> is<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:04.280> extra<00:02:04.820> piece<00:02:05.000> of

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
that web and this is the extra piece of

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.449 
that web and this is the extra piece of
sand<00:02:05.329> that<00:02:05.479> hybrids<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.950> hammer<00:02:07.159> comes

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
sand that hybrids and the hammer comes

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.500 
sand that hybrids and the hammer comes
out<00:02:07.640> here<00:02:07.909> pushes<00:02:08.720> out<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.110> shoots<00:02:09.440> off<00:02:09.649> so

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
out here pushes out and shoots off so

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.729 
out here pushes out and shoots off so
you<00:02:11.510> got<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.750> make<00:02:11.870> sure<00:02:12.049> if<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.350> want<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.650> do

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
you got to make sure if you want to do

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:13.990 
you got to make sure if you want to do
the<00:02:12.890> one<00:02:13.010> shot<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.310> have<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.519> make<00:02:13.640> sure<00:02:13.670> this

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
the one shot you have to make sure this

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.150 
the one shot you have to make sure this
is<00:02:14.150> loaded<00:02:14.480> as<00:02:14.600> well<00:02:14.810> this<00:02:15.560> just<00:02:15.709> comes<00:02:15.950> off<00:02:16.100> of

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
is loaded as well this just comes off of

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.530 
is loaded as well this just comes off of
this<00:02:16.370> wiring<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:17.140> yeah<00:02:18.170> shoot<00:02:18.500> oh<00:02:18.769> I<00:02:18.950> guess

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
this wiring and yeah shoot oh I guess

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.640 
this wiring and yeah shoot oh I guess
it's<00:02:20.540> er<00:02:20.630> yeah<00:02:20.900> there's<00:02:21.049> another<00:02:21.200> wall<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.500> hit

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
it's er yeah there's another wall to hit

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.830 
it's er yeah there's another wall to hit
is<00:02:22.519> there<00:02:22.760> I<00:02:22.790> don't<00:02:23.030> there's<00:02:23.180> no<00:02:23.299> sand<00:02:23.599> up
