now<00:00:50.360> and<00:00:50.780> I<00:00:51.079> have<00:00:51.199> loved<00:00:51.469> every<00:00:51.590> second<00:00:52.280> of<00:00:52.370> it

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
now and I have loved every second of it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.510 
now and I have loved every second of it
the<00:00:52.940> high<00:00:53.120> FPS<00:00:53.530> graphics<00:00:54.530> and<00:00:54.680> possibilities

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
the high FPS graphics and possibilities

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.490 
the high FPS graphics and possibilities
are<00:00:55.670> just<00:00:55.699> overwhelming<00:00:56.539> to<00:00:56.690> me<00:00:56.719> so<00:00:56.870> this

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
are just overwhelming to me so this

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.869 
are just overwhelming to me so this
video<00:00:57.770> is<00:00:57.829> not<00:00:57.920> going<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.340> be<00:00:58.520> about<00:00:58.609> me

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
video is not going to be about me

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.639 
video is not going to be about me
rambling<00:00:59.420> about<00:00:59.510> my<00:00:59.780> history<00:00:59.930> with<00:01:00.230> video

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
rambling about my history with video

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.610 
rambling about my history with video
games<00:01:00.949> but<00:01:01.520> rather<00:01:01.699> a<00:01:01.820> console<00:01:02.449> vs<00:01:02.840> pc<00:01:03.079> type<00:01:03.469> of

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
games but rather a console vs pc type of

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.650 
games but rather a console vs pc type of
video<00:01:03.859> and<00:01:04.190> what<00:01:04.460> i<00:01:04.670> think<00:01:05.000> is<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.449> true

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
video and what i think is the true

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.200 
video and what i think is the true
winner<00:01:05.840> between<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.470> two<00:01:06.759> so<00:01:07.759> let's<00:01:07.789> start

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
winner between the two so let's start

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.120 
winner between the two so let's start
with<00:01:08.300> console<00:01:08.869> they're<00:01:09.200> extremely<00:01:09.590> cheap<00:01:09.979> to

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
with console they're extremely cheap to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.740 
with console they're extremely cheap to
get<00:01:10.280> running<00:01:10.580> an<00:01:10.729> average<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.210> about<00:01:11.300> five

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
get running an average of about five

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.840 
get running an average of about five
hundred<00:01:11.960> dollars<00:01:12.350> per<00:01:12.590> unit<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.429> other<00:01:13.640> than

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
hundred dollars per unit so other than

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.150 
hundred dollars per unit so other than
the<00:01:14.000> price<00:01:14.300> what<00:01:14.630> does<00:01:14.810> console<00:01:15.320> have<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.770> PC

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
the price what does console have the PC

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.669 
the price what does console have the PC
doesn't<00:01:16.399> well<00:01:17.240> for<00:01:17.539> one<00:01:17.750> everyone<00:01:18.410> that<00:01:18.560> plays

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
doesn't well for one everyone that plays

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.620 
doesn't well for one everyone that plays
on<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:18.950> console<00:01:19.340> is<00:01:19.550> running<00:01:19.970> with<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.149> exact

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630

on a console is running with the exact
same<00:01:20.840> hardware<00:01:21.350> now<00:01:21.979> this<00:01:22.099> is<00:01:22.160> a<00:01:22.310> huge<00:01:22.700> benefit

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
same hardware now this is a huge benefit

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.330 
same hardware now this is a huge benefit
to<00:01:23.209> the<00:01:23.450> console<00:01:23.929> side<00:01:24.140> of<00:01:24.289> gaming<00:01:24.709> I've<00:01:24.860> had

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340

to the console side of gaming I've had
my<00:01:25.520> fair<00:01:25.729> share<00:01:25.789> of<00:01:26.060> frustration<00:01:26.750> with<00:01:26.899> my<00:01:27.080> FPS

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
my fair share of frustration with my FPS

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.830 
my fair share of frustration with my FPS
sometimes<00:01:28.099> dropping<00:01:28.580> below<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.000> 60<00:01:29.420> mark<00:01:29.660> on

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
sometimes dropping below the 60 mark on

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.230 
sometimes dropping below the 60 mark on

PC so to know that everyone is running
the<00:01:32.479> same<00:01:32.959> exact<00:01:33.349> hardware<00:01:33.800> and<00:01:34.069> getting<00:01:34.369> the

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:34.489 
the same exact hardware and getting the

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:37.270 
the same exact hardware and getting the

player<00:01:37.700> now<00:01:38.360> on<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.630> downside<00:01:39.110> having<00:01:39.530> a

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
player now on the downside having a

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.589 
player now on the downside having a
locked<00:01:39.920> framerate<00:01:40.340> can<00:01:40.729> sometimes<00:01:41.090> be<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.300> bad

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599 
locked framerate can sometimes be a bad

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:43.809 
locked framerate can sometimes be a bad
thing<00:01:41.630> especially<00:01:42.140> if<00:01:42.860> it<00:01:42.979> is<00:01:43.099> stuck<00:01:43.340> at<00:01:43.489> 30

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
thing especially if it is stuck at 30

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.940 
thing especially if it is stuck at 30
now<00:01:44.420> when<00:01:44.599> I<00:01:44.630> switched<00:01:44.959> from<00:01:45.259> really<00:01:45.619> low<00:01:45.800> FPS

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
now when I switched from really low FPS

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.160 
now when I switched from really low FPS
to<00:01:46.459> really<00:01:46.700> high<00:01:46.940> FPS<00:01:47.149> it<00:01:47.750> made<00:01:48.050> a<00:01:48.080> huge

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
to really high FPS it made a huge

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.169 
to really high FPS it made a huge
difference<00:01:48.500> in<00:01:49.039> the<00:01:49.130> quality<00:01:49.280> of<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.880> game<00:01:50.060> I

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
difference in the quality of the game I

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.809 
difference in the quality of the game I
played<00:01:50.509> now<00:01:51.140> consoles<00:01:51.590> also<00:01:51.950> use<00:01:52.160> controllers

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
played now consoles also use controllers

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.029 
played now consoles also use controllers
instead<00:01:53.239> of<00:01:53.360> keyboard<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:53.959> mouse<00:01:54.110> now<00:01:54.830> one

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
instead of keyboard and mouse now one

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.650 
instead of keyboard and mouse now one
thing<00:01:55.069> I<00:01:55.340> hated<00:01:55.610> about<00:01:55.849> controllers<00:01:56.360> was

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
thing I hated about controllers was

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.109 
thing I hated about controllers was
sticking<00:01:57.170> thumbsticks<00:01:57.830> now<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:58.429> did<00:01:58.789> make<00:01:59.000> it

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
sticking thumbsticks now I did make it

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.820 
sticking thumbsticks now I did make it
really<00:01:59.420> difficult<00:01:59.450> to<00:02:00.080> stand<00:02:00.440> still

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
really difficult to stand still

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.249 
really difficult to stand still
sometimes<00:02:01.190> in<00:02:01.550> games<00:02:01.580> not<00:02:02.509> on<00:02:02.629> the<00:02:02.750> downside
