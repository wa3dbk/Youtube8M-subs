00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
really simplistic and there's not really

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.270 
really simplistic and there's not really
much<00:00:54.329> going<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.050> after<00:00:55.800> watching<00:00:55.980> some

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280

his legs are pretty basic looking pretty

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.740 
his legs are pretty basic looking pretty
much<00:04:45.370> what<00:04:45.520> you<00:04:45.610> expect<00:04:45.940> from<00:04:46.030> a<00:04:46.180> beef<00:04:46.330> warmer

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750

articulation<00:04:49.000> which<00:04:49.569> is<00:04:49.690> kind<00:04:49.900> of<00:04:49.930> sad

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
articulation which is kind of sad

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.710 
articulation which is kind of sad
which<00:04:50.759> zooming<00:04:51.759> out<00:04:51.819> a<00:04:51.880> bit<00:04:52.270> there's

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
which zooming out a bit there's

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.930 
which zooming out a bit there's
articulation<00:04:53.319> it's<00:04:53.500> really<00:04:53.860> only<00:04:54.160> at<00:04:54.580> the

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
articulation it's really only at the

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.510 
articulation it's really only at the
elbow<00:04:55.539> here<00:04:55.680> just<00:04:56.680> like<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:56.889> Optimus<00:04:57.310> where

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
elbow here just like the Optimus where

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.820 
elbow here just like the Optimus where
it<00:04:57.580> goes<00:04:57.699> up<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:58.840> down<00:04:58.930> well<00:04:59.530> he's<00:04:59.650> got<00:04:59.800> a

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
it goes up and down well he's got a

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.499 
it goes up and down well he's got a
little<00:05:00.130> bit<00:05:00.250> of<00:05:00.340> a<00:05:00.400> pivot<00:05:00.759> at<00:05:00.849> the<00:05:00.940> hand<00:05:01.180> just

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
little bit of a pivot at the hand just

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.379 
little bit of a pivot at the hand just
because<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:01.960> his<00:05:02.050> transformation<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:04.000> you

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
because of his transformation and you

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.810 
because of his transformation and you
can<00:05:04.539> kind<00:05:04.750> of<00:05:04.810> say<00:05:05.020> his<00:05:05.139> shoulders<00:05:05.500> but<00:05:05.820> they

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
can kind of say his shoulders but they

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.159 
can kind of say his shoulders but they
they're<00:05:07.270> just<00:05:07.389> gonna<00:05:07.479> fought<00:05:07.750> back<00:05:07.930> down

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
they're just gonna fought back down

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.260 
they're just gonna fought back down
because<00:05:08.320> that's<00:05:08.650> the<00:05:08.889> whole<00:05:08.979> gimmick<00:05:09.729> portion

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
because that's the whole gimmick portion

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.510 
because that's the whole gimmick portion
of<00:05:10.389> it<00:05:10.479> right<00:05:10.630> there<00:05:10.870> so<00:05:11.860> that's<00:05:12.160> pretty<00:05:12.430> much

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
of it right there so that's pretty much

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.129 
of it right there so that's pretty much
it<00:05:12.729> a<00:05:12.759> little<00:05:13.000> bit<00:05:13.180> of<00:05:13.240> pivot<00:05:13.720> at<00:05:13.810> the<00:05:13.930> legs

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
it a little bit of pivot at the legs

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.350 
it a little bit of pivot at the legs
which<00:05:14.349> yeah<00:05:15.280> make<00:05:15.460> sure<00:05:15.669> he's<00:05:15.789> pristine

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
which yeah make sure he's pristine

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.540 
which yeah make sure he's pristine
pretty<00:05:16.870> securely<00:05:17.259> because<00:05:17.650> at<00:05:18.190> least<00:05:18.340> I'm

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
pretty securely because at least I'm

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.110 
pretty securely because at least I'm
mine<00:05:18.759> cuz<00:05:18.970> if<00:05:19.090> I<00:05:19.180> go<00:05:19.300> to<00:05:19.360> let<00:05:19.509> go<00:05:19.630> of<00:05:19.750> them

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
mine cuz if I go to let go of them

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.700 
mine cuz if I go to let go of them
that's<00:05:22.120> that's<00:05:22.599> what's<00:05:22.870> gonna<00:05:23.020> happen<00:05:23.470> a<00:05:23.530> lot

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
that's that's what's gonna happen a lot

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.589 
that's that's what's gonna happen a lot
so<00:05:24.639> you<00:05:24.759> want<00:05:24.880> to<00:05:24.940> make<00:05:25.030> sure<00:05:25.060> your<00:05:25.330> shells

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
so you want to make sure your shells

so you want to make sure your shells
pretty<00:05:25.840> low<00:05:25.960> because<00:05:26.229> mine<00:05:26.380> kind<00:05:26.620> of<00:05:26.680> sits<00:05:26.919> up

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
pretty low because mine kind of sits up

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.309 
pretty low because mine kind of sits up
a<00:05:27.159> little<00:05:27.340> bit<00:05:27.550> towards<00:05:27.909> the<00:05:28.030> front<00:05:28.240> so<00:05:28.319> he's

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
a little bit towards the front so he's

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.980 
a little bit towards the front so he's
gonna<00:05:29.500> lean<00:05:29.740> back<00:05:30.009> which<00:05:30.330> that<00:05:31.330> kind<00:05:31.509> of<00:05:31.690> sucks

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
gonna lean back which that kind of sucks

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.740 
gonna lean back which that kind of sucks
but<00:05:32.650> overall<00:05:33.520> robot<00:05:33.940> form<00:05:34.150> I<00:05:34.300> don't<00:05:34.330> think

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
but overall robot form I don't think

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.040 
but overall robot form I don't think
this<00:05:34.870> actually<00:05:35.440> looks<00:05:35.800> all<00:05:36.070> that<00:05:36.580> bad<00:05:36.990> end<00:05:37.990> of

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
this actually looks all that bad end of

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.300 
this actually looks all that bad end of
the<00:05:38.110> car<00:05:38.289> mode<00:05:38.500> it<00:05:38.650> actually<00:05:38.949> looks<00:05:39.250> really

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
the car mode it actually looks really

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.219 
the car mode it actually looks really
clean<00:05:39.849> so<00:05:40.120> I'm<00:05:40.210> actually<00:05:40.360> pretty<00:05:40.539> happy<00:05:40.930> with

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
clean so I'm actually pretty happy with

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.839 
clean so I'm actually pretty happy with
the<00:05:41.289> way<00:05:41.349> this<00:05:41.440> guy<00:05:41.590> turned<00:05:41.770> out<00:05:41.919> have<00:05:42.550> a<00:05:42.580> quick

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
the way this guy turned out have a quick

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.790 
the way this guy turned out have a quick
comparison<00:05:43.000> here<00:05:43.690> is<00:05:43.719> lock<00:05:44.139> down<00:05:44.380> caprara

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
comparison here is lock down caprara

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.740 
comparison here is lock down caprara
next<00:05:45.099> to<00:05:45.219> the<00:05:45.370> smash<00:05:45.909> and<00:05:46.090> change<00:05:46.300> Optimus

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
next to the smash and change Optimus

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.260 
next to the smash and change Optimus
Prime<00:05:47.009> so<00:05:48.009> overall<00:05:48.250> with<00:05:48.550> lock<00:05:48.699> down<00:05:48.940> I<00:05:49.180> think

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
Prime so overall with lock down I think

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.270 
Prime so overall with lock down I think
he<00:05:49.449> actually<00:05:49.690> didn't<00:05:50.289> turn<00:05:50.500> out<00:05:50.530> as<00:05:50.770> bad<00:05:50.979> as<00:05:51.190> I

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
he actually didn't turn out as bad as I

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.580 
he actually didn't turn out as bad as I
thought<00:05:51.460> he<00:05:51.610> was<00:05:51.789> going<00:05:51.969> to<00:05:52.259> granite<00:05:53.259> it's<00:05:53.409> not

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
thought he was going to granite it's not

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.200 
thought he was going to granite it's not
