00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.660
 the story of a gentleman once my father 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.419
 said fine because you have to 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.970

 sort of life comes way to development yes 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.280
 but really you have to say this 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.009
 Islands mind deaf that alliance yet 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.380
 there will be a rebellion in the bodies and only 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.539
 an invasion of murlocs will be capable of them 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.449
 stop here you can believe this 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:51.240
 insanity but u personally i think that both of you are not 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.360
 right in fact everything will be a bit 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.610
 in another way we will be back after the mission on 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.130
 draenor only to discover that 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.620
 azerot captured legion and legs 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.880
 the queen of the ball will emerge from the bottom of the sea and 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.310
 will call Illidana 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.460
 from the whirlwind of emptiness and together they 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.220
 will create a small palace of love together 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.919
 they try hard to summon Sargeras 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.889
 And when it appears, it will go down to Azeroth 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.409
 armies of the most terrible creatures but not 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.229
 worry about the characters because each of you 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.750
 will give improvements every class will 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.900
 chain of quests testing the hero on 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.560
 strength but rewards 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.560
 awards oh 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.509

 the future such a joe might happen 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:06:02.039
 dinosaurs are not from worgen yet more 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:05.130
