00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.630
 hello friends in this video i am 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.740
 tell and show how you yourself 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.140
 make mold with waffle texture 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.090
 Such mod made from ordinary 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.460
 baked polymer clay 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.369
 It will be strong and durable and 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.890
 at the same time flexible and elastic that 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.560
 allow you to easily peel off 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.410
 it polymer clay as I you 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.890
 I will show you how to make 2 wafer prints with 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.750
 single and with multiple squares 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.120
 a huge plus of any homemade mods 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.150
 of course is that we choose 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.140
 their view is width and depth and distance 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.570
 between wafer squares for 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.070
 Mold manufacturing We take polymer 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.620
 clay rolling pin and brush and starch 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.070
 instead of starch you can take children 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.350
 talc 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.830
 flour is better not to use it after all 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.979
 more coarse than starch or 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.840
 talc and most important tool in 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.939
 this video is credit 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.549
 or discount plastic card 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.950
 of course you can do without her he 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.249
 for example using a blunt end 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.280
 plastic knife 

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:31.819
 the card is a little bit thicker and it is much 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.969
 more convenient in work and and we will do 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:37.729
 waffle net on the face and so we roll out 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.759
 Polymer clay ball about 3-4 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.469
 centimeter in diameter 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.920
 sprinkle a little surface for sculpting 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:49.789
 starch or talc and roll out 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.950
 flat cake preferably round but not thin 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.869
 otherwise strips will be very 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.200
 problematic and she can just 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.959
 tear thickness do 3-4 millimeters 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.509
 when using starch surface 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:04.670
 turns out to be more even and smooth and 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.579
 may in the manufacturing process not 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.830
 sticks to the surface so we have it 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.170
 do not remember with attention or 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.750
 cutting off the surface and we need 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.180
 clarity in making better cells 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.189
 surface slightly still sprinkle 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.370
 but use clay after that 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:24.400
 I do not recommend again 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.319
 only for making hammers since 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.849
 Japan prize tank of course 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:33.040
 affects the quality of clay and remains 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.519
 blotches and whitish marks on the surface 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.430
 do molda gently slowly to 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.269
 make a mod the first time and do not harass 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.970
 clay for nothing 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:46.090
 for waffle young usually enough 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.860
 10 centimeters wide and now we 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.260
 decide what is the gap between 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.360
 cells we can do 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.620
 make some young with different 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.560
 cell size 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.410
 all as they say the occasions I have 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.920
 there is already a mod with small cells and in this 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.720
 Once I make a mod with large cells 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.530
 we will crumble the surface of the clay with starch and 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.620
 we start to strip by ourselves or us 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.620
 see yourself as you see better and 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.200
 as you prefer, we set the card strictly 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.790
 vertically and press so that 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.209
 left crumpled strip 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.819
 one millimeter deep control 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.099
 pressed very carefully so as not to tear 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.220
 clay through and not cutting off thereby 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.470
 card piece better take your time 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.010
 do exactly and equally 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.620
 do you still have to use this mold 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.590
 if there is some kind of a cant 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.010
 will be on all your future casts 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.099
 doing slowly and efficiently if you want 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.799
 make a hammer square round ends in 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:54.310
 the beginning and at the end of the cakes can be cut 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:57.000
 reaching the end we turn the mold on 90 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.989
 degrees and doing exactly the same bands 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.120
 perpendicular to the first to 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.250
 flat squares formed 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.560
 try to keep the distance between the bands 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.400
 it was the same and you succeeded 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.919
 squares they are rectangles or rhombuses 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.579
 shake off excess starch and mold can 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:18.099
 bake besides molds you can do more 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:21.099
 and stamps with convex squares 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.430
 we make them thicker and the height of the card 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.949
 pushing stupid 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.419
 same squares should stick out a little higher 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.669
 than in the first embodiment 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.490
 such stamps can be used for 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.199
 making miniature soft Viennese 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.639
 waffle 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:37.310
 the distance between the squares is necessary 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.910
 slightly expand so that the squares 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.979
 slightly narrowed to the top like a pyramid 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.740
 card a little bit press the mole on top and 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.240
 You can put on it a light texture with 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.759
 using peppermint foil 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:54.139
 all molds are ready and you can bake it 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.750
 last strangest at first 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.050
 the look of the subject is such a single 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.970
 square turret stamp 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.330
 turret need for ease of pressure 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.330
 finger ready fashion to bake 20 minutes in 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.310
 preheated oven 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.160
 take out the baked textures and give them 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.250
 cool on a flat surface and you can 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.169
 do not cover varnish 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.720
 if you tried to do and in 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.660
 thin enough they will be a little 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.599
 bend it will help us peel off 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.880
 imprint and let's test before 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.970
 you are young and show what chew 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.919
 imprints they leave the mole before 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.440
 using also need to sprinkle 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.870
 starch and shake off excess 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.110
 lightweight thin thin layer left 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.630
 good mash the clay and make a cake 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.490
 desired forms 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.300
 we roll and yogi texture and along and 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.389
 across 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.210
 neatly print and any msi 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:56.300
 the result further cut out which 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.310
 we tint and make thumbnails of more 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.099
 large waffle texture is obtained 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.800
 also very beautiful waffles nice 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:07.400
 Look at a large cell on a miniature 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.820
 ice cream form this stamp is pressed 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.830
 clay on top to sprinkle it need 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.340
 carefully because pressure 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:19.460
 will have much further cut off the clay 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:22.550
 edges leaving bumpers fail 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:26.080
 a thick Viennese wafer remains only 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.820
 tint it and make a texture on the side and 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.880
 last single square stamp 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.310
 the most economical option 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.280
 stamping one square can 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.660
 waffle a whole waffle 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.970
 of course she won't be so perfect 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.260
 even as other times but as super 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:46.690
 economical option is very suitable 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.850
 these are wonderful textures 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.980
 do it yourself not 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.830
 spending large funds to buy 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.440
 ready to make them any size and 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:59.200
 any width on the pier yes you can let 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.050
 unwanted remains of clay but best well 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.850
 stir in a uniform color let him 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.430
 it will not be very nice but 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:08.950
 uniform color clearly visible texture 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:12.760
 the application process and in the process 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:15.640
 use very happy if you helped 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.730
 my lesson sculpt smooth beautiful waffles 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.570
 make of them jewelery and miniatures for 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:26.820
 dolls and subscribe to new videos 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.820
 creative success to you all for now
