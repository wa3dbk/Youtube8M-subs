00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.619
 hello to all and fabien I present to you 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.420
 today how to make disappear 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.150
 your online nickname 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.010
 after the 1.07 patch so that's 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.310
 relatively simple the only necessity 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.529
 it's having a friend who is in 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.199
 an open group so you can 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.220
 so join him to start I'm going 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.170
 to show you that I am indeed 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.880
 update 1.07 is never too much 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.230
 cautious of the people who would get there 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.270
 not and who would come screaming at the fake 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.280
 at least that way you're sure and 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.870
 certain that it is functional 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.270
 anyway no longer see the date of the psn 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.579
 but that's changed we would 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.649
 custom party you assign your 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.570
 joystick as joystick number two 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.910
 to join a second account 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.920
 psn do you x and make you join 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.850
 again normal psn account what so 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.710
 you select one 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.910
 remember which one you take if 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.509
 you never have many because you 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.520
 have them join again 

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:07.810
 just after in the video so that's it 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.100
 so see the load that is silent 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.380
 it's a little long because the servers 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.759
 call of duty on currently the new 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.530
 when I comment this video was a 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.539
 little bit badly this lag is a 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.090
 little bit not bad law so basically a 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.560
 Once the account is joined you 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.270
 reassign your controller as much as 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.709
 number one joystick you will be celebrating it's worth 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.599
 put off living room you put on wii 

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:28.000
 you reassign your controller as 

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:29.440
 that number 2 you validate a fac 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.479
 it's validated you put back your controller 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.310
 in number 1 you will press will for 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.929
 to leave your controller 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.640
 put only one controller and there you 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.450
 wait a little bit a drop-down menu is going 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.220
 open on your own 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.450
 automatically and there you select 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.369
 the same psn account that you have 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.660
 selected just now so there if 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.280
 everything went well you should see 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.569
 your list of friends who knows duplicates there 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.700
 you see that all the names of my friends 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.050
 are written in duplicate since your two 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.700
 psn accounts are loaded that makes a 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.500
 kind of conflict it's pretty weird 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.780
 so you also see that account 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.910
 psn has the level of your old account 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.630
 psn and also has the current level of 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.569
 your psn account 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.739
 that makes some pretty weird bugs 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.380
 so that's so you join your 

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:06.550
 teammate paul so once has you 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.759
 joined him what are you doing 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.560
 and you assign your controller 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.060
 as number 1 to play 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.129
 so before assigning it of course 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.100
 Pressing round view you are with 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.960
 your second joystick that will do 10 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.820
 to be your second controller and there your 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.260
 joystick number one will lose his nickname 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.580
 you art is signed number one of 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.280
 way to get into the barracks 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.840
 and to be able to simply move in 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.040
 the occurrence I'm going to fire my name from 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.260
 clan and that's it I'm totally 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.280
 invisible so here are the friends I hope 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.110
 really that this little video you 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.450
 will have more a pretty fun glitch realized 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.800
 for the troll or whatever in any case 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.060
 I still want to specify that 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.110
 when you have the invisible nickname 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.480
 you really have trouble joining 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.800
 a part I do not know that bug it's 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.970
 weird so whatever it is you 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.650
 can still join the parties 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.630
 in which your nickname is invisible 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.710
 but in the party do not go so 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.180
 here are the friends I wanted on this 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.260
 video i hope you will have pleased me and 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.260
 I find again very soon lease
