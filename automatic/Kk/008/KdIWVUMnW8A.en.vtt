00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.529
 that in molecules of the type and at x4 the atoms 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.369
 that react to a hybridization of the 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:29.689
 type sp3 then in this case as 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.759
 we're going to draw our molecule 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.860
 of water 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.970
 we will go to our water molecule 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:42.409
 draw of this world first of all 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:45.379
 we have oxygen we know that 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:50.629
 craftsmen bridi of the type sp3 being 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:54.979
 stopped by one from a component if da 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:01:00.650
 three components are more squat than one 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:03.530
 part more slender than the other and not 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.449
 are like those own double club of 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.130
 type b that so much head is slender 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.890
 as from the left and I'm not even 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.790
 spherical like those of type s but are a 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.570
 intermediate and with hybrid therefore these 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.009
 orbitals oxygen at 4 orbitals i 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.780
 principles of this type 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:26.420
 two of which sp32 are in this one 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.729
 some structure rather one hand is 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.159
 elongated on the other two of them 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.460
 information about the two links is involved 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.079
 covalent the other two instead 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.369
 contain the two double electronic documents 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.509
 not shared 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:44.990
 so we initially go to do 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:50.090
 the dot this points to the core 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.429
 of our oxygen atom all that 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.899
 what we have 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:02:01.189
 we have to go and draw the 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:05.590
 orbital involved these orbitals 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:08.590
 naturally involved will be so 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.590
 designed 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.480
 the first sp3 hybrid orbital 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.530
 we follow attention 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:30.580
 we follow the lewis structure 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.560
 as regards the performance of the 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.330
 of 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.610
 the three-dimensional structure then it 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.250
 let's take a look at it this way 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.180
 this is the oxygen core that 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.670
 let's make 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:49.790
 the first sp3 hybrid orbital that 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.730
 would this this could this 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:03:01.490
 orbital and an electronic dubbing 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:05.260
 not shared the second hybrid orbital 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.700
 sp3 type 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.980
 this is the core we always imagine 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.739
 that oxygen core will be like that 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:19.970
 drawn then always follows one 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:22.010
 structure the torture day lewis and here 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.959
 we have this second hospitable that 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.640
 contains two electrons then the 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:31.070
 this is not then shared dubbing 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.239
 we have two other shivering orbitals that 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.310
 we have only one electron and participate 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.780
 to training each of these of a 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.230
 covalent bond with hydrogen 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.840
 filling yes because each of gods 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.630
 every hydrogen atom has one 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.739
 electronic configuration of the type 1 f 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.260
 1 with so this electron is found 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.830
 in an orbital they are of spherical type 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.520
 then how are we going to draw 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.710
 these two orbitals the drawing will come a 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.900
 confusingly, however, we must 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:10.030
 try to understand the trend of 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.710
 yellow issues participating in the 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:19.330
 bond formation we will have another 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:20.950
 hybrid cortical type sp3 which is 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.550
 just what forms the 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.170
 bond with valent with hydrogen mate 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.370
 forms the bond as the entity with 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.180
 hydrogen 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.640
 we must go and make another 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.670
 dot here that it would be the core 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.610
 of the hydrogen atom with the orbital 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:42.640
 silky that interacts with gross such 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.570
 the hybrid sp3 this here to form the 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:49.960
 first covalent bonds and last 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:05:02.140
 we have the latest hybrid loeb warp of the 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:05:06.370
 type sp3 which is therefore disposed in 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.380
 this way it will interact with 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.780
 what are we talking about this that a 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.120
 a wrong election will interact 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.330
 with the hospital 's hydrogen atom 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.400
 that to the other electron forming a 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.160
 other link problems than here 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.120
 we have our ato the atom of 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.130
 hydrogen with the only silky orbital 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.310
 of the hydrogen that interacts that 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.830
 sp3 hybrid arbital in blue are all 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.780
 weapons from hybrids in stige know sp3 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.800
 because we have seen that a molecule 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.800
 of the ex type
