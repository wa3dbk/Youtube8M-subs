00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
pickaxe and in 14,000 diamonds you get 2

dragon<00:01:52.590> pickaxes<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.430> would<00:01:54.329> say<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.540> got<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
dragon pickaxes I would say I got a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.840 
dragon pickaxes I would say I got a
little<00:01:55.140> bit<00:01:55.439> unlucky<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:56.130> not<00:01:56.369> too<00:01:56.579> unlucky

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
little bit unlucky but not too unlucky

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.149 
little bit unlucky but not too unlucky
because<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.570> droplet<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.049> around<00:01:58.530> like<00:01:58.770> 1<00:01:59.009> in

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
because the droplet is around like 1 in

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.940 
because the droplet is around like 1 in
5,000<00:01:59.820> or<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.659> not<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.500> was<00:02:01.770> too

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
5,000 or so so it's not like it was too

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.310 
5,000 or so so it's not like it was too
bad<00:02:02.130> or<00:02:02.369> something<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:03.869> I'm<00:02:04.049> quite

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
bad or something so you know I'm quite

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.580 
bad or something so you know I'm quite
happy<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.280> managed<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.640> get<00:02:05.820> 3<00:02:06.290> there<00:02:07.290> drop

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
happy and I managed to get 3 there drop

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.339 
happy and I managed to get 3 there drop
table<00:02:07.950> drops<00:02:08.220> at<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.550> odd<00:02:08.940> toward<00:02:09.750> stall<00:02:10.080> and

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
table drops at the odd toward stall and

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.830 
table drops at the odd toward stall and
pure<00:02:11.099> essence<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:12.540> use<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> lot<00:02:13.290> of

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
pure essence and I use a lot of

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.740 
pure essence and I use a lot of
blood<00:02:14.020> runes<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.500> think<00:02:14.739> I<00:02:14.830> had<00:02:15.010> like<00:02:16.720> I

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
blood runes I think I had like I

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.420 
blood runes I think I had like I
think<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.200> lost<00:02:17.349> a<00:02:17.530> lot<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.680> money<00:02:17.950> from<00:02:18.220> the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
think I lost a lot of money from the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.830 
think I lost a lot of money from the
blood<00:02:18.610> runes<00:02:18.849> because<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.209> actually<00:02:19.360> did<00:02:19.810> not

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
blood runes because I actually did not

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.589 
blood runes because I actually did not
profit<00:02:20.230> anything<00:02:20.800> by<00:02:20.950> getting<00:02:21.250> these

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
profit anything by getting these

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.120 
profit anything by getting these
pickaxes<00:02:22.599> because<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:22.959> was<00:02:23.260> using<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.650> cannon

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
pickaxes because I was using a cannon

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.880 
pickaxes because I was using a cannon
and<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.819> clearly<00:02:25.180> remember<00:02:25.540> remembered<00:02:26.530> having

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
and I clearly remember remembered having

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.630 
and I clearly remember remembered having
at<00:02:27.010> least<00:02:27.360> 70,000<00:02:28.360> cannonballs<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.640> 40,000

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
at least 70,000 cannonballs so 40,000

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.750 
at least 70,000 cannonballs so 40,000
lost<00:02:30.880> that's<00:02:31.239> really<00:02:31.989> a<00:02:32.019> lot<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.620> blood<00:02:33.519> runes

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
lost that's really a lot and blood runes

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.470 
lost that's really a lot and blood runes
I<00:02:34.060> had<00:02:34.810> around<00:02:35.430> 90,000<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:37.420> don't

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
I had around 90,000 and I don't

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.330 
I had around 90,000 and I don't
recommend<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.200> use<00:02:38.319> barrage<00:02:38.709> at<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.040> place

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
recommend to use barrage at that place

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.280 
recommend to use barrage at that place
even<00:02:40.000> though<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.330> may<00:02:40.480> seem<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.750> there<00:02:41.140> are<00:02:41.260> a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
even though it may seem that there are a

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.220 
even though it may seem that there are a
lot<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.560> things<00:02:42.040> in<00:02:42.370> one<00:02:42.580> place<00:02:42.610> but<00:02:43.239> I<00:02:43.569> hit

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
lot of things in one place but I hit

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.949 
lot of things in one place but I hit
like<00:02:44.410> two<00:02:44.860> targets<00:02:45.430> like<00:02:46.390> the

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
like two targets like the

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.390 
like two targets like the
best-case-scenario<00:02:47.380> was<00:02:47.950> like<00:02:48.130> three

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
best-case-scenario was like three

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.460 
best-case-scenario was like three
targets<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:49.060> it's<00:02:49.209> not<00:02:49.330> even<00:02:49.600> worth<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:50.140> you

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
targets so it's not even worth it you

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.259 
targets so it's not even worth it you
better<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.830> use<00:02:50.950> single<00:02:51.280> target<00:02:51.670> spell<00:02:51.940> so

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
better to use single target spell so

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.229 
better to use single target spell so
even<00:02:53.080> like<00:02:53.260> melee<00:02:53.709> weapons<00:02:54.160> will<00:02:54.640> work<00:02:54.910> fine

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
even like melee weapons will work fine

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.780 
even like melee weapons will work fine
without<00:02:55.480> Canon<00:02:56.110> at<00:02:56.319> all<00:02:56.680> so<00:02:57.340> now<00:02:57.489> I'm<00:02:57.610> not<00:02:57.760> sure

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
without Canon at all so now I'm not sure

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.490 
without Canon at all so now I'm not sure
if<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:58.150> should<00:02:58.360> add<00:02:58.540> this<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.959> my<00:02:58.989> tool<00:02:59.319> belt

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
if I should add this to my tool belt

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.250 
if I should add this to my tool belt
because<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.190> added<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.760> hatchet<00:03:01.150> already<00:03:01.569> and

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
because I added the hatchet already and

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.350 
because I added the hatchet already and
I<00:03:02.380> should<00:03:02.560> add<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:03.010> dragon<00:03:03.370> pickaxe<00:03:03.760> but<00:03:04.030> I

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
I should add the dragon pickaxe but I

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.870 
I should add the dragon pickaxe but I
don't<00:03:04.599> really<00:03:04.840> mind<00:03:05.319> I<00:03:05.590> mean<00:03:05.890> since<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.310> got<00:03:06.489> 99

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
don't really mind I mean since I got 99

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.990 
don't really mind I mean since I got 99
like<00:03:07.330> one<00:03:07.959> year<00:03:08.140> ago<00:03:08.410> I<00:03:08.620> never<00:03:08.739> mind<00:03:09.310> again<00:03:09.730> I

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
like one year ago I never mind again I

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.780 
like one year ago I never mind again I
got<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.930> experience<00:03:11.440> from<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.920> squeal<00:03:12.640> of

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
got the experience from the squeal of

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.000 
got the experience from the squeal of
fortune<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:14.970> effigies<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:17.080> probably<00:03:17.829> I'm

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
fortune and the effigies so probably I'm

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.099 
fortune and the effigies so probably I'm
not<00:03:18.040> ever<00:03:18.459> adding<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.030> diamond<00:03:19.359> pickaxe<00:03:19.720> unless

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
not ever adding a diamond pickaxe unless

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.050 
not ever adding a diamond pickaxe unless
some<00:03:20.350> new<00:03:20.590> rock<00:03:20.829> comes<00:03:21.250> out<00:03:21.459> into<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.880> game

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
some new rock comes out into the game

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.449 
some new rock comes out into the game
we'll<00:03:22.510> see<00:03:22.720> about<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:22.959> but<00:03:23.440> yeah<00:03:23.709> so<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.340> don't

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
we'll see about that but yeah so I don't

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.770 
we'll see about that but yeah so I don't
think<00:03:24.730> that<00:03:24.940> I'll<00:03:25.090> be<00:03:25.239> playing<00:03:25.510> in<00:03:25.660> the

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
think that I'll be playing in the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.660 
think that I'll be playing in the
upcoming<00:03:26.170> two<00:03:26.470> days<00:03:26.680> because<00:03:27.160> there<00:03:27.519> is

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
upcoming two days because there is

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.630 
upcoming two days because there is
really<00:03:28.090> nothing<00:03:28.269> left<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:29.200> do<00:03:29.350> now<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:29.859> I'm

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
really nothing left to do now and I'm

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.960 
really nothing left to do now and I'm
just<00:03:30.700> waiting<00:03:31.090> for<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.660> new<00:03:31.930> boss<00:03:32.170> Virago<00:03:33.130> so

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
just waiting for the new boss Virago so

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.520 
just waiting for the new boss Virago so
I<00:03:34.000> can't<00:03:34.180> wait<00:03:34.329> for<00:03:34.569> that<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:35.049> I<00:03:35.140> guess<00:03:35.319> that's

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
I can't wait for that and I guess that's

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.530 
I can't wait for that and I guess that's
it<00:03:35.680> for<00:03:35.739> this<00:03:36.010> video<00:03:36.190> so<00:03:36.640> hope<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:37.030> enjoyed<00:03:37.329> it
