00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.730
 of the 9.7-inch ipad box including 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.710
 you see it's a lot smaller 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.840
 really impressed me when bar 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.210
 when we put back in hand I think and its 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.200
 little ones and I was impressed 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.380
 so here I have 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.060
 I have not opened yet this ipad 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.520
 but I want to cons the 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.850
 cellophane unfolding his fans it serves 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.570
 not much 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:13.520
 I own at the opening and that's my 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:18.890
 new small ipad mini I remove 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.479
 employees there you take in hand it's a 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.530

 an ipad past it's a tablet it's 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:33.710
 it's light it's fine it's finally beautiful 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:39.740
 for me in any case here are the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:41.270
 two islands of protection and I am 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.920
 found with my little table and in the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.470
 I do not have a small one 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.950
 hand so see I take it enough 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.960
 easily still very easily 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.100
 in the hand this little tablet then 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.640
 what was barreteau 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.830
 obviously the button the home button 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.080
 I do not know if you see that located 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.440
 there as on other ipad and others 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.070
 iphone 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:10.970
 below the port 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:13.580
 the dup the lightning will be pin on 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.010
 the left slice when we hold 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.470
 Here the frequency of left there 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.830
 nothing at all it's all smooth just the 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.990
 aluminum part on the back logo 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.120
 apple is there the little camera on the 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.400
 right slice relief finds 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.900
 and red bart do not want the volume buttons 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.160
 at low volume the quad is turned on 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.560
 little button of what to disable the 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:45.440
 volume you listen it's pretty much 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.910
 all the jack jack them sensible and yes 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.459
 so his jack is not sweeping like 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.040
 the iphone is not located l epa support 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.440
 at the palace so on the part 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.940
 superior in water 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.860
 here is the front camera listen here 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.000
 what is for the tablet here is this 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.660
 that it is for the tablet where 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.100
 do not work with you very very 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.660
 wrong because it's really dark on 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.550
 black as the apple and black logo on 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.860
 black unlike the aluminum back 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.620
 of the ipad 2 do it 7 inches there one 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.150
 well distinguish the logo ipad lo 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.870
 tiempo young while we are small 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.870
 size comparison 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:32.540
 I hope you see it well 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.730
 not obvious it's really small 1 it's 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.720
 not unpleasant 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.780
 so inside the box they get 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.190
 find and of course yours 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.350
 that would make me an extra cap for 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.740
 iphone for iphone 5 is the new 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:49.640
 lightning cable that's the little 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.960
 documentation that goes with you we're going 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.960
 obviously I am also a good boss 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.000
 since it is not a version 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.000
 cellular 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.760
 that's classic and the adapter 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.070
 the AC adapter to charge this 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.390
 mini ipad 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.010
 So here it is left almost 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.360
 remains for me to give it a try I 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.180
 will offer you in another video 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.310
 games I'll be putting a movie somewhere 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.930
 thing on to see how that 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.609
 then works yes there may be some 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.940
 little indications behind so when 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.160
 even 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:24.250
 it's stipulated bombshell to let him shiga 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.320
 make sense for this version and then minc 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.210
 senna yesterday normally itunes will be 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.890
 to the angels itunes is not available 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.150
 his lands by it was planned for 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.670
 end of October but it will only be for me 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.830
 November so itunes are eleven there in 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.120
 being 10 points and 8 months for you go 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.170
 get along with anyway that's true 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.700
 worked I think I would not have 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.140
 all 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.060
 this day a lack of display whatever 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.310
 something like that on itunes pretty much 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.720
 everything here is this tablet side but 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.970
 their perfect in a game is not 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.670
 still lit that I do not unpack it 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.550

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.600
