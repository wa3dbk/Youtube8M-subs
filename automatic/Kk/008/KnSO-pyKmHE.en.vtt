 and horrify anything you know for sure that you recognize him if he and 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.300
 inimitable seals and this is 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.310
 gta san andrea 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.199
 a masterpiece is not a game, it is the game when someone asks me 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.270
 I'm sorry, love 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.930
 but what are you doing on ps2 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.330
 what questions it does 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.590
 gta san andreas 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.830
 but it seems obvious to me 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.520
 truly a masterpiece was perfect 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.960
 apulia innovation 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.899
 if it hadn't been for small problems that everything so become too often 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 I say no another time it happens to you 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.060

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.870

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.530
 this is the problem I bought new customer extends data sin 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.690
 from the beginning 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.470
 I've always wondered why 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.100
 I never understood if I have to tell you 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
 if I have to tell you, don't miss munch 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.939
 anyway now let's talk a little uncertain channel of what 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.030
 sappada 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.850

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.180
 on the site time 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.620
 so in the face because this is 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.140
 my first comment ever 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.470
 in any one thing 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.270
 then. 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.150
 this is weird 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.240
 now and my name is massimiliano 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.679

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.660
 emo 15 years 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.770
 and the passion to do 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.410
 short video idea 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.290

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.670
 I have known 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.120

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.450

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.159
 cabbage translator 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.699
 I have to try a little parenthesis myself 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.619
 because in this game 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.619
 it's a main shoot foot instead of a German spider 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.639
 you shoot a foot shoot in the air these hd stand behind 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.109
 these are things in the picture a little dishonorable acoustic season 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:29.729

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:34.919
 that is, san andreas 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.140

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.489
 euro mask for video quality not me that of hd pvr of course 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.489
 but you get close enough 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.689
 what happened I started looking at all the settings and I didn't see people here 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.379
 ethnic and register 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.009
 and I didn't understand why 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:07.169
 then I tried to set xbox fiction xbox for sixty-eight acoustics 2 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:07.889
 I tried 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.199

 what came out. out of registration 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.790
 I only know that there is a problem 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.719
 90% of games plus 6pad 60 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:27.129
 so until I saw the action yourself and I hope super 8 soon 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:32.129
 it came out to make me laugh at the video, even normal 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.599
 You had the idea a little 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.699

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.659
 of videogames in general 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.769

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.860
 excuse me 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.779

 second because of the beauty 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.400

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.039
 - xbox playlist

 two or three years and I'm pregnant - 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.550
 so I thought why we don't do this channel where 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.250
 we publish such videos until they have solved 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.159
 which does not mean that a person possesses this public function 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:25.419
 but I would like to ask you something then 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.369
 I wanted to ask if everyone is 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:29.469
