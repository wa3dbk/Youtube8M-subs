 complacent euro parliamentarian need 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.520
 pay tribute to Francis first he 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.160
 told them that no one else in europe 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.590
 I would not dare to say exactly what 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.350
 Europe today is a fading civilization 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.369
 her so-called new values lead 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.220

 she climbed onto the altar of the cathedral 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.700
 the Virgin and stood there half naked 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.860
 waving a flag with however dad is not 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.230
 stopped haggard and tired 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.600
 Old Europe is not a prolific and 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.640
 full of life lost their 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.010
 roots and ideals of the great departed from 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.870
 principles of peace and cooperation so 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.090
 characterized the pope modern 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.309
 Europe what became a cold shower for 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.790
 Deputies of the European Parliament and 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.530
 something outfits just 17 or vracha came

 time to work together to build 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.850
 Europe which does not rotate 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.010
 economy and around about holiness 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.170
 human personality and inherent 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.450
 values ​​it’s time to give up 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.110
 Europe which is full of fear and closed 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.390
 on myself 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.430
 they expected much from the sovereign of the vatican 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.320
 approval and praise for the construction 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.130

 development tolerance and tolerance i 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.130
 I know many believers lesbians and gays 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.130

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.939
 the community hear about it from him 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.700

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.630
 ulrika luna chic and got rebuff with 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.270
 harsh criticism 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.549
 great ideals that inspired 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.860
 Europe seems to have lost its attractive 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.950
 force is growing distrust of citizens to 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.619
 institutions and laws 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.799
 some nations are simply useless if 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.460
 don't say are harmful this modern dad 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.280
 dad of the 21st century he called with tired 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.920
 haggard and barren summed up 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.959
 british euro skeptic nigel farage and 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.840
 he alone thinks the pope is right 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.360
 appeared just si destruction of value 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.380
 the process of annihilating a family 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.739
 destruction believe therefore i think that 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.860
 performance on ruined bilal he beat 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.900
 spike not only fair she is very 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.420
 soft French for example have already given that he 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.459
 performed much, much and strong 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.769
 france is not known to be delighted with 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.209
 dictates of the so-called values ​​with 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.310
 the French despite massive 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.050
 performances could not fight off 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.970
 legalizing same-sex marriage 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.709
 and now paris is at risk 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.810
 huge losses from delay with 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.590
 Mistral supply to Russia in the case 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.600
 rave places too 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.440
 as for our our favorite ships 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.170
 which the people of France even sell you 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.860
 we were told that no you can not sell no 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.560
 we can serve 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.600
 The European Union is a flexible structure that 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.700
 is now 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:12.140
 guys contour with yet that is the European Union 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.870
 who leads a policy 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:20.040
 opposed the interests of France which 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.140
 oppose German interest however 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.540
 Germany does not seem to understand this 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.790
 The main thing is that sanctions harm Russia and 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.040
 nothing that they affect and germany too 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.500
 politics is more important than economics 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.540
 a quarter of a century ago when Polish dad 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.760
 john paul the second spoke to the euro 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.489
 Deputies called Europe a beacon 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.640
 civilization is now a new dad convinced 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.439
 this beacon of civilization does not shine in your hand 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.120
 sits on long loans us 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.310
 understandably independent financially 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.700
 and the united states of america about what 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.420
 supremacy team they are still to which fyuh 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.489
 threats such holding in such a story with 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.930
 such power with such independence on 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.790
 currently with a leader like 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.079
 Russians in general can say it 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.209
 forgive it 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.090
 a good face on a bad game this 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.549
 the picture is a facade from profanation however 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.680
 strapless such a profanation has become accustomed 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.840
 accustomed to seeing only what to see 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.060
 allowed accustomed to the position 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.659
 blinkered horse yes it's blind for one 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.729
 eye 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.010
 especially selectively is blindness 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.389
 interpretation of events in Ukraine 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.520
 but under the gaze of 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.710
 washington speaking to not quite another 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.810
 dad is European powerlessness 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.610
 practically confirms with this 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.860
 expanded and more influential 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.990
 the European Union is increasingly associated 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.090
 representation of aged and 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.400
 compressed Europe which is less 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.160
 feel the main character 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.900
 on the world stage with our representatives 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.449
 Orthodox Church such Europe 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.389
 no sympathy for the modern west 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.840
 this is a psychological pensioner who 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:54.180
 wants him to die in peace 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.280
 give him that opportunity europe 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:02.220
 today it is not the European Union we 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.770
 modern european union betrayed europe as 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.409
 the phenomenon that was formed 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.620
 Christianity is Europe more years sorry 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:14.789
 catholic church which missed 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.460
 opportunity to live fast western lesson 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.199

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.360

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.330
 Russia how much is this president to us 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.310

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.450
 american policeman home 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.940

 talked a lot about what needs to be fixed 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.080
 and urgently the chairman 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.880
 European Parliament Martin Schulz thanked 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.029
 dad for the advice recognized that the European Union 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.610
 Lost you are a man who shows 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:58.889
 us the way when we get lost he said 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.320
 However, will the European Union decide to go for 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.630
 the ways that the pope offered him 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.849
