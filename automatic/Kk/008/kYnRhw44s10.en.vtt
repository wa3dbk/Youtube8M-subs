00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.980
 hello hello today I bring you a video 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.139
 showing some lipstick there was 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.170
 uploaded an instagram photo and some 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.779
 people were betting me to see what 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.820
 mark was over is the first video goes to 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.390
 be focused on these lipsticks 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.830
 makeup academy so I 'm going to show you 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.570
 all that I have to the truth is that 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.670
 most I like there are only three that 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.010
 one of them does not just convince me 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.100
 color and the other two that the truth is 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.690
 they do not paint 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.129
 enough or almost nothing let's say but 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.809
 well the others yes I liked 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.390
 quite so I wanted to share it with 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.309
 your 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.790
 I'm going to start from the lightest to the most 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.670
 dark according to how I left them 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.490
 by the name really the first one is 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.920
 This number 5 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.380
 as you see in a glitter it does not reach 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.810
 paint for that really me this one then 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.820
 the truth is that I do not like it too much but 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.810
 good if someone is looking for a lip 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.740
 that is type brillito type blogs 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.740
 this is perfect 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.659
 In the next 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.620
 It is also very little pigmented, it gives you 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.460
 a little hydration a little bit of 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.460
 brightness but little more 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.190
 those two are the roads I like 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.690
 because they do not pigment me anything but because 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.580
 example my mother loves the 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.050
 lipsticks that we only provide glitter 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.060
 or something like that so for them they are 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.009
 perfect now the turn of elche 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.930
 and this is the other one that I do not like and 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.270
 because I do not pigment because as you see 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.630
 pigmented pretty well but because 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.729
 it has like a glitter and to me the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.329
 glitter on the lips as well as not 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.329
 he just convinced me 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.330
 we go with the next 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.380
 it would be this that is a something subiditos 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:19.269
 come now with the most powerful colors 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.269
 The first one that I am going to teach you is this 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.700
 it is a color as well as pulling purple 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.870
 the number 3 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.560
 what is a very pigmented fuchsia that to me 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.560
 I love 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.780
 the number 13 which is the red of the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.780
 collection 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.980
 pigment also very much 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.430
 and the last one I have would be this one that is 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.430
 the burgundy of the collection 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.470
 and now, as a review, tell you that 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.200
 he bought it for me that nobody 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.350
 pay no one has already given them to me 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.880
 review mode I tell you that the price of 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:29.200
 each labial is one with 49 or about 50 for 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.850
 the case more or less the same and as 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.990
 you have seen most are very 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:38.320
 pigmented and they are not matt because they are 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.890
 enough are creamy is not finished 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.290
 matte is a finish we believe milestone in the 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.990
 violence is this this is the packaging and 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:52.650
 well the part is if I get it 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:56.340
 is removed and that is also labial in itself 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.570
 we want to use it with some brochita 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.570
 or whatever it is is the same 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.200
 here inside gives a little bit more of 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.480
 darkness but that is the same tone and 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.170
 Well, in case we're running out, we have 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.140
 a little more before d 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.480
 to throw it out and renew it in the event that 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.419
 the order or I recommend it because 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.190
 for about 50 if you want some color in 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:23.540
 concrete or whatever it is because it's pretty 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.370
 well the duration are not not a 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.139
 very long duration does not put it on and you 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.680
 It lasts three hours but evidently 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:33.100
 1.50 we can not expect miracles but 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.290
 still the time 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.490
 now there is something you can hold it without retouching 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.000
 at least I can stand it without 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.300
 retouch after I am a person who 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.660
 I do a lot of this, so I'm eating 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.370
 the labial then at the time thing so a 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.400
 retouching no matter how small I am 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.770
 that I recommend them because 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.050
 price that have the pigmentation that 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.120
 they have and others was the relationship 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.800
 price-quality is great and the only 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.450
 that I did not like as you know they are 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.600
 the first three the others I'm 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.490
 delighted with them and nothing that I hope 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.010
 that the video is useful and I leave you with 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.230
 the next one that will also be another 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.270
 review showing other rights 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.790
 I hope you liked us 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.080
 we see in the next one remember that if 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.060
