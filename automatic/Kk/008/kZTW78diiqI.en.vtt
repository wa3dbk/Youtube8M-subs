00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:17.130
 hello to all fast video to explain them 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.710
 more than a recipe another chetino that 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.660
 maybe for many it will still be discovered 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.720
 however hot water for someone can 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.880
 be useful I'll explain to you the other day 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.800
 ama asked me to go and get them 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.270
 Garnier's dry shampoo 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.989
 when they are all at the store I saw 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.820
 behind and I noticed that actually besides 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.670
 all the ingredients to make 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.730
 indeed there was no spray 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.980
 almost nothing nor functional for washing 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.059
 hair if not amino of rice and oil of 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.290
 lemon 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.430
 then instead of spending if I don't remember 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.100
 but the 5 euros and 90 or so for one 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.580
 dry shampoo that eventually contains 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.580
 less and nothing 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.840
 today to do it directly at home and 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.350
 this is the result and I did it 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.390
 simply with a couple of tablespoons of 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.970
 this rice starch is bought 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.960
 quietly at the supermarket in the 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:24.080
 food department this one for 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.390
 but here you can find bathroom in 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.740
 hygiene department or in the ward 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:34.369
 food and this only contains only 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:39.080
 and exclusively the soul of rice and this 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:42.649
 that I have is in grains then a little bit 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.970
 big but just pass it 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.280
 with 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:52.760
 a pestle and will become a row powder 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:56.870
 to this I added two or three drops of 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:00.020
 lemon essential oil and then comes 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.200
 very fragrant very fresh then I have it 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.840
 made my mother use it by applying it 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.240
 on the scalp massaging it 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.310
 letting it act for a moment and combing 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.900
 the hair has come away 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.040
 rather politi sure is not like one 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.230
 shampoo however in extreme conditions of 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.130
 hurry when you don't have time to wash 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:29.050
 hair is very comfortable smelling e 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:33.430
 in addition they also seemed to be volumized 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:38.170
 so absolutely experiment 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.920
 approved promoted is very economical is 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.590
 very easy from 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.190
 realize if you don't have lemon oil 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.720
 you can put any other fragrance 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.750
 that started you like it or 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.400
 simply use rice starch 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.420
 I've seen on the internet that some people 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:00.080
 not all of them use talcum powder 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.760
 talcum powder have transfers or otherwise 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.030
 since some complained about the fact 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.160
 leaving a light white patina 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.160
 on the head this one does not leave 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.019
 absolutely nothing and I hope nothing 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.550
 this trick lived useful and there 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.550
 see you at the next video bye
