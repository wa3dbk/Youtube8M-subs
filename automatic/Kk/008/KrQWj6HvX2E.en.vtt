00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:10.860
 we are there together with 40 very weak yes 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:24.570
 we just have to swim straight 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:25.680
 I tend to antibes damn swimmers 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.349
 he wants 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.349
 hey we play a game a 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.430
 guess I'm thinking of something 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:38.790
 little orange I could do this 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.570
 they don't have wines and orange and small 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.579
 it's me 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.829
 and alright mister i know all this i don't 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.390
 have wines is right is small and with 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.190
 white stripes me next 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.170
 pulling you nar and me 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.270
 hell that awaits it seems to me I have 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.350
 already seen this great floating linen 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.120
 which means we have already passed 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.309
 here we are going in circles that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.530
 we're going straight and salami 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.530
 surface we are going to discover but to what 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.890
 let's go follow me who's relaxed a 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.890
 nice breath 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.780
 so now we ask for directions a 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.640
 someone is right and clear grain 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.770
 there is no one here from the korando we find 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.520
 this is the silly dinner we are not there 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.020
 just the two of us 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.020
 let 's see there's no one even has it 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.020
 nada 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.179
 here is someone territory and who brought cam 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.159
 and I'm thinking of something dark and 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.539
 mysterious a fish we don't know 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.189
 and if we ask for them indication there 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.509
 swallows spits the bones stick that 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.340
 you males don't want but ask 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.789
 indications is not a question of males or 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.530
 females 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.810
 you know what we risk is life at stake 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.189
 or death two exits from here is obvious 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.810
 well what else do you think you do if you don't 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.079
 try with a bit of optimism signing 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.079
 engines maybe you don't understand trust me 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:07.970
 okay excuse me little fish hi don't you 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:12.890
 you are never polite say hi to your daughter 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:15.200
 a memo nemo brought it to sydney yes 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.670
 and we absolutely have to get there on 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.940
 as soon as possible for what you 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.230
 would hate to give us a hand 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.060
 let's go nice weight wine 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.740
 come on i'm a minnow i'm not 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.450
 it seems to me that that thing leaves a 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.020
 little fish says me decades marine goes 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:41.720
 well 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:43.670
 now I talk to you and Malaysians know how you feel about 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.410
 what do you do 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.500
 but are you sure you know Balinese dori 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:56.450
 who knows what he is saying seen if he is 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.850
 the stop at sea perhaps never offended though 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.190
 another dori dialect 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.230
 torino seem whale seems instead that 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.290
 is going to vote well I try with negatives 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.380
 otherwise the market is affected 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.210
 here now seems to agonize that part but 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.040
 at the end the turquoises 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.330
 I looked like a real orca but what an orca 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.330
 you looked like something I never heard 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.380
 better so maybe she was hungry 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.650
 no fear and evil nino eat weights but 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.650
