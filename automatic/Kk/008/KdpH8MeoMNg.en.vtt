00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 very good this big station 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.250
 you are welcome to win and before 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.170
 forgive nothing for my voice because I'm just 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.790
 to wake up and I deserve a zombie and for the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.040
 video quality but this video is not 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.480
 mine is a video that I found in 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.830
 good internet that I've seen thanks a 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.059
 retweet now I can not remember 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.980
 who but good thanks to the one who gave him 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.539
 retweet and is that freaked out how far 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.369
 come the point of the hacks in pokemon 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.990
 x and it's not a weird thing that coach does 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.080
 Exactly it has no face and it is not just 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.670
 take out a damn volcano yum shine and if 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.000
 flipante not so good 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.620
 in order for you to see everything is very strange 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.449
 and this mega volcano evolves 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.309
 as you see a volcano I have 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.129
 evolved and it's not that it changes its shape 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.860
 but what they do change are their peers 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.079
 say it power is so go for god 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.210
 that if it can give problems to change their 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.920
 stands scream though not mega though of 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.050
 abnormal form returns because no 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.570
 have a mega form so look what 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.250
 bitch not well apart from the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.949
 trainers without face as we have seen and 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.379
 this mega volcano and this is not the worst 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.120
 that you can get to see in Pokémon x 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.250
 yes today because before then good 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.050
 if there was the power save and the maximum 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.000
 you could do was get things that 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.950
 they were already in the game or 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.509
 get an unlimited number of things 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.539
 but what things that already existed and already 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.009
 I was in the game that is, you could not 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.210
 to do could not suffer a volcano eo 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.830
 because it was a pokémon that 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.880
 saying it is not also the memory of 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.710
 game or something like that 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.810
 well I think it was but let's go 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.429
 they did not put it or be as much as you can 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.750
 get could yes and objects like a 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.429
 nation if such forward like that since a 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.550
 despite existing in the memory of the game 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:34.100
 they never parted, that is, I can not imagine 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.159
 that if it comes out what is new games 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.450
 or so and buying in pokemon blond megan 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.800
 and sapphire to the country to which new mega 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.959
 returns, what will be done will be 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.310
 that does not get an update for 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.929
 add the new new stones to 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.239
 pokemon xy because if not what happens is 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.220
 that all these people can get those 

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:51.890
 mega returns in pokémon xy if not 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.360
 is said update so what 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.800
 would do a little bit annoy the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.200
 surprise for because very mega mega says 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.270
 to be alfano but but flippant that is 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.090
 literally destructive this cocoon 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.160
 because I'm going to 12 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.330
 I think flipante to the point or 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.739
 pokemon xy is worth here besides going the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.390
 life of the volcano and although I think it's 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.040
 lifeless and is fighting you do not see very 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.560
 well the truth but it is that it is not 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.010
 Llama called a lot of attention because 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.060
 is how it is or is this this makes 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.069
 time that is not say without seeing a game 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.180
 Pokemon hacked so vast mind but 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.420
 a lot of time or really 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.609
 and the jaleos there is a lot of time without 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.890
 pokemon group so so so so 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:39.159
 hacked by is this is this is 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.439
 awesome this is already happening or is this 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.299
 it happens and we all know it and look here 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.849
 the box goes latin star and it's going to 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.590
 bring a flippant host but this does not 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.750
 it's all because then they throw a bout of 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.790
 double I think these two when this 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.030
 again done in a double combat and it's 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.829
 what is it for is something something is really cool 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.109
 amazing I wish I had the code 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.700
 combat and I could have recorded it from 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:04.940
 a good way is to say as in the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.080
 capturing but good or 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.380
 I dont know 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.500
 to bolt canyon look, I do not think 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.990
 affects nothing and such, if you were 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.760
 few fish that were not seen could not be seen 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.680
 ok here it is but let's get up now 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.780
 pull another volcano in our group and 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.550
 then the goal will evolve that neither will 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.110
 Worry saint and also be flip 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.210
 yes they had already achieved ago 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.180
 a couple of months ago like a volcano 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.940
 I sainz and all that but I do not know 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.860
 first not so vast mind and how they do 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.780
 Now it is that they are always walking 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.670
 in a kind of power for pokemon 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.010
 x for little mo'nique and if I do not know a bear 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.600
 extracting the 620 with a thing that 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.980
 called safe dong which is also something 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.660
 very cheap cheaper than power save 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.340
 and of course this is what happens now fixos 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.180
 the other fight that the truth is still 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.470
 more freaking because apart from the uncle this 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.700
 that has a name so long that it does not 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.920
 you can put the name so long besides 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.390
 even with Japanese characters 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.300
 that we are the one who takes us out 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.860
 pokemon egg to fight what balls or 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.320
 be like what an egg remained but 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.050
 well there's the egg there bonsai 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.450
 not by the way as not and on average 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.709
 the egg evolves mega egg and not 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.219
 I'm talking mainly my eggs 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:17.919
 but this new pokémon is worth 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:19.780
 the know is how come is not going to q 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.330
 have a mega egg yes yes if there is 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.470
 unfortunately or fortunately there is 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.870
 a mega ball come and raise your defense in 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.270
 finally it is that boys whenever that is 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.500
 I see a little more light and not because I 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.479
 the sight like that a little bit doing and 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.740
 ezeiza skipping parts of the video but 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.660
 now that the days and commenting by 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.520
 over is that I'm like hallucinating 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.289
 because it does not seem like normal or 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.120
 was not in my life had I seen with 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.039
 marriage because I really mean it and that 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.509
 capture the hacks were a lot more to 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.699
 the order of the day because it was very many 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.949
 easy hacker a game and take away to be 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.750
 so easy people do not know which one was in 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.330
 do this kind of thing or I have not 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.220
 seen or I have not looked for what things 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.539
 how do you want to say it but in my life 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.270
 I had seen an egg fight because 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.949
 monkeys and that sometime in some in some 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.320
 ja explain how this forever if you or 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.810
 be a mega egg a mega is 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.900
 mega volcano john me la chupá what the fuck 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.440
 this is something impressive 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.130
 and when I say awesome it's 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.170
 impressive either in my life there was 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.210
 seen what the cats do is 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.910
 fuck the experience of the game and I what 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.590
 I admit but you do not get to a point 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.240
 change this seems to me to be curious and 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.510
 It strikes me that's why I'm like this 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.620
 little to say excited because 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.040
 really in my life I had seen something 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.250
 well and it seems supernatural to me that you want 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.250
 I tell you 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.130
 what the hell and the egg has also 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.680
 used the attack this should be 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.990
 currently diamonds and it still rises 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.770
 the mother earthquake defense yes yes 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:51.410
 Well, that egg is right now 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.900
 One is God I want a better egg 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.790
 See why because it might be that your 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.400
 mega in pokémon blond legalization alpha 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.640
 would be mega egg seriously would blow power 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.350
 take out that a good bat that seen 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.540
 seen it surely from the first day 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.130
 and there he starts to see jarque excited 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.050
 from the second avant video yes but 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.270
 good because total what I would have to 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.250
 create would be a seix editor of that 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.810
 game and neither is it the most expensive 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.090
 because what it cost so far in 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.740
 little less if it was to obtain support by 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.390
 stress of the ceip in but it is already 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.600
 can do and in addition in a very 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:27.020
 easy so I do not think it costs either 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.450
 I do not know much about doing it 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.520
 Let's go from the day a 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.050
 pokémon blond mechanization al for the 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.710
 selling almost as I'm in 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.710
 mega egg 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.380
 Come on, I think there are going to be those 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.330
 I believe that everything will be all all 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.820
 ready I think it is to be able to let 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.620
 the game which will be a little bitch 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.260
 especially for the new megas and such 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.550
 because molaría is not used to discover like this 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.440
 is in the game itself that only in the 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.240
 things that I like most in pokémon x xi and it's 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.250
 that there were no hacks at the beginning of 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.600
 game which mostly for people 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.400
 that we are from europe that the game to come out 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.530
 a week later although at the end and at 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.180
 we'll get it done process two days 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.470
 before a day before I do not know why it is 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.890
 when they will give the order that can be 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:12.450
 take out for sale but well then that's not 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:14.500
 what I told you practically that 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.790
 fuck a little game experience 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.870
 and I say because it will be the 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:22.180
 Japanese and Americans with all the all 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:25.210
 the pokémon sitting I do not know how it is 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:28.270
 and with tube follow 49 you finish 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:30.100
 passing the league and say that is 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.780
 not good but still good 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.670
 curious to see it like that in a video but that 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.320
 it would be rather annoying and 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.090
 really this time the people who use 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.110
 hacks as I know and what actions 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.640
 use because they are to stay 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.409
 because military does not bother me but 

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.909
 people use notes afa things 

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:47.649
 It annoys the favorite video and appreciates 

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:49.929
 do coach without candies and with 

00:07:47.649 --> 00:07:51.849
 chicken and hat because it will not have a face 

00:07:49.929 --> 00:07:53.349
 but the hat has a while so 

00:07:51.849 --> 00:07:55.119
 guys, hello, we'll see each other in the 

00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:55.749
 next channel video and up to the 

00:07:55.119 --> 00:07:58.319
 next 

00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:58.319
 goodbye
