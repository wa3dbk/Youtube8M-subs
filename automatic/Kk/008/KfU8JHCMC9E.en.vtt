going<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.949> have<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.280> buy<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.850> graphics<00:00:48.480> card

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
going to have to buy a graphics card

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.810 
going to have to buy a graphics card
that<00:00:49.320> has<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.980> dual<00:00:50.850> slot<00:00:51.359> a<00:00:52.100> it<00:00:53.100> has<00:00:53.249> to<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.579> an

that has a dual slot a it has to have an

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.479 
that has a dual slot a it has to have an
analog<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.769> a<00:00:55.789> digital<00:00:57.739> output<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.399> also

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
analog and a digital output it can also

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.310 
analog and a digital output it can also
have<00:00:59.789> s-video<00:01:00.269> but<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.780> doesn't<00:01:01.050> really<00:01:01.140> make

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
have s-video but it doesn't really make

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.259 
have s-video but it doesn't really make
a<00:01:01.379> difference<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:02.339> you<00:01:02.550> definitely<00:01:02.850> need

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
a difference but you definitely need

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.180 
a difference but you definitely need
analog<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.110> digital<00:01:06.560> now<00:01:07.560> around<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> back

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
analog and digital now around the back

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.880 
analog and digital now around the back
of<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> TV<00:01:08.640> or<00:01:09.510> check<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> make<00:01:10.500> sure<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
of the TV or check and make sure you

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.770 
of the TV or check and make sure you
have<00:01:11.130> an<00:01:11.430> analog<00:01:13.070> input<00:01:14.210> it<00:01:15.210> would<00:01:15.360> be<00:01:15.540> right

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
have an analog input it would be right

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.520 
have an analog input it would be right
here<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.230> says<00:01:16.370> RGB<00:01:17.370> pc<00:01:17.760> and<00:01:18.300> it'll<00:01:19.260> be<00:01:19.380> right

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
here it says RGB pc and it'll be right

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.770 
here it says RGB pc and it'll be right
there<00:01:19.800> but<00:01:20.400> because<00:01:20.580> i<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.940> a<00:01:20.970> vizio<00:01:21.390> okay

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
there but because i have a vizio okay

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.480 
there but because i have a vizio okay
the<00:01:21.960> first<00:01:22.140> step<00:01:22.560> once<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.980> have<00:01:23.160> all<00:01:23.340> your

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the first step once you have all your

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.880 
the first step once you have all your
materials<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:25.110> plug<00:01:25.410> in<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.810> digital<00:01:27.890> into

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
materials is to plug in the digital into

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.790 
materials is to plug in the digital into
the<00:01:29.040> back<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.690> graphics<00:01:30.690> card<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.230> then

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
the back of the graphics card and then

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.800 
the back of the graphics card and then
plug<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.130> analog<00:01:32.700> into<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> back<00:01:33.510> of<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
plug the analog into the back of the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.840 
plug the analog into the back of the
graphics<00:01:34.200> card<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:35.190> we'll<00:01:35.340> wrap<00:01:35.580> that<00:01:35.790> in

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
graphics card then we'll wrap that in

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.260 
graphics card then we'll wrap that in
you<00:01:36.600> plug<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.470> other<00:01:38.100> end<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> analog

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
you plug in the other end of the analog

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.210 
you plug in the other end of the analog
into<00:01:40.230> the<00:01:40.820> TV<00:01:42.290> with<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.560> where<00:01:43.860> i<00:01:43.890> showed

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
into the TV with the where i showed

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.870 
into the TV with the where i showed
before<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.570> plug<00:01:45.870> in<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.440> digital<00:01:46.880> into

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
before and you plug in the digital into

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.880 
before and you plug in the digital into
the<00:01:48.420> back<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.930> monitor<00:01:49.080> which<00:01:49.560> I'll<00:01:49.710> show

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the back of the monitor which I'll show

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.660 
the back of the monitor which I'll show
us<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.250> second<00:01:51.350> okay<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.620> take<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.040> other<00:01:53.220> end

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
things you can say not attached now with

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.700 
things you can say not attached now with
TV<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:43.300> go<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:45.120> input<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.470> don't<00:02:47.470> know<00:02:47.560> if

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
TV you go to a input I don't know if

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.140 
TV you go to a input I don't know if
your<00:02:47.830> remote<00:02:48.100> looks<00:02:48.310> anything<00:02:48.520> like<00:02:48.640> mine<00:02:48.910> but

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
your remote looks anything like mine but

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.680 
your remote looks anything like mine but
if<00:02:49.270> it<00:02:49.360> does<00:02:49.570> where's<00:02:50.530> my<00:02:50.980> remote<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.690> input

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
if it does where's my remote and input

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:01.440 
if it does where's my remote and input
is<00:02:54.150> right<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:58.530> tier<00:02:59.670> it's<00:03:00.670> this<00:03:01.060> one<00:03:01.300> you

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
is right the tier it's this one you

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.640 
is right the tier it's this one you
can't<00:03:01.690> really<00:03:01.810> read<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.140> because<00:03:02.230> it's<00:03:02.410> fuzzy

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
can't really read it because it's fuzzy

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.830 
can't really read it because it's fuzzy
but<00:03:02.980> whatever<00:03:03.340> it's<00:03:03.910> not<00:03:04.090> focusing<00:03:04.570> on<00:03:04.660> that

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
but whatever it's not focusing on that

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.360
