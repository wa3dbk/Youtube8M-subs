00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
anyway if you've only got one acts at a

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.420 
anyway if you've only got one acts at a
gig<00:06:35.070> throw<00:06:35.640> this<00:06:35.790> thing<00:06:36.060> into<00:06:36.300> your<00:06:36.930> loop<00:06:37.110> and

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
gig throw this thing into your loop and

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.070 
gig throw this thing into your loop and
you<00:06:38.430> can<00:06:38.610> make<00:06:38.760> it<00:06:38.910> sound<00:06:39.180> like<00:06:39.420> different

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
you can make it sound like different

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.280 
you can make it sound like different
things<00:06:40.160> I'm<00:06:41.160> making<00:06:41.490> any<00:06:41.730> sense<00:06:41.970> at<00:06:42.210> all<00:06:42.300> yeah

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.290 
things I'm making any sense at all yeah

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.860 
things I'm making any sense at all yeah
probably<00:06:43.710> not<00:06:44.040> but<00:06:44.580> I<00:06:44.790> do<00:06:44.910> like<00:06:45.210> the<00:06:45.270> pedal<00:06:45.720> I

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
probably not but I do like the pedal I

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.740 
probably not but I do like the pedal I
hope<00:06:46.050> I<00:06:46.140> showcased<00:06:46.680> some<00:06:47.090> of<00:06:48.090> the<00:06:48.240> things<00:06:48.480> that

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
hope I showcased some of the things that

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.110 
hope I showcased some of the things that
you<00:06:48.900> can<00:06:49.110> do<00:06:49.260> with<00:06:49.290> it<00:06:49.820> somebody<00:06:50.820> with<00:06:51.090> a

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
you can do with it somebody with a

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.020 
you can do with it somebody with a
little<00:06:51.300> more<00:06:51.540> skill<00:06:52.200> time<00:06:53.000> patience<00:06:54.000> and

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
little more skill time patience and

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.720 
little more skill time patience and
knowledge<00:06:54.690> could<00:06:54.900> probably<00:06:55.170> do<00:06:55.470> more<00:06:55.500> so<00:06:56.430> if

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
knowledge could probably do more so if

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.840 
knowledge could probably do more so if
