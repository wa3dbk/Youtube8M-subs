00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
apps just freezes so so I'm hoping this

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.890 
apps just freezes so so I'm hoping this
one<00:02:58.190> doesn't<00:02:58.730> do<00:02:58.850> but<00:02:59.180> on<00:02:59.360> me<00:02:59.540> i'm<00:02:59.630> going<00:02:59.780> to<00:02:59.840> go

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
one doesn't do but on me i'm going to go

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.860 
one doesn't do but on me i'm going to go
ahead<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.110> activate<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:01.190> i<00:03:01.840> don't<00:03:02.840> know

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.600 
i guess i'll do a follow up once i play
around<00:03:04.880> with<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.090> little<00:03:05.300> bit<00:03:05.420> more
