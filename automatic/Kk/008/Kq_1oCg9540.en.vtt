so<00:03:38.020> if<00:03:39.020> you<00:03:39.200> have<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.410> same<00:03:39.620> thing<00:03:39.830> I<00:03:39.920> do<00:03:39.980> where

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
so if you have the same thing I do where

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.880 
so if you have the same thing I do where
I<00:03:40.400> plug<00:03:40.850> my<00:03:41.000> internet<00:03:41.390> for<00:03:42.050> my<00:03:42.170> x-box<00:03:42.470> into<00:03:42.800> my

laptop to get the connection you

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.830 
laptop to get the connection you
probably<00:03:45.470> don't<00:03:45.710> want<00:03:45.920> to<00:03:45.980> use<00:03:46.220> a<00:03:46.840> network

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
it's not a real internet connection so

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.720 
it's not a real internet connection so
to<00:04:12.650> get<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:12.980> real<00:04:13.190> deal

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
to get the real deal

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.910 
to get the real deal
instead<00:04:14.690> of<00:04:14.900> doing<00:04:15.260> network<00:04:15.710> sharing<00:04:16.070> I<00:04:16.489> did

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
instead of doing network sharing I did

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.540 
instead of doing network sharing I did
all<00:04:18.920> yup<00:04:19.730> -<00:04:19.910> uh<00:04:20.890> alright<00:04:21.890> I<00:04:22.070> bridge<00:04:22.340> the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
all yup - uh alright I bridge the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
connections put it simple and this will

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.130 
connections put it simple and this will
work<00:04:24.620> it<00:04:25.610> worked<00:04:25.820> for<00:04:25.970> me<00:04:26.120> that's<00:04:26.840> what<00:04:27.020> I'm

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
local area connection which is your

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.190

ethernet<00:04:34.850> cord<00:04:35.210> that<00:04:35.450> you<00:04:35.510> have<00:04:35.720> plugged<00:04:35.990> in

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
ethernet cord that you have plugged in

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.680 
ethernet cord that you have plugged in
and<00:04:36.440> then<00:04:37.100> if<00:04:37.400> your<00:04:37.550> wireless<00:04:38.030> it's<00:04:38.240> wireless

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
and then if your wireless it's wireless

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.230 
and then if your wireless it's wireless
network<00:04:39.350> connection<00:04:39.890> enabled<00:04:40.610> Realtek

whatever<00:04:41.600> wireless<00:04:42.260> that's<00:04:42.980> my<00:04:43.100> Belkin<00:04:43.550> so<00:04:44.240> at

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
whatever wireless that's my Belkin so at

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.020 
whatever wireless that's my Belkin so at
first<00:04:45.200> sometimes<00:04:45.890> it<00:04:46.250> may<00:04:46.400> work<00:04:46.580> for<00:04:46.730> you<00:04:46.850> but

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
first sometimes it may work for you but

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.060 
first sometimes it may work for you but
at<00:04:47.210> first<00:04:47.419> I<00:04:47.750> was<00:04:48.470> connected<00:04:48.830> to<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.010> Internet

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
at first I was connected to the Internet

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.570 
at first I was connected to the Internet
and<00:04:50.210> no<00:04:51.210> no<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:51.690> had<00:04:51.870> Network<00:04:52.260> sharing<00:04:52.650> on<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.070> I

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
and no no I had Network sharing on and I

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.070 
and no no I had Network sharing on and I
tried<00:04:53.790> to<00:04:53.910> bridge<00:04:54.090> them<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.510> that<00:04:54.840> wouldn't

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
tried to bridge them and that wouldn't

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.960 
tried to bridge them and that wouldn't
work<00:04:55.170> so<00:04:55.380> you<00:04:55.530> have<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.740> take<00:04:55.980> off<00:04:56.220> network

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
work so you have to take off network

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.150 
work so you have to take off network
sharing<00:04:57.270> to<00:04:57.960> bridge<00:04:58.140> those<00:04:58.350> two<00:04:58.410> connections

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
sharing to bridge those two connections

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.730 
sharing to bridge those two connections
now<00:05:00.000> we<00:05:00.060> take<00:05:00.300> off<00:05:00.420> network<00:05:00.720> sharing<00:05:01.110> very

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
now we take off network sharing very

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.950 
now we take off network sharing very
simple<00:05:02.220> you<00:05:02.790> highlight<00:05:03.240> your<00:05:03.540> wireless

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
simple you highlight your wireless
