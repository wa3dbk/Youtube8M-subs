 Hi friends, let's make a ball today. 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.869
 Silk I used in the beard festival of 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.800
 a lot of people asked me last year 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.440
 to teach 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:28.529
 so let's go today and I will use 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:32.420
 half leaf down just to stay 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.420
 easier to open for you to see 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.460
 here I have five leaf 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.280
 I'm going to cut them to pieces. 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:25.450
 I have 10 when I do with the sheet 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:28.210
 whole I do with 12 sheets and quotes 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.909
 party here smaller may be just so 10 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.130
 now 10,000 each 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:42.069
 so let's make an accordion in all 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:44.759
 have fans more or less one of the two is 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.759
 affiliated 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.130
 about half or double yes 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.190
 to get better 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:22.110
 I worked half 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.110
 let's tie the end of nani 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:54.850
 not already left a big son to 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.850
 make worse what I do 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:07.700
 now let's round the arrows to 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.700
 stay well-flowed goes from little to little 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:20.510
 we got the 22 goals like that and it goes 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.510
 round with scissors 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:37.709
 saw the same thing on the other hand goes 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.709
 stay very straight 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:39.630
 we only need to open I have 10 thefts 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.590
 so I'm going to pull 5 to one side and 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.590
 five to the other 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:33.980
 now let's do the other side is the same 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:37.520
 very strange thing at the same time 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.520
 each forum 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:50.779
 then challenge 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:16.080

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.100
