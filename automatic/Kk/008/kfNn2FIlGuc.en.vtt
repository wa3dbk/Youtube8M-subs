00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
holy crap all I cared about this entire

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.510 
holy crap all I cared about this entire
time<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.170> doubt<00:01:31.560> that's<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.400> was

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
time was the doubt that's what I was

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.890 
time was the doubt that's what I was
attracted<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.240> wasn't<00:01:33.540> intellectual

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
attracted to it wasn't intellectual

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.390 
attracted to it wasn't intellectual
stimulation<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.770> was<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.100> idea<00:01:35.220> that

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
stimulation it was just the idea that

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.160 
stimulation it was just the idea that
somebody<00:01:35.759> else<00:01:36.000> could<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.540> wrong<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.020> that's

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
somebody else could be wrong and that's

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.719 
somebody else could be wrong and that's
scary<00:01:37.500> because<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.070> means<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.340> don't<00:01:38.520> believe

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729
