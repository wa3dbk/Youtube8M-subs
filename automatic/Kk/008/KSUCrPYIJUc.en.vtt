guided<00:01:31.860> scan<00:01:32.630> basically<00:01:33.630> these<00:01:33.780> allow<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.140> to

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
guided scan basically these allow you to

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.560 
guided scan basically these allow you to
scan<00:01:34.710> from<00:01:35.040> different<00:01:35.460> types<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.820> devices<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
scan from different types of devices the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.649 
scan from different types of devices the
guided<00:01:36.900> scan<00:01:37.140> also<00:01:37.470> allows<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.659> recover

guided scan also allows you to recover

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.810 
guided scan also allows you to recover
items<00:01:40.079> from<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.380> formatted<00:01:40.920> drive<00:01:41.159> or<00:01:41.549> even

files<00:02:45.750> into<00:02:46.140> independent<00:02:46.710> folders<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:47.820> you

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
files into independent folders so you

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.780 
files into independent folders so you
can<00:02:48.300> see<00:02:48.660> which<00:02:49.080> files<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:50.160> able<00:02:50.460> to<00:02:50.490> find

and if you hit the plus signs on any of
these<00:02:53.400> it's<00:02:53.700> going<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.940> break<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.270> down<00:02:54.390> and
