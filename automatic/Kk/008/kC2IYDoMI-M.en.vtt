00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.490
 gameplay to express 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.490
 release gameplay it will be short but 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.250
 informative 1 k is called m2 world of 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.130
 la myth sword and let's look at it 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.529
 this is such a kind of lpg where we will 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.210
 play all in the role of some youngster who 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.390
 has the ability to make 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.180
 turning into some kind of transformer and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.859
 so what we have here you see our 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.080
 oil and it turns into this 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.210
 transformer naturally everything here can 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.810
 pump improve and so on like in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.840
 any rpg 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.180
 there are three types of crappy venture games 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.910
 fantasy let's run one of them and 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.329
 let's see how it looks at all and 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.989
 how much the game is cool and can it 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.149
 tighten in google play it is incompatible 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.949
 with our country but I think it is not 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.879
 problem and you can find it and download 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.280
 from a third-party resource 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.469
 so it is available for free though 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.149
 Unfortunately, these are the Chinese 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.609
 developers for some reason did not want 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.420
 share with the world this game although she 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.640
 quite good has enough 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.060
 such mediocre graphics but enough 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.950
 I wonder what the combat mechanism is and 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.590
 principle, I can now chop 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.900
 playing the role of a youngster and I think will pass 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.790
 quite a bit of time when I have 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.650
 here on energy codes for me 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.990
 could turn into a year I give it to you now 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.180
 Be sure to show just let's 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.640
 wait for this moment and so besides 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.640
 this boy of ours is like a robot 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.070
 there are super blows let's try on 11 of 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.009
 for example here now 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.400
 I just accumulate energy to 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.770
 show you and 2 here's a super hit and then 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.680
 turn into a robot as well beyond that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.390
 we have bottles with 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.070
 elixir that allow us 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.590
 heal and all we need 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.710
 hold out 5 waves here it is written 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.440
 the fact that now comes the second wave of 5 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.680
 let's apply the first magic again 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.619
 so here it does damage and now we 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.780
 we can sort of turn into a robot 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.700
 so here is our character when he 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.910
 turns into a robot and we can already 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.170
 on a par with the enemy robot to fight and 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.209
 defeating him overall pretty funny 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.580
 ideas are interesting not so often in rpg 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.070
 you will meet transformer moreover 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.860
 softens in general probably about this game 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.080
 all who liked to download who do not 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.300
 look review further the second game 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.130
 called kite wounds this is beautiful 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.010
 a kind of runner where we have to 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.510
 fly a kite here there are two 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.390
 control type using accelerometer 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.900
 And with the help of tapas, that is, here and so 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.730
 such a left-right we turn the serpent 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.100
 collect coins returned from 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.870
 obstacles and pick up different lanes 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.360
 for example at the moment we picked up 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.230
 coin magnets can be collected using 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.810
 this coin let's fly to the place 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.090
 where are the coins and try to collect them 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.850
 and also we are running out of time and 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.030
 time ends see losing which 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:11.010
 seeks to get to the bomb and 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.829
 after all this we will be 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.579
 attack to bring down any missiles that 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.420
 will be self guided by our snake so 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.970
 more 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.700
 by the way it was like that to activate the magnet 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.650
 for coins and without them themselves 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.480
 were going and we got as much as possible 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.850
 more points in general 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.000
 kinda runner performed in good 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.620
 graphics with quite dynamic music and 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.980
 generally interesting idea 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.100
 3 game called Ser octopus that is 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.769
 serenity octopus family 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.959
 and let's look at this puzzle 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.420
 let's start with the first mission so not much 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.640
 bother and try you in easy 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.500
 casual atmosphere explain meaning 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.600
 from the game and so we manage 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.780
 here is such an uncle octopus him 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.210
 you must gather all his children either 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.610
 whether nephews further these children will 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.580
 located in different places and most 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.010
 the interesting thing is that when we 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.540
 connect to our children then we already 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.170
 all this how to say all this 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.500
 are lagging behind in the future because of this we 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.079
 we will be at an impasse in simpletons 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.790
 and it will already cause not big 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.530
 difficulty to pass 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.780
 and so basically the first mission 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.419
 light enough goes straight 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.280
 literally intuitive without even forcing 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.470
 you think further but really 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.710
 missions will be somewhat more difficult 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.440
 so you have a lot to think a lot 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.540
 to go through all these missions like this 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.669
 Here is a puzzle with a great cartoon 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.620
 graphics last game is called human 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.780
 slingshot it may not be issued 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.330
 great graphics but she has an idea 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.410
 just omega treshovaya that we have to 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.540
 do we have to delay the slingshot 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.630
 so here we say in angry birds and 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.880
 after that on run of our man 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.280
 out of it and make it land 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.380
 on the trampoline what can we do we can 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.210
 adjust flight altitude 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.530
 that is, so here is the tension force 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.750
 these ropes 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.330
 let's try again maybe 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.460
 we need it here 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.280
 naturally a knack for this 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.330
 the game take place without it in our lives 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.960
 nowhere 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.810
 as you see 2 days is quite difficult 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.110
 but I thought for those who adapt themselves 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.780
 won't be a big deal in general like me 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.479
 understood me this will not work to 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.660
 sorry for you try hope you 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:39.550
 it will turn out much better than me all 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.740
 Thank you very much for your attention with you 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:47.430
 there was a gameplay subscribe to the channel 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.430
 put your fingers on top and be good
