00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.800 
rather the impossibility does it not
indeed<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.660> does<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.730> yet<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:21.090> has<00:02:21.450> just

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
indeed it does and yet that has just

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.140 
indeed it does and yet that has just
been<00:02:22.050> made<00:02:22.319> possible<00:02:22.620> by<00:02:22.950> my<00:02:23.610> good<00:02:23.880> buddy

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
been made possible by my good buddy

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.540 
been made possible by my good buddy
etech<00:02:24.540> self<00:02:24.900> who<00:02:25.739> has<00:02:25.920> made<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.520> new<00:02:27.120> filter

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
etech self who has made a new filter

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.229 
etech self who has made a new filter
that<00:02:29.550> allows<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.330> do<00:02:31.050> this<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:32.220> do<00:02:32.520> just

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
that allows you to do this to do just

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.530 
that allows you to do this to do just
that<00:02:34.850> yeah<00:02:36.050> you<00:02:37.050> saw<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.430> also<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:39.120> also<00:02:39.300> was

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
that yeah you saw it also this also was

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.130 
that yeah you saw it also this also was
high<00:02:40.370> no<00:02:41.510> damage<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:43.260> entities<00:02:45.140> this

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
high no damage to the entities this

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.309 
high no damage to the entities this
filter<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.650> able<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.819> make<00:02:48.319> invulnerable

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
filter is able to make invulnerable

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.570 
filter is able to make invulnerable
entities<00:02:50.750> yeah<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:52.049> would<00:02:52.620> suggest<00:02:52.830> you<00:02:53.069> not<00:02:53.340> to

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
entities yeah I would suggest you not to

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.820 
entities yeah I would suggest you not to
put<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.120> on<00:02:54.390> our<00:02:54.660> mind<00:02:55.049> cards<00:02:55.380> because<00:02:55.530> they

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
put this on our mind cards because they

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.229 
put this on our mind cards because they
tend<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.340> become<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:57.030> bit<00:02:57.360> glitchy<00:02:58.049> like<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:59.239> not

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
tend to become a bit glitchy like so not

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.539 
tend to become a bit glitchy like so not
on<00:03:00.480> neither<00:03:01.200> on<00:03:01.440> boats<00:03:01.739> because<00:03:01.980> they<00:03:02.220> tend<00:03:02.400> to

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
on neither on boats because they tend to

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.670 
on neither on boats because they tend to
sink<00:03:02.910> for<00:03:03.209> some<00:03:03.390> reason<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:03.840> would<00:03:04.019> advise<00:03:04.500> you

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
sink for some reason I would advise you

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.210 
sink for some reason I would advise you
to<00:03:04.799> not<00:03:04.830> do<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.280> however<00:03:06.030> for<00:03:06.150> paintings<00:03:06.870> and

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
to not do that however for paintings and

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.420 
to not do that however for paintings and
item<00:03:08.220> frames<00:03:08.519> making<00:03:09.420> them<00:03:10.040> you<00:03:11.040> can<00:03:11.220> still

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
item frames making them you can still

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.880 
item frames making them you can still
rotate<00:03:11.790> them<00:03:11.970> but<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.330> cannot<00:03:12.900> interact<00:03:13.530> with

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
rotate them but you cannot interact with

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.170 
rotate them but you cannot interact with
them<00:03:14.070> because<00:03:14.250> simply<00:03:14.640> because<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:14.910> can't

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
them because simply because you can't

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.680 
them because simply because you can't
break<00:03:15.510> them<00:03:16.549> that<00:03:17.549> is<00:03:17.730> one<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.269> amazing

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
that creeper couldn't blow it up because

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.660 
that creeper couldn't blow it up because
see<00:03:30.090> they<00:03:30.540> stay<00:03:30.959> they<00:03:31.320> don't<00:03:31.650> break<00:03:31.950> off<00:03:32.220> well

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
see they stay they don't break off well

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.130 
see they stay they don't break off well
they<00:03:32.820> will<00:03:33.000> break<00:03:33.180> off<00:03:33.329> on<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.600> block<00:03:33.780> updates

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
they will break off on the block updates

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.090 
they will break off on the block updates
but<00:03:34.320> those<00:03:34.530> didn't<00:03:37.130> so<00:03:38.150> if<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.390> have<00:03:40.100> that's

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
but those didn't so if you have that's

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.580 
but those didn't so if you have that's
why<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.250> test<00:03:41.579> it<00:03:41.670> on<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:42.000> obsidian<00:03:42.269> it<00:03:43.200> was

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
why I test it on this obsidian it was

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.340 
why I test it on this obsidian it was
completely<00:03:44.150> intact<00:03:45.150> when<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.660> sandstone

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
completely intact when the sandstone

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.770 
completely intact when the sandstone
near<00:03:46.739> it<00:03:46.950> just<00:03:47.280> broke<00:03:47.519> away<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.090> then<00:03:48.540> the

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
near it just broke away and then the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.229 
near it just broke away and then the
thing<00:03:49.380> updated<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.100> fell<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:54.090> is

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
thing updated and fell and that is

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.330 
thing updated and fell and that is
insane<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:54.780> can<00:03:55.380> also<00:03:55.530> make<00:03:55.769> invulnerable

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
insane you can also make invulnerable

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.130 
insane you can also make invulnerable
mobs<00:03:56.579> like<00:03:56.850> they<00:03:57.120> won't<00:03:57.299> take<00:03:57.510> any<00:03:57.750> sort<00:03:58.079> of
