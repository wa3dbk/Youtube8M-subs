00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:15.109
 his client's farm there was a 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:18.270
 Carijó chicken that had seven chicks 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:21.840
 his supplement took care of the entire farm 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.980
 with a lot of love with a lot of affection but some 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:30.630
 enemies wanting to take possession of their 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:35.340
 earth set fire to 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.629
 destroy the farm and destroy everything 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.300
 your client had this carijó chicken 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:48.000
 she was terrified when she saw fire 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:51.690
 approaching her chicks she 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.510
 he also saw the work of his clement 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.730
 I used to throw water around trying to 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.539
 flames 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:06.360
 this chicken then starts calling the 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:10.770
 their chicks but one of them solves 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.310
 to become alone and she is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.680
 Because of that there was the chick 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.009
 your calling 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.130
 but those I saw in your calling 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:26.310
 she then spread her wings and protected 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.549
 all the chicks right next to each other 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.950
 protect with wings 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:35.970
 but that chick that was 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.570
 disobedient ended up being consumed by the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.110
 fire 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:45.220
 the carijó chicken continue to protect 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:49.410
 their chicks but the heat was so 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:54.280
 so unbearable that only the heat 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:56.140
 burned their feathers and their feathers 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.280
 they burned 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.280
 and she died 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:08.879
 past the fire all the chicks 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:12.769
 left under their wings and were 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.769
 safe and sound 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.099
 the farm is the world 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.250
 The owner of the farm is God who cares 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:27.750
 always from its creation the enemy to 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.239
 Satan who wants to destroy the work of God 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.010
 to take possession of what belongs to 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.739
 God, because he 's a thief. 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.360
 He is a bad factor. He came to kill. 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:42.420
 stealing and destroying the chicken is our 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.700
 Lord and Savior Jesus Christ 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.690
 died for our sins for us 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.010
 and the chick who died in the 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.420
 fire 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:58.260
 is the Christian rebel or is the human being 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:01.769
 rebel who does not hear the Lord's voice and 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.630
 it does not come under its wings in 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:11.100
 jesus chapter 23 verse 37 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.920
 says the following how many times your a 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.459

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.230
 join the chicks under your wings 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.410
 and you do not want to say 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.400
 but to all who will receive the Lord 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.280
 Jesus 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.730
 the father gave them the power to be made 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.730
 sons of god
