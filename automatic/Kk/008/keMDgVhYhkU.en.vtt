the<00:01:38.909> h2<00:01:41.150> don't<00:01:42.150> think<00:01:42.329> anything<00:01:42.630> else<00:01:42.689> is

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the h2 don't think anything else is

being<00:01:43.079> done<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.470> any<00:01:43.649> more<00:01:43.799> power<00:01:44.040> would

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
being done to it any more power would

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.060 
being done to it any more power would
crack<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.909> block<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.180> think<00:01:48.180> that's<00:01:48.420> it

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
crack the block so I think that's it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
stuff done so you'll see a base of that
