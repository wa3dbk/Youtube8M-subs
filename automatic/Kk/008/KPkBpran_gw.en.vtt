00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello everyone welcome to my 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.390
 channel this video will be my collection 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.400
 varnishes she's really small and I will tell 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.150
 and show how each shade looks like 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.809
 elbows and so the first varnish of this series color 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.509
 intense 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.000
 it is in such a company from 1 1 3 to 7 2 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.029
 shade of this company at number 2 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.010
 turquoise and single elephant strip 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.930
 two layers fall in principle ok but 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.869
 the only negative is that he 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.250
 probably dries for about an hour and keeps 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.600
 for two days 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.640
 second varnish avon series gel finish 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.420
 also really like the color and such 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.329
 in one layer also bald spots strip a 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.270
 two layers so beautiful deep 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.890
 a little bit like that dark silver shade 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.870
 with sparkles on sparkles and there are such 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.700
 medium-sized they just shimmer in 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.940
 general holds on 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.969
 Three or four days these lags are called 1 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.270

 hue is called the path to fame me 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.659
 really like here on that at once 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.299
 him such a translucent coating but i 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.840
 always apply 2 coats and dries by the way 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.549
 he is pretty fast his resistance is not 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.590
 much big more than two days he 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.330
 not holding much and a little bad 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.330
 erased from groans due to the fact that 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.390
 he has such a close shade way to 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.790
 fame he is so bright and he 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.700
 extinguish in one layer he will raise two words 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.619
 looks good gum that dries he does not 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.400
 very fast but within half an hour to me 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.400
 nails dries out 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.850
 this lacquered by golden rose from the rish series 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.460
 color is very well applied in one layer 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.030
 not polish and two words too great 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.270
 but the color is more deeply saturated 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.909
 shade number 13 holds on 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.759
 somewhere two days and then the end of the second 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.899
 day on the same slazit with the tips of the nails 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:05.360
 lacquer gradually it's such a golden rose from 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.560
 from the same series only color in my 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.379
 shade 49 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.650
 and here is such a matte varnish it is absolutely 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:18.230
 a matt firm called opium tint 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:20.180
 124 blessings golden rose to me 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.160
 like them very much no color 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.900
 palette and tassel tassel she 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.480
 pretty wide very comfortable and 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.370
 apply this varnish in one coat 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.370
 and in two words it seems to be caught quite well 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.569
 this local really surprised him 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:41.030
 a little bit like that can be said matt on 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.639
 the camera was reflected in them and I want to say 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.060
 that I did not want to take him for a long time 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:49.430
 bought at the supermarket a b b or table he 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.799
 very cheap that about seven green and was 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.840
 such a large color palette in the base 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.079
 tenge were all bright orange and yellow 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.639
 and others so by persistence i 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.319
 really happy because 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.900
 lasts for three or four days 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.310
 and when I circulation you remains only 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.230
 very much as if from a little lat 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.389
 absorbed into the nails and remains such 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.280
 divorces on the nails which is a little bit 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.430
 hard to wash off and so basically them 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.319
 I was pleased with the way of the series 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.780
 ivan star of hollywood shade if not 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.459
 mistaken is called a star with character 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.669
 here the word loot goes well not 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.989
 polls keeps probably day 3 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.730
 the next varnish is also a star series 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.040
 Hollywood shade is called 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.019
 cover girl i like more 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.450
 the fact that it dries out literally 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.760
 20 minutes maximum 30 and very good 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.910
 lays down in 1 and 2 slots there is it does not strip 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.170
 without any problems that is very 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.620
 like him so handsome 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.970
 gloss red color two more varnishes and 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.510

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.340
 Here is the color of varnish on the nails 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.850
 which is darker from the color series 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.280
 intense 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.000
 he is actually so darker 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.010
 target even a little bit 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.110
 dark maroon pours and here is such 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.060
 very light varnish 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.980
 I liked the fact that it probably 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.100
 the only light paws that does not strip 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.680
 at 11 falls very well so gives 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.150
 light coating and in two layers is more 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.840
 It looks a little bright light 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.940
 pinkish 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:27.419
