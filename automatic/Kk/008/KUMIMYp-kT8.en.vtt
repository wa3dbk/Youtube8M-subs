00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello everyone welcome to a 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.819
 more video than tj has already come out the second 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.500
 teaser of star wars the force water 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.200
 they want to wake up from strength in 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
 Spanish and I liked it a lot 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.809
 flipping with the 3d right now I've seen 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.299
 a lot of things that I liked 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.869
 I want to comment with you and good 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.609
 I expected not something else is just what 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.930
 I wanted to have taught me what I was looking for 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.789
 it's fine I'm not going to fall short has it 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.859
 I liked the trailer and it's 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.689
 that I really want this movie 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.179
 as I also have others as a terminator 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.740
 genesis and a sit work but star wars 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.780
 for me it's another one of my franchises that 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.180
 I love and the truth this trailer 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.370
 they have many things that have uploaded me 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.200
 level of mercy through the clouds so 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.850
 let's move on to comment and we're going to 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.140
 see what has caught my attention 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.149
 and good if you see something that I have 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.980
 escaped as we discussed below we are going 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.230
 to it the first scene we can see 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.020
 is the desert sand of the planet already 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.670
 q q planet and say that in twitter 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.199
 official of the ball droid have told me 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.579
 they were going to the planet and q 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.620
 so it may be that this planet is 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.449
 will call yacu or it might be high 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.309
 twin because in the last two good the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.549
 last two of the two sagas begins the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.930
 history or is very much related 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.430
 contact and that is the house 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.910
 instead of anakin and then is home 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.830
 by luke skywalker in this scene we can 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.300
 see in the foreground the speeder that 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.580
 was moving to the right and we see 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.380
 an x wing in the foreground and background 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.540
 we see a super epic imperial cruiser 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.180
 destroyed that has crashed against the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.580
 desert sand I say tatooine 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.520
 why 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.080
 the voice- over of luke skywalker says that 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.310
 the strength was in my father the force 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.979
 is in my sister and strength now 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.780
 it is in this also in you I this 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.220
 I can interpret also that everything 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.350
 it starts in the same place it has a lot 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.550
 what to see but for now let's say that 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.950
 it is already called what he said of the 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.260
 official droid twitter so nothing 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.660
 and good another scene that has been super 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.670
 epic is seeing the burnt helmet of darth 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.110
 Vader the helmet that I wore if you remember 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.570
 at the end of the return of the jedi because what 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.810
 they will watch like all the Jedi and see the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.300
 burned helmet is has been a total nod 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.040
 to darth vader super epic I do not know if it 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.450
 will give more as to darth vader it was said that 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.489
 was going to come out we do not know if it refers to 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.470
 this little cameo with the helmet is going to 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.989
 come out as if they were dagoba in the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.790
 cave a kind of flashback or something the 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.890
 case is that the helmet of darth vader to me 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.150
 my hype has gone through the clouds and it's 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.580
 I can not wait for it to come from 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.260
 December and the truth that is is another 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.120
 detail that has touched me and in this 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.130
 scene we see our dear r2 that 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.600
 excessive is my favorite droid not 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.670
 I want more droids I just want around 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.620
 of two and we see the metallic hand that 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.060
 it can be from luke skywalker it can be no 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.800
 I'm sure that's what I bring to you 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.930
 why 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.860
 when he says I have strength just goes out 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.840
 here playing at r2 d2 and good is another 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.570
 detail in case you do not know how to give an account and 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.060
 good this scene also welcomed from the 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.920
 trailer we see the x wing on a 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.970
 planet that I do not know if it can be and has fit 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.010
 that the planet because it has 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.790
 different contrasts in this case is a 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.790
 pretty planet 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.330
 green we see that it appears let's say a 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.340
 architecture similar to the one that appears in 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.020
 alter we think boiler is not 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.910
 destroyed but the type of planets 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.590
 like the new x wing to this 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.819
 modified and improved version that 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.730
 we could see in the other video the 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.720
 differences that we had see them 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.820
 flying at ground level on a 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.380
 will administered x wing except 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.390
 for the star of death and so low 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.680
 it's tall and good here we have another 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.480
 scene from the famous sword of the 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.060
 controversy that the sit and the 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.410
 true that now that I've seen it in 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.120
 another scene in sight movement of 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.500
 attacking I started to like it a bit more 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.200
 I know that everyone is going to be 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.720
 over for this comment but good the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.550
 I have really stayed 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.750
 this time filled with this scene from the 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.090
 sword not like I stayed with the other time 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.700
 and well here we see a plan a first 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.200
 plane of what will be the site of the 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.000
 movie we do not know if it will be bad in the 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.100
 three sagas the case is that it reminds me 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.720
 very much to give rebane if you have played 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.700
 to knights of the old republic or 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.160
 to the republic or have you read the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.570
 comics of star wars because you will have 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.069
 who I speak and the truth the resemblance is 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.049
 pretty pretty 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.920
 same as we say that I believe that the 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.590
 wearing this helmet is totally 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.490
 a tribute to give him ban and if we continue 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.800
 this scene has caught my attention 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.800
 because we see an imperial army we see 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.709
 in the background someone who seems to be 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.269
 in a lectern that on a planet this time 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.889
 ice cream and I do not know if it 's the same planet 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.150
 before we see green you have already told us 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.370
 that can be completely with button and 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.660
 contrasts and it reminded me of the scene 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.919
 with the background emperor I do not know if it will be 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.690
 yes we've seen before which is 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.860
 above but good we also see the new 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.050
 design of the stormtroopers already 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.120
 we had seen but here we go back to 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.030
 comment on this other scene we can see 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.560
 one of the ships of the empire this time 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.880
 it's about the tee fighter we see him 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.740
 is modified is different from the one 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.020
 we could see in the star wars movies of 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.430
 the first trilogy and we see the lights 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.660
 reds underneath that neither the 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.800
 I was wearing even the wings are a bit 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.410
 different let's say they open towards 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.570
 the sides as we can see in this 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.950
 image I like I also like 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.990
 this design just as I like the design 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.700
 of the x wing and good in this other 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.710
 scene we see an imperial cruise also 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.720
 it's something different from the ones we've seen 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.430
 especially in the front is 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.130
 as cut and as if I had two 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.860
 panels and we see a shuttle similar to 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.510
 the dividium shuttle that we saw in the 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.409
 first trilogy of star wars and good 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.869
 also in the last 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.909
 of the new trilogy we saw a 

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:16.529
 Shuttle very similar to this one and we see it 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.820
 who is being escorted by several 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:22.000
 ships more is a detail 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.160
 that comes out in the trailer and well no 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.840
 we know who goes on board that ship not 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.310
 we know if there will be a new emperor if 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.290
 will be to say that we have seen will be the 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.000
 right hand of this new emperor as well 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.650
 that we will continue more here we see the one 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.090
 will be the new adventure companion that 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.200
 this ball droid which is the same one that has 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.060
 said that they were on the planet since 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.740
 I suppose it will replace on the fingers and 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.540
 how good we know that the 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.340
 characters of the classic trilogy but 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.650
 we do not know if they are going to go out a lot to 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.050
 leave little and network or leave alone in 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.670
 some scenes or it will come out in all and 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.520
 well this scene is the beginning of 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.410
 maybe the best trailer scene we see 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.550
 an imperial cruise we do not know and 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.870
 we feel we've seen those before 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.460
 others appeared another by the way that 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.080
 has and we see that by one of the 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.880
 reactors is is getting the 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.040
 millennial hawk and who leads the falcon 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.260
 millennial then who but they leave alone 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.540
 and chivas and chivas here we see that 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.940
 come out of the hawk we see these famous 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.160
 walls that the hawk has on the roof 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.050
 and such and we see that it comes out if they go with the 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.130
 bow and we see frank just that besides I 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.620
 love to see harrison ford 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.940
 characterized and so nothing if I 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.650
 I lost some detail I asked for something 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.420
 we can comment on it in the comments 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.100
 so I do not expect you to like the 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.790
 video and you know 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:31.390
 december starwars hard and war in summer 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.140
 in july terminator genesis go year 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.330
 what awaits us 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.330
 and the avengers until the next video
