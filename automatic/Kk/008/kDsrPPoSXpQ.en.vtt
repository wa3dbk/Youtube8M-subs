00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.780
 hello everyone I'm apm nya and today I'm back 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.369
 with a video to show you how 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.170
 return the battery little by little to 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.200
 your iphone since every once in a while 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.320
 it spoils us lasts less here you can 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.930
 see in the cydia is an application there 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.820
 several in the appstore but I have not 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.090
 worked none that I used one that 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.739
 is in cydia and to find it you have 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.440
 what to put because this is the repo of 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:43.160
 Vctor is the obligation free and they put 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.160
 you are looking for your material you are looking for 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:51.530
 they come out, do not paint here 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.510
 and good is how to always install 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.210
 and once installed I'm not sure if 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.870
 ask for respite I do not think not but the 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.870
 you have here 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.259
 and good the first screen that you have 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.290
 is when you look at them and the disk of 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.890
 our iphone tennis bluetooth 3g 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.280
 if you have some sort this if you have the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.890
 very high brightness and all that I have everything 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.240
 that activated everything I need and I 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.240
 he says he's losing a lot of battery 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 fast if you want to connect 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.399
 teaches us everything you have since 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.549
 it is consuming battery if you want 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:36.159
 I'll fix it just give it to you 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.560
 self-destructive but I do not want that 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.909
 I do it because it takes away everything and I have 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.090
 what I need 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:48.149
 the second screen are like modes what 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.240
 there are many these first five come 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:56.380
 by default but I have made one why 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.680
 I have put what I want to have the 3g 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.890
 has put some kind is everyone 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.600
 cited had not been removed because everything 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.289
 what I need everything you see there the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.880
 shine 75 and here you have these for 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.880
 example this is the normal one that comes to you 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.510
 that opens you all bluetooth - the plane 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.510
 it makes my account shine and the block 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.300
 automatic or ads 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:28.940
 and the others are because it takes everything away 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:33.210
 asleep if you click on them you can see 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:36.750
 screen locks 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.020
 I think it 's the one he used the most when 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.580
 plug in the iphone 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.610
 Well tell me what makes you a fast charge 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.790
 as you see there the three circuits 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.830
 there's under the dark green sun that 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.260
 put fast charges circulating with 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.740
 charge and the third thing is when it fixes 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.200
 the battery you have to leave the century 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.880
 complete if you do not do it is the same 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.550
 I will not spoil our battery either 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.330
 for the best that you leave here you have 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.000
 a calendar of everything you have 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.780
 all the loads that you have done and you see 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.120
 that I have some classes take it half 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.420
 the latter with the facts well a 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.400
 full cycle which is what this calls 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.820
 application is when you are for less 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.720
 of 20% and I'll load it up I'll say this 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.820
 until the last little circle ends 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.380
 it takes more takes some three hours in 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.420
 load it whole so I recommend you 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.390
 that you do it at night and that you do not 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.600
 use to make it better 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.410
 and here is some advice if you give 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.569
 there to the second line that 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.939
 you can not read for 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.010
 because it gives you advice standing on the 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:51.319
 battery last nothing if it does not break 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.940
 you can see here all the tips 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.980
 true 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.870
 but there are many who write if you do 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.440
 everything he says 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.890
 I can not use my mobile 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.380
 then in the fourth little eyelash 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.030
 we hope to apply are the applications 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.030
 What else do they consume? 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.959
 here you can see all the ones that I use since 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.549
 they are the ones that consume me the most 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.549
 is that very many 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.280
 but good is that here yours 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.400
 whatsapp for example I'm not going to 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.770
 remove but keep in mind that you spend 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.820
 much 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.080
 in the last tab is the first 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:42.349
 is 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:47.060
 it takes off everything lets almost call and sms 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.060
 when it is below what you see 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.150
 and this avoid because you can not use it 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.529
 of a good one that does that is not that 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.399
 you can not basically find it 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.399
 this is 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.830
 this 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.419
 annoying 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.029
 I did not get this at all 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:16.119
 this is that the third is not block 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:19.089
 lash that when what is the 

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:21.750
 device if you have several 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:24.900
 open applications 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.240
 after a time here for example 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.830
 10 minutes if you have the device 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.820
 created 10 minutes 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:36.180
 of the lands you can all put 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.770
 some you do not want customer closing is 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.600
 quite useful but I'm not just 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.000
 to convince 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.529
 well this that you room that came down from that 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.409
 it would be the result when you unlock 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:51.990
 Well it is said what is the device 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:54.540
 Tells you that you have deleted such obligations 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:58.140
 the next is when what does the 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:02.060
 device that will remove the 3g 4g 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.060
 after the time that you 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.560
 but of course if you do that they do not reach you 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.720
 enough 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.470
 messages from the world in any application 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.470
 messaging 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.930
 we have the battery information 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.889
 As you can see, I 'm using it because 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.770
 I have the fatal battery 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:25.349
 it ends very fast and you can get here 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.330
 you can see all the information 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:29.449
 our battery bis mine is 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:33.350
 overheated 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:36.700
 and where else this is for 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:40.430
 for notification center stuff 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.830
 you have the shortcuts there 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.770
 of the status bar when you apply in 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.490
 Battery 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:51.750
 but remember to load what are several 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:56.590
 things this from other other settings of 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:57.430
 social networks and support applications and 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:01.270
 nothing else 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:04.030
 this application is very good I had 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.310
 the fatal battery had it like in a 60 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.710
 the peak and it has recovered me and I continue 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.220
 doing it I do not know if I can recover the 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:14.220
 everything but it's serving me well 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.050
 this has been everything to tell me if as 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.560
 you prefer that I like the videos and with a 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.610
 camera watching the mobile from outside or 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.550
 making them and recording a screen 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.860
 directly and this has been all not 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.540
 I have more to say to like 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.160
 defined in the first time it says a 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.160
 my video and until the next day
