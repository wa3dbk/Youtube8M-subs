00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:08.910
 movie theme 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.740
 brazier with his own hands and every person 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.590
 who do something with their own hands 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.000
 that is, as the so -called do- it -yourselfers 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.480
 always it 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.619
 and tries to do this thing for himself 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.760
 he himself is now basically a big brazier 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.010
 what choice do you want any up to 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.540
 that there is a whole barbecue 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:37.739
 how would such portable stoves 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.840
 but i'm saying that homemade forever 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.360
 do for yourself with your own hands with 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.270
 of this cohort of homemade people I myself so 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.500
 say also carry 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:53.399
 these to this cohort and made for myself 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.800
 Here is a brazier this is the second manal but 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.870
 2 I made it easier in what plan 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:04.739
 You see, I kind of worked out more correctly. 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.830
 even pereral in some sense in 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.260
 I always saw my grandmother’s childhood 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.890
 Singer such a machine everyone knows sewing 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.250
 Yes, and so I just remembered it from this 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.049
 zen air but decided such legs and 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.790
 modeled himself that is, well, as if 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.880
 peredral on here it is cousin roughly speaking 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.470
 but I like a shape like this 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.420
 did i just took sketching on 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:39.600
 so so so then it all drove the size and 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:44.100
 as usual did one to one drawing 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.740
 On dvp or on beat on chipboard that under 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.320
 hands were then all the details well, 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:57.329
 welded here and all the technology means 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:01.110
 Now Astana is not the most yes it is 12 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.020
 squares these are the main legs of this 12 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.789
 square jumper and there inside that 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.860
 10 square and so that it does not fail 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.320
 since it's 12 years old here you see in 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.540
 I just had otters from me and showed 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.500
 overview of crowns and here these crowns 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.680
 otters remain this in this case 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.420
 copper otters just then legs for 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.490
 the investigator cut the thread and 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.360
 Baltic us she's screwed in such 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.210
 otter of this on even on the sand can 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.400
 set the grill on the lawn everywhere and 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.880
 she he feels steadily not 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.820
 fails because she does not 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:50.170
 like means how I bent it 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:53.459
 yes not that simple and easy well here I am 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.459
 I showed you such a tool 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:06.490
 here it is taken and quietly this 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:10.540
 radius stands out and looking for a bush like that 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:14.140
 the tool can be applied I live vomiting 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:19.150
 and not easy not normally everything is possible 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:22.849
 do and here is how I got a bed there 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.250
 such beauty stuff 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.470
 here even see jumpers specifically 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.860
 put enough of these two 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.849
 jumpers and here here is jumper and 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:40.769
 this is enough of such a bed 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:45.150
 it is light and comfortable and you appreciate it 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.989
 I see that it looks beautiful now about 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.620
 trough 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:52.110
 trough metal construction is the most important 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.319
 because they do with poltorashki 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.390
 see it even on temperature 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.720
 his one and a half or there is graph paper 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:07.890
 generally burns out quickly is a troika 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:11.519
 mean length is 600 by 350 and height is 160 by 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:15.139
 drilled such holes 8 millimeters with 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:18.900
 one side and here's the same thing 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:24.810
 this in order to maintain well 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:27.919
 he wiped better turns cut it was 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.410
 i have sheet metal i just have it 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.150
 grinder cut that's all that is if u 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.250
 who have the opportunity to Zālīte tries 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.260
 chop up this one but i have this 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.350
 there was no possibility of it from the Bulgarian 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.690
 okay under the sly everything is possible 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.440
 here cut off such conditions 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.610
 holiday workshop all this is done later 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.100
 I always leave shoes on purpose 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.740
 then you make a better fire 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.320
 and the heat somehow lasts longer 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:03.500
 when the hive is already recruited a lot then 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:09.150
 apply in fertilizer and now there is such 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:12.600
 the expander is hard but it 's guys 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.400
 made a forge to me so a gift 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.460
 such was 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:22.160
 from friends 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:24.020
 Well, now I use the pride principle 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.500
 little if loaded at the cottage 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.970
 Well, it will be necessary to fry something and 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.990
 make a video for you to show them 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:36.190
 use how to kindle but for now i'm 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.190
 showing review 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:45.910
 on all sides I repeat it again 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:51.169
 can be done in the conditions of country and and all 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:56.000
 of DIY is doing well and the height of another 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:57.320
 900 millimeters that is comfortable standing in 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.500
 all growth calm 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.199
 But if the skewer turned there 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.070
 I turn the lattice over here 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:09.800
 considerations went to such a height because 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.229
 what have they do too low too 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.650
 small well, I think I decided 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:17.889
 right with the dimensions here is my 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.560
 country grill and 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:26.169
 so now I kind of praise myself yes 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.210
 and about the rights out and now you say 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.889
 Like Dislike 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.349
 it will be a real score 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:35.500
 with you was the channel helpful tips and 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:40.280
 devices for cottages and houses 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:45.250
 thumb up thumb down questions for all 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.250
 I will answer to new meetings
