00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.520 
weeks is the best gather for me because
it<00:02:26.510> allows<00:02:26.750> my<00:02:26.959> hair<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.500> grow<00:02:29.019> as<00:02:30.019> much<00:02:30.350> as

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
it allows my hair to grow as much as

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.819 
it allows my hair to grow as much as
it's<00:02:30.709> going<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:30.980> grow<00:02:31.130> for<00:02:32.320> what<00:02:33.320> a<00:02:33.350> month<00:02:33.440> I

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
it's going to grow for what a month I

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:40.000 
it's going to grow for what a month I
guess<00:02:34.540> but<00:02:35.540> at<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.959> same<00:02:36.170> time<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.799> also<00:02:39.010> it's

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
guess but at the same time and also it's

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.949 
guess but at the same time and also it's
not<00:02:40.280> too<00:02:40.489> much<00:02:40.640> time<00:02:40.970> in<00:02:41.180> between<00:02:41.239> married<00:02:41.810> I

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
not too much time in between married I

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.150 
not too much time in between married I
think<00:02:41.989> so<00:02:42.500> yeah
