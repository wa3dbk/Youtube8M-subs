the<00:00:19.760> initial<00:00:20.060> concept<00:00:20.900> was<00:00:21.140> for<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:22.279> uniform

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
the initial concept was for the uniform

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.950 
the initial concept was for the uniform
to<00:00:22.910> represent<00:00:23.330> something<00:00:23.510> that's<00:00:23.750> unique

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
right now we have an expression that we

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.780 
right now we have an expression that we
use<00:00:39.260> around<00:00:39.470> the<00:00:39.620> office<00:00:40.010> as<00:00:40.129> steeped<00:00:40.580> in

uniforms they are built for the future
so<00:00:46.970> we<00:00:47.120> have<00:00:47.300> landed<00:00:48.200> on<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:49.010> perfectly<00:00:49.969> the

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
so we have landed on it perfectly the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.910 
so we have landed on it perfectly the
end<00:00:50.450> result<00:00:50.899> is<00:00:51.050> probably<00:00:51.500> one<00:00:51.710> of<00:00:51.739> our

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
end result is probably one of our

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.500 
end result is probably one of our
strongest<00:00:52.190> uniforms<00:00:53.000> out<00:00:53.149> of<00:00:53.239> this<00:00:53.300> whole

it<00:00:59.420> was<00:00:59.570> actually<00:01:00.050> named<00:01:00.290> after<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.950> outlet

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
it was actually named after the outlet

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.029 
it was actually named after the outlet
for<00:01:01.789> 25<00:01:02.210> bomber<00:01:02.510> squadron<00:01:03.020> which<00:01:03.620> was<00:01:03.860> the

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
squadron indicator forces the fact that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.010 
squadron indicator forces the fact that
dovetails<00:01:09.530> into<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:10.630> francophone<00:01:11.630> element

dovetails into the francophone element

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.930 
dovetails into the francophone element
where<00:01:12.170> this<00:01:12.350> is<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:12.530> only<00:01:12.940> francophone

definitely has a historical context to
it<00:01:25.520> but<00:01:26.209> we<00:01:26.539> definitely<00:01:26.780> wanted<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:27.259> have<00:01:27.530> a

it but we definitely wanted to have a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.070 
it but we definitely wanted to have a
modern<00:01:28.340> design<00:01:28.670> we<00:01:28.819> wanted<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.119> appeal<00:01:29.479> to<00:01:29.509> a

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
modern design we wanted to appeal to a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.710 
modern design we wanted to appeal to a
young<00:01:30.470> fan<00:01:30.770> in<00:01:31.640> particular<00:01:31.849> we<00:01:32.390> wanted

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
young fan in particular we wanted

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.749 
young fan in particular we wanted
something<00:01:32.929> that<00:01:33.140> was<00:01:33.890> significantly

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
something that was significantly

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.320 
something that was significantly
different<00:01:35.649> we<00:01:36.649> have<00:01:37.009> some<00:01:37.280> colors<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:37.970> still

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
different we have some colors that still

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.839 
different we have some colors that still
have<00:01:38.569> some<00:01:38.899> link<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.429> colors<00:01:40.670> that

00:01:40.839 --> 00:01:40.849 
have some link to to to the colors that

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:43.449 
have some link to to to the colors that
perhaps<00:01:41.569> our<00:01:42.229> fans<00:01:42.560> are<00:01:42.679> used<00:01:42.860> to<00:01:42.950> seeing<00:01:43.009> and

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
perhaps our fans are used to seeing and

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.240 
perhaps our fans are used to seeing and
the<00:01:43.759> red<00:01:43.910> and<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.090> blue<00:01:44.530> but<00:01:45.530> we<00:01:45.679> wanted<00:01:45.979> to<00:01:46.069> go

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
the red and the blue but we wanted to go

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.430 
the red and the blue but we wanted to go
with<00:01:46.429> a<00:01:46.490> design<00:01:46.970> that<00:01:47.000> was<00:01:47.479> very<00:01:47.690> very

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
with a design that was very very

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.900 
with a design that was very very
different<00:01:48.679> than<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.190> color<00:01:49.399> i<00:01:49.490> think<00:01:49.819> is

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
different than the color i think is

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.609 
different than the color i think is
really<00:01:50.179> cool<00:01:50.390> it's<00:01:50.539> a<00:01:50.599> real<00:01:50.780> step<00:01:51.110> out<00:01:51.319> from

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
really cool it's a real step out from

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.309 
really cool it's a real step out from
their<00:01:52.459> traditional<00:01:52.670> which<00:01:53.569> was<00:01:54.050> what<00:01:54.200> we

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
their traditional which was what we

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:55.600 
their traditional which was what we
wanted<00:01:54.410> to<00:01:54.590> see<00:01:54.830> teams<00:01:55.069> do<00:01:55.310> through<00:01:55.520> this

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
wanted to see teams do through this

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.940 
wanted to see teams do through this
whole<00:01:55.819> process<00:01:55.849> was<00:01:56.420> step<00:01:57.200> away<00:01:57.349> from<00:01:57.500> you

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
whole process was step away from you

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.410 
whole process was step away from you
know<00:01:58.069> the<00:01:58.099> traditional<00:01:58.819> elements<00:01:59.209> of<00:01:59.300> your

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
know the traditional elements of your

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.820 
know the traditional elements of your
uniform<00:01:59.899> going<00:02:00.229> in<00:02:00.349> that<00:02:00.440> different

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
uniform going in that different

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.620 
uniform going in that different
direction<00:02:01.099> making<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:01.759> a<00:02:01.819> bit<00:02:01.970> more<00:02:02.090> powerful

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
direction making it a bit more powerful

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.630 
direction making it a bit more powerful
making<00:02:02.929> it<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.140> bit<00:02:03.440> edgier<00:02:03.679> I<00:02:04.069> think<00:02:04.369> that's<00:02:04.520> a

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
making it a bit edgier I think that's a

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.999 
making it a bit edgier I think that's a
great<00:02:04.759> way<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.030> describe<00:02:05.420> it<00:02:05.630> in<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.619> perfect

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
great way to describe it in a perfect

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.199 
great way to describe it in a perfect
for<00:02:07.130> Quebec<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:07.729> know<00:02:07.819> it's<00:02:07.970> our<00:02:08.090> most

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
for Quebec you know it's our most
