yep and you'll do the same thing to this
one<00:04:57.289> and<00:04:58.289> then<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.770> would<00:04:58.919> get<00:04:59.039> pieces<00:04:59.310> that

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
one and then you would get pieces that

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.000 
one and then you would get pieces that
look<00:04:59.820> like<00:04:59.880> this<00:05:00.240> now<00:05:00.930> I<00:05:00.960> did<00:05:01.349> have<00:05:01.560> a<00:05:01.590> few

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
look like this now I did have a few

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.800 
look like this now I did have a few
fails<00:05:02.310> which<00:05:02.789> I<00:05:02.970> showed<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.270> guys<00:05:03.300> in<00:05:03.660> my

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
fails which I showed you guys in my

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.260 
fails which I showed you guys in my
video<00:05:04.139> as<00:05:04.380> well<00:05:04.560> which<00:05:05.430> were<00:05:05.639> these<00:05:05.789> ones<00:05:06.060> and

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.029 
these were temporary tattoos in the ink
obviously<00:05:10.020> it<00:05:10.470> leaked<00:05:10.740> it<00:05:11.099> bled<00:05:11.400> through<00:05:13.039> so

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039
