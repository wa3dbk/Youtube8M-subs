00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 prepare a condensed milk for this 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.870
 what do we need looks are we going to need 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.780
 whether it is regular sugar by the clarita 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.529
 the dark not to say brunette the brunette 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.690
 of the brands and if not or is already going 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.029
 to buy is powdered sugar 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.769
 glas but we're leaving now let's not forget 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.779
 that icing sugar is not something else 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.800
 that pulverized powdered sugar 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.230
 now the dark brown sugar is not the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.710
 that sweetens us more if the clear is a 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.899
 little bit softer is any of them 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.160
 we're going to have to have the same 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.469
 quantity 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.510
 let's say that at home we will use what 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.780
 that we have a big cup is not the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.309
 another measure even if it is and so that it does not 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.610
 burn our blender as we are going to 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.120
 use all that this cup sugar 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.969
 big equally also of this milk 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.520
 with this powdered milk powder 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.410
 any brand except for that of 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.410
 baby for example others 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:14.009
 For example, it is also for 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:15.899
 kids those brands we can break and 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.909
 we are going to also occupy the vanilla and 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:21.210
 vanilla if you realize gavin are very 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.030
 little ones and if you really know but very 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.250
 very tasty and very equal to the same can 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.219
 we will also use the same 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.039
 800 milliliters of natural water 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.469
 in this case but we can change it by 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.649
 true orange leaf tea by the 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:40.470
 flavor change this much there are those who 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.709
 they like natural water and there are others that 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.560
 with the with the orange leaf tea 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:48.239
 the taste gives it a special flavor 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.369
 I repeat the person I like again 

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:52.890
 more with natural water ok but what 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.759
 can you do at home very well ok 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.459
 we're going to need the blender hey 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.810
 but the water is cold or you have to heat 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:03.450
 sorry, it's good that I mentioned it to this one 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.369
 if the water has to be warm 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.750
 or super hot because if not we 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.649
 can burn our blender 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.050
 only warm dissolve mainly 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.750
 the sugar goes down what we are going to put 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.440
 our big cup of sugar uca and the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.440
 let's pulverize 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.340
 that is first it is pulverized so it is for 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.340
 make it sugar glas ok 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.810
 and there goes 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.120
 to see what we can do so that 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.480
 we burn our blender that is 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.300
 have the powdered sugar at home 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.880
 in a jar keep the daughter nothing more 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.460
 when we are going to use it really is 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.080
 very quick to do it if we can do 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.630
 our desserts and the only thing that we 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.820
 stops maybe in time is this 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.800
 spray review them then if you already 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.050
 we have even so that we are not 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.630
 burn the blender if we already have it in 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.420
 house in a jar so much faster 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.640
 or being buying them but it comes out a little bit 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.220
 more expensive than it is proposed that 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.540
 environments all the savings we pay 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:26.420
 we have to if it's about saving not from 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.459
 be lazy so why 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.500
 Well, all we can save is 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.080
 welcome true clear this 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.890
 later we are going to put this 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.080
 made in the powder edge a cup of 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.510
 almost the same amount violate cable me 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.610
 I put a little more milk or a 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.489
 little bit less sugar so that I do not 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.250
 come out so sweet now there are people who 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.110
 they can not eat sugar they can do it 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.450
 with the substitute 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.849
 and it's also excellent 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.340
 so we can all eat milk 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:03.129
 condensed clear yes very well then 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.960
 with cookies with desserts with everything 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:09.450
 takes 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.450
 nothing else we integrate it ha ha 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.860
 it is integrated in our blender we are going 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.380
 to remove the top cover, say well 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.800
 although we are going to remove the lid from above 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.050
 we will go 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.040
 putting to work and little by little 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.420
 we are going to put the water 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.420
 as if it were a trick 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.900
 or at once it does not have to be little 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.030
 for a put now I recommend them 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.970
 that are not exactly because no 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.070
 we can measure 800 milliliters but 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.530
 little by little we also see the 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.720
 consistency of our moon and it's like 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.850
 we will be putting a little bit of the 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.550
 life and because that's how you put all this 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.229
 it looks gorgeous if you have to not now 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.490
 we must forget that when the 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.490
 water to thicken 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.820
 because we move 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.820
 so it stays stuck in the skins 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.810
 and also 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:33.040
 for this quick dessert a dessert with 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.790
 fruit and then put it to robert and be 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.940
 rich 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:40.140
 that's how we're putting a little more 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.140
 of water because we do not need 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.360
 and we're going to put vanilla and vanilla 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.240
 the trickle I like very much with 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:54.050
 vanilla but you can also feel the 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.680
 vanilla not out to please is like a 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.680
 taste gan 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.620
 I would put the vanilla a taste 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.620
 What should he wear? 

00:06:08.489 --> 00:06:13.989
 like the other that the area 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:17.229
 We can store in the refrigerator well 

00:06:13.989 --> 00:06:20.379
 so covered is to attend to keys that 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:22.659
 you give it away you keep it and it becomes like 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:24.939
 a little lanita equal is done 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:27.279
 They prove right now that I will see him 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:29.379
 I'm going to try the labor one look 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:32.109
 there is a spoon to see a teaspoon already 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:34.149
 nothing else in our jar box we're going 

00:06:32.109 --> 00:06:36.189
 to put a label how they all go 

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:38.379
 we can and will last us around 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:40.749
 three weeks for you gerardo in our 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:43.859
 milk but this must be done by 

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:43.859
 moment thanks
