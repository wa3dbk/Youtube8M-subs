exactly these are the two most important
things<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> tires<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.210> easiest<00:00:27.660> thing

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
things on the tires the easiest thing

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.599 
things on the tires the easiest thing
that<00:00:27.990> women<00:00:28.140> need<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.439> be<00:00:28.529> checking<00:00:28.980> or<00:00:29.250> even

all the men for that matter to tire

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.500 
all the men for that matter to tire
pressure<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.830> important<00:00:32.460> because<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.059> right

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510

looking at your tire pressure checking

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.440 
looking at your tire pressure checking
them<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.559> least<00:00:46.680> monthly<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.760> want<00:00:47.969> also<00:00:48.300> look

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
them at least monthly you want also look

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.540 
them at least monthly you want also look
at<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> tread<00:00:48.899> condition<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:50.010> couple<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
at the tread condition a couple the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.220 
at the tread condition a couple the
easiest<00:00:50.940> tricks<00:00:51.149> are<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.870> old<00:00:52.020> penny

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
easiest tricks are to the old penny

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.139 
easiest tricks are to the old penny
trick<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.680> old<00:00:52.800> winkin<00:00:53.100> head<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.969> take<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
trick the old winkin head you take a

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.970 
trick the old winkin head you take a
penny<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.110> measure<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.500> tread<00:00:55.680> with<00:00:55.860> it

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
penny and you measure the tread with it

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.529 
penny and you measure the tread with it
it's<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.489> easiest<00:00:56.760> thing<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.300> you're

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
it's the easiest thing to do but you're

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.750 
it's the easiest thing to do but you're
looking<00:00:57.840> about<00:00:57.899> 2<00:00:58.230> 30<00:00:58.410> seconds<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.920> tread<00:00:59.250> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
looking about 2 30 seconds to tread and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.189 
looking about 2 30 seconds to tread and
you're<00:00:59.879> also<00:01:00.059> looking<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.480> evenness<00:01:00.930> we're

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
you're also looking for evenness we're

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.410 
you're also looking for evenness we're
across<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.739> tire<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.609> those<00:01:02.820> are<00:01:03.000> things<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
across the tire so those are things you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.570 
across the tire so those are things you
need<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.019> look<00:01:04.199> at<00:01:04.379> monthly<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.460> have

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
need to look at monthly if you do have

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.340 
need to look at monthly if you do have
your<00:01:05.610> regular<00:01:06.090> tire<00:01:06.299> where<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.990> want<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.260> get

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
your regular tire where you want to get

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.480 
your regular tire where you want to get
your<00:01:07.500> tires<00:01:07.650> check<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.130> an<00:01:08.189> alignment

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
your tires check for an alignment

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.060 
your tires check for an alignment
possibility<00:01:09.360> suspension<00:01:09.900> problems<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.950> you

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
possibility suspension problems but you

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.020 
possibility suspension problems but you
need<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> look<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.549> tires<00:01:11.729> at<00:01:11.909> least

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
need to look at the tires at least

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.600 
need to look at the tires at least
monthly<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.590> really<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.490> simple

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
monthly so it really is just as simple

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.539 
monthly so it really is just as simple
as<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.630> show<00:01:15.900> us<00:01:15.930> sure<00:01:16.740> tire

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
as that and can you show us sure tire

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.039 
as that and can you show us sure tire
pressure<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.540> easiest<00:01:18.570> thing<00:01:18.900> to

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
pressure is one of the easiest thing to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.480 
pressure is one of the easiest thing to
check<00:01:19.200> unis<00:01:19.470> need<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.680> standard<00:01:20.070> tire<00:01:20.250> pressure

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
check unis need a standard tire pressure

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.100 
check unis need a standard tire pressure
gauge<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.939> lot<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.330> service<00:01:21.600> stations<00:01:21.900> have

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
gauge a lot of service stations have

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.679

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
them and how they easy to do is to check

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.390 
them and how they easy to do is to check
the<00:01:24.840> pressure<00:01:24.990> with<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.740> find<00:01:26.159> what

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the pressure with it you can find what

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.130 
the pressure with it you can find what
