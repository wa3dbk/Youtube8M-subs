00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
your VGA the DVI connector you have

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.240 
your VGA the DVI connector you have
molex<00:01:59.410> or<00:01:59.860> 4<00:02:00.280> pin<00:02:00.520> power<00:02:00.790> to<00:02:01.540> 6<00:02:02.230> pin<00:02:02.500> power<00:02:02.710> to

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
molex or 4 pin power to 6 pin power to

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.510 
molex or 4 pin power to 6 pin power to
power<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.520> graphics<00:02:04.000> card<00:02:04.210> in<00:02:04.360> case<00:02:04.540> your

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
power the graphics card in case your

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.190 
power the graphics card in case your
power<00:02:06.520> supply<00:02:06.700> doesn't<00:02:06.940> have<00:02:07.360> another<00:02:07.630> 6<00:02:07.990> pin

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
power supply doesn't have another 6 pin

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.780 
power supply doesn't have another 6 pin
and<00:02:09.060> finally<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.209> have<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:11.099> full<00:02:12.099> HDMI

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
and finally you have a full HDMI

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.649 
and finally you have a full HDMI
converter<00:02:13.170> full<00:02:14.170> HDMI<00:02:14.769> it's<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:14.980> mini<00:02:15.190> HDMI

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
converter full HDMI it's a mini HDMI

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.140 
converter full HDMI it's a mini HDMI
because<00:02:16.659> this<00:02:16.840> card<00:02:17.170> has<00:02:17.379> a<00:02:17.590> mini<00:02:17.980> HDMI<00:02:18.760> port

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
because this card has a mini HDMI port

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.980 
because this card has a mini HDMI port
and<00:02:19.510> not<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.840> full<00:02:20.380> HDMI<00:02:21.190> port

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
and not a full HDMI port

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.320 
and not a full HDMI port
so<00:02:23.880> inside<00:02:24.880> under<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.480> tray<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.960> have<00:02:27.330> driver

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
so inside under the tray you have driver

very<00:03:01.450> not<00:03:02.380> straightforward<00:03:02.770> but<00:03:03.730> it's<00:03:03.940> in

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
very not straightforward but it's in

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.860 
very not straightforward but it's in
many<00:03:04.330> languages<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:06.000> can<00:03:07.000> read<00:03:07.210> that<00:03:07.390> if<00:03:07.720> you

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
many languages you can read that if you

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.060 
many languages you can read that if you
want<00:03:09.390> here<00:03:10.390> you<00:03:10.510> have<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.750> actual<00:03:11.170> manual<00:03:11.680> so

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
want here you have the actual manual so

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.940 
want here you have the actual manual so
let's<00:03:12.220> flip<00:03:12.340> through<00:03:12.670> this<00:03:13.830> you<00:03:14.830> have<00:03:14.920> a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
graphics card buyers so let's get this

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.510 
graphics card buyers so let's get this
box<00:03:30.400> out<00:03:30.550> of<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.700> way<00:03:33.300> so<00:03:34.300> this<00:03:34.480> card<00:03:34.810> is<00:03:35.520> the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
box out of the way so this card is the

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.010 
box out of the way so this card is the
650<00:03:37.270> chipset<00:03:37.750> but<00:03:37.900> overclocked<00:03:39.480> normal<00:03:40.480> 650

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
650 chipset but overclocked normal 650

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.050 
650 chipset but overclocked normal 650
would<00:03:41.230> have<00:03:41.700> 1024<00:03:42.700> megahertz<00:03:43.210> clock<00:03:43.630> on<00:03:43.990> its

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
would have 1024 megahertz clock on its

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.900 
would have 1024 megahertz clock on its
processor<00:03:46.060> but<00:03:46.540> this<00:03:47.050> one<00:03:47.260> has<00:03:47.500> 10<00:03:48.130> 84<00:03:48.700> which

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
processor but this one has 10 84 which

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.910 
processor but this one has 10 84 which
is<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.480> small<00:03:49.990> upgrade<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:52.960> still<00:03:53.230> you

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
is a small upgrade and this is still you

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.970 
is a small upgrade and this is still you
still<00:03:54.130> overclock<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:54.730> in<00:03:55.920> afterburner<00:03:58.980> so

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
still overclock it in afterburner so

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.600 
still overclock it in afterburner so
here<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:01.690> see<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.380> very<00:04:02.680> plastic<00:04:03.100> heat<00:04:03.550> grill
