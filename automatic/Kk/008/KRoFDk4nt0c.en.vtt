they'll play fast insert looks a lot

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.810 
they'll play fast insert looks a lot
better<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:31.950> s<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:33.150> looks<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.720> um<00:01:34.460> as<00:01:35.460> far<00:01:35.759> as

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
better but s just looks and um as far as

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.380 
better but s just looks and um as far as
using<00:01:36.780> them<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.200> play<00:01:37.729> like<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.850> said<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> haven't

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
using them to play like I said I haven't

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.480 
using them to play like I said I haven't
really<00:01:39.570> tried<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.960> out<00:01:40.140> because<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.189> an

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
really tried that out because of an

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.160 
really tried that out because of an
ankle<00:01:41.790> injury<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.390> will<00:01:42.479> assume<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:42.930> I

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
ankle injury but it will assume but I

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.530 
ankle injury but it will assume but I
think<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.220> play<00:01:44.399> strong<00:01:44.759> answer<00:01:45.149> will<00:01:45.390> be

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
think the play strong answer will be

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.920 
think the play strong answer will be
better

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
better

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.580 
better
just<00:01:46.649> cuz<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:47.130> think<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.909> helps<00:01:48.210> your<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:49.290> helps

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
just cuz I think it helps your it helps

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.480 
just cuz I think it helps your it helps
lock<00:01:49.829> your<00:01:50.570> ankle<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.500> place<00:01:52.770> your<00:01:53.100> feet<00:01:53.310> in

place yeah
so<00:01:56.130> here's<00:01:56.430> what<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> think<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.119> shoe<00:01:57.329> um<00:01:57.600> I

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
so here's what I think of this shoe um I

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.350 
so here's what I think of this shoe um I
really<00:01:58.590> like<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.310> fact<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.759> there's<00:02:00.180> more

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
really like the fact that there's more

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.350 
really like the fact that there's more
cushioning<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:02.040> feels<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.460> lot<00:02:02.640> more<00:02:02.700> solid

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
cushioning and it feels a lot more solid

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.310 
cushioning and it feels a lot more solid
than<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> Kobe<00:02:03.930> six<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.560> five<00:02:05.930> Maccoby<00:02:06.930> six

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590

strong insert I don't really think they

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.320

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
just think that they keep it in place so

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.190 
just think that they keep it in place so
they<00:02:57.390> won't<00:02:57.570> come<00:02:57.720> off

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
they won't come off

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.710 
they won't come off
and<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:59.730> make<00:02:59.880> your<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.360> make<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> little

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720

feel<00:03:00.990> a<00:03:01.020> lot<00:03:01.290> more<00:03:01.500> solid<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:03.770> that's<00:03:04.770> pretty

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
feel a lot more solid so that's pretty

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.240 
feel a lot more solid so that's pretty
much<00:03:05.070> what<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.460> think<00:03:05.790> those<00:03:06.540> shoes<00:03:07.070> if<00:03:08.070> you
