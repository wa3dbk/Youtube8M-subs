00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.799 
little bit rougher it's hard to hard to
use<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.579> touch<00:00:57.819> we've<00:00:58.300> got<00:00:58.479> our<00:00:58.629> touch

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
use the touch we've got our touch

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.559 
use the touch we've got our touch
sensible<00:00:59.499> technology<00:01:00.370> so<00:01:00.819> we<00:01:00.969> can<00:01:01.149> just<00:01:01.300> come

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:01.569 
sensible technology so we can just come

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.469 
sensible technology so we can just come
down<00:01:01.749> here<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:02.260> use<00:01:03.039> this<00:01:03.550> controller<00:01:04.150> to

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
down here and use this controller to

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.270 
down here and use this controller to
control<00:01:04.900> all<00:01:05.110> of<00:01:05.290> those<00:01:05.409> functions<00:01:05.979> again

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
control all of those functions again

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.690 
control all of those functions again
very<00:01:06.880> very<00:01:07.150> simply<00:01:08.009> they<00:01:09.009> are<00:01:09.040> microbrews<00:01:09.640> the

we're<00:01:11.530> out<00:01:11.590> on<00:01:11.619> the<00:01:11.740> water<00:01:11.950> today<00:01:12.100> testing<00:01:12.640> the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
we're out on the water today testing the

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.039 
we're out on the water today testing the
NSS<00:01:13.270> Evo<00:01:13.630> 2<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:15.490> today<00:01:15.759> we've<00:01:15.909> got<00:01:16.060> a<00:01:16.299> duel<00:01:16.719> at

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
NSS Evo 2 so today we've got a duel at

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.340 
NSS Evo 2 so today we've got a duel at
Jul<00:01:17.290> 12<00:01:17.590> inch<00:01:17.829> screen<00:01:18.219> setup<00:01:18.539> we've<00:01:19.539> got<00:01:19.750> two

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
Jul 12 inch screen setup we've got two

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.499 
Jul 12 inch screen setup we've got two
mounted<00:01:20.710> side-by-side<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.579> typical

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
mounted side-by-side and typical

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.149 
mounted side-by-side and typical
installation<00:01:23.079> you'll<00:01:23.229> have<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.409> chart<00:01:23.770> setup<00:01:24.070> a

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
installation you'll have a chart setup a

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.560 
installation you'll have a chart setup a
one<00:01:24.340> display<00:01:24.729> and<00:01:25.119> so

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
one display and so

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.320 
one display and so
on<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.750> other<00:01:25.870> screen<00:01:27.030> makes<00:01:28.030> it<00:01:28.150> flexible

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
on the other screen makes it flexible

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.710 
on the other screen makes it flexible
you<00:01:28.900> can<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:29.409> can<00:01:29.560> quickly<00:01:30.600> manipulate<00:01:31.600> your

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
you can you can quickly manipulate your

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.750 
you can you can quickly manipulate your
chart<00:01:31.990> while<00:01:32.560> still<00:01:32.979> viewing<00:01:33.310> your<00:01:33.400> sonar

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
chart while still viewing your sonar

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.780 
chart while still viewing your sonar
simultaneously<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.860> is<00:01:35.979> our<00:01:36.160> work<00:01:36.340> boat<00:01:36.580> so

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
simultaneously this is our work boat so

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.520 
simultaneously this is our work boat so
we've<00:01:36.940> also<00:01:37.090> got<00:01:37.330> a<00:01:37.360> 9<00:01:37.600> inch<00:01:37.810> display<00:01:38.170> set<00:01:38.440> up

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
we've also got a 9 inch display set up

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.609 
we've also got a 9 inch display set up
on<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.770> top<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.570> in<00:01:40.750> this<00:01:40.869> case<00:01:41.110> it's<00:01:41.320> running

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
on the top and in this case it's running

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.680 
on the top and in this case it's running
our<00:01:41.740> structure<00:01:42.130> scan<00:01:42.250> viewing<00:01:43.240> out<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.479> left

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
our structure scan viewing out the left

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.120 
our structure scan viewing out the left
and<00:01:43.840> right<00:01:43.960> hand<00:01:44.140> side<00:01:44.320> of<00:01:44.410> the<00:01:44.470> boat<00:01:44.680> the

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
and right hand side of the boat the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.010 
and right hand side of the boat the
modules<00:01:45.490> can<00:01:45.640> be<00:01:45.700> networked<00:01:46.090> together<00:01:46.300> they

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
modules can be networked together they

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.900 
modules can be networked together they
all<00:01:47.170> connect<00:01:47.440> over<00:01:47.590> Ethernet<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.280> all<00:01:48.759> our

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
all connect over Ethernet and all our

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.900 
all connect over Ethernet and all our
slicers<00:01:49.360> will<00:01:49.540> integrate<00:01:49.750> nicely<00:01:50.170> together

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
slicers will integrate nicely together

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.999 
slicers will integrate nicely together
so<00:01:51.910> we're<00:01:52.060> doing<00:01:52.180> on<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.869> NSS<00:01:53.259> Evo<00:01:53.560> 2<00:01:53.619> we're

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
so we're doing on the NSS Evo 2 we're

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.740 
so we're doing on the NSS Evo 2 we're
doing<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.250> 7<00:01:54.580> inch<00:01:54.700> screen<00:01:55.060> which<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:55.479> smaller

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
doing a 7 inch screen which is smaller

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.440 
doing a 7 inch screen which is smaller
than<00:01:55.990> this<00:01:56.110> one<00:01:56.170> this<00:01:56.619> is<00:01:56.740> our<00:01:56.890> 9<00:01:57.270> these<00:01:58.270> are

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
than this one this is our 9 these are

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.570 
than this one this is our 9 these are
our<00:01:58.570> 12s<00:01:59.110> and<00:01:59.229> we're<00:01:59.410> doing<00:01:59.500> a<00:01:59.680> larger<00:02:00.009> 16<00:02:00.399> inch

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
our 12s and we're doing a larger 16 inch
