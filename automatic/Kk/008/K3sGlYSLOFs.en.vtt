here Frank Gore beaches it out for a

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.480 
here Frank Gore beaches it out for a
game<00:02:11.040> ok<00:02:12.600> like<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.720> said<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.960> run<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:14.920> every<00:02:15.100> now

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
game ok like I said I run it every now

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.730 
game ok like I said I run it every now
and<00:02:15.730> then<00:02:15.850> against<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.690> like<00:02:16.810> as<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:17.440> can<00:02:17.590> see

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
and then against it like as you can see

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.770 
and then against it like as you can see
in<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.920> examples<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.460> it<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.880> inconsistent

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
in the examples that it is inconsistent

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.610 
in the examples that it is inconsistent
and<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.390> don't<00:02:22.390> suggest<00:02:22.750> running<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.440> ball

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
and so I don't suggest running the ball

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.560 
and so I don't suggest running the ball
too<00:02:23.860> much<00:02:24.040> when<00:02:24.700> they're<00:02:24.880> shaking<00:02:25.090> off<00:02:25.390> in

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
too much when they're shaking off in

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.690 
too much when they're shaking off in
salon<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.870> suggest<00:02:26.440> doing<00:02:26.710> this<00:02:26.920> next<00:02:27.160> concept

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
salon I suggest doing this next concept

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.060 
salon I suggest doing this next concept
which<00:02:27.910> is<00:02:28.030> passing<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.480> ball<00:02:28.800> what<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:29.920> want

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
which is passing the ball what you want

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.880 
which is passing the ball what you want
to<00:02:30.130> do<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.430> have<00:02:30.610> three<00:02:31.240> routes<00:02:31.660> going<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.800> the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
to do is have three routes going to the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.760 
to do is have three routes going to the
left<00:02:33.130> hand<00:02:33.370> side<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:35.080> formation<00:02:35.380> i<00:02:35.620> will

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
left hand side and the formation i will

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.910 
left hand side and the formation i will
be<00:02:35.860> showing<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.780> wide<00:02:37.780> trips<00:02:38.290> halfback

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
be showing is the wide trips halfback
