00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.990
 this one maxime johnson with blackberry 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.060
 from here the next platform of the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.700
 Canadian company research in motion 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.740
 so here I have a blackberry phone 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.200
 must alphabet which they miss 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.240
 for a phone that will be launched by 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.379
 will accompany it for developers 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.630
 it says the operating system 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.400
 blackberry 10 him he should be 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.779
 like when I here cramps 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.910
 beck which still displays a lot 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.650
 information actually everything all the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.490
 system is designed on to display 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.869
 a lot of information and go from one 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.399
 screen to each other quickly so I'm going to you 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.300
 show two of the three main 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.370
 characteristics 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.910
 firstly if I have my screen with him 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.719
 applications by assuring like those 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.579
 found elsewhere 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.899
 what come so when I open 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.450
 the application as we can see here 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.520
 so becomes full screen but I can 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.559
 then close it and they stay 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.110
 displayed here in small you are the active 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.760
 so the tiles are his assets so 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.199
 it's applications that work 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.930
 if you have music that's fine 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.180
 operate and know how to display his can 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.520
 also display differently specially 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.070
 for this small screen so as we see 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.570
 here it gives me the temperature of a 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.710
 way we can see the smile 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.390
 big lots so that's one of the 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.700
 main fundamentals of black 2010 a 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.680
 the most important thing is what we 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.020
 call the blackberry so I read here 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.470
 my job what are these big all 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.710
 the information of my emails half 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:30.390
 of my sons book of my babies m2 but 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.759
 twitter but who are displayed at the same 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.590
 place so if it's really a 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.640
 kind of notification center but 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.070
 it's more than that because it's actually 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.540
 it's man sic have access to our 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.930
 emails and this is only nato 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.670
 who has no email application of a 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.549
 blackberry all say that there is also the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.990
 abc gray bin that is accessible from 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.970
 anywhere so when I read from 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.079
 the home screen 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.750
 I go to the left if I run a 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.719
 application lose if I'm in a 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.729
 in an application like here 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.659
 when I can do it's only 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.640
 on himself a message so I can I 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.920
 a function that allows me to 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.030
 he insisting a device of 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.810
 development does not work very 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.110
 alright but so I can go to see is 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.110
 here water his messages while expanding 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.260
 this app there so that's it 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.220
 it's a bit like the furniture of three others 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.630
 little things I'm going to show you 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.400
 characteristics that are 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.510
 interestingly firstly it's a 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.510
 work that really does for the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.180
 work and home and we can have 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.940
 choices of what we want so if I 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.020
 am in my apps here he will have to 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.080
 again is not mentioned very much 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.880
 alright so i can get access to meaux at 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.530
 arm in fact maybe this phone 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.690
 is not activated and so we can have 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.600
 access to these work applications or 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.920
 of house and changed everything in to 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.110
 the other one so it still works 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.500
 very well his jokes balance to have 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.560
 really his private information and of 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.570
 work as very distinct between six 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.550
 country the internship do I want it to show 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.500
 your little things this is it's 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.110
 keyboard while a tale enclave here 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.940
 so it's a keyboard that software for 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.480
 the moment and that there is prediction 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.160
 of texts so if I write I write 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.519
 saying I can search but I'm doing a 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.019
 again a new email or a 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.310
 new text message 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:26.540
 so if I write if I write then the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.220
 words are going to be proposed so for me 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.430
 propose the next months written so 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.750
 either it's the prediction as we 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.220
 would find other keyboards a little 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.019
 like swiftkey but we can also 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.570
 simply select the words 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.519
 when one is chosen not that I have it 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.780
 not done so I click on it and it's okay 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.010
 write my mont mau in full as soon as 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.079
 these demonstrations this was not the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.810
 better but it's a simple choice 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.220
 who likes and well spent so it was 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.750
 the few new products 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.310
 blackberry say I'm going to you 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.290
 present having more information I 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.560
 am going to check the article all of which no 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.560
 video
