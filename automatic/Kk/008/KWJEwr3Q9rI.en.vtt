I<00:01:49.649> kind<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.039> stay<00:01:50.189> around<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.390> middle<00:01:51.930> of

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
I kind of stay around like the middle of

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.410 
I kind of stay around like the middle of
the<00:01:52.109> map<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:53.250> you'll<00:01:53.789> see<00:01:53.939> I'm<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.060> scanning

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.060 
the map and you'll see I'm just scanning
throughout<00:01:55.049> although<00:01:55.409> you'll<00:01:55.680> learn<00:01:55.829> all<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
throughout although you'll learn all the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.010 
throughout although you'll learn all the
spawns<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.490> will<00:01:56.609> you<00:01:56.670> play<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.840> just

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
spawns and will you play it and I just

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.240 
spawns and will you play it and I just
keep<00:01:58.140> going<00:01:58.289> from<00:01:58.469> side<00:01:58.679> to<00:01:58.829> side<00:01:58.859> just

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
keep going from side to side just

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.099 
keep going from side to side just
checking<00:01:59.939> out<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.299> know<00:02:00.420> where<00:02:00.840> people<00:02:00.960> are

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
checking out you know where people are

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:02.840 
checking out you know where people are
coming<00:02:01.170> from<00:02:01.369> this<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.460> are<00:02:02.520> they<00:02:02.609> going<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.789> be

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
coming from this is are they going to be

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.580 
coming from this is are they going to be
a<00:02:02.880> hijack<00:02:03.240> gameplay<00:02:03.630> or<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.810> meltdown<00:02:04.079> gameplay

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
a hijack gameplay or a meltdown gameplay

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.679 
a hijack gameplay or a meltdown gameplay
I<00:02:05.159> couldn't<00:02:05.939> decide<00:02:06.060> which<00:02:06.359> one<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.600> use

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
I couldn't decide which one to use

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.600 
I couldn't decide which one to use
because<00:02:06.960> they'll<00:02:07.200> both<00:02:07.380> pretty<00:02:07.619> cool<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.550> uh

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
because they'll both pretty cool but uh

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.310 
because they'll both pretty cool but uh
if<00:02:09.210> this<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.510> the<00:02:09.540> meltdown<00:02:09.930> one<00:02:10.110> you're<00:02:10.230> gonna

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
if this is the meltdown one you're gonna

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.790 
if this is the meltdown one you're gonna
see<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.770> clip<00:02:11.070> fail

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
see a clip fail

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.730 
see a clip fail
like<00:02:12.010> Miss<00:02:12.220> easiest<00:02:12.640> quadfeed<00:02:12.940> but<00:02:13.210> yeah<00:02:14.020> I

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
like Miss easiest quadfeed but yeah I

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.090 
like Miss easiest quadfeed but yeah I
guess<00:02:15.670> there's<00:02:16.360> not<00:02:16.510> too<00:02:16.720> much<00:02:16.930> i<00:02:17.200> really

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
guess there's not too much i really

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.420 
guess there's not too much i really
recommend<00:02:18.220> just<00:02:18.700> practicing<00:02:19.210> because<00:02:20.430> you

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
recommend just practicing because you

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.770 
recommend just practicing because you
need<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:21.850> kind<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:22.090> like<00:02:22.210> experience<00:02:22.690> to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
need that kind of like experience to

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.820 
need that kind of like experience to
know<00:02:22.900> where<00:02:23.050> all<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.200> spawns<00:02:23.440> going<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.710> be

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
know where all the spawns going to be

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.850 
know where all the spawns going to be
and<00:02:24.160> all<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.490> sort<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.670> stuff<00:02:25.440> if<00:02:26.440> using

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
and all that sort of stuff if using

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.130 
and all that sort of stuff if using
killstreaks<00:02:27.250> i'd<00:02:27.490> recommend<00:02:28.000> i<00:02:28.420> personally

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
killstreaks i'd recommend i personally

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.570 
killstreaks i'd recommend i personally
don't<00:02:29.290> use<00:02:29.350> lethal<00:02:29.620> except<00:02:30.130> for<00:02:30.310> Hunter

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
don't use lethal except for Hunter

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.090 
don't use lethal except for Hunter
sometimes<00:02:31.030> because<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:32.440> don't<00:02:32.620> want<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.980> use

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
sometimes because you don't want to use

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.890 
sometimes because you don't want to use
counter<00:02:33.250> UAV<00:02:33.460> because<00:02:33.970> then<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.240> can't<00:02:34.450> like

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
counter UAV because then you can't like

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.540 
counter UAV because then you can't like
when<00:02:35.410> people<00:02:35.650> see<00:02:35.740> a<00:02:35.770> red<00:02:35.950> dot<00:02:36.070> on<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.220> UAV

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
when people see a red dot on the UAV

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.800 
when people see a red dot on the UAV
they'll<00:02:36.730> instantly<00:02:36.970> run<00:02:37.240> towards<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.690> that

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
they'll instantly run towards and that

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.780 
they'll instantly run towards and that
helps<00:02:38.350> with<00:02:38.500> thumb<00:02:38.680> clip<00:02:39.220> opportunities<00:02:39.670> and

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
helps with thumb clip opportunities and

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.010 
helps with thumb clip opportunities and
obviously<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.150> can<00:02:40.300> of<00:02:40.420> UAVs<00:02:40.690> up<00:02:40.840> there<00:02:40.960> not

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
obviously the can of UAVs up there not

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.840 
obviously the can of UAVs up there not
kind<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.230> comfortable<00:02:41.470> user<00:02:41.830> I<00:02:42.040> just<00:02:42.550> use<00:02:42.730> you

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
kind of comfortable user I just use you

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.230

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
ov hunter and the orbital vsat just

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.940 
ov hunter and the orbital vsat just
because<00:02:46.510> obviously<00:02:47.080> all<00:02:47.410> lovey<00:02:47.680> so<00:02:47.740> it's

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950

really<00:02:48.040> good<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:49.390> do<00:02:49.750> use<00:02:49.960> a<00:02:49.990> blister<00:02:50.320> sometimes

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
really good I do use a blister sometimes

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.070 
really good I do use a blister sometimes
but<00:02:51.040> it's<00:02:51.670> pretty<00:02:51.880> inconsistent<00:02:52.630> with<00:02:52.930> it

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
but it's pretty inconsistent with it

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.390 
but it's pretty inconsistent with it
markers<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.440> stuff<00:02:53.500> even<00:02:54.010> though<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.160> is<00:02:54.220> a

markers and stuff even though it is a

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.540 
markers and stuff even though it is a
very<00:02:55.180> fast<00:02:55.420> gun<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.260> still<00:02:56.470> love<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.950> just
