00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
much but basically they do help to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.690 
much but basically they do help to
refresh<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:46.020> weather<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.250> get<00:00:47.489> the

and<00:00:50.360> but<00:00:51.360> obviously<00:00:51.660> I've<00:00:52.020> only<00:00:52.230> set<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.710> auto

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
and but obviously I've only set the auto

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.430 
and but obviously I've only set the auto
scrolling<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.699> 10<00:00:54.149> seconds<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.140> auto

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
scrolling to 10 seconds and the auto

scrolling to 10 seconds and the auto
refresh<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.930> three<00:00:57.930> hours<00:00:58.320> because<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.710> can't

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
refresh to three hours because you can't

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.000 
refresh to three hours because you can't
drain<00:00:59.309> your<00:00:59.460> battery<00:00:59.609> if<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.969> set<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.449> and

quickly refresh what fresh quicker now

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.950 
quickly refresh what fresh quicker now
what<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.250> don't<00:01:05.460> need<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.150> go<00:01:06.659> into
