00:07:40.579 --> 00:07:40.589 
madding cash but I'm sure that's not the

00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:43.670 
madding cash but I'm sure that's not the
only<00:07:40.710> criteria<00:07:41.490> that<00:07:41.550> look<00:07:41.879> for<00:07:42.409> as<00:07:43.409> you<00:07:43.589> can

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020 
see it is definitely possible to not be

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.290 
see it is definitely possible to not be
a<00:07:46.050> maxed-out<00:07:46.469> player<00:07:46.919> or<00:07:47.250> max<00:07:47.669> level<00:07:48.000> player
