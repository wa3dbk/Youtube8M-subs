Patton on is standard battle on the

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.720 
Patton on is standard battle on the
steps<00:00:30.410> and<00:00:30.590> so<00:00:30.770> often<00:00:31.040> often<00:00:31.310> you<00:00:31.550> see<00:00:31.700> a

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
steps and so often often you see a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.280 
steps and so often often you see a
standard<00:00:32.180> battle<00:00:32.360> on<00:00:32.509> the<00:00:32.630> steps<00:00:32.870> these<00:00:33.079> days

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
standard battle on the steps these days

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.010 
standard battle on the steps these days
it's<00:00:33.500> normally<00:00:33.920> an<00:00:34.070> encounter<00:00:34.579> battle<00:00:35.020> so

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
it's normally an encounter battle so

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.540 
it's normally an encounter battle so
this<00:00:36.350> one<00:00:36.590> will<00:00:36.770> be<00:00:36.950> a<00:00:36.980> little<00:00:37.100> bit<00:00:37.400> of<00:00:37.489> a

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
this one will be a little bit of a

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.790 
this one will be a little bit of a
change<00:00:37.760> of<00:00:37.910> Pearson<00:00:38.570> a<00:00:38.630> change<00:00:38.840> of<00:00:38.960> tactics<00:00:39.350> so

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
change of Pearson a change of tactics so

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.110 
change of Pearson a change of tactics so
I'll<00:00:39.860> be<00:00:39.980> interesting<00:00:40.460> to<00:00:40.550> see<00:00:40.700> how<00:00:40.820> this<00:00:40.940> one

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
I'll be interesting to see how this one

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.320 
I'll be interesting to see how this one
plays<00:00:41.149> itself<00:00:42.140> out<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:43.130> firstly<00:00:43.489> a<00:00:43.790> good

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
plays itself out so firstly a good

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.450 
plays itself out so firstly a good
contingent<00:00:44.870> of<00:00:44.990> medium<00:00:45.470> tanks<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.130> tank

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
contingent of medium tanks and tank

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.610 
contingent of medium tanks and tank

destroyer going off to push up this
right-hand<00:00:49.610> flank<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:50.330> can<00:00:50.480> see<00:00:50.660> there

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
right-hand flank and you can see there

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.390 
right-hand flank and you can see there
being<00:00:50.990> supported<00:00:51.500> by<00:00:51.530> other<00:00:51.770> medium<00:00:52.100> taqman

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
of the tank destroyer and this t44

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.070 
of the tank destroyer and this t44
pushed<00:00:55.610> up<00:00:55.790> a<00:00:55.880> little<00:00:56.270> bit<00:00:56.420> too<00:00:56.600> far<00:00:56.840> doesn't

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
pushed up a little bit too far doesn't

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.380 
pushed up a little bit too far doesn't
really<00:00:57.290> have<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.470> support<00:00:57.920> of<00:00:58.100> his<00:00:58.250> allies<00:00:58.670> so

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
really have the support of his allies so

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.090 
really have the support of his allies so
and<00:00:59.750> I<00:00:59.840> don't<00:01:00.110> really<00:01:00.350> think<00:01:00.530> he's<00:01:00.740> got<00:01:00.950> the

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
and I don't really think he's got the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.550 
and I don't really think he's got the
time<00:01:01.310> to<00:01:01.340> get<00:01:01.670> out<00:01:01.880> of<00:01:02.120> this<00:01:02.240> one<00:01:02.510> alive<00:01:02.900> since

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
time to get out of this one alive since

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.079 
time to get out of this one alive since
he's<00:01:03.710> got<00:01:03.860> all<00:01:04.070> that<00:01:04.250> ground<00:01:04.549> to<00:01:04.670> cover<00:01:04.820> and

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
he's got all that ground to cover and

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.310 
he's got all that ground to cover and
he's<00:01:05.330> definitely<00:01:05.689> not<00:01:05.750> going<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.020> be<00:01:06.140> able<00:01:06.170> to

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
he's definitely not going to be able to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.890 
he's definitely not going to be able to
reverse<00:01:06.560> himself<00:01:06.770> out<00:01:07.189> of<00:01:07.220> there<00:01:07.520> Oh<00:01:07.900> ever

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
reverse himself out of there Oh ever

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.170 
reverse himself out of there Oh ever
it's<00:01:09.140> not<00:01:09.380> quite<00:01:09.770> able<00:01:10.159> to<00:01:10.369> get<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.880> last<00:01:11.030> shot

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
it's not quite able to get the last shot

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.550 
it's not quite able to get the last shot
and<00:01:11.450> pick<00:01:11.570> up<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:11.810> kill<00:01:12.020> there<00:01:12.200> but<00:01:12.350> still

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
and pick up the kill there but still

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.319 
and pick up the kill there but still
doing<00:01:12.770> a<00:01:12.950> decent<00:01:13.340> amount<00:01:13.430> of<00:01:13.670> damage<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.030> him

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
doing a decent amount of damage to him

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.140 
doing a decent amount of damage to him
so<00:01:15.229> it<00:01:15.290> looks<00:01:15.320> like<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.740> enemy<00:01:15.950> has<00:01:16.520> pushed<00:01:17.060> a

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
so it looks like the enemy has pushed a

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.820 
so it looks like the enemy has pushed a
couple<00:01:17.390> of<00:01:17.450> heavy<00:01:17.630> tanks<00:01:17.960> into<00:01:18.170> this<00:01:18.500> trench

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
couple of heavy tanks into this trench

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.940 
couple of heavy tanks into this trench
and<00:01:19.100> there<00:01:19.820> is<00:01:19.940> a<00:01:19.970> few<00:01:20.300> of<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.480> trance<00:01:20.950> circle

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
and there is a few of the trance circle

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.320 
and there is a few of the trance circle
around<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.220> other<00:01:22.280> side<00:01:22.370> of<00:01:22.550> these<00:01:22.790> rocks

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
around the other side of these rocks

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.580 
around the other side of these rocks
she's<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.290> is<00:01:24.620> it<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.900> 152<00:01:26.900> company<00:01:27.409> behind

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
she's the is it and a 152 company behind

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.100 
she's the is it and a 152 company behind
the<00:01:27.890> ridge<00:01:28.070> just<00:01:28.400> over<00:01:28.880> there<00:01:29.090> two<00:01:29.810> patterns

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
the ridge just over there two patterns

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.610 
the ridge just over there two patterns
and<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:30.530> e<00:01:30.560> 50<00:01:30.920> M<00:01:31.250> just<00:01:31.790> got<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.570> good<00:01:33.170> position

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
and the e 50 M just got a good position

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.620 
and the e 50 M just got a good position
behind<00:01:33.920> these<00:01:34.310> rocks<00:01:34.670> here

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.440 

just<00:01:38.320> waiting<00:01:38.979> for<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.520> opportune<00:01:39.969> moment

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
just waiting for the opportune moment

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.050 
just waiting for the opportune moment
and<00:01:40.630> then<00:01:40.990> going<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.680> push<00:01:42.039> on<00:01:42.250> folds<00:01:42.820> use

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
and then going to push on folds use

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.510 
and then going to push on folds use
their<00:01:43.270> speed<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:43.750> maneuverability<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:45.039> get<00:01:45.369> a

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
their speed and maneuverability to get a

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.789 
their speed and maneuverability to get a
good<00:01:45.850> position<00:01:46.119> on<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.689> enemy<00:01:46.899> as<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:47.710> can

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
good position on the enemy as you can

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.590 
good position on the enemy as you can
see<00:01:47.950> there's<00:01:48.130> an<00:01:48.189> is-7<00:01:48.700> up<00:01:49.000> on<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.420> ridge

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
see there's an is-7 up on the ridge

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.880 
see there's an is-7 up on the ridge
there<00:01:49.899> but<00:01:50.049> he's<00:01:50.140> not<00:01:50.289> going<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.590> be<00:01:50.710> very

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
there but he's not going to be very

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.850 
there but he's not going to be very
effective<00:01:51.220> because<00:01:51.670> of<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:52.509> layer<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.590> the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
effective because of the layer of the

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.249 
effective because of the layer of the
terrain<00:01:54.189> then<00:01:54.490> fact<00:01:54.759> is<00:01:54.880> probably<00:01:55.329> going<00:01:56.079> to

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
terrain then fact is probably going to

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.069 
terrain then fact is probably going to

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
in that center there so once the the

you<00:04:04.580> can<00:04:04.670> see<00:04:04.880> picking<00:04:05.330> up<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.720> GW<00:04:06.170> tiger

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
you can see picking up the GW tiger

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.740 
you can see picking up the GW tiger
there<00:04:06.740> and<00:04:07.810> it's<00:04:08.810> just<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.500> m40<00:04:10.340> 43<00:04:10.940> left<00:04:11.420> I

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
there and it's just the m40 43 left I

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.990 
there and it's just the m40 43 left I
was<00:04:12.140> a<00:04:12.200> good<00:04:12.590> shot<00:04:13.010> then<00:04:13.280> I<00:04:13.460> don't<00:04:13.700> think<00:04:13.910> it

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
was a good shot then I don't think it

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.370 
was a good shot then I don't think it
realizes<00:04:14.450> that<00:04:14.480> he's<00:04:14.660> been<00:04:14.810> spotted<00:04:15.110> he

realizes that he's been spotted he

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.800 
realizes that he's been spotted he
realizes<00:04:15.770> now<00:04:15.980> and<00:04:16.489> decides<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:17.000> drive<00:04:17.480> away

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
realizes now and decides to drive away

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.530 
realizes now and decides to drive away
but<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:18.170> he<00:04:18.920> hasn't<00:04:19.340> left<00:04:19.640> early<00:04:20.180> enough<00:04:20.390> we

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
but it he hasn't left early enough we

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.180 
but it he hasn't left early enough we
should<00:04:20.690> have<00:04:20.780> started<00:04:20.989> driving<00:04:21.470> long<00:04:21.830> ago

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
should have started driving long ago

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.040 
should have started driving long ago
when<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.460> realize<00:04:22.790> that<00:04:22.820> he's<00:04:23.090> allies<00:04:23.450> the

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
that's when he should have started

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.850
