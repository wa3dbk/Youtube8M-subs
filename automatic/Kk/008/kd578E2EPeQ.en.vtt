00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.699
 well hello friends that cyclists 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.070
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.900
 new video for episode 25 of my 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.009
 road series or cristiano ronaldo on 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.660
 fifa 11 ultimate team 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.949
 so we started with a head 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.419
 good classic guys whether it's 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.259
 players in the form of regular players that 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.730
 works very well 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.540
 so there you are telling yourself 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.250
 where am I doing 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.960
 calculate the prices so it's on the site 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.730
 football predicts the manager there is the 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.960
 calculator and then here you go 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.760
 the purchase price you put your bar 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.770
 and I use the basic scale and 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.090
 then we get a price, I put the 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.190
 price a little bit below this 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.929
 team give it a little a little 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.859
 blow to me it changes nothing attention 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:52.239
 leave and still the player but 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.739
 it's in my head it's psychological 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.929
 not looking to understand guys so 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.100
 this is after if wilko goes after two 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.739
 days when your day does not leave you 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.909
 lower the selling price and you try 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.199
 still do not make losses on 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.460
 your player and while trying to 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.199
 make gains even if they will be a little 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.720
 smaller than expected in any case that's it 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.010
 born and try not to make any losses 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.240
 it's like the goal is usually there 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.860
 has no loss with the airplane attak it's 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.030
 So why can not I remake of 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.380
 slats and trucks simply because 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.210
 that it works very very very very very 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.710
 very well everyone will tell you not 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.180
 to tell you in storm tell you to 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.830
 eragny you tell everyone you 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.090
 will say that it works on all 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.530
 consoles that does not have one that tell me 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.360
 it does not work on the console 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.150

 well what do I mean so what 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.340
 then we will move on to a second 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.830
 technique that you will see everything from 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.320
 next so it's the players boosterait 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.640
 would deal with a very high price 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.020
 it was barbichette who showed me 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.830
 this technique of which goatee see 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.310
 this is a guy who makes the purchase 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.990
 resale 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.970
 you will surely tutor you go 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.470
 find so he showed me this 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.400
 technique which I told myself why 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.510
 not try I had already tried to 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.740
 the previous episode he's going you go 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.180
 see that I'm going to make over a million 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.710
 than more than one hundred thousand credit benefits 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.120
 on agout euroboost in really not 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.500
 a lot of time I had them at a 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.790
 million credits in immediate so 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.990
 it's really really being there at the right 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.240
 moment in the right place I'm going to them 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.320
 sell a million 165,000 credit this is 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.760
 all this thoroughly it's simply 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.050
 huge benefit you can get 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.030
 very quickly but if the players 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.259
 very expensive booster with captions 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.300
 it's the same we do not know how to do it for 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.620
 the players like that's why in 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.909
 this episode there will be no legend of the 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.650
 racket of the players that everyone 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.000
 can simply buy it on the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.959
 benefit is a bit less big but 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.970
 as long as we can get credits 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.440
 quickly guys we're here we have 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.909

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.860
 ronaldo it's the investment it is 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.150
 a lot and a lot a lot helped by 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.950
 relative to the selling price some 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.400
 some times but sometimes it's worth 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.720
 really 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.430
 like 100000 credits the benefit of a 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.439
 blow it's really huge so that's it 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.620
