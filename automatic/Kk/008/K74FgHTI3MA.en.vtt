possible for children in need like
that's<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.280> main<00:01:26.430> thing<00:01:26.810> right<00:01:27.810> now<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.500> are

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
that's the main thing right now we are

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.580 
that's the main thing right now we are
number<00:01:28.770> 40<00:01:29.340> Oh<00:01:29.579> blur<00:01:30.210> stop<00:01:30.750> focus<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
number 40 Oh blur stop focus at the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.130 
number 40 Oh blur stop focus at the
moment<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:32.310> are<00:01:32.340> number<00:01:32.520> 40<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> UK<00:01:33.630> charts

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
moment we are number 40 in the UK charts

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.109 
moment we are number 40 in the UK charts
and<00:01:34.350> somewhat<00:01:35.189> dangerously<00:01:35.850> close<00:01:36.090> to

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
and somewhat dangerously close to

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.569 
and somewhat dangerously close to
slipping<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.780> top<00:01:36.960> 40<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.470> which<00:01:38.430> would

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
slipping out the top 40 and which would

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.700 
slipping out the top 40 and which would
be<00:01:38.670> devastating<00:01:39.240> because<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:40.020> top<00:01:40.229> 40<00:01:40.500> is

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
be devastating because the top 40 is

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.950 
be devastating because the top 40 is
what<00:01:40.860> counts<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.430> anything<00:01:42.299> below<00:01:42.509> 40

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
what counts like anything below 40

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.389 
what counts like anything below 40
doesn't<00:01:43.259> get<00:01:43.380> rent<00:01:43.560> out<00:01:43.649> on<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> radio<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
doesn't get rent out on the radio and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.039 
doesn't get rent out on the radio and
it's<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.729> no<00:01:45.210> one<00:01:45.240> really<00:01:45.479> cares<00:01:45.720> about<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
it's just no one really cares about the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.990 
it's just no one really cares about the
Hat<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.740> we<00:01:46.829> really<00:01:47.040> need<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.189> get<00:01:47.310> top<00:01:47.520> 40<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
Hat so we really need to get top 40 and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.789 
Hat so we really need to get top 40 and
we're<00:01:48.360> number<00:01:48.479> 40<00:01:48.810> at<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.930> moment<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.320> we

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
we're number 40 at the moment so we

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.280 
we're number 40 at the moment so we
could<00:01:50.070> either<00:01:50.340> serve<00:01:50.640> out<00:01:50.820> or<00:01:51.570> we<00:01:51.930> could<00:01:52.079> start

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
could either serve out or we could start

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.719 
could either serve out or we could start
to<00:01:52.439> climb<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.649> little<00:01:52.950> bit<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.430> we're<00:01:53.549> really

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
to climb a little bit and we're really

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.730 
to climb a little bit and we're really
hoping<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.390> get<00:01:54.570> sort<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.049> maybe<00:01:55.170> top<00:01:55.409> 30

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
hoping we can get sort of maybe top 30

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.480 
hoping we can get sort of maybe top 30
that<00:01:56.130> would<00:01:56.219> be<00:01:56.280> great<00:01:56.780> we<00:01:57.780> found<00:01:57.930> out<00:01:58.140> today

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.340 
that would be great we found out today
