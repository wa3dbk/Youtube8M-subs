oxygen star me where I will be looking

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.840 
oxygen star me where I will be looking
at<00:00:15.480> different<00:00:16.139> things<00:00:16.500> how<00:00:16.980> they<00:00:17.010> might<00:00:17.609> be

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
at different things how they might be

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.490 
at different things how they might be
related<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.539> each<00:00:18.810> other<00:00:19.109> right<00:00:24.170> off<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.199> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
related to each other right off of the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.290 
related to each other right off of the
bat<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:26.039> can<00:00:26.220> notice<00:00:26.430> similar

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
bat you can notice similar

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.200 
bat you can notice similar
characteristics<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.800> behavior<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
characteristics and behavior with the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.089 
characteristics and behavior with the
ox's<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.840> star<00:00:31.109> me<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.859> things

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
ox's and star me and one of the things

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.470 
ox's and star me and one of the things
that<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.399> can<00:00:32.550> notice<00:00:32.759> right<00:00:33.059> off<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.450> bat

that you can notice right off of the bat

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.760 
that you can notice right off of the bat
is<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.500> crystal<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.670> middle<00:00:36.770> another

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
is the crystal in the middle another

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.920 
is the crystal in the middle another
interesting<00:00:37.950> thing<00:00:38.430> about<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.300> star

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
interesting thing about it is that star

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.889 
interesting thing about it is that star
me<00:00:40.079> releases<00:00:40.649> radio<00:00:41.100> waves<00:00:41.489> into<00:00:41.879> space<00:00:42.660> at

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
me releases radio waves into space at

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.380 
me releases radio waves into space at
night<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:43.350> seen<00:00:44.160> from<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.489> movie<00:00:44.820> destiny

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
night as seen from the movie destiny

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.569 
night as seen from the movie destiny
Deoxys<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> two<00:00:46.230> deoxys<00:00:46.770> are<00:00:46.890> communicating

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
Deoxys the two deoxys are communicating

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.270 
Deoxys the two deoxys are communicating
to<00:00:47.789> one<00:00:48.120> another<00:00:48.690> by<00:00:48.960> making<00:00:49.379> Aurora's<00:00:49.950> from

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
to one another by making Aurora's from

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.830 
to one another by making Aurora's from
the<00:00:50.399> crystal<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.300> could<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.629> pretty

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the crystal so this could be pretty

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.680 
the crystal so this could be pretty
interesting<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.760> deoxys<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.969> communicating

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
interesting that deoxys is communicating

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.900 
interesting that deoxys is communicating
with<00:00:55.020> star<00:00:55.500> me<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.829> well<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.699> was

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
with star me as well and this was

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.000 
with star me as well and this was
actually<00:00:57.059> stated<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> pokédex<00:00:58.230> first

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
actually stated in the pokédex first

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.130 
actually stated in the pokédex first
army<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.760> they<00:00:59.940> communicate<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.750> way

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
army that they communicate that way

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.500 
army that they communicate that way
sending<00:01:02.129> radio<00:01:02.399> waves<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.300> thing<00:01:03.480> is

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
sending radio waves but the thing is

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.690 
sending radio waves but the thing is
that<00:01:03.690> star<00:01:04.199> me<00:01:04.379> sends<00:01:04.680> them<00:01:04.799> at<00:01:04.979> night<00:01:05.010> so

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
that star me sends them at night so

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.789 
that star me sends them at night so
that's<00:01:05.970> pretty<00:01:06.330> interesting<00:01:06.659> sheet<00:01:07.409> another

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that's pretty interesting sheet another

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.219 
that's pretty interesting sheet another

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
information is the star you can somewhat

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.289 
information is the star you can somewhat
alter<00:01:10.710> its<00:01:10.860> body<00:01:11.130> using<00:01:11.549> camouflage<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.390 
alter its body using camouflage and
minimize<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.229> hardon<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:13.920> not<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
minimize and a hardon but not to the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.630 
minimize and a hardon but not to the
extent<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.119> deoxys<00:01:16.280> star<00:01:17.280> me<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
extent of a deoxys star me and the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.060 
extent of a deoxys star me and the
aluxes<00:01:18.000> are<00:01:18.180> also<00:01:18.450> both<00:01:18.930> psychic<00:01:19.860> type

original<00:01:23.220> form<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.610> stormy<00:01:24.119> what<00:01:24.780> could<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:24.990> be

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
original form of stormy what could it be

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.770 
original form of stormy what could it be
that<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:26.009> deoxys<00:01:26.580> virus<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.180> what<00:01:27.390> made<00:01:27.600> it

that the deoxys virus is what made it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.950 
that the deoxys virus is what made it
into<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> Pokemon<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.549> different<00:01:29.939> type<00:01:30.119> type

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
into a Pokemon in a different type type

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.469 
into a Pokemon in a different type type
of<00:01:31.200> way<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.799> different<00:01:32.220> type<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.369> form<00:01:32.790> because

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
of way a different type of form because

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.179 
of way a different type of form because
they<00:01:33.600> say<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> ox's<00:01:34.409> virus<00:01:34.799> once<00:01:35.009> it

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
they say that the ox's virus once it

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.920 
they say that the ox's virus once it
hits<00:01:35.400> earth<00:01:35.640> it'll<00:01:36.000> transform<00:01:36.689> into

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
hits earth it'll transform into

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.289 
hits earth it'll transform into
something<00:01:37.290> else<00:01:37.590> like<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.860> Pokemon<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.820> it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
something else like a Pokemon and it

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.969 
something else like a Pokemon and it
could<00:01:39.450> be<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.869> transformed<00:01:40.409> into<00:01:40.560> star

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
could be that it transformed into star

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.100 
could be that it transformed into star
you<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.430> then<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.060> know<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.390> well<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.899> was

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you and then you know as well as it was

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.620 
you and then you know as well as it was
into<00:01:43.439> star<00:01:43.740> me<00:01:43.920> or<00:01:44.340> could<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.060> actually

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
into star me or could I be that actually

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.139 
into star me or could I be that actually

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
come from a different planet like let's

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.370 
come from a different planet like let's
say<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> water<00:01:50.520> planet<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.420> hasn't<00:01:52.259> been

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
say a water planet that hasn't been

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.770 
say a water planet that hasn't been
discovered<00:01:52.740> yet<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> deoxys<00:01:54.420> virus

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
discovered yet and that the deoxys virus

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.440 
discovered yet and that the deoxys virus
hit<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.380> somehow<00:01:55.649> they<00:01:56.549> teleported<00:01:57.299> all

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
hit that and somehow they teleported all

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.679 
hit that and somehow they teleported all
the<00:01:57.600> way<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> earth<00:01:58.200> as<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:59.520> Pokemon<00:02:00.060> because<00:02:00.420> it

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the way to earth as I Pokemon because it

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.740 
the way to earth as I Pokemon because it
does<00:02:00.899> signal<00:02:01.320> out<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.560> space<00:02:02.189> as<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:03.329> know<00:02:03.570> at

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
does signal out to space as you know at

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.770 
does signal out to space as you know at
night<00:02:04.159> could<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.280> be<00:02:05.340> possible<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:06.390> is

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
night could that be possible that is

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.680 
night could that be possible that is
from<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.680> virus<00:02:08.039> simply<00:02:08.819> from<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.300> ox's

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
from the virus simply from the ox's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.589 
from the virus simply from the ox's
virus<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.229> it's<00:02:10.440> somehow<00:02:10.739> related<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.060> a

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
virus so it's somehow related to it in a

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.790 
virus so it's somehow related to it in a
way<00:02:12.810> when<00:02:13.080> they<00:02:13.230> go<00:02:13.440> in

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
way when they go in

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.640 
way when they go in
Earth's<00:02:14.520> atmosphere<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:16.080> could<00:02:16.320> probably

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
Earth's atmosphere this could probably

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.910 
Earth's atmosphere this could probably
be<00:02:16.950> another<00:02:17.820> type<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.420> theory<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.710> virus

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
be another type of theory that the virus

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.540 
be another type of theory that the virus
is<00:02:20.370> what<00:02:20.760> made<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.180> into<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.660> star<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.370> in<00:02:23.370> that

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
is what made it into a star you in that

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.480 
is what made it into a star you in that
form<00:02:23.970> when<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:24.390> hits<00:02:24.600> earth<00:02:24.870> or<00:02:25.490> different

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
form when it hits earth or different

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.340 
form when it hits earth or different
other<00:02:26.670> planets<00:02:27.180> like<00:02:27.390> other<00:02:27.780> planets<00:02:28.290> that

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
other planets like other planets that

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.140 
other planets like other planets that
there<00:02:28.530> might<00:02:28.710> be<00:02:28.770> in<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.130> universe<00:02:29.520> because<00:02:29.730> I

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
there might be in the universe because I

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.760 
there might be in the universe because I
believe<00:02:30.630> in<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> Pokemon<00:02:31.320> world<00:02:31.530> there

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
believe in the Pokemon world there

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.280 
believe in the Pokemon world there
actually<00:02:32.280> are<00:02:32.430> more<00:02:32.670> other<00:02:32.880> planets<00:02:33.450> simply

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
actually are more other planets simply

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.360 
actually are more other planets simply
because<00:02:34.410> there<00:02:34.800> are<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.950> lot<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.220> different

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
because there are a lot of different

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.430 
because there are a lot of different
pokemons<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.450> some<00:02:36.690> have<00:02:36.840> been<00:02:36.960> noted<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.350> be

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
pokemons and some have been noted to be

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.830 
pokemons and some have been noted to be
come<00:02:37.710> from<00:02:38.400> different<00:02:38.640> planets<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.540> let's

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
come from different planets like let's

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.900 
come from different planets like let's
say<00:02:39.930> for<00:02:40.260> Clefairy<00:02:40.500> supposedly<00:02:41.370> came<00:02:41.580> out<00:02:41.760> of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
say for Clefairy supposedly came out of

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.390 
say for Clefairy supposedly came out of
the<00:02:42.030> moon<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.740> there<00:02:43.740> could<00:02:44.010> be<00:02:44.070> other

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
the moon and there could be other

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.890 
the moon and there could be other
Pokemon<00:02:44.880> they<00:02:44.970> came<00:02:45.150> from<00:02:45.270> other<00:02:45.510> different

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
Pokemon they came from other different

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.280 
Pokemon they came from other different
planets<00:02:46.380> as<00:02:46.590> well<00:02:47.840> another<00:02:48.840> thing<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.140> I

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
planets as well another thing that I

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.070 
planets as well another thing that I
like<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.650> mention<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.430> theory<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:50.910> that

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
like to mention to this theory is that

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.620 
like to mention to this theory is that
the<00:02:52.080> support<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.800> Pokemon<00:02:53.610> riders<00:02:54.060> actually

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
the support that Pokemon riders actually

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.440 
the support that Pokemon riders actually
are<00:02:54.840> influenced<00:02:55.680> by<00:02:55.710> real<00:02:56.190> life<00:02:56.490> sci<00:02:57.240> fi

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120

elements in their series so this could

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
be that Pokemon actually use some other

crystal<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.209> which<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.020> described<00:03:58.530> the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
crystal and which it is described the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.530 
crystal and which it is described the
star<00:03:58.920> twinkles<00:03:59.550> when<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.940> stars<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.510> the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
star twinkles when the stars and the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.910 
star twinkles when the stars and the
space<00:04:01.380> twinkle<00:04:02.150> I'm<00:04:03.150> not<00:04:03.390> sure<00:04:03.840> how<00:04:04.620> this

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
space twinkle I'm not sure how this

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.580 
space twinkle I'm not sure how this
would<00:04:05.190> be<00:04:05.459> into<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.480> same<00:04:06.750> but<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:07.200> could<00:04:07.410> be

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
would be into the same but it could be

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.040 
would be into the same but it could be
possible<00:04:07.800> that<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.430> was<00:04:08.580> inspired<00:04:09.120> throughout

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
possible that it was inspired throughout

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.430 
possible that it was inspired throughout
the<00:04:10.380> whole<00:04:10.620> series<00:04:11.300> so<00:04:12.300> yes<00:04:12.570> are<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.080> probably

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
the whole series so yes are you probably

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.039 
the whole series so yes are you probably
connected<00:04:13.860> in<00:04:14.010> some<00:04:14.310> way<00:04:14.340> into<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.420> ox's<00:04:15.870> as

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049

section<00:04:18.810> what<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.290> think<00:04:19.500> about<00:04:19.590> this<00:04:19.919> theory

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
section what you think about this theory

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.099 
section what you think about this theory
I'm<00:04:20.430> not<00:04:20.580> saying<00:04:20.820> it's<00:04:20.970> true<00:04:21.299> this<00:04:21.750> is<00:04:21.960> a

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
I'm not saying it's true this is a

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.090 
I'm not saying it's true this is a
theory<00:04:22.410> that<00:04:22.500> I<00:04:22.680> decided<00:04:23.100> to<00:04:23.310> do<00:04:23.520> today

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
theory that I decided to do today

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.820 
theory that I decided to do today
and<00:04:24.220> it<00:04:25.060> was<00:04:25.210> quite<00:04:25.360> interesting<00:04:25.480> to<00:04:26.080> see<00:04:26.290> how

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
and it was quite interesting to see how

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.490 
and it was quite interesting to see how
they<00:04:27.130> are<00:04:27.160> related<00:04:27.490> in<00:04:27.820> some<00:04:28.180> way<00:04:28.210> and<00:04:28.630> that's

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
they are related in some way and that's

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.380 
they are related in some way and that's
pretty<00:04:29.680> much<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:29.950> let<00:04:30.730> me<00:04:30.820> in<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.000> comments

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
pretty much it let me in the comments

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.840 
pretty much it let me in the comments
suggesting<00:04:31.510> a<00:04:32.170> next<00:04:32.740> theory<00:04:33.040> video<00:04:33.520> that<00:04:33.730> you
