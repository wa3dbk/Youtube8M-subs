00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 well hi all dear friends well 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.230
 back together with that 76 today we go 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.929
 to face a nice video comparison for 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.040
 regarding the aesthetics and graphics of 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.559
 two operating systems 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.440
 certainly at the top with regards to 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.630
 let it be ios on one side with your iphone 6 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.830
 both lollipop on one side with his 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.990
 nexus 5 so much scam orphism when it came out 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.640
 iphone 7 iphone ios 7 sorry had been 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.040
 introduced precisely within that 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.989
 operating system there a little revised 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.410
 but not even that much within 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.239
 ios and 8 with this iphone 6 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.129
 as for nex 5 in my opinion 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.950
 learned so much life with 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.370
 lollipop 5.0 with lots of white like 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.219
 we also have it on iphone on iphone 6 on 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.890
 ios and 8 but above all the two systems 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.620
 they look very much above all 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.899
 for the graphic design of all of them 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.570
 this white of all these animations 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.300
 that are added inside the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.070
 own settled recovers tv are not 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.229
 lover of animations as you can 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.689
 see on my iphone or even 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.520
 eliminated the effect we have 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.860
 on the opening of the closure of any 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.570
 application because second less so 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.869
 to me damage and stomach however short 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.390
 they are very personal things as far as 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.340
 instead we are dealing with nex 5 we have these 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.990
 animations these transitions are 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.270
 very pleasant during everyday use 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.009
 they are very slim and fast as you can 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.140
 see the operating system e 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.210
 as fluid as we are on iphone 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.310
 because anyway we go to open e 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.270
 close the application in a very way 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.620
 the differences very quickly and quickly 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.930
 substantial on these two 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.940
 on these two operating systems yes 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.840
 they can also see from there from various two 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.430
 notification centers on nexus 5 we have 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.400
 specially designed notification center 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.020
 for an android experience to the state 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.420
 pure while only s 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.640
 we're a little bit going on the Android 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.590
 dependent as you can see are 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.050
 exit the various widgets for the center 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.630
 notifications in short, the operating system 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.580
 it is mirroring a little more upwards 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.550
 android as android and the rest learned 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.000
 80 transparencies of white as the style 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.070
 flat by androidi ios wants here in short i 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.840
 two operating systems are very much 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.580
 pairing with each other for what 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.970
 it's about aesthetics as you can see 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.390
 also from the two from the 22 menus of the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.520
 settings in short, we feel at home in 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.310
 both make up departments maybe 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.910
 on apple we have a more performance menu 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.630
 along with things more focused instead on 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.090
 nex 5 on android 5.0 which is better 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.400
 graphic interface I can't tell you 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.200
 that is, or rather they are two interfaces 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.180
 graphics as you can see that yes 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.190
 they look like yes but in the heart they are 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.500
 completely different for example 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.209
 multitasking and in my opinion studied 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.660
 better on android with this interface 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.550
 really scrolling through pages 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.430
 interesting while ios not 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.980
 it is never as never convinced this 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.750
 notification center and above all sorry 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.550
 this multitasking especially also 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.890
 with recent contacts I never did 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.720
 I use it because it is not properly it 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.660
 go to press the key twice 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.630
 home to find recent contacts 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.810
 what a lot smarter instead for 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.600
 regarding android and the possibility 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.740
 also to put a contacts widget 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.240
 recent 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.450
 the heart is the one because anyway 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.550
 android and ios look alike like i have 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.220
 already mentioned remarkably look at the 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.990
 white look also at the keys ie more or 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.270
 minus the two things interface 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.370
 very much on eg giving the 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.330
 telephone nex 5 search for faith 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.860
 we don't have the phone book on ios but if 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.660
 standard applications let's say yes 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.820
 they look very much like each other 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.860
 this could be good could 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.290
 to be bad, I don't know, anyway 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.500
 let's say the two operating systems 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.200
 really in 2014 they went to 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.730
 establish on an interface more or less 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.530
 similar 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.080
 clearly I'm not talking about the dro e 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.940
 because we know we can't 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.010
 do nothing but go to 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.720
 rearrange applications as much as we can 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.630
 like put it on android we have one 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.049
 possibility of customization to 360 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.669
 degrees 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:25.220
 if the first android wasn't like that from the 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.920
 more delicious with regards to the 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.260
 comparable graphics 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.600
 if its applications I can assure 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.390
 which is now very close 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:38.830
 in my opinion , he may even have passed it 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.510
 however, because there was Duyos 78 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.140
 no news regarding the 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:47.500
 graphics from android 4.4.4 kitkat a 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.750
 lollipop 5.0 has really changed one 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.490
 world if you agree with me there 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.310
 expect comments I wait for you on 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.140
 reviews of 86 wars on facebook or if 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.890
 I don't know but we feel on the various social networks 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.410
 network 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.410
 for today it is all a salute from wars 86
