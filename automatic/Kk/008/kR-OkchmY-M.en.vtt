tips<00:00:13.410> I'm<00:00:13.559> gonna<00:00:13.769> give<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.219> now<00:00:15.030> when<00:00:15.360> I've

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
tips I'm gonna give you now when I've

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.269 
tips I'm gonna give you now when I've
been<00:00:15.480> racing<00:00:15.960> online<00:00:16.289> or<00:00:16.500> drifting<00:00:16.890> online

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
been racing online or drifting online

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.519 
been racing online or drifting online
I've<00:00:18.060> been<00:00:18.480> mostly<00:00:18.810> seeing<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.350> East

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
I've been mostly seeing the East

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.660 
I've been mostly seeing the East
circuits<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.130> that's<00:00:20.279> what<00:00:20.400> I'm<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.640> to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
circuits so that's what I'm going to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.670 
circuits so that's what I'm going to
focus<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.480> there's<00:00:21.689> three<00:00:21.930> circuits<00:00:22.500> here

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
focus on but there's three circuits here

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.009 
focus on but there's three circuits here
as<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.340> see<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.840> East

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
as you can see so this is the East

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.370 
as you can see so this is the East
circuit<00:00:25.410> now<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.939> very<00:00:26.970> very<00:00:27.510> short<00:00:27.930> track

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
circuit now it's a very very short track

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.370 
circuit now it's a very very short track
with<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> lot<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.490> sharp<00:00:29.760> turns<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.900> better

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
with a lot of sharp turns so you better

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.990 
with a lot of sharp turns so you better
slow<00:00:31.859> down<00:00:32.099> when<00:00:32.340> you're<00:00:32.460> drifting<00:00:32.850> here

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
slow down when you're drifting here

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.610 
slow down when you're drifting here
because<00:00:33.360> you're<00:00:33.750> gonna<00:00:33.870> get<00:00:34.050> eat<00:00:34.290> by<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
because you're gonna get eat by the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.340 
because you're gonna get eat by the
tires<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.520> by<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.850> walls<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.840> make<00:00:37.020> sure<00:00:37.050> your

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
tires and by the walls so make sure your

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.410 
tires and by the walls so make sure your
slow<00:00:37.559> down<00:00:37.739> now<00:00:38.280> secondly<00:00:38.700> pay<00:00:38.969> attention

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
slow down now secondly pay attention

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.569 
slow down now secondly pay attention
right<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:39.629> as<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.559> can<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.129> went<00:00:41.430> from

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
right here as you can see I went from

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.860 
right here as you can see I went from
fourth<00:00:42.000> gear<00:00:42.420> with<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> low<00:00:43.770> rpm<00:00:44.870> downshift

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
fourth gear with a low rpm downshift

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.229 
fourth gear with a low rpm downshift
it's<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.200> third<00:00:46.469> gear<00:00:46.860> one<00:00:47.399> side<00:00:47.579> down<00:00:47.760> shifted

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
it's a third gear one side down shifted

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.439 
it's a third gear one side down shifted
I<00:00:48.360> was<00:00:48.510> already<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.079> my<00:00:49.260> my<00:00:49.890> just<00:00:50.160> right<00:00:50.489> with

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
I was already in my my just right with

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.569 
I was already in my my just right with
the<00:00:51.570> RPMs<00:00:52.110> being<00:00:52.440> higher<00:00:52.800> since<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.340> down

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the RPMs being higher since I down

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.430 
the RPMs being higher since I down
shifted<00:00:54.120> they<00:00:54.449> help<00:00:54.660> me<00:00:54.780> power<00:00:55.020> through<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
shifted they help me power through the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.170 
shifted they help me power through the
turns<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.309> did<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.699> through<00:00:56.910> up<00:00:57.000> this

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
turns and I did that through up this

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.049 
turns and I did that through up this
whole<00:00:57.570> track<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.859> find<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.340> helps<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.789> lot

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
whole track and I find that helps a lot

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.750 
whole track and I find that helps a lot
so<00:01:00.420> those<00:01:00.899> are<00:01:01.079> two<00:01:01.109> quick<00:01:01.980> tips<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.460> want<00:01:02.609> to

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
for me and I got an impressive score on

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.830 
for me and I got an impressive score on
one<00:01:20.070> lap<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.670> track<00:01:20.939> getting<00:01:21.509> over

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
one lap on this track getting over

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.410 
one lap on this track getting over
10,000<00:01:22.590> points<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.490> that's<00:01:23.939> pretty<00:01:24.150> good

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
10,000 points so that's pretty good
