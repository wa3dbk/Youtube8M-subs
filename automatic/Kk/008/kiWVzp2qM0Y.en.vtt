00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.019
 Hi, I'm all lost the DAX you could have us here alone 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.980
 City at CeBIT 2011 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.749
 and now one shows the one 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.699
 wireless in notebooks 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.429
 such as the Sony Vaio 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.579
 the Epsilon series 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:32.070
 Here comes as CPU Dertour cured his 50 used space graphics solutions the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.950
 Original see the 6100 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.330
 Neckermann had the 6 inch display with the wonderful 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.500
 Resolution CD equal 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.470
 two gigabytes of memory so Norbert Walter also 20 gigabyte hard drive of course 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.470
 The anniversaries were a webcam and Bluetooth 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.300
 Germans here have the display it's just the years has its roots 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.510
 Resolution I think finds 4 6 inches granted 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.570
 Hermes again at us this thousand 200 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.480
 Millennium one 66 times seven from 60 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.650
 domestic media resolution for me 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.149
 Wiesbaden Kim's video is the normal continue to run and took me 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 the title page Rest Nature 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.800
 Actually tenant Bieler is that she is a bit at the debtor 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.800
 absolutely no problem for me 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.460
 nice palm rest 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.460
 disengage the touchpad with the two 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.620
 cross the omari mosque 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.850
 and Sven Manz this would almost be that wonderful kill so 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.960
 I notice a wonderful light twitch of up to the South 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.030
 in that Matt has such beautiful bio-logo on top 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.240
 as normal with the Assist Percy as for bite is the castle 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.210
 take away on the road and Smith back 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.920
 So Laurent de Bras definitely has enough power to go on the road 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.869
 the opposite side have as we want it so first power adapter VW Rockton Pardini 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.450
 then often USB 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.110
 Dan is now the card reader and several candles the memory itself 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.319
 Card Year forward so Niessl 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.580
 he gave me one more the long breaker or both off for 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.929
 Plane the status leds 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:21.089
 on the right side the two audio ports two more USB ports 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:24.999
 Kanzian kilo place and a network India on the power 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.249
 Partners increase for years consecration and notebooks knows 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.650
 So that was the Sony Vaio Epsilon series 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.659
 alone with the Brazos 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:40.079
 for this CW 2011
