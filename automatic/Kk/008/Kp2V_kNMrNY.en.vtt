 it is very important to proceed to 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.630
 waterproofing with a product of

 quality 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.989
 it is proven in the laboratory that the 1 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.780
 allows silicone based reading 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.120
 evaporates quickly facilitates the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.860
 mold formation and the star gets

 high product development 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.210
 technology 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.760

 delaying discoloration and 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.320
 the wear of the roofs in the laboratory he us 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.860
 was allowed to test the properties of the 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.440
 pro and 6.6 28 we treated the 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.259
 papers with two products there with a 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.530
 competing product based on silicone and

 the other with the pro and 6,6 23 with 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.369
 fluoropolymers and then we 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.369
 have immersed in the water 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.180

 to the pros and 6.6 23 is not wet and 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.650
 the results him in contrast to

 competitive products for 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.940
 task resistances we have hi 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.130
 paper and to deal with 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.750
 tested products
