00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.640
 hello tankers guys come new 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:24.039
 patch 90 with this patch as always came 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.960
 all the various lags friezes and sags 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.380
 fps so to speak new frontier all that 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.630
 other 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.620
 so guys things in collect your 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.140
 minimalist build modifications in 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.160
 which includes the most useful fashions the most 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.629
 nothing extra is needed any 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.940
 beautiful spices and other nonsense 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.850
 so the first thing you see guys 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.739
 This screen saver when entering the game 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.850
 probably everyone she already tired of those son 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.470
 players who are 20 30 40 thousand battles 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.409
 the last is also memorized 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.900
 fresh nakata you went this chip 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.960
 from patch 0 8 10 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:09.250
 I also think everyone will be useful too 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.830
 no need vagay cleaned in hangar 5 to see 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.960
 next first this ping servers in 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.230
 xvm style is the best story 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.360
 continues purple less good 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.570
 server language some yellowish but also 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.270
 such a reddish color also guys 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.760
 added here so that's a great by 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.490
 my opinion is the statistics for the day that is 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.030
 it can be reset here displays all 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.000
 the most necessary rating is vn8 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.409
 win8 digit here in n6 and rating 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.430
 efficiency winning percentage 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:45.070
 experience damage on the light but also other nonsense 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.280
 plus silver for the money they earn 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.470
 so to speak missed during the session like this 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.710
 after each fight guys will be 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.409
 the power of such a cat I think that here 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.470
 whether there Krasin does not need this 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.450
 efficiency of your in vn8 rating in n 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.180
 6 efficiency rating and how much you 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.549
 earned net money here is very 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.799
 useful feature plus more to this fashion 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.470
 guys if you went into battle for example on 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.540
 some tanks there let it be t1 from 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.690
 you were killed there in the middle of the battle you leave on 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.430
 ms-1 battle here and during the battle with the left 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.719
 do you have such a window with 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.910
 information about the past of the battle, that is, victory 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:28.640
 defeat lynch and what is written tanchika 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.340
 rpc was also useful so cool 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:37.580
 chip also guys in the hangar removed 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.020
 learning before this then kitty is wrong 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.590
 often but only needed 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.780
 for beginners 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.210
 all her will pass and principle then he only 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.730
 interferes here but small changes 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.040
 achievements for some reason I do not know what that 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.700
 bug your bow and have a new patch 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.590
 life statistics are not shown here 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.170
 just winning percentage rounded by color 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:03.170
 in style to her that is greens 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.670
 purple red blue and stuff in 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.370
 principle guys on this hangar all 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.280
 no more changes no rest i 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.080
 I think something is not necessary there may be 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.420
 I will find something useful on the Internet 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.580
 add both to the hangar and proper for battle 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.580
 now we will go to the actual wallpaper there 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:23.120
 see what changes we have there 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.420
 and so the guys are fighting for the following changes 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.580
 First is a comprehensive fashion xvm 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.150
 which includes the very statistics on 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.430
 players on the ears of the minimap team 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.600
 with sonar from the maximum square 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.420
 drawing units with a circle of view 445 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.860
 meters unchanged circle further guys 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.370
 damage panel from player gambit p 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.350
 minimalistic panel which 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.050
 shows how much murom inflicted how 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.340
 projectile and what is the tanchik here 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:58.790
 which shows the time for repairing the module 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.100
 cut very thing and does not take fps 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.020
 and here will stand corners 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:08.620
 horizontally vodka that is a corner of such 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.170
 I have not played on the patch I can not show 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:16.019
 also minimalist 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:18.250
 prevents nothing obstructs further yes 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.669
 First of all this distance 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.860
 so-called commander's camera on 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.780
 crocus knot does not translate into sniper 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.740
 mode 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:33.419
 here and from his own disabled 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.220
 dynamic camera shake is disabled 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:41.520
 no after shots this is jerking the barrel 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.520
 experience and stuff 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:51.070
 cleaned fog removed guys scart and plus 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.950
 the rendering distance is also increased too 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.680
 a very useful thing, sort of 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.050
 a small servant that increases fps but 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.030
 exactly the dish can not tell it's me 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.940
 read on some forum about this one 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:09.610
 the module is such a thing so guys and 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.160
 in fact , where, in principle , we all have 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.140
 still the last piece of the guys that we have 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:19.539
 in battle there are 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.880
 caps f3 turn on free camera 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.800
 that is, here it can fly on the map 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.229
 useful thing for those who write video 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.350
 where he just wants to look risky 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.300
 Turns on only with this tank, that is 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.970
 when services then you can 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.680
 take advantage of is actually mine 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.530
 build finished 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:42.289
 secret chips bad when that's what i 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.060
 clan gives my clan left now 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:48.169
 shown here is such a znachechek it 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.629
 entered only in my assembly clan 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.180
 is not included in the top 100 50 there 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:57.969
 it seems or top100 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:06:00.349
 so there is nothing like that 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:03.169
 all successful bend use 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.580
 it will be updated as possible 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.889
 what mods will go in there yet 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.650
 but it will not be too overloaded there 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:12.680
 It's not all it's beautiful and 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:16.310
 you would be so minimalistic 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.469
 only on gif hardcore but everything to everyone 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.509
 high fps vigorous bend 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:23.020
 good luck subscribe to the channel put 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.020
 likes bye
