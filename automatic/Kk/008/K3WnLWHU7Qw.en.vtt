00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.680
 today as you see 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.939
 I'm not going to talk a little 

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:11.939
 on the first board 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.609
 the ipad 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.470
 as you see 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.539
 10-inch screen driven by 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.220
 teacher tegra 2 of nvidia 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.619
 has acs 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.490
 of 1280 for 800 points 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.490
 in a 16 screen format 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.380
 the operating system that incorporates is andrade 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.490
 in the version 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.960
 three points to 1 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.450
 after which you can use 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.260
 right now in the Spanish version 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.360
 as you see 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.130
 your 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.330
 Of the brand 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
 to which I have preferred to take the 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.680
 for now to make it 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.700
 in a more fluid way 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.790
 the operating system is specially designed for all 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.250
 maybe a destination is spoken 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.820
 what makes the most difference 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.430
 to train the rest of their competition 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.430
 what dogs 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.810
 to a base 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.690
 it becomes practically 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.190
 on a laptop 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.600
 more like a format 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.400
 jones mad 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.450
 with a full keyboard 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.900
 Approximately 90 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.200
 contemplates the 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200
 specially designed for 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.070
 base 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.530
 to have a full keyboard 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.030
 two formations vs 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.530
 juanín storage 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.099
 and it also adds a battery 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.579
 regás 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.579
 that increases the autonomy of responding on the board 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:22.919
 sardá 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.919
 incorporated 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.679
 of positioning 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.619
 we imagine 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:41.799
 with your full browser 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.799
 i two 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.379
 a front of one like 2 megapixel 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.069
 and another back we can here 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.319
 of 5 megapixels that is capable of shooting asked the tri 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.959
 nation 720p 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.629
 on the lake as weise 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.029
 what to transform 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:06.359
 a screen between glass 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.359
 hardened to avoid the network 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:15.329
 like a mantra back house lies and coquito the marked a profile 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.549
 of aluminum 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.689
 in what is the tablet with volume controls 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.319
 on and off 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.409
 and in the other 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.079
 we have some the micros are prepared to stain the internal part of the corpse 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.079
 that there is 100 to 16 or 32 gigas internal depending on the price 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:37.009
 and then I was swollen double screen cover 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.619
 and an exit from 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.229
 of headphones 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:46.649
 with the result what is very manageable around 700 grams 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.849
 with a choir 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.329
 who won bronze 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.329
 i 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:58.519
 with its keyboard base 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.579
 the angle when we fix your tablet on the keyboard 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:10.279
 that you have for your extraction so that we 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.889
 it is believed that he is completely self-confident 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.959
 and how to vejer profile 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.379
 it is much bigger 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:22.330
 the one of a ultralight laptop tab
