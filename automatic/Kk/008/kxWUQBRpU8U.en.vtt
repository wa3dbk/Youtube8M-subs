00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
it a quick chop over I just let it add a

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.219 
it a quick chop over I just let it add a
little<00:01:08.400> salt<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.970> garlic<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.990> reason

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
little salt to this garlic the reason

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.570 
little salt to this garlic the reason
that<00:01:10.290> did<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.770> because<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.159> salt<00:01:11.400> acts

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
that did that is because the salt acts

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.990 
that did that is because the salt acts
as<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:12.080> is<00:01:13.080> kind<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.439> an<00:01:13.560> abrasive<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.880> also

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
as a is kind of an abrasive and it also

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.260 
as a is kind of an abrasive and it also
helps<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:16.530> garlic<00:01:16.979> that's<00:01:17.759> when<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.090> juice

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
helps the garlic that's when it's juice

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.929 
helps the garlic that's when it's juice
so<00:01:18.840> now<00:01:18.990> we're<00:01:19.110> going<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.259> start<00:01:19.759> they're<00:01:20.759> not
