that<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.460> simply<00:00:42.149> got<00:00:42.270> cancer<00:00:42.600> because<00:00:42.780> I'm<00:00:42.899> not

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
that I simply got cancer because I'm not

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.660 
that I simply got cancer because I'm not
a<00:00:43.079> vegan

okay<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.059> see<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> lot<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.510> people

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
okay so you can see a lot of people

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.600 
okay so you can see a lot of people
called<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> lot<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.829> people<00:00:47.010> wrote<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.460> him<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
called in a lot of people wrote to him a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.069 
called in a lot of people wrote to him a
lot<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.850> people<00:00:48.059> messaged<00:00:48.450> him<00:00:48.690> saying<00:00:48.989> that

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
lot of people messaged him saying that

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.959 
lot of people messaged him saying that
he<00:00:49.320> should<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.620> been<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.770> vegan<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.550> then

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
he should have been a vegan and then

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.790 
he should have been a vegan and then
because<00:00:51.390> he's<00:00:51.539> not<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.719> vegan<00:00:52.020> he<00:00:52.590> got

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
because he's not a vegan he got

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.549 
because he's not a vegan he got
testicular<00:00:52.980> cancer<00:00:53.850> now<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.079> disagree

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
testicular cancer now I have to disagree

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.220 
testicular cancer now I have to disagree
because<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> most<00:00:57.360> established<00:00:57.660> factor

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
because is the most established factor

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.830 
because is the most established factor
associated<00:00:58.620> with<00:00:58.920> testicular<00:00:59.340> cancer<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.239> Mel

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
associated with testicular cancer is Mel

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.160 
associated with testicular cancer is Mel

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
associated with a two to four fold

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.000 
associated with a two to four fold
increase<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.200> risk<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.590> testicular

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
increase in the risk of testicular

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.370 
increase in the risk of testicular
cancer<00:01:08.670> however<00:01:09.330> some<00:01:09.840> studies<00:01:10.080> have

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
cancer however some studies have

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.469 
cancer however some studies have
reported<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.979> relative<00:01:11.400> risk<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:12.150> testicular

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
reported a relative risk for testicular

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.200 
reported a relative risk for testicular
cancer<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.320> see<00:01:13.380> over<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> MDT<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:15.000> range

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
cancer so see over the MDT in the range

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.109 
cancer so see over the MDT in the range
of<00:01:15.420> five<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.750> ten<00:01:16.350> fold<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> major

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
of five to ten fold so this is a major

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.330 
of five to ten fold so this is a major
factor<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:19.080> why<00:01:19.380> someone<00:01:19.799> may<00:01:19.979> develop

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
factor in why someone may develop

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.219 
factor in why someone may develop
testicular<00:01:20.909> cancer<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.750> funnily<00:01:22.200> enough

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
testicular cancer and funnily enough

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.380 
testicular cancer and funnily enough
that<00:01:23.009> actually<00:01:23.159> has<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> lot<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:24.030> with<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
that actually has a lot to do with the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.780 
that actually has a lot to do with the
mother's<00:01:24.750> diet<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.590> diet<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> mother

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
mother's diet so the diet of the mother

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.510 
mother's diet so the diet of the mother
has<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> lot<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.810> whether<00:01:28.140> or<00:01:28.350> not<00:01:28.520> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
has a lot to do with whether or not the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.060 
has a lot to do with whether or not the
MDT<00:01:30.090> occurs<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.960> also<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.530> mention<00:01:31.710> that

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
MDT occurs and also like to mention that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.830 
MDT occurs and also like to mention that
just<00:01:32.220> because<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.670> go<00:01:32.790> vegan<00:01:33.060> doesn't<00:01:33.450> mean

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
just because you go vegan doesn't mean

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.410 
just because you go vegan doesn't mean
you<00:01:33.990> eat<00:01:34.140> healthy<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:35.159> Pete<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.390> a

you eat healthy but Pete and this is a

he hasn't actually brought up any

he hasn't actually brought up any
studies<00:05:45.360> there's<00:05:46.020> a<00:05:46.110> lot<00:05:46.380> of<00:05:46.650> a<00:05:47.400> lot<00:05:48.030> of<00:05:48.150> proof

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
studies there's a lot of a lot of proof

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.420 
studies there's a lot of a lot of proof
that<00:05:48.480> we<00:05:48.780> should<00:05:49.020> be<00:05:49.140> eating<00:05:49.170> meat<00:05:49.710> our<00:05:49.980> bodies

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
that we should be eating meat our bodies

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.720 
that we should be eating meat our bodies
are<00:05:50.780> we<00:05:51.800> grew<00:05:52.800> up<00:05:52.830> eating<00:05:53.070> meat<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:53.460> that's

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
are we grew up eating meat and that's

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.800 
are we grew up eating meat and that's
how<00:05:54.920> thousands<00:05:55.920> of<00:05:56.010> thousands<00:05:56.430> of<00:05:56.520> years<00:05:56.810> we

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
how thousands of thousands of years we

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.840 
how thousands of thousands of years we
that's<00:05:58.230> how<00:05:58.380> we<00:05:58.440> grew<00:05:58.740> up<00:05:58.770> just<00:05:59.460> because<00:05:59.700> we

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
that's how we grew up just because we

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.370 
that's how we grew up just because we
grow<00:06:00.060> up<00:06:00.150> doing<00:06:00.420> something<00:06:00.810> doesn't<00:06:00.990> mean<00:06:01.200> we

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
grow up doing something doesn't mean we

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.440 
grow up doing something doesn't mean we
have<00:06:01.500> to<00:06:01.530> continue<00:06:02.160> doing<00:06:02.520> it<00:06:02.640> and<00:06:02.820> in<00:06:02.970> fact<00:06:03.150> if

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
have to continue doing it and in fact if

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.300 
have to continue doing it and in fact if
vegan<00:06:03.810> diet<00:06:04.050> or<00:06:04.230> a<00:06:04.290> vegetarian<00:06:04.710> diet<00:06:05.040> is

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
vegan diet or a vegetarian diet is

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.770 
vegan diet or a vegetarian diet is
healthier<00:06:05.790> then<00:06:05.970> why<00:06:06.120> wouldn't<00:06:06.360> we<00:06:06.510> follow

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
healthier then why wouldn't we follow

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.410 
healthier then why wouldn't we follow
that<00:06:07.020> and<00:06:07.380> that<00:06:07.800> is<00:06:07.980> fine<00:06:08.220> if<00:06:08.520> you<00:06:08.550> need<00:06:09.060> to<00:06:09.240> get

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.420 
that and that is fine if you need to get

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.030 
that and that is fine if you need to get
