day a little controversy there but Mike

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.930 
day a little controversy there but Mike
came<00:00:23.120> up<00:00:23.270> with<00:00:23.510> us<00:00:23.600> for<00:00:24.040> you<00:00:25.040> know<00:00:25.160> for<00:00:25.910> the

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
came up with us for you know for the

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.270 
came up with us for you know for the
dyno<00:00:26.150> day<00:00:26.240> and<00:00:26.620> basically<00:00:27.620> when<00:00:27.920> we<00:00:28.070> rolled

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280 
dyno day and basically when we rolled

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.930 
dyno day and basically when we rolled
the<00:00:28.400> car

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
the car

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.030 
the car
you<00:00:29.300> know<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:29.630> car<00:00:29.810> made<00:00:29.990> like<00:00:30.140> 276

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
you know the car made like 276

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.740 
you know the car made like 276
horsepower<00:00:31.430> we<00:00:31.610> were<00:00:31.700> like<00:00:31.850> all<00:00:32.119> amazed<00:00:32.450> at

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
horsepower we were like all amazed at

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.170 
horsepower we were like all amazed at
the<00:00:32.840> car<00:00:33.020> meet<00:00:33.170> so<00:00:33.320> much<00:00:33.469> horsepower<00:00:34.180> torque

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
the car meet so much horsepower torque

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.849 
the car meet so much horsepower torque
was<00:00:35.450> back<00:00:35.780> normal<00:00:36.260> but<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.530> horsepower

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
was back normal but the horsepower

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.819 
was back normal but the horsepower
seemed<00:00:37.160> pretty<00:00:37.579> high<00:00:37.960> and<00:00:38.960> so<00:00:39.320> we<00:00:39.499> thought<00:00:39.710> he

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
seemed pretty high and so we thought he

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.669 
seemed pretty high and so we thought he
was<00:00:39.949> sand<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:40.370> to<00:00:40.609> be<00:00:40.699> perfectly<00:00:41.120> honest<00:00:41.679> but

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:42.679 
was sand and to be perfectly honest but

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.000 
was sand and to be perfectly honest but
he<00:00:42.769> wasn't<00:00:43.129> and<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.210> we<00:00:44.719> after<00:00:45.409> the<00:00:45.530> end<00:00:45.679> of<00:00:45.829> the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
he wasn't and so we after the end of the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.439 
he wasn't and so we after the end of the
dyno<00:00:46.190> day<00:00:46.429> we<00:00:46.640> wanted<00:00:46.879> to<00:00:46.940> putting<00:00:47.149> him<00:00:47.300> back

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
dyno day we wanted to putting him back

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.959 
dyno day we wanted to putting him back
on<00:00:47.719> and<00:00:48.170> do<00:00:48.260> an<00:00:48.379> air<00:00:48.499> fuel<00:00:48.739> sample<00:00:49.249> and<00:00:49.460> a<00:00:49.730> boost

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
on and do an air fuel sample and a boost

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.720 
on and do an air fuel sample and a boost
sample<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:50.600> then<00:00:50.960> we<00:00:50.989> found<00:00:51.409> as<00:00:52.069> you<00:00:52.399> can<00:00:52.579> see

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
sample and then we found as you can see

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:04.000 
sample and then we found as you can see
right<00:00:52.909> here<00:01:01.539> it's<00:01:02.539> a<00:01:02.629> California<00:01:02.960> car<00:01:03.409> but

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
right here it's a California car but

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.399 
right here it's a California car but
basically<00:01:04.430> he<00:01:04.670> was<00:01:04.820> running<00:01:05.120> dead<00:01:05.510> lean<00:01:05.810> you

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
basically he was running dead lean you

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.969 
basically he was running dead lean you
can<00:01:06.440> see<00:01:06.710> already<00:01:07.010> at<00:01:07.340> 3,000<00:01:07.969> rpm<00:01:08.719> he's<00:01:09.350> at<00:01:09.560> 16

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
can see already at 3,000 rpm he's at 16

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.330 
can see already at 3,000 rpm he's at 16
almost<00:01:10.189> 17<00:01:10.369> pounds<00:01:11.030> of<00:01:11.149> boost<00:01:11.649> 3,000<00:01:12.649> rpm<00:01:12.979> he's

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
almost 17 pounds of boost 3,000 rpm he's

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.270 
almost 17 pounds of boost 3,000 rpm he's
in<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.579> 1400<00:01:14.299> area<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.170> it<00:01:15.680> comes<00:01:15.920> all<00:01:16.189> the

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
in the 1400 area and it comes all the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.219 
in the 1400 area and it comes all the
way<00:01:16.310> across<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:16.909> as<00:01:17.030> he<00:01:17.329> reaches<00:01:17.719> into<00:01:17.899> peak

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
way across and as he reaches into peak

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.209 
way across and as he reaches into peak
torque<00:01:18.530> 4,000<00:01:19.280> 5,000<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.119> most<00:01:20.719> importantly

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
torque 4,000 5,000 and most importantly

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.429 
torque 4,000 5,000 and most importantly
4245<00:01:22.219> you<00:01:22.729> could<00:01:22.939> see<00:01:23.119> he's<00:01:23.329> still<00:01:23.570> wait<00:01:24.049> wait

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
4245 you could see he's still wait wait

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.399 
4245 you could see he's still wait wait
wait<00:01:24.740> lean<00:01:25.100> all<00:01:25.789> the<00:01:25.850> way<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:26.780> know<00:01:26.869> like

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
wait lean all the way you know like

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.380 
wait lean all the way you know like
we're<00:01:27.649> at<00:01:27.829> 16<00:01:28.280> pounds<00:01:28.610> of<00:01:28.700> boost<00:01:28.820> reach<00:01:29.180> in

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
we're at 16 pounds of boost reach in

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.109 
we're at 16 pounds of boost reach in
peak<00:01:29.600> torque<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.140> we're<00:01:30.770> right<00:01:31.070> on<00:01:31.219> the<00:01:31.490> 1300

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
peak torque and we're right on the 1300

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.789 
peak torque and we're right on the 1300
which<00:01:32.509> is<00:01:32.659> really<00:01:33.079> lean<00:01:33.259> for<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:33.590> clock

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
which is really lean for this clock

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.910 
which is really lean for this clock
finally<00:01:34.670> it<00:01:34.880> kind<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.149> kind<00:01:35.960> of<00:01:36.020> loves<00:01:36.409> itself

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
finally it kind of kind of loves itself

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.950 
finally it kind of kind of loves itself
or<00:01:37.159> for<00:01:37.430> a<00:01:37.460> couple<00:01:37.939> of<00:01:38.000> thousand<00:01:38.420> rpm<00:01:38.750> about

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
or for a couple of thousand rpm about

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.170 
or for a couple of thousand rpm about
just<00:01:39.890> about<00:01:40.070> a<00:01:40.130> thousand<00:01:40.549> rpm<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.939> kind<00:01:41.119> of

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
just about a thousand rpm the kind of

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.999 
just about a thousand rpm the kind of
levels<00:01:41.450> itself<00:01:41.780> for<00:01:41.990> but<00:01:42.409> then<00:01:42.560> look<00:01:42.740> what<00:01:42.770> it

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
levels itself for but then look what it

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.230 
levels itself for but then look what it
does<00:01:43.219> it<00:01:43.820> dive<00:01:44.299> bombs<00:01:44.719> into<00:01:45.409> like<00:01:45.859> 9<00:01:46.189> o<00:01:46.219> so<00:01:47.090> the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
does it dive bombs into like 9 o so the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.060 
does it dive bombs into like 9 o so the
call<00:01:47.450> room<00:01:47.719> really<00:01:48.259> really<00:01:48.500> lean<00:01:48.829> in<00:01:49.009> the

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
call room really really lean in the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.490 
call room really really lean in the
beginning<00:01:49.429> with<00:01:49.579> a<00:01:49.609> lot<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:49.969> boost<00:01:50.380> kind<00:01:51.380> of

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
beginning with a lot of boost kind of

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.230 
beginning with a lot of boost kind of
you<00:01:51.890> know<00:01:52.009> even<00:01:52.340> ran<00:01:52.520> lean<00:01:52.759> right<00:01:52.969> through<00:01:53.210> a

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
you know even ran lean right through a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.719 
you know even ran lean right through a
peak<00:01:53.450> torque<00:01:53.740> loves<00:01:54.740> itself<00:01:55.159> out<00:01:55.369> for<00:01:55.520> about<00:01:55.640> a

peak torque loves itself out for about a
thousand<00:01:56.210> rpm<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:57.079> then<00:01:57.229> dump<00:01:57.799> all<00:01:58.159> kinds<00:01:58.460> of

thousand rpm and then dump all kinds of

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.060 
thousand rpm and then dump all kinds of

your car will run a lot better and a lot
safer<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:20.200> will<00:03:20.350> definitely<00:03:20.560> make<00:03:20.829> less

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
safer it will definitely make less

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.610 
safer it will definitely make less
horsepower<00:03:21.670> but<00:03:22.299> it'll<00:03:22.450> run<00:03:22.600> a<00:03:22.630> lot<00:03:23.079> safer<00:03:23.410> and

a<00:03:23.680> lot<00:03:23.890> more<00:03:23.920> consistent<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:24.820> you<00:03:25.090> won't<00:03:25.269> be

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
a lot more consistent and you won't be

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.810 

Brett<00:04:05.660> yes<00:04:06.650> he<00:04:07.010> definitely<00:04:07.400> was<00:04:07.550> 30

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
Brett yes he definitely was 30

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.790 
Brett yes he definitely was 30
horsepower<00:04:08.210> but<00:04:09.020> look<00:04:09.320> at<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.560> torque

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
horsepower but look at the torque

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.620 
horsepower but look at the torque
numbers<00:04:10.010> you<00:04:10.310> actually<00:04:10.640> increase<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:11.390> torque

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
numbers you actually increase the torque

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.040 
numbers you actually increase the torque
so<00:04:12.470> this<00:04:13.370> number<00:04:13.790> as<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.270> told<00:04:14.540> everybody<00:04:14.840> that

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
so this number as I told everybody that

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.870 
so this number as I told everybody that
day<00:04:15.380> is<00:04:15.530> not<00:04:15.680> a<00:04:15.740> real<00:04:16.040> number<00:04:16.070> it's<00:04:16.610> just<00:04:16.790> a

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
day is not a real number it's just a

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.190 
day is not a real number it's just a
fake<00:04:17.090> number<00:04:17.270> because<00:04:17.660> you're<00:04:17.810> leaning<00:04:18.110> out

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
fake number because you're leaning out

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.920 
fake number because you're leaning out
the<00:04:18.380> motor<00:04:18.560> so<00:04:18.770> so<00:04:19.280> immensely<00:04:19.820> look<00:04:20.660> at<00:04:20.780> this

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930
