00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
what's up youtube this is twist i'm here

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.420 
what's up youtube this is twist i'm here
with<00:00:02.220> a<00:00:02.280> deck<00:00:02.939> profile<00:00:03.650> I'm<00:00:04.650> profiling<00:00:05.100> my

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
with a deck profile I'm profiling my

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.850 
with a deck profile I'm profiling my
Stardust<00:00:05.850> Dragon<00:00:06.170> assault<00:00:07.170> mode<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:09.860> you

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
Stardust Dragon assault mode and you

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.430 
Stardust Dragon assault mode and you
know<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.130> I'll<00:00:11.190> get<00:00:11.309> right<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:11.809> runs<00:00:12.809> to

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
know so I'll get right to it runs to

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.470 
know so I'll get right to it runs to
Stardust<00:00:13.830> dragon<00:00:14.099> assault<00:00:14.280> mode<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.639> think<00:00:15.360> two

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
Stardust dragon assault mode I think two

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.470 
Stardust dragon assault mode I think two
is<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> best<00:00:15.750> number<00:00:16.080> three<00:00:16.490> really<00:00:17.490> makes

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
is the best number three really makes

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.060 
is the best number three really makes
for<00:00:18.660> some<00:00:18.779> more<00:00:18.930> inconsistent<00:00:19.230> draws<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.980> put

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
for some more inconsistent draws and put

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.830 
for some more inconsistent draws and put
some<00:00:20.189> more<00:00:20.250> dead<00:00:20.430> cards<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.760> your<00:00:20.789> hand<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.810> I

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
some more dead cards in your hand so I

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.240 
some more dead cards in your hand so I
think<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.170> any<00:00:22.289> assault<00:00:22.590> mode<00:00:22.710> deck<00:00:22.980> two<00:00:23.189> is

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
think in any assault mode deck two is

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.000 
think in any assault mode deck two is
probably<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.640> best<00:00:23.789> number<00:00:24.590> the<00:00:25.590> deck<00:00:25.740> runs

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
probably the best number the deck runs

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.250 
probably the best number the deck runs
three<00:00:26.460> assault<00:00:27.000> beasts<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.510> only<00:00:27.990> run<00:00:28.140> two

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
when I only ran two beasts I didn't draw

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.190 
when I only ran two beasts I didn't draw
