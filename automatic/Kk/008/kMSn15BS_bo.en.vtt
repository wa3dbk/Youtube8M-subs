00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.910
 marley headphones yes that's what they look like 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.590
 Here you can see from the side 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.890
 look pretty good if we just go 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.590
 open 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.119
 Here you can also see where to find them online 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.380
 Of course you can buy them as well 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.699
 buy normal shops 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.769
 then they do too I have here already 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.360
 only made on but it has it 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.920
 not open so i also right here 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.020
 which gets neat on otherwise 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.410
 The environment here again from behind 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.180
 see 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.190
 you have the headphones here something about 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:51.660
 bob marley himself in different 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:53.430
 languages in different languages 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.740
 I can not speak all German now 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.430
 English and also there yes we want there 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.430
 Get get out 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.570
 so you are outside what the packaging 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:24.170
 and devote our heads to look 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.170
 but we can do that 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.860
 and there are also different ones 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.310
 little things how to see Graf here 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.119
 can 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.420
 Well, I'm not so headphone right now 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.460
 bit away 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:48.650
 this time the bag rausholen is out 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.920
 something in there of course here 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.930
 operation manual 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.460
 although actually does not know what you are for 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.970
 which needs now because of itself 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.520
 even 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.780
 I would rather not use it 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.850
 Do not smoke who needs a nice one 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:14.130
 bag here you can pull it 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:19.680
 open again so beautiful 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:22.709
 raster green red green yellow but what me 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.930
 because the bread is green here so now 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.160
 nice that the signs of what also 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:36.150
 the family has been controlled 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:44.160
 then let's to the headphone 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:49.260
 Out there they are beautiful blooming 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.579
 with beautiful here stops here 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.000
 You can do headphones yourself that way 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.940
 fold up that they are smaller 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.019
 so that you can fit in too 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.910
 here you can enlarge them or 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.400
 Shrink down depending on how you head 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.400
 kicked big head or not 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:12.890
 Here , male was very nice here 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.209
 red cable to it, I think quite nice 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.860
 and here of course the connection cable 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:23.430
 what comes on the pc or just mp3 player 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.840
 or or trust is from beautiful 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.840
 look at the fabric 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:38.709
 thatcher and economics less here 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.890
 normal connection like that 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.580
 Everywhere is common and connected 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.470
 not here with quite normal ribbon 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.990
 here plastic but everything has to 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.930
 yet are degradable by nature because 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:56.530
 that's what the marlies stand for 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:00.160
 world in the green and others 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.850
 testifies quite nicely is also relative 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.150
 long 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:08.860
 I do not know now one and a half two 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:11.200
 meter so not two meters land very much 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:16.209
 beautiful stuffed animal feel with grid 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.890
 colors inside that they are such a real thing 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.549
 leather in too far'm not so sure 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.680
 and so for real leather rolls and in 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.250
 indoors again here also nice this 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.150
 I think colors are very beautiful now 60 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.140
 euro costs 59 99 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.380
 and yes I hope they have one now 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.470
 but I have not had a good sound of wood 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.850
 think they will be fine 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.930
 I can do that at the time 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.130
 maybe optimized 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.850
 but otherwise I would say that was now 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.490
 you can actually unboxing here 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.690
 make it nice here 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.680
 then the fit is still right in the 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.340
 bag in and yes then I finish here 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.960
 the video 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.610
 I hope you liked it if 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.320

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.200
