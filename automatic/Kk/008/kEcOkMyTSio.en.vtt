00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.290
Alright, Sarah. New blankie.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:03.839
What?

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.220
Yep, it just goes over your head.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.280
You want me to put my head in there?

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.500
Yeah, look. I'll get in there with you. See?
See? Sarah come here.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.480
Do you want to smell it?

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.360
(Gasps) It's weird.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.570
It's a blanket.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.860
(Leaves rustling)

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.740
She'll never find it here.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.280
Do you know where the sleeve is this time?
It's not hanging off the back, right?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.120
No.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.740
No, that would be terrifying.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.240
Yeah.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.640
So, I don't know why this color is being discontinued,
I think it looks awesome.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.640
Seriously, it looks awesome. I hope that I
can find a stable blanket to match.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.579
Alright, blanket change.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.640
(static shock sounds)

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.680
Ow!

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.980
Sorry.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:04.299
I mean I know it's not quite your size, but...you
know. I don't think it's a big deal. I got

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.210
a great deal on it!

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.760
So, according to this blanketing app, we should
be good with a turnout sheet for the rest

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.010
of today. Perfect.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.220
Uhhhh, or not...

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.640
I told you.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.620
How is that even possible?

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.720
What do you mean? This is how I wear this
one.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.609
No, I, it's...it's still connected. I don't
even understand how you got...half way out

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:29.390
of it.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.400
Whoa, whoa! Buy me a treat first.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.520
It's supposed to be this way. Breathability.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.560
No?

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.060
No.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.640
Hey!

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.260
Oh no.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.340
Oh! This? No, this was Teddy.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.509
I was being good. Teddy was very naughty.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.900
It wasn't that nice anyway.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.670
It wasn't that nice anyway?

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.369
No.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.640
Do you know how much money this cost?

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.199
It's itchy.
