people in this lane now that I have my
allies<00:05:28.020> on<00:05:28.260> the<00:05:28.350> map<00:05:28.530> and<00:05:28.890> going<00:05:29.160> around

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
allies on the map and going around

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.790 
allies on the map and going around
ganking<00:05:29.790> their<00:05:29.940> other<00:05:30.120> allies<00:05:30.600> and<00:05:30.900> on<00:05:31.500> top<00:05:31.770> of

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
ganking their other allies and on top of

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.620 
ganking their other allies and on top of
that<00:05:32.010> pushing<00:05:32.790> down<00:05:32.940> their<00:05:33.120> towers<00:05:33.420> then<00:05:33.570> you

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
that pushing down their towers then you

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.920 
that pushing down their towers then you
see<00:05:33.750> era<00:05:33.960> thorn<00:05:34.260> here<00:05:34.860> fell<00:05:35.220> for<00:05:36.030> how<00:05:36.210> weak<00:05:36.540> he

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
see era thorn here fell for how weak he

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.690 
see era thorn here fell for how weak he
believed<00:05:37.530> that<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.950> catapults<00:05:38.400> were<00:05:38.520> weak

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
believed that the catapults were weak

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.060 
believed that the catapults were weak
and<00:05:39.000> it<00:05:39.330> ended<00:05:39.510> up<00:05:39.600> taking<00:05:39.750> out<00:05:40.050> 90%<00:05:40.890> of<00:05:40.920> his

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
and it ended up taking out 90% of his

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.770 
and it ended up taking out 90% of his
health<00:05:41.310> that<00:05:41.910> was<00:05:42.000> without<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.330> super

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
health that was without the super

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.300 
health that was without the super
activated<00:05:43.350> so<00:05:43.470> if<00:05:43.560> they<00:05:43.680> come<00:05:43.890> close<00:05:43.919> I'm

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
activated so if they come close I'm

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.070 
activated so if they come close I'm
gonna<00:05:44.460> activate<00:05:44.700> that<00:05:44.940> super<00:05:45.360> and<00:05:45.780> I<00:05:45.840> really

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
gonna activate that super and I really

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.630 
gonna activate that super and I really
like<00:05:46.230> it<00:05:46.350> if<00:05:46.410> I<00:05:46.500> can<00:05:46.650> get<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.860> route<00:05:47.040> on<00:05:47.190> them<00:05:47.430> -

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
like it if I can get the route on them -

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.970 
like it if I can get the route on them -
well<00:05:48.600> I'm<00:05:48.750> he's<00:05:48.960> sitting<00:05:49.260> here<00:05:49.380> distracting

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
well I'm he's sitting here distracting

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.440 
well I'm he's sitting here distracting
them<00:05:50.130> that<00:05:50.520> when<00:05:50.640> they<00:05:50.760> get<00:05:50.880> the<00:05:51.030> towers<00:05:51.419> down

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
them that when they get the towers down

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.150 
them that when they get the towers down
they're<00:05:51.780> gonna<00:05:51.900> actually<00:05:52.080> backdoor<00:05:52.740> it<00:05:52.950> and

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
they're gonna actually backdoor it and

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.190 
they're gonna actually backdoor it and
then<00:05:53.430> it's<00:05:53.580> just<00:05:53.820> done<00:05:54.630> from<00:05:54.870> there<00:05:55.020> because

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
then it's just done from there because

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.600 
then it's just done from there because
we're<00:05:55.380> in<00:05:55.500> their<00:05:55.680> base<00:05:55.860> and<00:05:56.130> they're<00:05:56.250> screwed

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
we're in their base and they're screwed

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.150 
we're in their base and they're screwed
over<00:05:56.900> veristic<00:05:57.900> really<00:05:58.350> comes<00:05:58.590> into<00:05:58.800> his<00:05:58.890> own

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
over veristic really comes into his own

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.250 
over veristic really comes into his own
late-game<00:05:59.520> because<00:06:00.450> then<00:06:00.600> he<00:06:00.750> has<00:06:00.840> a<00:06:00.870> shield

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
late-game because then he has a shield

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.140 
late-game because then he has a shield
upgraded<00:06:01.919> his<00:06:02.040> heal<00:06:02.340> upgraded<00:06:02.880> and<00:06:02.970> his

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
upgraded his heal upgraded and his

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.720 
upgraded his heal upgraded and his
ridiculous<00:06:03.690> catapults<00:06:04.530> now<00:06:05.130> right<00:06:05.310> there<00:06:05.550> is

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
ridiculous catapults now right there is

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.790 
ridiculous catapults now right there is
the<00:06:05.970> the<00:06:06.419> major<00:06:06.630> thing<00:06:07.230> I<00:06:07.320> was<00:06:07.440> talking<00:06:07.740> about

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
the the major thing I was talking about

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.290 
the the major thing I was talking about
earlier<00:06:07.919> about<00:06:08.220> people<00:06:08.430> under<00:06:08.790> estimating

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
earlier about people under estimating

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.970 
earlier about people under estimating
the<00:06:09.390> catapults<00:06:09.840> not<00:06:09.990> sure<00:06:10.140> he<00:06:10.320> was<00:06:10.440> level<00:06:10.740> 5

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
the catapults not sure he was level 5

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.320 
the catapults not sure he was level 5
and<00:06:11.310> really<00:06:11.490> under<00:06:11.700> leveled<00:06:12.030> I<00:06:12.090> don't<00:06:12.270> know

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
and really under leveled I don't know

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.060 
and really under leveled I don't know
why<00:06:12.480> he<00:06:12.750> pushed<00:06:13.050> because<00:06:13.410> anybody<00:06:13.740> could<00:06:13.980> have

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
why he pushed because anybody could have

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.980 
why he pushed because anybody could have
got<00:06:14.250> him<00:06:14.460> but<00:06:14.910> he<00:06:15.030> seemed<00:06:15.330> to<00:06:15.510> think<00:06:15.720> that

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
passive which it did kind of forget to

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.770 
passive which it did kind of forget to
mention<00:06:28.680> over<00:06:28.800> everything<00:06:29.130> else<00:06:29.400> is<00:06:29.940> passive

mention over everything else is passive
is<00:06:30.930> kind<00:06:31.530> of<00:06:31.680> in<00:06:32.100> a<00:06:32.220> way<00:06:32.340> you<00:06:32.400> might<00:06:32.610> think<00:06:32.669> weak

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
is kind of in a way you might think weak

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.150 
is kind of in a way you might think weak
but<00:06:33.510> in<00:06:33.600> the<00:06:33.750> end<00:06:33.900> it<00:06:34.110> really<00:06:34.140> makes<00:06:34.590> it<00:06:34.740> strong

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
but in the end it really makes it strong

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.670 
but in the end it really makes it strong
it<00:06:35.460> is<00:06:35.940> just<00:06:36.510> you<00:06:37.169> give<00:06:37.380> some<00:06:37.560> basic

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
it is just you give some basic

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.370 
it is just you give some basic
resistance<00:06:38.430> now<00:06:38.729> this<00:06:38.940> goes<00:06:39.120> up<00:06:39.270> to<00:06:39.300> 36

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
resistance now this goes up to 36

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.250 
resistance now this goes up to 36
basic<00:06:40.890> attack<00:06:41.220> and<00:06:41.480> ability<00:06:42.480> resistance<00:06:42.990> late

basic attack and ability resistance late

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.910 
basic attack and ability resistance late
beam<00:06:43.530> and<00:06:43.950> it's<00:06:44.400> just<00:06:44.700> crazy<00:06:45.570> because<00:06:46.140> he

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:46.920 
beam and it's just crazy because he

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.070 
beam and it's just crazy because he
doesn't<00:06:47.250> need<00:06:47.370> a<00:06:47.430> tank<00:06:47.730> belt<00:06:48.000> to<00:06:48.180> tank<00:06:48.450> now<00:06:49.020> he

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
doesn't need a tank belt to tank now he

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.870
