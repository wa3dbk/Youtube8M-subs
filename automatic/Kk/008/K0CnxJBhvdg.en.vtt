for<00:00:05.279> this<00:00:05.430> tutorial<00:00:05.940> we<00:00:06.330> will<00:00:06.359> be<00:00:06.480> simply

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
for this tutorial we will be simply

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.140 
for this tutorial we will be simply
animating<00:00:07.500> text<00:00:07.950> making<00:00:08.340> each<00:00:08.700> word<00:00:08.940> in<00:00:09.059> the

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
animating text making each word in the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.530 
animating text making each word in the
sentence<00:00:09.510> appear<00:00:09.929> one<00:00:10.410> frame<00:00:10.740> at<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> time

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
sentence appear one frame at a time

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.780 
sentence appear one frame at a time
first<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.719> all<00:00:12.809> let's<00:00:13.410> create<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.830> new<00:00:13.980> document

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
first of all let's create a new document

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.330 
first of all let's create a new document
for<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.450> move<00:00:16.020> over<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.590> file<00:00:16.830> menu<00:00:17.100> and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
for that move over to the file menu and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.760 
for that move over to the file menu and
select<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.970> new<00:00:18.180> option<00:00:18.720> with<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.619> new

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
select the new option with the new

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.710 
select the new option with the new
window<00:00:20.070> opened<00:00:20.430> up<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:21.150> will<00:00:21.270> change<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
window opened up we will change the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.500 
window opened up we will change the
document<00:00:22.230> size<00:00:22.410> keeping<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.279> width<00:00:23.490> at<00:00:23.730> 450

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
document size keeping the width at 450

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.070 
document size keeping the width at 450
and<00:00:24.689> changing<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.500> height<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:26.070> 150<00:00:26.730> pixels

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
and changing the height to 150 pixels

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.689 
and changing the height to 150 pixels
after<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.230> let's<00:00:28.800> click<00:00:29.070> on<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> ok'<00:00:29.670> button

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
after that let's click on the ok' button

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.450 
after that let's click on the ok' button
and<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.390> canvas<00:00:30.810> will<00:00:30.990> open<00:00:31.260> up<00:00:31.380> before<00:00:32.130> we

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
and the canvas will open up before we

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.160 
and the canvas will open up before we
get<00:00:32.550> started<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.329> should<00:00:33.360> know<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.989> when

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
get started you should know that when

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.200 
get started you should know that when
making<00:00:34.500> an<00:00:34.620> animation<00:00:34.980> GIMP<00:00:35.730> would<00:00:35.910> think<00:00:36.120> of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
making an animation GIMP would think of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.060 
making an animation GIMP would think of
every<00:00:36.600> layer<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> document<00:00:37.079> as<00:00:37.680> an

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
every layer in the document as an

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.850 
every layer in the document as an
animation<00:00:38.489> frame<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.899> every<00:00:40.170> frame<00:00:40.379> there

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
animation frame so for every frame there

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.619 
animation frame so for every frame there
should<00:00:41.129> be<00:00:41.250> corresponding<00:00:41.969> layers<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
should be corresponding layers in the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.319 
should be corresponding layers in the
document<00:00:43.140> therefore<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.430> will<00:00:44.520> type<00:00:44.789> each<00:00:45.000> and

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
document therefore we will type each and

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.819 
document therefore we will type each and
every<00:00:45.629> word<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.050> sentence<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
every word of the sentence in a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.979 
every word of the sentence in a
different<00:00:47.160> layer<00:00:47.390> so<00:00:48.390> let's<00:00:48.420> move<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
different layer so let's move to the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.979 
different layer so let's move to the
tool<00:00:49.260> box<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.739> pick<00:00:50.039> up<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.399> text<00:00:50.760> tool<00:00:51.030> now

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
tool box and pick up the text tool now

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.840 
tool box and pick up the text tool now
let's<00:00:52.230> move<00:00:52.379> back<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.829> canvas<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.489> create

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
let's move back to the canvas and create

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.880 
let's move back to the canvas and create
the<00:00:54.000> text<00:00:54.329> box<00:00:54.539> by<00:00:54.780> simply<00:00:55.170> clicking<00:00:55.350> over

animation again and again over here you

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.479 
animation again and again over here you
have<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.690> delay<00:02:51.170> between<00:02:51.590> frames<00:02:51.980> option

what<00:02:53.060> this<00:02:53.239> will<00:02:53.420> do<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:53.570> set<00:02:53.959> all<00:02:54.170> of<00:02:54.200> the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
what this will do is set all of the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.440 
what this will do is set all of the
frames<00:02:54.739> in<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.130> animation<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.820> a<00:02:55.850> particular

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
frames in the animation to a particular

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.750 
frames in the animation to a particular
time<00:02:56.720> frame<00:02:56.750> according<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.799> the<00:02:57.950> value<00:02:58.280> we<00:02:58.489> put

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
time frame according to the value we put

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.080 
time frame according to the value we put
here<00:02:59.320> 1000<00:03:00.320> milliseconds<00:03:00.890> equals<00:03:01.400> one<00:03:01.610> second

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
here 1000 milliseconds equals one second

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.300 
here 1000 milliseconds equals one second
so<00:03:02.600> let's<00:03:02.780> change<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.260> value<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.530> three<00:03:04.010> five

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
so let's change the value to three five

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.420 
so let's change the value to three five
four<00:03:04.640> over<00:03:05.090> here<00:03:05.360> after<00:03:05.600> that<00:03:06.500> let's<00:03:07.040> click<00:03:07.310> on
