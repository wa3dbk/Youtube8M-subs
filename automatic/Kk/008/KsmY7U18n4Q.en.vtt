00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello everyone, this is a review of 1000 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.040
 today I continue to heading 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.110
 origami and I want to show you this 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.660
 interesting 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:17.670
 how such an interesting envelope is 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.230
 envelope surprise here such an hour plan 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.720
 I'll show you how to do it, that is 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.859
 so lush open let's say here 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.890
 can I put something 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.410
 the question then an example of candy put here 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.059
 Now I will show you how to make such 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.059
 envelope here you can put all that 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.500
 it pleases us to do a little 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.910
 need a square piece of paper 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.940
 initially you will need to divide it into 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.149
 three stripes that is more accurate to make a line 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:57.770
 3 line I will do these lines here 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:01:02.149
 this way you can measure with a ruler 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.149
 fact faster on can guys 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.079
 and it will also be great not to open and we 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.079
 done now we neatly 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:44.000
 we got 3 mini 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.759
 so what about these all origami and 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.409
 many others can be seen on the channel in 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.320
 Origami heading a lot 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:56.229
 diverse who did not look like this 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:58.100
 did everything to see now 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.390
 this little corner 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.390
 here to this corner 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.760
 now this arc 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.120
 to this, that is, we will find with you 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.120
 Centre 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:38.250
 unfolded found a center here 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:44.220
 now we will need this and the bottom 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:47.940
 here's the side to this line 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:53.220
 turn more precisely on this here 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.980
 this here to this line so that we have 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.410
 it turns out 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:04.310
 will turn out so we will turn over 9 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.310
 square 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:19.530
 itâ€™s like that 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.530
 9 squares here center 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.100
 Further 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.810
 wrap one side 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:48.680
 and in such a way that we have here 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:56.450
 it was like this to see four on this 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:04:01.120
 here's the side to be laid even smoother 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.120
 we should have such a preparation 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:15.070
 then turned over and now here 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.070
 this corner is just like we did 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:32.180
 look carefully what is not clear 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:40.900
 rewind and also respect turned over 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:43.900
 and roughly so clockwise 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.900
 So 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.490
 listen here 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:11.350
 trimmed here now we came out here 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:18.080
 look like youtube some kind of icon 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:20.750
 you can then drag it so here on this 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:28.910
 lines here may me 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:36.620
 it will be necessary in such a way that 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:42.190
 we got here like this now 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.190
 Turn things up 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:06:01.599
 so now this corner turned here 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.599
 this line 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:15.409
 we wrap it up and thatâ€™s what happened 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:18.430
 This is such a star is now possible 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:20.930
 will be the same look that is can 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.659
 we unfold here when we have 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.639
 such a pocket goes for our 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:33.279
 some surprise gift 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:39.229
 let's say we put jewelry here so you 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:42.080
 put in center shut down here 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:47.870
 It turns out such corners 4 things to us 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:50.270
 need to be here the center once persuaded 2 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:55.599
 corner alarm 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.599
 and 4 corner here in the pocket offended and 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:08.979
 Here we have such a one 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:08.979
 envelope surprise give it open 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:18.500
