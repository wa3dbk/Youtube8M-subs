logged into the game I think that's what
most<00:02:20.980> people<00:02:21.220> are<00:02:21.280> going<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.460> end<00:02:21.580> up<00:02:21.670> spending

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
was actually hilarious because we had

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.680 
was actually hilarious because we had
two<00:02:54.850> healers<00:02:55.150> come<00:02:55.570> and<00:02:55.870> they<00:02:56.500> both<00:02:56.650> died<00:02:57.690> so

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
that made that fight a little more

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.470 
that made that fight a little more
stressful<00:03:00.220> than<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.640> had<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.940> be<00:03:00.970> but<00:03:01.270> it<00:03:01.390> was

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
stressful than it had to be but it was

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.320 
stressful than it had to be but it was
you<00:03:01.780> know<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:01.930> was<00:03:02.200> still<00:03:02.440> fun<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:06.970> think<00:03:07.000> by

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
you know it was still fun and I think by

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.470 
you know it was still fun and I think by
far<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.900> old<00:03:08.200> 11-15<00:03:09.040> dungeon<00:03:09.490> is<00:03:09.730> my<00:03:10.000> favorite

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
far the old 11-15 dungeon is my favorite

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.830 
far the old 11-15 dungeon is my favorite
I<00:03:10.690> think<00:03:11.560> it's<00:03:11.680> copper<00:03:11.950> Bell<00:03:12.130> mines<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.850> think

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
I think it's copper Bell mines I think

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.600 
I think it's copper Bell mines I think
that<00:03:13.960> one<00:03:14.110> has<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.440> most<00:03:14.590> interesting<00:03:15.130> bosses

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
that one has the most interesting bosses

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.180 
that one has the most interesting bosses
so<00:03:15.820> far<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:19.320> for<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.410> people<00:03:20.530> like<00:03:20.800> me<00:03:21.010> that
