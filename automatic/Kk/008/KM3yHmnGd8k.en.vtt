Hi Bananas! It's November and that means Thanksgiving's
coming up

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.030
I want to talk to you today about how
thankful I am for my body

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.980
each of our body parts has a different
job to do and they're all equally

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.480
important

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.140
why don't we start at the top of our
bodies and go all the way down to the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.430
bottom and learn about all the amazing
things that our bodies can do

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.300
first we have our head

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.469
our head holds really important things
like our brains

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.390
that's what we used to remember things. On the outside of our head we have two

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.770
eyes to see

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:49.729
A nose to smell, two ears to hear and a
mouth to talk and giggle. *Laughs*

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.800
next we have our arms

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.609
I have shoulders that I can shrug like this. I have elbows that I can bend

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.840
I have hands that I can shake and ten
fingers that i can twinkle.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.400
The middle part of my body is
called my torso

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.820
there's lots of important muscles in
there that help me twist like this.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.220
*laughs*. That's so much fun

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.790
the last part of our body is our legs

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.159
I have two thighs that help me run really
fast and I have knees that i can bend

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.720
and bounce on

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.420
i also have two feet that help me jump
real high and then i have ten toes that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.290
I can twinkle

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.530
there are a lot of important parts in
our bodies

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:49.270
did you know that we have 206 bones? Some are really big and some are really small but

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.480
they're all really important. Remember
not everyone has the same type of body

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.960
we're all different and that's what
makes us so special

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.490
I'm thankful for the body that i do have
so i'm going to do my best to take

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.410
really good care of it

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.300
I hope you do the same. Thanks for
joining me today bananas

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.310
bye
