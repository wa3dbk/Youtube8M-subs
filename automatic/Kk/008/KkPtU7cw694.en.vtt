systems that I've developed are really a

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.469 
systems that I've developed are really a
range<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.430> system<00:01:35.789> to<00:01:35.939> try<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.149> accommodate

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
range of system to try and accommodate

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.170 
range of system to try and accommodate
all<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.320> different<00:01:37.649> surface<00:01:38.100> needs<00:01:38.369> from

so<00:01:44.159> either<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.880> strains<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.390> products<00:01:45.780> are

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
so either the strains of products are

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.200 
so either the strains of products are
designed<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:46.830> hope<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.190> there<00:01:47.429> is<00:01:47.670> one

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
designed I really hope that there is one

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.679 
designed I really hope that there is one
out<00:01:48.539> there<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.840> suits<00:01:49.440> your<00:01:49.619> needs
