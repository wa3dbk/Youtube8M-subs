00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.030
 when you ask for telepizza you just have to 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.560
 to arrive in a hurry the wait is over now 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.600
 we take you the new pizza three floors 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:28.110
 for 795 then a pair 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.210
 well I always always like to stay 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.660
 and pull and improve everything that is 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.050
 can a player at the end I think that he 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.879
 like to throw and well I tried once 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.470
 in the game was not a project shot 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.860
 but good at the end you have to try and 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.140
 keep trying I think there's 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.530
 people of all kinds that in the end all do not 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.050
 can forget the same and yes that is true 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.600
 that I at least noticed that the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.640
 people are not 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.440
 So happy to enter Europe and good 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.470
 I believe that 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.299
 It has been a year with many matches 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.299
 final I think one of the objectives 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.190
 it was this we have achieved and now what 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.220
 important is to add these last three 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.770
 matches to be fifth or what is 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.420
 what can be done already and we will do so 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.090
 that so good important now go 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.840
 adding that yes there are data 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.840
 in the end 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.450
 not the objectives I think main 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.610
 It was this one going another year to Europe 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.490
 then already enter champions twice 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.260
 followed for a team to for real 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.630
 it is very very difficult 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.120
 we know we have potential and we could 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.850
 have got but good hey always 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.220
 you can not have it as said there is that 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.160
 aspire to more but it could not be this 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.440
 year not yet not known to installed 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.380
 min emotion but good the important thing is 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.119
 keep working keep adding points 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.150
 and at the end of the year already asserted in what 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.370
 position we are not I think to demand 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.220
 they have to demand at the end 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.950
 if people do not demand you do not pressure you 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.009
 was not 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.180
 Well, I think that in the end it's pressure 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.819
 good you have to want to do more and 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.160
 get something more always and good 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.310
 this year I think it's like to be 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.410
 happy is true that good 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.930
 the game that we have given has not been with 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.209
 last year but good but not always 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.520
 you can win by playing well what 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.980
 important is to add always I said the 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.459
 war how to play and cut down have that are 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.310
 bullshit for me the important thing is to add 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.269
 and get the three points always if 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.599
 they are in a good time they lost 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.390
 against the lec from there but hey there is 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.180
 very difficult to win because because that 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.530
 pressure that I have is very difficult 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.900
 of overcoming them he saw a great athletic 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.560
 and good in Sevilla, then another 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.360
 very good season that is doing 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.670
 that are showing that if they are there 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.080
 is for something like that, it will be very good 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.270
 hard to beat them but good song 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.739
 there you are with very few points like that 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.890
 how good we will try until the 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.019
 end as always fight and fight until 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.090
 the end can not be new that people 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.290
 in the end he gives the most for that, not because 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.750
 fourth in Bilbao and good at 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.150
 final 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.810
 they are things that happen we spend 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.430
 now they are there that I believe that 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.800
 you have to assume that you are making a 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.580
 good season we have 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.610
 tried is very difficult to follow a 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.920
 good level two years in a row and I think 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.430
 that you have to settle where where 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.380
 we are and well then we have to play 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.440
 another opposing party is there that is 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.350
 very difficult but in the end it is 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.760
 another party via death is rather by 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.489
 the pride that for the points so 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.180
 good another very difficult game that I 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.180
 I think we can get it
