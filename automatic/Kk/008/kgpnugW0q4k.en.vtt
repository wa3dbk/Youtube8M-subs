00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
to evaporate all this moisture by

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.650 
to evaporate all this moisture by
sauteing<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.340> on<00:02:49.459> high<00:02:49.670> heat<00:02:49.700> after<00:02:50.209> they're

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
sauteing it on high heat after they're

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.870 
sauteing it on high heat after they're
softened<00:02:51.140> otherwise<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.280> dough<00:02:52.400> becomes<00:02:52.610> a

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
softened otherwise the dough becomes a

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.850 
softened otherwise the dough becomes a
little<00:02:53.209> too<00:02:53.360> sticky<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.049> be<00:02:54.350> difficult<00:02:54.590> to

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
little too sticky and be difficult to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.789 
little too sticky and be difficult to
roll<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.220> out<00:02:55.660> once<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:56.810> notice<00:02:57.019> that<00:02:57.440> all<00:02:57.650> the

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
roll it out once you notice that all the

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.190 
roll it out once you notice that all the
moisture<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.310> evaporated<00:02:58.750> I'm<00:02:59.750> going<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.049> add

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
moisture is evaporated I'm going to add

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.400

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
for the dough remember that we added

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.600 
for the dough remember that we added
some<00:04:02.540> salt<00:04:02.810> to<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.290> muli<00:04:03.440> mixture<00:04:03.890> so<00:04:04.130> add<00:04:04.310> in

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
just a little bit as I mentioned earlier

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.870 
just a little bit as I mentioned earlier
them<00:04:08.390> muli<00:04:09.170> already<00:04:09.560> has<00:04:09.830> some<00:04:10.100> moisture<00:04:10.640> so

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
them muli already has some moisture so

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.450 
them muli already has some moisture so
we<00:04:11.240> will<00:04:11.390> first<00:04:11.660> combine<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.740> dough<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.250> the

much<00:04:16.370> water<00:04:16.670> is<00:04:16.910> required<00:04:17.180> we<00:04:18.049> will<00:04:18.200> add<00:04:18.380> in

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
much water is required we will add in

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.450 
much water is required we will add in
more<00:04:18.970> add<00:04:19.970> in<00:04:20.210> some<00:04:20.420> water<00:04:23.110> add<00:04:24.110> it<00:04:24.950> in<00:04:25.100> little

more add in some water add it in little
at<00:04:25.550> a<00:04:25.610> time<00:04:25.900> you<00:04:26.900> don't<00:04:27.020> want<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.380> dough<00:04:27.530> to

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
at a time you don't want the dough to

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.400 
at a time you don't want the dough to
become<00:04:27.980> too<00:04:28.220> soggy

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
become too soggy

refrigerate for later use so let's begin
to<00:05:07.760> roll<00:05:07.910> the<00:05:08.120> dough<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:09.830> begin<00:05:10.070> making<00:05:10.280> the

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
to roll the dough to begin making the

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.160 
to roll the dough to begin making the
molle<00:05:10.700> paratha<00:05:11.030> I'm<00:05:11.330> gonna<00:05:11.570> flatten<00:05:11.900> the

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
molle paratha I'm gonna flatten the

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.240 
molle paratha I'm gonna flatten the
dough<00:05:12.200> and<00:05:12.620> dust<00:05:13.460> it<00:05:13.670> in<00:05:13.790> flour

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
dough and dust it in flour

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.590 
dough and dust it in flour
the<00:05:16.250> dough<00:05:16.430> will<00:05:16.670> be<00:05:16.820> a<00:05:16.850> little<00:05:17.150> sticky<00:05:17.450> so

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
the dough will be a little sticky so

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.390 
the dough will be a little sticky so
it's<00:05:17.960> important<00:05:18.440> to<00:05:18.500> dust<00:05:18.800> it<00:05:18.980> in<00:05:19.100> enough

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
it's important to dust it in enough

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.120 
it's important to dust it in enough
flour<00:05:19.730> apply<00:05:20.540> just<00:05:20.930> a<00:05:21.080> little<00:05:21.110> pressure<00:05:21.680> when

you<00:05:22.280> roll<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.760> dough<00:05:22.910> and<00:05:23.590> dust<00:05:24.590> it<00:05:24.770> back<00:05:24.920> and

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
you roll the dough and dust it back and

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.190 
you roll the dough and dust it back and
flour<00:05:25.340> again<00:05:25.670> so<00:05:25.970> it<00:05:26.090> doesn't<00:05:26.510> stick<00:05:26.870> to<00:05:27.110> the

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
flour again so it doesn't stick to the

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.550 
flour again so it doesn't stick to the
surface

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.890

cooking<00:07:07.379> time<00:07:07.589> is<00:07:07.829> less<00:07:08.069> than<00:07:08.249> 30<00:07:08.489> seconds<00:07:08.969> or

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:09.389 
cooking time is less than 30 seconds or

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:11.419 
cooking time is less than 30 seconds or
even<00:07:09.719> less<00:07:09.899> but<00:07:10.739> if<00:07:10.889> you've<00:07:11.009> rolled<00:07:11.219> it

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:11.429 
even less but if you've rolled it

00:07:11.429 --> 00:07:13.279 
even less but if you've rolled it
thicker<00:07:11.969> then<00:07:12.389> it<00:07:12.509> takes<00:07:12.749> a<00:07:12.899> little<00:07:13.049> while

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:13.289 
thicker then it takes a little while

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:15.039 
thicker then it takes a little while
longer

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:15.049 
longer

00:07:15.049 --> 00:07:18.049 
longer
make<00:07:16.049> sure<00:07:16.259> you<00:07:16.379> stack<00:07:16.709> the<00:07:16.949> Piratas<00:07:17.429> one<00:07:17.699> over

00:07:18.049 --> 00:07:18.059 
make sure you stack the Piratas one over

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:20.689 
make sure you stack the Piratas one over
the<00:07:18.179> other<00:07:18.209> so<00:07:19.199> this<00:07:19.379> creates<00:07:19.860> moisture<00:07:20.549> for

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 
the other so this creates moisture for

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:22.339 
the other so this creates moisture for
each<00:07:20.909> of<00:07:21.029> the<00:07:21.119> parathas<00:07:21.599> and<00:07:21.749> they<00:07:22.049> remain

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:22.349 
each of the parathas and they remain

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:29.870 
each of the parathas and they remain
soft<00:07:22.679> for<00:07:23.039> a<00:07:23.069> longer<00:07:23.399> time

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.340 

thus<00:07:30.880> pirata<00:07:31.240> tastes<00:07:31.660> delicious<00:07:32.020> with<00:07:32.320> a
