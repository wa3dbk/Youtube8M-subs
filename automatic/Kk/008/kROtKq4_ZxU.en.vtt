00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.500
 hello i am rijn and in this review 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.760
 we look at a very powerful battery there 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.670
 screw 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.210
 rheumatic knock drill it is the u 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.359
 neomax van bosch well this is the woods 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.670
 unio up and this is the real powerhouse 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.619
 powerhouse on lithium ion 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.090
 boxes will run for a while because yes 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.470
 on the outside is a nice suitcase 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.970
 but the see it you so much 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.920
 here we have two instructions for use 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.449
 occupy one for charging it 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.980
 device and of course one 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:35.760
 operating instructions for the device 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.620
 self 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.089
 then there is also something in the box 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.409
 drills there 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.210
 well is always handy you see right away 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:43.949
 that you are talking about one here 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.769
 sds connection and that is natural 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.540
 not very strange because this is the device 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.089
 and that looks cool, but it is 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.760
 tough because it is 18 volts 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.049
 one and a half amps well that lithium ion who 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.210
 you prefer that power that becomes 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:59.070
 given by this lithium ion battery 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.010
 that look very easy this way too 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.540
 picks up and therefore the setup now and then 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.220
 you see just already you can do this with 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.670
 hold two hands and that is not 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.189
 for nothing 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.040
 because it is not only you can do the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.930
 so simply screw in the screws 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.370
 screws screw machine because he is 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.080
 very suitable for me is the door 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.810
 extremely suitable also just for 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.610
 farmers and last but not least 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.620
 to beat and he does 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.260
 actually our sometime pneumatically 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.500
 So well that indicates that you are also with 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.320
 a drill that runs on a battery 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.290
 You can do pretty solid farmer work 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.640
 because now matisse impact drills yes that is 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.570
 of course the summit that wants 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.130
 you actually all 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.750
 well take a look at it again 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.860
 the service that they all do not 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.810
 complicated here you have of course 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.590
 button with which the direction of rotation can be adjusted 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.690
 adjust 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.960
 with this you turn it on and off and with this 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.360
 you give from right here I go 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.830
 screws or I'll go on and on 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.260
 put this button on this side 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.600
 we will also beat and then in particular 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.430
 pneumatic well then you see another one here 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.530
 very handy connections here you can 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.570
 they simply SDS connection SDS-Quick 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.710
 connection then you just stop there 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.510
 quickly 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.009
 well that is also included 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.110
 them when you need something 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.840
 like a drill well you see here too 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.590
 all the connections with the same it is 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.810
 sds-quick connection to the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.180
 also great you can buy all there 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.400
 are still some separate bits with one 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.840
 screw in bits 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.610
 so there you have in any case 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.050
 for nature you can get started right away 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.060
 what I actually want to leave 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.950
 that is when you turn it on 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.660
 that is just being enlightened and 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.390
 the light that sits here and that shines 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.170
 exactly neat here where you 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.810
 are at work 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.650
 so that is also very well thought out 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.410
 through forest 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.110
 in short, a real powerhouse even 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.230
 pneumatic drilling and all that in one 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.230
 battery
