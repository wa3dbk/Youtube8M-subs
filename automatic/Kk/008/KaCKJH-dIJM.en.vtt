00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
label with the BMP 21 is really

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.940 
label with the BMP 21 is really
straightforward<00:02:27.940> we<00:02:28.940> just<00:02:29.120> take<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.480> unit

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
straightforward we just take the unit

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.830 
straightforward we just take the unit
end<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.220> text<00:02:31.580> but<00:02:32.270> you<00:02:32.360> like<00:02:32.540> on<00:02:32.720> the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
end of the text but you like on the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.790 
end of the text but you like on the
label<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:37.990> once<00:02:38.990> you've<00:02:39.170> got<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.380> text<00:02:39.680> in

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
label and once you've got the text in

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.310 
label and once you've got the text in
hit<00:02:40.130> print<00:02:41.560> your<00:02:42.560> labels<00:02:42.860> printed<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.340> side

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
hit print your labels printed the side

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.309 
hit print your labels printed the side
and<00:02:45.400> once<00:02:46.400> it's<00:02:46.610> printed<00:02:46.790> we<00:02:47.750> can<00:02:47.900> chop<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.140> off

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
and once it's printed we can chop it off

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.020 
and once it's printed we can chop it off
using<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.800> paddles<00:02:49.160> on<00:02:49.370> either<00:02:49.520> side<00:02:49.819> of<00:02:49.850> the

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
using the paddles on either side of the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.530 
using the paddles on either side of the
printer

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
printer

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.170 
printer
so<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:51.020> chop<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.380> label<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.820> label<00:02:52.850> is

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
so you chop the label and the label is

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.729 
so you chop the label and the label is
returned<00:02:53.510> by<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.780> printer<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.470> doesn't

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
returned by the printer so it doesn't

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.100

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.990 

this<00:04:25.080> shows<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.320> range<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:25.950> cable<00:04:26.700> markers

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
this shows the range of cable markers

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.090 
this shows the range of cable markers

the self-laminating cable marker but in

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.190 
the self-laminating cable marker but in
addition<00:04:35.130> you<00:04:35.490> can<00:04:35.610> also<00:04:35.790> produce<00:04:36.210> hatred

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
addition you can also produce hatred

through the through the printer and then

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.580 
through the through the printer and then
you<00:04:44.640> pop<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.150> slave<00:04:45.360> up<00:04:45.600> and<00:04:45.870> pop<00:04:46.350> it<00:04:46.380> over

you pop the slave up and pop it over

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.440 
you pop the slave up and pop it over
your<00:04:46.800> cable<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.400> then<00:04:47.790> heat<00:04:47.970> ring<00:04:48.240> into
