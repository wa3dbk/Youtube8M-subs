00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
idea what the hell that thing is its a

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.980 
idea what the hell that thing is its a
bright<00:01:05.089> UFO<00:01:06.070> flying<00:01:07.070> disc<00:01:07.600> as<00:01:08.600> well<00:01:08.630> looks

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
bright UFO flying disc as well looks

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:17.740 
bright UFO flying disc as well looks
like

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.950 

that's<00:01:18.470> probably<00:01:18.650> focus<00:01:19.250> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.870 

right<00:01:25.590> dude<00:01:25.799> about<00:01:26.659> I'll<00:01:27.659> say<00:01:28.049> 800<00:01:28.710> times<00:01:29.549> zoom

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
right dude about I'll say 800 times zoom

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.510 
right dude about I'll say 800 times zoom
that's<00:01:30.360> why<00:01:30.479> I'm<00:01:30.540> guessing<00:01:31.190> it's<00:01:32.190> moving

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that's why I'm guessing it's moving

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.830 
that's why I'm guessing it's moving
toward<00:01:33.030> me<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:34.140> which<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.740> am<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.840> which

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
toward me with which I am in which

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.690 
toward me with which I am in which
director<00:01:37.580> that's<00:01:38.580> north<00:01:40.159> moving<00:01:41.159> toward<00:01:41.520> me

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
director that's north moving toward me

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.330 
director that's north moving toward me
