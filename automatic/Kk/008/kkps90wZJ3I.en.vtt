00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:12.259
 ruler and such a poet was first shown 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.680
 to the public in January of this year 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.519
 at the exhibition from the network of gas stations 2008 plus census 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:19.680
 presently 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.769
 it consists of only two models 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.259
 with a screen diagonal of 15 and 17 inches 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.569
 a little later should appear 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.839
 miniature eleven inch 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:29.659
 models 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.519
 today on the agenda we have tag fights 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.390
 510 by the way the device has already appeared 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.160
 in Moscow retail 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.240
 very interesting laptop design 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.080
 after boring conflict by ege and 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.490
 pretty clumsy and rulers or otherwise 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.600
 lassi 3 thousand know i'm a poet just a ray 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.140
 light in the dark kingdom interesting 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.130
 color range unusual shape 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.070
 metal panel enclosures 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.030
 around the keyboard and with the touchpad g and 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.030
 perhaps the most pleasant element 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.290
 clearance cover 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.870
 notice no gloss 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.380
 which sometimes get carried away 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.410
 laptop makers instead 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.490
 this interesting embossed texture 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.480
 imitating rude york 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.520
 looks great on your 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.780
 the score is even better and the most important as opposed to 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.359
 row of word cover 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.819
 fingerprints on this surface and 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:25.109
 prominent at all 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.419
 and even small scratches are lost on 

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:29.889
 background embossed pattern live beautifully 

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:33.300
 practical successful find designers 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.250
 The keyboard is more than that 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.220
 which are used by the archdiocese very 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.090
 nicely 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.860
 but the layout of the r that and the course 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.220
 and although akaev keys hate basis 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.830
 but the segment here is much more 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.820
 are accustomed 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.170
 all right he was handed the upper hand 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.979
 what was the shift behind 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.770
 function keys 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.119
 above the keyboard is behind the valuable 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.539
 multimedia control panel 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.289
 the function to her right is conspicuous 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.870
 long volume control 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.000
 near a small box 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.660
 switching mode of panels 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.850
 thanks to this, it was avoided 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.539
 too crowded buttons 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.079
 basically social management things not 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:18.879
 are unique 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.459
 you can meet him in others 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.549
 manufacturers 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.749
 yuri bank flight dushanbe 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:27.739
 however, this idea seems to be implemented here. 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.489
 most competently 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.959
 in the same year boldly logic 40 let's say social 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.230
 You can't call the unit convenient, but here everything is 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.230
 just convenient and understandable 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:43.039
 d pay attention 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:45.769
 at the bottom of the werniche half he 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.339
 there is another interesting example 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.479
 LED charge indicator 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:52.900
 battery I'll be one and a thing 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.310
 sorry just turned off 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.990
 condition it does not work because sometimes 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.450
 it is convenient to know the battery charge is not 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.899
 including devices 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.069
 move on to learning the system 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.909
 except for a noticeable pair of speakers on the sides a 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:06.950
 such a row of thieves 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.260
 there are a couple of front speakers 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.549
 hiding in the base of the lid 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.039
 a subwoofer lurking on the bottom 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:15.599
 eventually came forward 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.319
 by the way this is almost the only 15 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.870
 inch laptop with such a serious 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.969
 concessions 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.419
 Of course this is high-quality technology 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.179
 acoustics and white hare 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:26.959
 its volume is enough to 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.869
 example to watch movies almost in 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:29.959
 any conditions 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.089
 on the front edge of the body we see two 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.979
 microphone 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.329
 in fact they form in the sphere he 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.609
 microphone reflects records not only 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.939
 volume but source position 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.659
 sound settled here 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.159
 infrared port 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.329
 card reader and slider controls 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.329
 wireless interfaces 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.029
 The first faces of the case contain an audio jack. 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:59.759
 1 if the sports output from the video is by the way not 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.049
 very well its location as well 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.069
 modem connector and actually approx 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.179
 on the left you can find in 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.149
 year power mains plug hole for 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:12.299
 heated air outlet and system 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.319
 cooling output to an external monitor 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.049
 just analogue digital here to 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.620
 Unfortunately there are not two more Libyan 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.750
 a total of three 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.420
 Baer Baer and full sized pci connectors 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.420
 express card 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.009
 for the day there is almost nothing behind 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:31.659
 except for the above 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:33.819
 battery charge indicator this 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:35.479
 due to roof structure 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.449
 being open it is completely 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.309
 obstructs busy so post 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:42.900
 here something useful is simply not reasonable 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.120
 to the design of the power supply designers 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.140
 also not very traditional 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.690
 it is quite unusual in shape and 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.640
 In addition, the power indicator is combined with 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.970
 company logo or logo 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.889
 highlighted 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.270
 on the bottom is provided 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.629
 a lot of vent 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:00.499
 holes 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:02.159
 more than half of them will remain 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:04.330
 open in any conditions 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.409
 Of course, if you do not put the laptop on 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:07.860
 pillow or boat 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.539
 here is located just in Kabula 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.159
 the capacity of the batteries was not forbidden but its 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:14.569
 quite enough for home 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.569
 multimedia notebook 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.759
 finally the far corner is 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.129
 the subwoofer is not playing 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:25.860
 last role in case they are embedded 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.129
 acoustics 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:30.789
 Finally, we will look at the implementation of the new 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.059
 technology cutout exit recognition 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:35.110
 user faces 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.129
 First you need to register in 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.699
 the program that takes literally 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.499
 seconds 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:43.499
 now logged out 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.059
 here 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:51.729
 n enough to remove the hand from the face of the warrior 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.199
 The CIS will probably recognize the user and 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.509
 admits are being conducted in fact of course u 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.159
 we would be the perfect case did not change 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:02.299
 the procurement report of the head of the corner angle at which 

00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:03.550
 light falls 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.919
 In practice, the work in the UFO and SFC is very 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.289
 highly dependent on these factors so 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.129
 hopes for impeccable action 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:12.870
 this system is not worth it but it has 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.770
 other useful features except 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.330
 proper recognition 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.199
 first all people trying to get 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:21.669
 access to the computer your absence will be 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.680
 photographed in the second alas reefs if 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.090
 automatic situation 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.960
 out of sight of services in case 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.120
 user and not at the computer and 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.430
 on the contrary you will not be thrown out of the system 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.619
 if you are watching a movie
