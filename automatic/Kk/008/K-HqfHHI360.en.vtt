00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:06.090
 hello today we are going to rejuvenate a plant 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.800
 but also 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.080
 this sings we have here as 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.980
 it is called money plant in the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.230
 conditions that are yellow 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.390
 because some branches are already dry 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.770
 blooming of very sad and I want you to 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.900
 notice to be here 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.150
 she is a son of the previous plant 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.369
 that you have seen fix the difference 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.900
 in the size of the sheet is worth and the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.960
 flowering is much prettier more 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.149
 striking 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.810
 how we do it is a very operation 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.760
 simple 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.080
 in what we know as multiplication 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.080
 meditative let's listen 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.390
 we will try not to have flowers because 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.890
 the pieces that have flowers are more 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.890
 weak and it costs them more work 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.430
 we believe convenient in this 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.430
 more or less case I cut is up 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.329
 in the next video explain that there 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.800
 to take the scissors but this is now the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.240
 world will know us 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.240
 we will take several etc 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.250
 without using several shortages at the same time 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.840
 just because one only tends to dry 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.350
 we put 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.350
 together 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.909
 ah 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.860
 the next step will be to get the 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.960
 flower pot that uses a substrate 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.119
 very simple based on mud so 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.280
 very easy we can find in any 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.229
 even supermarket is not necessary to be 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.330
 a stratum 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.640
 special agreement 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.659
 then we will see what 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.600
 we will do is eliminate all the leaves 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.429
 of test the part that is going to be 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.429
 buried they set minutes 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.990
 this would be the outline below 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.780
 we make a little hole with our finger 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.500
 a little hole and we put the first one already 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.110
 we have the first ones that we already removed 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.050
 we continue following the same 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.730
 we will always try to have a bud 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.520
 u2 minimum so that here you can take 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.720
 the roots the cutting as I said what 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.720
 let's put all together 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.700
 Well, we are already finishing 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.430
 I'm practically going to put this last 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.200
 that Egypt, as I said, I'm going to cut it 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.440
 we're always going to try 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.810
 try to cut under a yolk 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.080
 I repeat slowly to do the last and 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.299
 we eliminate the leaves never between reid 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:52.730
 leaf when making cutting because 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:56.120
 it rot and lose the cutting the 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.000
 force more or less like this would it be going to 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.160
 be the last and notice that you do not use 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.910
 no type of hormones 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.910
 nothing 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:15.090
 that way the plant would stay and in a couple of 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.760
 weeks that a woman like that would spend 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.140
 to buy us 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.420
 with this channel it has two weeks and almost 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.690
 the roots do not want to have it take but 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.260
 it's almost treated 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.860
 would be the final result and there we have 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.860
 our collection 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.480
 achieved in a very short time 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:42.590
 when we must perform this operation 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.690
 the fall and spring are the best 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.790
 times of the year when it starts 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.790
 the cold is no longer advisable 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.780
 let's have a temperature 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.220
 we will study 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.220
 but what goes wrong
