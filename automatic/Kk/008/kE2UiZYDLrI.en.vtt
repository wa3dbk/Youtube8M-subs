00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:14.880
 but in this new tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:18.189
 teach how to put the one that has vegeta 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.740
 717 in his series of plant planet what 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.529
 first thing they have to do is 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.599
 download is what you think in the 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.630
 description I will leave you a link that will 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.220
 will send a video to youtube or about 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.119
 how to download the walk launcher if it is 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.830
 that do not have it 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.470
 olancho already after having seen the 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.170
 video go to the wind will leave them in the 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.460
 description of the video and then it's a 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.610
 Mediafire page is for what it is in 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.220
 the texture for for maikel because it says 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.860
 a 0.9 answered by now still not 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.470
 the original since it is the very toxic not 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.720
 we are in 12 as it is original that 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.860
 I will make another good video after having 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.800
 downloaded the file 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.050
 the doubling chair and just that 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.330
 arribita above the ce says mike el 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.430
 period of the ce there is a small key 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.700
 If you can see it, I'll do it 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.400
 I'm going to mark it like this with the Angelus 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.680
 you click 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.680
 and give you options requires restart 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.630
 they give you click they do not give you the says packages 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.630
 of textures 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.750
 the select 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.740
 Look for a way to get rid of what is 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.380
 the lucky file expander that is called 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.960
 the texture is normal in two 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.870
 discards that falls apart as they see me only 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.070
 I have short and when the 0.9 point zero 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.070
 points and click 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.969
 automatically its texture is 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.969
 installed they give back 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.049
 and wait for the moment as it ends 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.610
 to put it, then you work a little bit and 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.610
 then it can work 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.850
 well I do not know if you answer me in the block 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.230
 launcher but that's a bug of mine is that a 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.170
 you are going to work well 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.069
 as you see here it has already opened 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.069
 oh and let's hope 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.480
 If that seems like this they have to give it in 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.480
 return to normal 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.340
 good not to be so much roll and you 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.350
 Once downloaded the application is given 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.270
 there where I explain them and then 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.780
 Well, they will have their textures package 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.450
 already installed as they have it then 7 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.090
 717 in what is pc already going to have 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.550
 in his hand psuv approach 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.930
 let's see if you can not let's do 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.020
 internal try to see if they can 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.090
 catch up to see 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.440
 keep on saying if they look like 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.390
 is egyptus is given in return to 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.930
 normal are going to come out and then what 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.930
 they believe again 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.410
 good guys it seems the texture of the 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.310
 play on any 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.800
 world 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.410
 or april 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.360
 a boy so I'm going to leave you guys 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.560
 already discover how all things are 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.560
 how to rob boys 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.400
 and I have the sword the eggs and everything 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.200
 good until here the video I hope you 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.390
 I have served 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.050
 at the beginning when they start not 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.050
 appear like this 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.120
 good to you not to appear like this already 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.190
 you can use your texture as 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.930
 you want, you can play 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.040
 normally with the texture of vegeta 777 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.620
 well that gives me this because my 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.910
 phone is a bit bad so up 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.910
