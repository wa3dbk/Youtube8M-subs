first one in the book no most of the
time<00:00:07.890> its<00:00:08.309> rhythm<00:00:08.670> that<00:00:08.940> causes<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.450> problem

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
time its rhythm that causes the problem

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.499 
time its rhythm that causes the problem
of<00:00:09.990> this<00:00:10.639> you've<00:00:11.639> got<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.790> be<00:00:11.910> really<00:00:12.300> careful

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
of this you've got to be really careful

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.150 
of this you've got to be really careful
because<00:00:12.780> it's<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.049> syncopated<00:00:13.679> rhythm<00:00:13.950> for<00:00:14.070> you

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
because it's a syncopated rhythm for you

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.970 
because it's a syncopated rhythm for you
you<00:00:14.490> do<00:00:14.610> actually<00:00:14.880> understand<00:00:15.299> worth<00:00:15.540> beats

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
you do actually understand worth beats

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:35.680 
you do actually understand worth beats
for<00:00:18.380> there's<00:00:19.380> one<00:00:19.590> marking<00:00:20.160> one<00:00:20.789> two<00:00:21.600> three

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.229 

one<00:00:36.690> two<00:00:36.719> three<00:00:38.840> four<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.170> one<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.219> two<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
one two three four and one and two and

one two three four and one and two and
three<00:00:43.219> four<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.820> happens<00:00:45.360> all<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.840> way

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
three four and that happens all the way

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.610 
three four and that happens all the way
through<00:00:46.640> under<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> last<00:00:47.940> bar<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> last

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
through under the last bar and the last

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.380 
through under the last bar and the last
bar<00:00:53.480> everything<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:56.059> mostly<00:00:57.059> only<00:00:57.149> off

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
bar everything is and mostly only off

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.000 
bar everything is and mostly only off
beats

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.640 

one<00:01:03.239> two<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.600> three<00:01:05.409> and<00:01:05.680> four<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:07.530> I'll<00:01:08.530> go

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
one two and three and four and I'll go

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.050 
one two and three and four and I'll go
through<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:08.979> rhythm<00:01:09.220> anyway<00:01:09.490> but<00:01:09.700> that's<00:01:09.909> so

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
through the rhythm anyway but that's so

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.700 
through the rhythm anyway but that's so
you<00:01:10.119> see<00:01:10.450> how<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:10.750> looks<00:01:10.780> when<00:01:11.200> it's<00:01:11.380> up<00:01:11.470> going

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
you see how it looks when it's up going

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:34.590 
you see how it looks when it's up going
down<00:01:11.920> so<00:01:12.190> one<00:01:12.490> two<00:01:32.759> right<00:01:33.759> that's<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.390> rhythm

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
down so one two right that's the rhythm

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.810 
down so one two right that's the rhythm
that<00:01:35.110> happens<00:01:35.440> all<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.590> way<00:01:35.770> through<00:01:36.100> if<00:01:36.640> I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
that happens all the way through if I

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.020 
that happens all the way through if I
clap<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.240> last<00:01:37.479> line<00:01:38.729> including<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:39.789> last

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
clap the last line including the last

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:58.889 
clap the last line including the last
bar<00:01:40.300> one<00:01:41.259> -<00:01:56.940> that's<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.119> body<00:01:58.270> usually<00:01:58.659> gets

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
bar one - that's the body usually gets

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:05.490 
bar one - that's the body usually gets
everybody<00:01:59.320> I'll<00:01:59.440> do<00:01:59.560> it<00:01:59.619> again<00:02:04.500> everything

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
everybody I'll do it again everything

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.660 
everybody I'll do it again everything
comes<00:02:05.739> in<00:02:05.920> between<00:02:06.280> which<00:02:06.459> is<00:02:06.489> what

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
comes in between which is what

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.780 
comes in between which is what
syncopation<00:02:07.270> is<00:02:07.390> all<00:02:07.509> about
