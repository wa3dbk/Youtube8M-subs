00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello people so long he is a star 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.110
 wars mmog again on santorin new 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.300
 Supply base of the clones 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.970
 yes and I now directly times as I 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.210
 this time on year vegetation 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:27.380
 largely be waived forward a 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.400
 River has a lot of vegetation and rocks 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.470
 So the whole is in two stages 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.380
 the one is here in trier 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.110
 this is always seen here, we can 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.230
 good times seen here can be window 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.180
 with technology in between and that 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.720
 overall picture of it was just rather flat 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.220
 So dark and helga change year 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.240
 I also looks pretty good always 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:55.200
 there are really brand new ones 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.090
 the deck are marks racing 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.980
 lost just talk 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:05.640
 astro people stop and he sounded 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:08.550
 sitting here and then there is a 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.830
 was yes that's a little bit 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:21.720
 technikum on it and then you can already see 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:22.610
 how is a quarter and of course that 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.780
 again 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.590
 I must go shortly to turn on the light, the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.560
 By the way, as well as you can see 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.690
 a certain structure in the ground 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.220
 center it is here a series dark gray 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.360
 2 x 2 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:45.270
 here you can see the front told us again 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.619
 with a bit of technology , here it is me 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.369
 Unfortunately, I did not find any part of that 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.630
 the right thing to do so take synonymous 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.990
 I think the only flaw in the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.610
 Base 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.470
 that was that the thing is this 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.450
 staircase so in the staircase with it 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.270
 that 's not it 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:09.890
 so you can the expensive again you can 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:13.550
 has to turn on us so we come 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.570
 to see someone's bathing is here 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.920
 Above many tv technology on it has one 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:25.850
 large satellite dish with technical room 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:31.360
 one pilot with the other speaks yes 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.360
 Consoles and defense business 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:41.630
 technology here so big and antennae 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:46.330
 that was the roof on this page 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.330
 is not always there 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:56.890
 so it looks better there is also in peace 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:00.130
 a few pipes a pipe still crates goes 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.340
 it up the stairs and there again 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:08.100
 my revolving doors 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:11.850
 yes and then here is a snack machine 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.989
 environment day something he sits here 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.239
 Talk to him and he leans over 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.080
 the railing their why is the two 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:24.480
 tomorrow goes to work without employment 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.480
 well, no plants break 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.560
 No 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:40.780
 wanted to do so once you see page 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.550
 was very late because I knew 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.060
 just not what I'm looking for on this manko 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.520
 in the meantime because of this one 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.280
 gastank itan with so rounds after 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.450
 above everything or a space stations though 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.700
 In the end, I have one for that 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.900
 communication or supply basis 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.650
 decided 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.310
 That's just how it looks good, we see 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.220
 here are two stages 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.720
 then there are many more 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.720
 You can also open Christians here 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.890
 only after droids interface to 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.020
 Recognition then still different boxes 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.380
 and your own grave with a ticket as 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:23.050
 just a small bridge stop here 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.540
 in the stairwell also leads again so 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.410
 That's it from the outside now 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.750
 Let's go to the roof is off now 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.980
 also great to see the inside like 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.000
 you can see here are the two 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.430
 doors with the gear then here completely 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.070
 many computers and weapons holder 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.790
 of course, here are the individual sitting 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.220
 clones on the computers which puts it 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.080
 has 50 gave 1 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.220
 He has a good moment tree with him 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.770
 track down a bit 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.290
 Well then yes, the coal projects in order 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.960
 the middle lodge projection with the 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:02.050
 Studies are therefore political and here 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:08.310
 the windows out with a Stammtisch 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.310
 the box and here a computer and the 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.980
 really likes 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.060
 that was actually already from the inside of the 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:23.050
 has one supply base the next 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.340
 mock will be an apocalypse yes there would 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.060
 you have to catch art 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.440
 can be happy 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.150
 yes, if you liked that, you can 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.410
 like to live a thumb on it 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.470
 I would think so about it myself 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.690
 Followed and if you still ideas for mox 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.150
 I will write off what I am writing 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.920
 I can do that but that was now 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.210
 enough of me until next time 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.210
 I 'm looking forward to it and bye
