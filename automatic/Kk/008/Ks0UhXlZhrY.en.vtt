00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.799
 sound to talk about an exercise that 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.990
 everyone is very common 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.930
 but it is a very complete exercise and that 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.939
 helps some parts of the body to 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.980
 improve your physical condition how is 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.930
 this in tajonar 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.920
 good morning listening to you conduit 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.570
 say hello 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.300
 if you're right today let's talk a 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.699
 little lizards opus shops not the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.400
 we know how well you say is one of the 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.780
 most common secrets for many vessels 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.150
 I think it is one of the most complete 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.650
 well doing lizards that 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.390
 were great benefits since 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.309
 they involve many muscles at the same 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.680
 time but for this you have to know 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.360
 do them correctly has many 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.980
 benefits as we are criticizing the 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.750
 first is that you can do it where 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.449
 you do not need sophisticated equipment 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.280
 indicated only your own weight and in 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.080
 where is the posts this is a 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.549
 excellent exercise because you work 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.979
 several muscles at the same time 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:03.170
 mainly the chest the shoulders in 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.059
 sad the back in what is the core 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.280
 as we had talked about that is to say 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.650
 the lower back the abdomen and the beginnings 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.450
 all this muscle activity makes the 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.950
 heart work harder to pump 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.780
 blood to all the muscles that you are 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.610
 working so it increases your 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.650
 breathing then that raises your rhythm 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.020
 metabolic and enters suits' and while 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.820
 recovers which contributes a lot to 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.950
 weight loss do push - ups 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.620
 strengthen your wrists your forearms 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.780
 Ficod your arms and your shoulders 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.790
 will help reduce bone loss and 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.680
 they cause stronger bones and mind 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.420
 then it helps you too much the 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.430
 joints and it's not important 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.010
 better mention some feet so that 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.910
 we can do lizards very well 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.320
 initiative that comes with a good 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.930
 plant we have to be aligned 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.850
 totally with the arms in up 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.290
 then at the beginning we have to be a 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.390
 good position with the head raised 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.980
 moving down and with the head 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.240
 raised yours aligned with the 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.040
 back that's the main thing 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.870
 another important point that we have to 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.700
 have hands up to our 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.320
 shoulders are not going to throw their hands 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.060
 up or hands more work is 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.800
 very important that the final basis to 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.810
 all the regions another important point 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.030
 in the thumbs the first ones have to 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.530
 to be inward you have to rotate the no 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.590
 you have to do it because inside neither 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.090
 the thumbs the thumbs in 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.310
 the hands at the height of my shoulders 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.290
 to start when we go down to start 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.480
 It will be lizard not worth it when going down 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.130
 we raise the shoulders is important that no 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.350
 let's carry the howitzers in the ears that 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.980
 let's go straight that's another point 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.870
 important 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.640
 Another important point is also the 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.590
 back in the right career when 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.390
 we go down it is not going to lift the hip 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.400
 is another important point because you 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.840
 you can hurt subtraction of bad exercise 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.849
 fact that can hurt then the 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.620
 go down has to be with a board of 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.720
 realize that it is a goal for that man plan 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.310
 that according to the board as such and that's how it is 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.120
 as they go down and the hip up and the 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.489
 hip down here 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.769
 another important point are the elbows there 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.599
 than download them and paste the agreements is not 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.540
 it's ok to open them you have to download all 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.040
 pegaditos to the body that also goes to us 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.290
 help a lot to work sad or 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.599
 work despite working shoulders live in 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.580
 another and the last thing to do them slowly and 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.140
 as by doing many lizards you do not 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.269
 it's going to be happiness one work better 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.730
 It would be very good to go down in one or two 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:13.000
 times and pick up numbers and it 's easy 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.890
 like 1 200m go down common with this person 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.810
 very good lizard are many 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.489
 benefits and then when making a 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.290
 very common exercise we have more 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.960
 complete many musicians work 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.210
 body the advantage 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.130
 and above all good that after already when 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.350
 you are elevated as we are seeing some 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.080
 images because there is already some kind of 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.790
 lizards already specific to do 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.470
 certain muscle groups already 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.060
 we will be talking next week to 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.250
 some other themes you think 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.810
 perfect friend very well and you have 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.480
 reason we can go out with the students 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.100
 attachments open hands hang with 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.350
 the pair that with the feet so the best 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.000
 and some other positions what kind of 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.560
 can help you work harder but 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.360
 the lizard as normal and is 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.490
 working more and as I tell you a 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.470
