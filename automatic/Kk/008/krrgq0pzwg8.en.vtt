00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
yeah so another thing that's heavily

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.070 
yeah so another thing that's heavily
stressed<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.430> map<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.689> naval

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
stressed on this map is is the naval

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.780 
stressed on this map is is the naval
combat<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.829> again<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.280> paracel<00:01:29.759> storm

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
combat so again this is paracel storm

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.899 
combat so again this is paracel storm
basically<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.320> cluster<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.100> islands<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
basically it's a cluster of islands and

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.340 
basically it's a cluster of islands and
you<00:01:32.970> kind<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.299> fight<00:01:33.540> from<00:01:33.780> island<00:01:34.140> island

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
you kind of fight from island island

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.319 
you kind of fight from island island
we're<00:01:34.650> playing<00:01:34.920> conquest<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.000> different

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
we're playing conquest so the different

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.580 
we're playing conquest so the different
conquest<00:01:36.750> points<00:01:36.810> are<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.140> these<00:01:37.290> different

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
conquest points are on these different

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.170 
conquest points are on these different
islands<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.040> mean<00:01:38.159> if<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.610> want<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> swim

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.060 
islands so I mean if you want to swim
from<00:01:39.420> island<00:01:39.780> island<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:40.950> that's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
from island island you can but that's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.530 
from island island you can but that's
really<00:01:41.340> really<00:01:41.640> slow<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.090> you're<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> sitting

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
moment now I kind of a little sneak peek

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.030 
moment now I kind of a little sneak peek
of<00:02:18.180> what<00:02:18.480> can<00:02:18.630> happen<00:02:18.660> for<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.290> LEvolution<00:02:19.740> or

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
of what can happen for the LEvolution or

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.130 
of what can happen for the LEvolution or
the<00:02:20.130> interactive<00:02:20.790> part<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.330> map<00:02:21.630> as<00:02:22.080> you

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
the interactive part of this map as you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.830 
the interactive part of this map as you
can<00:02:22.440> see<00:02:22.680> here<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.220> storm<00:02:23.880> rolls<00:02:24.270> in<00:02:24.570> and

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
can see here a storm rolls in and

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.080 
can see here a storm rolls in and
they're<00:02:25.050> super<00:02:25.380> super<00:02:25.830> tall<00:02:26.340> waves<00:02:26.730> that

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
they're super super tall waves that

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.060 
they're super super tall waves that
start<00:02:27.390> coming<00:02:27.690> through<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> ocean<00:02:28.320> one<00:02:28.830> thing

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
start coming through the ocean one thing

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.770 
start coming through the ocean one thing
that's<00:02:29.250> really<00:02:29.520> really<00:02:29.910> cool<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.360> terms<00:02:30.540> of

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
that's really really cool in terms of

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.570 
that's really really cool in terms of
like<00:02:30.930> naval<00:02:31.350> combat<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.010> just<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.280> know<00:02:32.340> the

like naval combat and just you know the
ocean<00:02:33.120> everything<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:33.750> map<00:02:33.960> is<00:02:34.170> all<00:02:34.740> of

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
ocean everything in this map is all of

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.760 
ocean everything in this map is all of
those<00:02:35.100> waves<00:02:35.550> are<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.120> same<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.780> everybody's

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
those waves are the same on everybody's

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.830 
those waves are the same on everybody's
screen<00:02:38.190> its<00:02:38.490> networked<00:02:39.060> water<00:02:39.390> which<00:02:39.690> is

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
screen its networked water which is

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.660 
screen its networked water which is
really<00:02:40.230> really<00:02:40.500> impressive<00:02:40.800> I've<00:02:41.070> never<00:02:41.400> seen

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
really really impressive I've never seen

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.220 
really really impressive I've never seen
a<00:02:41.700> game<00:02:41.970> do<00:02:42.150> something<00:02:42.510> like<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:42.840> before<00:02:43.140> and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
a game do something like that before and

a game do something like that before and
as<00:02:43.320> you<00:02:43.440> guys<00:02:43.590> know<00:02:43.830> like<00:02:44.010> when<00:02:44.130> you're

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
as you guys know like when you're

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.190 
as you guys know like when you're
playing<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.640> game<00:02:44.700> when<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.480> shoot<00:02:45.750> something

a tree or something like that sometimes

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.300 
a tree or something like that sometimes
that<00:02:51.450> doesn't<00:02:51.900> happen<00:02:52.080> on<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.740> enemy<00:02:53.100> team's

anything you know it's not you know all
linked<00:02:56.730> together<00:02:56.910> because<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.450> takes<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.780> lot

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
linked together because it takes a lot

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.750 
linked together because it takes a lot
of<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.260> know<00:02:58.290> GPU<00:02:58.800> processing<00:02:59.100> power<00:02:59.610> and

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
of you know GPU processing power and

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.790 
of you know GPU processing power and
things<00:02:59.880> like<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.090> but<00:03:00.660> in<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:00.870> game<00:03:01.110> all<00:03:01.440> of

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
things like that but in this game all of

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.199 
things like that but in this game all of
the<00:03:01.920> waves<00:03:02.130> are<00:03:02.340> linked<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.850> waves<00:03:03.030> that

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
the waves are linked so the waves that

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.970 
the waves are linked so the waves that
you<00:03:03.390> see<00:03:03.630> are<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.959> waves<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.290> your<00:03:04.380> enemy<00:03:04.740> seas

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980

you see are the waves of your enemy seas
which<00:03:05.490> is<00:03:05.700> which<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.030> crazy<00:03:06.420> because<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.810> know

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
which is which is crazy because you know

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.180 
which is which is crazy because you know
that<00:03:07.080> means<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.350> can<00:03:07.470> use<00:03:07.620> your<00:03:07.770> waves<00:03:08.010> as

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
that means you can use your waves as

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.010 
that means you can use your waves as
cover<00:03:08.430> or<00:03:08.700> when<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:08.970> jump<00:03:09.240> over<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.510> wave<00:03:09.720> or

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
cover or when you jump over a wave or

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.150 
cover or when you jump over a wave or
you<00:03:10.320> know<00:03:10.380> things<00:03:10.560> like<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.770> like<00:03:11.070> the
