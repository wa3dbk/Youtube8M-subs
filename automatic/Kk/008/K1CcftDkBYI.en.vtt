00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
be held up by the tree but it's a big

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.870 
be held up by the tree but it's a big
trees<00:02:51.600> so<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.830> would<00:02:53.010> have<00:02:53.130> been<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.280> big<00:02:53.519> way

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880
