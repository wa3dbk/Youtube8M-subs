safety<00:04:32.080> click<00:04:32.320> for<00:04:32.590> every<00:04:32.979> single<00:04:33.220> app<00:04:33.720> out

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
safety click for every single app out

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.960 
safety click for every single app out
there<00:04:35.100> it<00:04:36.100> just<00:04:36.250> takes<00:04:36.460> a<00:04:36.550> little<00:04:36.639> time<00:04:36.850> to

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
there it just takes a little time to

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.200 
there it just takes a little time to
figure<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.240> out<00:04:37.389> but<00:04:37.800> um<00:04:38.800> if<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.850> guys<00:04:40.030> have
