is slightly to the left and I'm going to

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.460 
is slightly to the left and I'm going to
take<00:00:28.520> a<00:00:28.550> little<00:00:28.760> section<00:00:29.090> of<00:00:29.330> hair<00:00:29.390> right<00:00:30.290> here

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
water just because she has a tendency to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.229

braid<00:00:52.579> not<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.390> right<00:00:53.540> side<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.620> I'm<00:00:55.220> just

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
braid not the right side and I'm just

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.870 
braid not the right side and I'm just
going<00:00:55.550> to<00:00:55.640> try<00:00:55.790> to<00:00:55.850> keep<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:56.809> braid<00:00:57.110> as<00:00:57.880> close

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
going to try to keep the braid as close

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.780 
going to try to keep the braid as close
to<00:00:59.210> her<00:00:59.390> forehead<00:00:59.690> as<00:01:00.079> humanly<00:01:00.590> possible<00:01:00.790> her

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
to her forehead as humanly possible her

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.969 
to her forehead as humanly possible her
hairline<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.469> longer<00:01:03.469> for<00:01:03.680> it<00:01:04.059> and<00:01:05.059> you'll<00:01:05.329> see

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
hairline a longer for it and you'll see

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.320 
hairline a longer for it and you'll see
when<00:01:06.979> I<00:01:07.100> get<00:01:07.250> a<00:01:07.280> little<00:01:07.460> farther<00:01:07.729> what<00:01:08.090> I<00:01:08.120> mean

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
when I get a little farther what I mean

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.710 
when I get a little farther what I mean
by<00:01:08.450> that<00:01:08.479> angle<00:01:08.870> kind<00:01:09.290> of<00:01:09.409> straight<00:01:09.680> down

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
by that angle kind of straight down

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.600 
by that angle kind of straight down
initially<00:01:11.860> because<00:01:12.860> if<00:01:13.010> you<00:01:13.100> start<00:01:13.310> angling

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
initially because if you start angling

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.730 
initially because if you start angling
back<00:01:13.880> at<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:14.180> point<00:01:14.450> it<00:01:14.750> won't<00:01:15.290> land<00:01:15.470> where

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
back at this point it won't land where

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.810 
back at this point it won't land where
you<00:01:15.770> want<00:01:16.010> it<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.280> ultimately<00:01:17.470> finished<00:01:18.470> braid

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
you want it to ultimately finished braid

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.280 
you want it to ultimately finished braid
so<00:01:19.820> if<00:01:20.060> you<00:01:20.150> look<00:01:20.360> at<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.570> picture<00:01:20.900> of<00:01:21.020> Rihanna

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
so if you look at the picture of Rihanna

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.820 
so if you look at the picture of Rihanna
she<00:01:21.590> is<00:01:22.280> wearing<00:01:23.210> this<00:01:23.840> braid<00:01:24.140> with<00:01:24.650> her

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
she is wearing this braid with her

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.550 
she is wearing this braid with her
bright<00:01:25.040> red<00:01:25.190> hair<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:26.570> kind<00:01:26.780> of<00:01:26.840> goes<00:01:26.990> over

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
bright red hair and it kind of goes over

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.920 
bright red hair and it kind of goes over
her<00:01:27.799> ears<00:01:28.070> which<00:01:28.729> is<00:01:28.760> why<00:01:29.180> I'm<00:01:29.360> angling<00:01:29.810> the

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
her ears which is why I'm angling the

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.810 
her ears which is why I'm angling the
braid<00:01:30.140> down<00:01:30.470> like<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:33.280> because<00:01:34.280> I<00:01:34.400> want<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.670> to

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
braid down like so because I want it to

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.609 
braid down like so because I want it to
kind<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.180> hang<00:01:35.360> right<00:01:35.600> over<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:36.080> top<00:01:36.290> of<00:01:36.320> her

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
kind of hang right over the top of her

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.130 
kind of hang right over the top of her
ears<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:39.140> we're<00:01:39.290> just<00:01:39.380> going<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.680> continue<00:01:39.860> to

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
ears and we're just going to continue to

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.420 
ears and we're just going to continue to
braid<00:01:42.140> it

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.219 

and<00:01:45.430> now<00:01:45.729> when<00:01:45.940> I<00:01:45.970> hit<00:01:46.270> that<00:01:46.330> top<00:01:46.720> of<00:01:46.900> her<00:01:47.020> ear

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
going to start a regular braid and this

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.309 
going to start a regular braid and this
is<00:03:49.849> how<00:03:49.969> you<00:03:50.030> just<00:03:50.299> kind<00:03:50.480> of<00:03:50.510> form<00:03:50.810> them<00:03:50.959> into

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
is how you just kind of form them into

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:59.400 
is how you just kind of form them into
one<00:03:52.840> braid

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.990 

and<00:03:59.920> we'll<00:04:00.070> go<00:04:00.190> all<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.550> way<00:04:00.580> down<00:04:02.970> till<00:04:03.970> we
