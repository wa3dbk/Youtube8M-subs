which<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.110> always<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.440> case<00:00:43.649> when<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.070> build

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
which is always the case when you build

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.549 
which is always the case when you build
something<00:00:45.149> new<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.510> your<00:00:45.629> prototype<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.410> you

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
something new and your prototype and you

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.500 
something new and your prototype and you
roll<00:00:46.860> them<00:00:47.010> out<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.309> smaller<00:00:47.579> numbers<00:00:47.700> right

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
roll them out in smaller numbers right

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.479 
roll them out in smaller numbers right
but<00:00:48.930> from<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> very<00:00:49.320> beginning<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.430> are

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
but from the very beginning on we are

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.479 
but from the very beginning on we are
about<00:00:50.760> half<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:51.960> not<00:00:52.050> less<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.770> operating

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
about half if not less in operating

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.060 
about half if not less in operating
costs<00:00:53.789> per<00:00:54.120> mile<00:00:54.360> that's<00:00:55.020> amazing<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.920> is

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
costs per mile that's amazing so this is

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.369 
costs per mile that's amazing so this is
the<00:00:56.219> future<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.899> transport<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.079> these<00:00:58.230> are

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the future of transport and these are

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.840 
the future of transport and these are
