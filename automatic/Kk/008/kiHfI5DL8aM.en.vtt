00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.960
 Hello folks, everything is good with you and I am 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.910
 here back and today I came to bring the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.980
 Christmas makeup video is beating 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.759
 at the door and where he had brought nothing 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.040
 for you 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.880
 so I decided to make a very simple make 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.760
 to do 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.220
 but a little bit suddenly because it is 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.890
 You can use more than one simple 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.390
 occasions both a more formal party with 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.609
 something more informal 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.529
 You do not dare so much when it comes to 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.689
 use a lipstick in this color choose one 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.880
 nude tone or rosy that will also stay 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.950
 Surprising, I chose this tomato. 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.780
 heavy because I really thought I was 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.300
 I think it's cool that I agreed. 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.430
 going out on Christmas Eve, probably I 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.800
 would go for dinner something of the type 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.350
 so I chose this makeup so 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.230
 but more party more night 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.899
 but if you think these colors are 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.879
 very heavy take the same technique only 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.379
 change the body and make you have it too 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.289
 sure it will look good 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.629
 the lipstick is super beautiful and super combines in 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.640
 our skin tone I'm sure of it 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.159
 I was very insecure when it came to using 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.970
 Lipstick in that tone and if you button me 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.409
 conquered 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.110
 button that I'm using this 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.180
 Good afternoon, fine. So this is it step by step. 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.580
 It's very simple there and I 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.380
 I hope you like it and then I 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.479
 I go back to say goodbye to you and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.180
 wish a merry christmas for all 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.180
 My beautiful followout checkout 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.229
 Let's continue the make to 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.280
 make this eye I'll use this 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.890
 Shadow of the Maybelline Armadillo Colo in Color 30 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.200
 I'll apply using the same fingers 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.110
 but if you want to feel comfortable, I already 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.000
 I know what time I'll be in heaven. 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.030
 the entire movable eyelid giving slight 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.390
 to make sure you're 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.700
 all applied well in the sequence I go 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.390
 apply this shadow there is cosmetic and 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:03.110
 body where honey with and smoked brush and 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.330
 cultures or brush well because of the beginning 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.759
 At the end of this make the secret will be 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.250
 informed smudge good for anything stand 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.209
 marked 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.890
 now with a black shadow and a paintbrush 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.200
 I'm going to do the outside corner 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.560
 I'm going to make a neighbor of mine, and then 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.110
 gently I'm going to smoke I do not want 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.360
 that this rate becomes very black so I 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.420
 I applied very little black even and 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.760
 I 've been doing this a lot with 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.940
 the brown shadow that same shadow of the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.400
 yes cosmetics and the larger foam brush 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.860
 I'm going to follow command this time I'm going 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.940
 Weigh your hand more so you get more 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.829
 Marketplace 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.079
 but at the same time I 'm going to study 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.079
 enough to make it soft 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.480
 with that same brush there and grubby 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.299
 black shadow I gave a light layer 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.730
 In that brown that was already there I did not 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.480
 I applied a product I just used what I already 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.480
 had in the brush 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.620
 I'm going to make the inner corner of my 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.409
 eye with a shimmering shadow from there is 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.230

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.099
 cosmetics from porto alegre 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.280
 Now I'm going to prepare my eye for 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:26.430
 pass the applied eyelash 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.349
 I did not apply did not record application 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.540
 Because I still do not have much way to 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:36.389
 thing but I promise to soon record with the 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.349
 children already applied outlined already done I 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:43.099
 I'll apply a mask part of 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:46.769
 lashes to unite the natural style 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:52.530

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:55.590

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.199
 bottom of my child on the outside 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.709
 I'm going to make a light blur with a 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:03.709
 brown shade so that everything is fine 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.709
 smoothed 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.939
 to finish the skin I'll mark a 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.419
 this contour with the 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:15.269

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:25.310
