00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello this world so today you 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:10.130
 come back for a little review on the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:13.830
 reindeer paste so I get it in 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.770
 creative hobby store me this is 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.220
 red is bent so I did not have 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.590
 too much to say I may try to 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.619
 to write him a bar of info cheats I him 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.689
 for 3 euros and something and so 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.330
 I use it for no Tamil 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.579
 so it's a dough that's 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.460
 very flexible in fact so it's a 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.399
 dough that dries in the free air 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.739
 excuse me so she comes under 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.570
 a format a compact box we know 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.910
 well that when it was finished it 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.170
 can store things so that's 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.100
 just another how we can 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.129
 sheriff so here's me personally 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.440
 I took a glass green hair wever 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.820
 because it tempted me and many 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.260
 several colors so its manufacture 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.309
 is still and even if we do not care 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.439
 that's why it's not about being 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.890
 come is not much available in 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:15.450
 France so I 'm going to mold a crazy man who 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.470
 is great when you do for small 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.080
 party heaven 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.110
 we just take effect textures and after 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.360
 we add the nuggets 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.119
 it's just great here's the dough is 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:34.740
 just a texture a kind we 'll say 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:37.200
 sweet creamy what can people 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.450
 as of the moral girl actually has 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.640
 so we're going to make a ball that has to be 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.070
 a hard object so me in this case 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.970
 cookies and textured cooked and it is in 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.740
 burke failure 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.130
 if you do not know what it is 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.310
 new remains of dough that are dirty or 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.920
 other we will take the ball of 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.719
 preferably it is mandatory 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.790
 is larger than the object a calf 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:10.650
 and we will come against cookies 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:16.030
 and press everything gently pressed 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:18.220
 until a month ago and I have but 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:23.200
 a good amount because going from 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:26.050
 ska and no and so that's why 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.950
 I just do not even have a little bit 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:34.420
 put the edges back in place so that's it 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.630
 so I have already done 1 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.140
 he's great and I'm going to show you the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.260
 result 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.560
 that's what gives after two days so 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.180
 me a day and a half what but of 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.760
 preferably two days for them 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.730
 manage to take all the motives and 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.660
 dry so learned he's like this 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.040
 so excuse me for my nails it's 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.950
 that right now I'm doing a lot of 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.280
 heads manual work 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.709
 so here it is flexible enough 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.890
 not to do one here it is not the 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.470
 silicone either but it's pretty good 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.260
 so I personally had some 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.360
 little cookies for jars king his microphone 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.600
 I will not deprive myself 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.390
 new creations in fact and so the 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.150
 What did I realize at these 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.620
 little tubes created to actually put it 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.209
 broke down and to put it for me 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.930
 because I do not like these 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.180
 big waves 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.180
 good this is for the fiom 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.799
 so here I hope you enjoyed it 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.690
 I will soon make a video review 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:45.030
 the mussels as well as the nose in dream pata 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:47.380
 for sale that I actually do myself and 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.239
 I will make their views of all my 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.410
 molds because actually I had it already 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.180
 done but now I have a lot 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.799
 more so here I am full fat 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.799
 kisses and until the next can
