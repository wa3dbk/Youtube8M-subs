00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.559
 we are at the foot of our end 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.110
 this is his part is interpreted so we 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.140
 worked ground masses of 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.640
 stack of boxes that the box of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.820
 ditches that is our signature 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.610
 we propose the boxes by proposing 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:56.670
 on stage objects at the foot object of this 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:58.260
 his part involved this staging I 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.960
 would say that it's a meeting where 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.000
 several meetings 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.670
 it is first that with carole sees it 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.890
 and his whole universe since 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.690
 this scenography 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.120
 is in direct correlation with 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.350
 the carole show sees it and the 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.510
 second meeting 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.520
 he is an agronomist 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.770
 is called adrien benard 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.439
 with whom we collaborated to 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.969
 to realize precisely this vegetal decoration is 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.929
 what are called hiccups and damas 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:32.920
 it is a floral art from Japan 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:37.000
 and the benrien adrien team designed 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.549
 a particular substrate with a treatment of 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.200
 particular mousse to precisely put 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.090
 worth the plants in this sphere 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.649
 of moss these plants are real 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.080
 love is alive around the 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.119
 sphere love is alive too 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:58.060
 on the ground since we realized a whole carpet 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:02:01.270
 of foam so here the first 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.070
 boards of inspiration where precisely the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.009
 Plant selection is very very 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.229
 aerial on this drawing of which he 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.600
 represented the red carpet is at 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.459
 center of each of these showcases on 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.459
 find the works of carole sees it 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.420
 the meeting with carole is it 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.850
 really a trigger 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.550
 we wanted this universe of 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.100
 goes beyond the canvas and the challenge 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.350
 was to find the link between us the 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.320
 presentation of our products 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.210
 retransform its forms modernize them and 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.130
 that we are also trying to show on 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.130
 outside and so in the windows
