00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:11.720 
hi I'm for the hall for digital camera

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.299 
hi I'm for the hall for digital camera
and<00:00:11.840> welcome<00:00:12.110> to<00:00:12.230> our<00:00:12.290> review<00:00:12.410> of<00:00:12.650> nickens<00:00:13.100> new

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
and welcome to our review of nickens new

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.140 
and welcome to our review of nickens new
professional<00:00:14.059> Destler<00:00:14.510> the<00:00:14.990> default<00:00:16.150> design

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
professional Destler the default design

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.630 
professional Destler the default design
wise<00:00:17.570> the<00:00:18.110> default<00:00:18.650> doesn't<00:00:18.830> move<00:00:19.070> on<00:00:19.310> much

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
wise the default doesn't move on much

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.120 
wise the default doesn't move on much
from<00:00:20.090> the<00:00:20.180> d3s<00:00:20.689> at<00:00:20.900> first<00:00:21.080> glance<00:00:21.349> it's<00:00:21.920> still

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
from the d3s at first glance it's still

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.190 
from the d3s at first glance it's still
a<00:00:22.160> big<00:00:22.460> durable<00:00:23.240> camera<00:00:23.660> with<00:00:23.810> a<00:00:23.840> magnesium

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
a big durable camera with a magnesium

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.380 
a big durable camera with a magnesium
alloy<00:00:24.529> chassis<00:00:24.980> plenty<00:00:25.880> of<00:00:25.970> weather<00:00:26.119> sealing

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
alloy chassis plenty of weather sealing

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.450 
alloy chassis plenty of weather sealing
so<00:00:26.750> it's<00:00:26.930> a<00:00:27.020> really<00:00:27.320> rugged<00:00:27.650> piece<00:00:28.009> of<00:00:28.189> kit

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
so it's a really rugged piece of kit

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.640 
so it's a really rugged piece of kit
that<00:00:28.669> all<00:00:28.910> withstand<00:00:29.360> quite<00:00:30.079> a<00:00:30.110> lot<00:00:30.320> of<00:00:30.410> abuse

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
that all withstand quite a lot of abuse

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.650 
that all withstand quite a lot of abuse
there<00:00:31.489> have<00:00:31.640> been<00:00:31.790> some<00:00:32.060> changes<00:00:32.450> though

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
there have been some changes though

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.470 
there have been some changes though
namely<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.829> shutter<00:00:34.280> button<00:00:34.399> is<00:00:34.970> angled

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
namely the shutter button is angled

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.180 
namely the shutter button is angled
slightly<00:00:35.780> differently<00:00:36.350> rather<00:00:36.800> than<00:00:37.010> being

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
slightly differently rather than being

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.360 
slightly differently rather than being
28<00:00:37.670> degrees<00:00:37.970> in<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:38.180> beefiest<00:00:38.630> at<00:00:39.380> 35<00:00:40.070> degrees

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
28 degrees in the beefiest at 35 degrees

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.430 
28 degrees in the beefiest at 35 degrees
so<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:41.120> theory<00:00:41.420> being<00:00:41.690> there<00:00:42.019> will<00:00:42.109> be<00:00:42.140> more

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
so the theory being there will be more

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.220 
so the theory being there will be more
comfortable<00:00:42.890> over<00:00:43.160> long<00:00:43.489> periods<00:00:43.879> of<00:00:44.000> time

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
comfortable over long periods of time

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.470 
comfortable over long periods of time
the<00:00:45.230> metering<00:00:45.829> button<00:00:46.219> which<00:00:46.429> was<00:00:46.609> on<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:46.969> d3s

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
the metering button which was on the d3s

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.720 
the metering button which was on the d3s
has<00:00:47.690> been<00:00:47.929> taken<00:00:48.410> away<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:48.620> is<00:00:48.920> now<00:00:49.129> on<00:00:49.460> this

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
has been taken away and is now on this

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.779 
has been taken away and is now on this
mode<00:00:50.420> dial<00:00:50.660> over<00:00:50.989> here<00:00:51.379> and<00:00:51.620> at<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:52.579> rear

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
mode dial over here and at the rear

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.090 
mode dial over here and at the rear
we've<00:00:53.179> now<00:00:53.420> got<00:00:53.719> a<00:00:53.870> dedicated<00:00:54.230> movie<00:00:54.920> button

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
we've now got a dedicated movie button

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.700 
we've now got a dedicated movie button
Live<00:00:55.969> View<00:00:56.179> button<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:56.809> swapping<00:00:57.620> between

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
Live View button and swapping between

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.779 
Live View button and swapping between
stills

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
stills

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.829 
stills
so<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.989> d3s<00:01:00.559> had<00:01:00.859> two<00:01:01.640> compact<00:01:02.179> flash<00:01:02.449> slots

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
so the d3s had two compact flash slots

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.869 
so the d3s had two compact flash slots
but<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.559> default<00:01:03.710> changes<00:01:04.370> that<00:01:04.519> slightly

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
but the default changes that slightly

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.910 
but the default changes that slightly
still<00:01:05.150> got<00:01:05.300> a<00:01:05.330> compact<00:01:05.690> flash<00:01:05.930> slots<00:01:06.260> but<00:01:06.830> on

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
still got a compact flash slots but on

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.690 
still got a compact flash slots but on
top<00:01:07.130> of<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:07.340> there's<00:01:07.610> now<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:08.290> xqd<00:01:09.290> slot<00:01:10.040> which

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
top of that there's now a xqd slot which

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.090 
top of that there's now a xqd slot which
is<00:01:10.730> Sony's<00:01:11.360> new<00:01:11.390> next<00:01:12.170> generation<00:01:12.230> kind<00:01:12.980> of

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
is Sony's new next generation kind of

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.190 
is Sony's new next generation kind of
contact<00:01:13.520> flash<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:14.630> performs<00:01:15.140> really

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
contact flash and it performs really

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.100 
contact flash and it performs really
well<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:16.460> d4<00:01:17.210> is<00:01:17.360> now<00:01:17.540> capable<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.960> shooting

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
well the d4 is now capable of shooting

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.930 
well the d4 is now capable of shooting

from the one DX and Canon that was still
yet<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.790> test<00:02:16.180> there's<00:02:17.180> been<00:02:17.420> some<00:02:17.630> worry<00:02:17.870> that

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
yet to test there's been some worry that

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.780 
yet to test there's been some worry that
the<00:02:18.200> d4<00:02:18.709> with<00:02:18.890> its<00:02:19.040> increased<00:02:19.489> resolution

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
the d4 with its increased resolution

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.820 
the d4 with its increased resolution
won't<00:02:20.390> be<00:02:20.569> as<00:02:20.630> good<00:02:20.720> as<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.110> d3<00:02:21.500> s<00:02:21.560> when<00:02:21.739> it

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
won't be as good as the d3 s when it

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.440 
won't be as good as the d3 s when it
comes<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.100> image<00:02:22.310> noise<00:02:22.519> but<00:02:22.819> as<00:02:22.910> far<00:02:23.120> as<00:02:23.239> we

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
comes to image noise but as far as we

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.390 
comes to image noise but as far as we
