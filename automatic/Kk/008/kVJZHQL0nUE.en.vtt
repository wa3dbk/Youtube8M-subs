benefits to using optical sights as well
I'm<00:01:31.079> not<00:01:31.290> necessarily<00:01:31.890> saying<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.250> these

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
I'm not necessarily saying that these

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.310 
I'm not necessarily saying that these
benefits<00:01:32.700> outweigh<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.420> benefits<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.140> other

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
benefits outweigh the benefits of other

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.170 
benefits outweigh the benefits of other
attachments<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.100> say<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> laser<00:01:35.640> sight<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
attachments like say the laser sight the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.670 
attachments like say the laser sight the
suppressor<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.780> stock<00:01:37.020> anything<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.650> that

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
suppressor the stock anything like that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.679 
suppressor the stock anything like that
but<00:01:38.250> there<00:01:38.400> are<00:01:38.549> definitely<00:01:39.030> other<00:01:39.119> benefits

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
but there are definitely other benefits

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.149 
but there are definitely other benefits
that<00:01:39.840> I'm<00:01:39.930> about<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.290> show<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.009> can

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that I'm about to show you and you can

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.980 
that I'm about to show you and you can
decide<00:01:41.400> how<00:01:41.579> important<00:01:42.030> they<00:01:42.180> really<00:01:42.210> are<00:01:42.630> so

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
decide how important they really are so

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.749 
decide how important they really are so
right<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.500> three<00:01:43.979> screenshots<00:01:44.369> of

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
right here I have three screenshots of

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.389 
right here I have three screenshots of
the<00:01:44.820> mp7<00:01:45.299> one<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> iron<00:01:46.680> sights<00:01:46.950> one

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the mp7 one with the iron sights one

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.039 
the mp7 one with the iron sights one
with<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.670> reflex<00:01:48.090> sight<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.540> one<00:01:48.750> with<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
with the reflex sight and one with the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.870 
with the reflex sight and one with the
EOTech<00:01:49.320> sight<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.009> these<00:01:50.159> images<00:01:50.579> were<00:01:50.700> all

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
EOTech sight and these images were all

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.270 
EOTech sight and these images were all
taken<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> exact<00:01:51.899> same<00:01:52.170> spot<00:01:52.530> right<00:01:53.130> off

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
taken in the exact same spot right off

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.190 
taken in the exact same spot right off
the<00:01:53.399> bat<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.729> might<00:01:53.970> not<00:01:54.180> notice<00:01:54.420> too<00:01:54.840> much<00:01:55.049> of

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the bat you might not notice too much of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.719 
the bat you might not notice too much of
a<00:01:55.259> difference<00:01:55.590> between<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.040> three<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:56.640> if

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
a difference between the three but if

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.490 
a difference between the three but if
you<00:01:56.790> take<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> closer<00:01:57.329> look<00:01:57.570> at<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.930> walls<00:01:58.170> you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you take a closer look at the walls you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.050 
you take a closer look at the walls you
can<00:01:58.680> see<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.189> reflex<00:01:59.640> sight<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.030> a

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
can see that the reflex sight is a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.459 
can see that the reflex sight is a
little<00:02:00.390> bit<00:02:00.479> farther<00:02:00.689> zoomed<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.170> than<00:02:01.350> the

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
little bit farther zoomed in than the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.319 
little bit farther zoomed in than the
iron<00:02:01.649> sights<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.430> EOTech<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> little

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
iron sights and the EOTech is a little

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.609 
iron sights and the EOTech is a little
bit<00:02:03.420> farther<00:02:03.630> zoomed<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.049> than<00:02:04.229> even<00:02:04.530> the

bit farther zoomed in than even the

bit farther zoomed in than even the
reflex<00:02:05.040> sight<00:02:05.310> now<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.240> both<00:02:06.390> good

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
reflex sight now this can be both good

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.779 
reflex sight now this can be both good
and<00:02:06.930> bad<00:02:06.990> with<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> iron<00:02:08.099> sights<00:02:08.369> you've<00:02:08.610> got

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
and bad with the iron sights you've got

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.249 
and bad with the iron sights you've got
the<00:02:08.910> upper<00:02:09.000> hand<00:02:09.119> from<00:02:09.420> closer<00:02:09.660> range<00:02:09.959> because

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
the upper hand from closer range because

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.930 
the upper hand from closer range because
you<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.500> more<00:02:10.739> peripheral<00:02:11.190> vision<00:02:11.550> from

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
you have more peripheral vision from

long range on the other hand the
ootek<00:02:13.690> site<00:02:13.930> will<00:02:14.080> give<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.500> advantage

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000

areas where you will be able to see

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.370 
areas where you will be able to see

and then slightly to the left and right
I<00:02:34.390> understand<00:02:35.050> that<00:02:35.140> I'm<00:02:35.290> only<00:02:35.440> showing<00:02:35.680> this

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
I understand that I'm only showing this

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.500 
I understand that I'm only showing this
with<00:02:36.070> one<00:02:36.310> weapon<00:02:36.490> but<00:02:36.820> it's<00:02:36.970> pretty<00:02:37.210> much<00:02:37.300> the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
with one weapon but it's pretty much the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.180 
with one weapon but it's pretty much the
same<00:02:37.540> for<00:02:37.870> each<00:02:37.990> weapon<00:02:38.230> your<00:02:38.650> field<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.010> view

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
same for each weapon your field of view

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.770 
same for each weapon your field of view
when<00:02:39.370> using<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.790> reflex<00:02:40.270> or<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.540> EOTech

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
when using the reflex or the EOTech

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.360 
when using the reflex or the EOTech
sights<00:02:41.230> will<00:02:41.410> typically<00:02:41.680> be<00:02:41.890> much<00:02:42.130> larger

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
sights will typically be much larger

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.220 
sights will typically be much larger
than<00:02:42.640> when<00:02:42.910> using<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.300> iron<00:02:43.480> sights<00:02:43.900> on<00:02:44.050> any

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
than when using the iron sights on any

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.960 
than when using the iron sights on any
given<00:02:44.470> weapon<00:02:44.920> with<00:02:45.280> all<00:02:45.430> of<00:02:45.520> this<00:02:45.640> being<00:02:45.850> said

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
given weapon with all of this being said

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.580 
given weapon with all of this being said
I<00:02:46.210> actually<00:02:46.570> think<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.020> a<00:02:47.080> fairly<00:02:47.290> easy

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
I actually think it's a fairly easy

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.470 
I actually think it's a fairly easy
decision<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.190> decide<00:02:48.550> which<00:02:48.850> attachment<00:02:49.420> is

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
decision to decide which attachment is

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.420 
decision to decide which attachment is
better<00:02:49.690> on<00:02:49.900> which<00:02:50.140> weapon<00:02:50.470> class<00:02:50.710> first<00:02:51.280> of

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430

all with the pistols the crossbow and
the<00:02:53.440> shotguns<00:02:53.920> I'm<00:02:54.070> obviously<00:02:54.340> gonna<00:02:54.730> say<00:02:54.940> the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
the shotguns I'm obviously gonna say the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.880 
the shotguns I'm obviously gonna say the
reflex<00:02:55.450> sight<00:02:55.660> because<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.080> EOTech<00:02:56.320> is<00:02:56.709> not

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
reflex sight because the EOTech is not

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.740 
reflex sight because the EOTech is not
available<00:02:57.430> for<00:02:57.490> these<00:02:57.790> weapons<00:02:58.209> if<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:58.630> have

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
available for these weapons if you have

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.210 
available for these weapons if you have
an<00:02:58.840> extra<00:02:59.080> class<00:02:59.260> lock<00:02:59.560> go<00:02:59.800> ahead<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.070> throw

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
an extra class lock go ahead and throw

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.680 
an extra class lock go ahead and throw
the<00:03:00.340> reflex<00:03:00.730> on<00:03:00.880> there<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.240> improve<00:03:01.510> your

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
the reflex on there to improve your

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.910 
the reflex on there to improve your
vision<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:02.020> little<00:03:02.140> bit<00:03:02.380> now<00:03:02.650> with<00:03:02.770> these

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
vision a little bit now with these

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.560 
vision a little bit now with these
submachine<00:03:03.430> guns<00:03:03.610> I<00:03:03.730> know<00:03:03.790> my<00:03:04.000> friend<00:03:04.240> Kevin

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
submachine guns I know my friend Kevin

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.880 
submachine guns I know my friend Kevin
would<00:03:04.690> disagree<00:03:05.110> but<00:03:05.230> I'm<00:03:05.350> gonna<00:03:05.500> go<00:03:05.680> ahead

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
would disagree but I'm gonna go ahead

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.560 
would disagree but I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:03:06.040> save<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.370> reflex<00:03:06.850> sight<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.330> better

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
and save you reflex sight is a better

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.570 
and save you reflex sight is a better
option<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.260> say<00:03:08.620> this<00:03:08.770> because<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.100> reflex

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
option I say this because the reflex

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.310 
option I say this because the reflex
sight<00:03:09.640> gives<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.209> best<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.630> both<00:03:10.690> worlds

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
sight gives you the best of both worlds

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.990 
sight gives you the best of both worlds
you<00:03:11.440> still<00:03:11.740> have<00:03:11.890> great<00:03:12.130> peripheral<00:03:12.670> vision

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
you still have great peripheral vision

you still have great peripheral vision

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
the best options now even if a weapon
