actually defected back knacks

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.259 
actually defected back knacks
now<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.250> sounds<00:00:14.429> like<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.670> silly<00:00:14.880> name<00:00:15.089> I

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
now it sounds like a silly name I

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.519 
now it sounds like a silly name I
probably<00:00:15.509> butchered<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.990> name<00:00:16.139> as<00:00:16.260> watch<00:00:16.410> you

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
probably butchered the name as watch you

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.439 
probably butchered the name as watch you
can<00:00:16.650> see<00:00:16.740> over<00:00:16.920> here<00:00:16.949> their<00:00:17.310> claws<00:00:17.580> very<00:00:18.240> much

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
can see over here their claws very much

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.760 
can see over here their claws very much
like<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> bladed<00:00:19.050> Club<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.619> case

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
like the bladed Club but in this case

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.560 
like the bladed Club but in this case
they're<00:00:20.010> bigger<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.820> will<00:00:21.000> be<00:00:21.150> able<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.420> hit

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
they're bigger you will be able to hit

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.970 
they're bigger you will be able to hit
multiple<00:00:21.750> enemies<00:00:21.960> at<00:00:22.199> some<00:00:22.590> point<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.890> mean

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
multiple enemies at some point I mean

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.230 
multiple enemies at some point I mean
look<00:00:23.160> at<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.519> kind<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.850> stretching<00:00:24.180> it

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
look at this it's kind of stretching it

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.089 
look at this it's kind of stretching it
right<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.750> they<00:00:25.109> will<00:00:25.230> be<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.560> be<00:00:25.710> yeah

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
right here they will be have to be yeah

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.410 
right here they will be have to be yeah
they'll<00:00:26.340> have<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.609> be<00:00:26.670> pretty<00:00:26.939> close<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.300> each

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
they'll have to be pretty close to each

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.670 
they'll have to be pretty close to each
other<00:00:27.510> because<00:00:27.750> otherwise<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.439> won't<00:00:28.529> be

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
other because otherwise you won't be

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.109 
other because otherwise you won't be
able<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.920> at<00:00:29.010> them<00:00:29.160> because<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.730> range<00:00:29.910> is

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
able to at them because the range is

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.490 
able to at them because the range is
very<00:00:30.330> limited<00:00:30.779> on<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.019> they're<00:00:31.230> all<00:00:31.320> jumping

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
very limited on this they're all jumping

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.900 
very limited on this they're all jumping
on<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.800> hell<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> trip<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.340> that's<00:00:32.759> not

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
on the hell of a trip it that's not

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.910 
on the hell of a trip it that's not
being<00:00:33.030> super<00:00:33.329> helpful<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:34.079> where<00:00:34.350> do<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.620> get

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
being super helpful but where do you get

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.620 
being super helpful but where do you get
this<00:00:35.190> well<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.910> actually<00:00:36.030> get<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.360> fit<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
this well you actually get the fit the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.720 
this well you actually get the fit the
back<00:00:36.780> max<00:00:37.020> from<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.469> Crimson<00:00:37.710> mimics<00:00:38.280> during

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
we're just holding it up as if we're

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.080 
we're just holding it up as if we're
like<00:02:59.620> using<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.040> magic<00:03:00.310> mirror<00:03:00.490> but<00:03:00.730> it's<00:03:00.850> never

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
like using a magic mirror but it's never

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.910
