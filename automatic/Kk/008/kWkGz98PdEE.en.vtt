00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.230 
education on tire care and maintenance I
think<00:00:10.440> there<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.650> more<00:00:11.010> educational<00:00:11.730> material

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240

there<00:01:13.560> were<00:01:13.680> several<00:01:13.980> models<00:01:14.490> available<00:01:15.120> I

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
there were several models available I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.750 
there were several models available I
chose<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.080> 400<00:01:16.710> series<00:01:16.740> model<00:01:17.430> because<00:01:17.730> of

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
chose the 400 series model because of

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.220 
chose the 400 series model because of
the<00:01:17.910> features<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.420> offered<00:01:18.990> like

the fact that there is a visual as well
as<00:01:35.100> audible<00:01:35.850> warning<00:01:36.330> system<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:36.900> you

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
as audible warning system if you

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.990 
as audible warning system if you
experience<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.770> loss<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.250> pressure<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
experience a loss in pressure and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.090 
experience a loss in pressure and
there's<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.630> temperature<00:01:40.050> alarm<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.830> tire

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
there's a temperature alarm if the tire

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.000 
there's a temperature alarm if the tire
temperature<00:01:41.700> rises<00:01:42.210> above<00:01:42.740> 167<00:01:43.740> degrees

temperature rises above 167 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:44.640> another<00:01:45.510> added<00:01:45.900> benefit<00:01:46.320> was

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
Fahrenheit another added benefit was

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.140 
Fahrenheit another added benefit was
that<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.830> can<00:01:47.040> replace<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.700> lithium

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
that you can replace the lithium

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.210 
that you can replace the lithium
batteries<00:01:48.690> in<00:01:48.900> all<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.500> transmitters

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
batteries in all of the transmitters

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.490 
batteries in all of the transmitters
when<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.490> battery<00:01:50.880> dies<00:01:51.110> rather<00:01:52.110> than

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
when the battery dies rather than

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.800 
when the battery dies rather than
replacing<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.190> entire<00:01:53.300> transmitter<00:01:54.300> which

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
replacing the entire transmitter which

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.410 
replacing the entire transmitter which
can<00:01:55.050> get<00:01:55.200> very<00:01:55.470> expensive<00:01:55.880> now<00:01:56.880> let<00:01:57.150> me<00:01:57.240> show

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
can get very expensive now let me show

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.780 
can get very expensive now let me show
you<00:01:57.450> how<00:01:57.840> easy<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.440> to<00:01:58.680> set<00:01:58.950> up<00:01:58.980> and<00:01:59.310> use

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
you how easy it is to set up and use

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.300 
you how easy it is to set up and use
it's<00:02:00.660> important<00:02:01.260> that<00:02:01.410> you<00:02:01.500> read<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> owner's

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
it's important that you read the owner's

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.390 
it's important that you read the owner's
manual<00:02:02.340> when<00:02:02.880> your<00:02:03.030> TPMS<00:02:03.600> arrives<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.950> easy
