00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.700
 my name is alain bush I work 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.100
 in the laboratory 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.930
 so what is called grenoble institute 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.520
 neuroscience 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.119
 we call the jeans so I have you 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.920
 brought an object that more that is to my 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.199
 researcher career and that's 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.830
 simply a paperweight ball in 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.690
 world map shape that I brought back from a 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.500
 congress where I went where I'm going 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.910
 quite regularly 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.519
 it's the congress of society 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.460
 American neuroscience is also 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.890
 a symbol for them to call me back a 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.479
 little motivation for me 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.140
 led to choose this career of 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:59.120
 researcher when choosing this 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.250
 training and this type of career 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.989
 we are lucky enough to go abroad from 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.610
 live abroad to work at 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.710
 Abroad him the idea to come back on 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.690
 grenoble for me when I already had 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.229
 a career as a research professor at 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.950
 caen was coming back to join the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.930
 jeans and to install a team there a 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.510
 team whose theme would be health 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.670
 around Alzheimer's disease and 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.020
 mechanisms that lead to this 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.880
 pathology which is a pathology 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.380
 extremely heavy 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.650
 so there is a whole part of the 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.400
 knowledge that will be turned towards 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.430
 process 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.800
 we will say physiological of 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.330
 understanding of what the memory of 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.880
 what are the cellular mechanisms 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.010
 which lead to memory and how 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.510
 in a context pathologies of the 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.659
 alzheimer's disease this memory is going to be 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.310
 affected but here we are going to happen 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.680
 at the microscopic scale try 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.110
 to study how does neurons work 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.700
 how a background a neuron will learn 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.380
 how it changes according to 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.940
 information and how in a 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.760
 pathology context that loses this 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.409
 ability a thing that is important 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.479
 we are not the doctors will never be 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.280
 doctors and our role is not to 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.319
 validate treatments our role is 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.420
 to find new approaches 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.890
 therapeutics that will be the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.890
 treatments of the future 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.960
 and 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.590
 but for me
