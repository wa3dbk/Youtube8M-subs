00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.900
 are all guys are the ones to whom to give 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.969
 today we are here in this new video 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.219
 where we're going to make an attack with solo 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.500
 healers and wait but I wouldn't attack 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.500
 I would also use heroes as a healing healer 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.840
 no guys i use red healers 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.269
 so we'll see what happens then 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.730
 it will be a kind of blessing of the 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.439
 village and I could manage to do 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.840
 maximum zero percent theoretically 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.670
 so let's see what this will be 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.380
 magnificent of attack here we have immediately to 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.270
 look for someone to attack like that 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.460
 meanwhile I talk to you a little about my life 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.050
 as you see or very much glasses 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.730
 children because today I woke up has 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.510
 having said we take a video with these 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.850
 glasses 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.040
 I would say that with only healers we can 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.200
 simply attach a max ato 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.570
 because that's how cool it is because it's there 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.090
 guys would be if i said boh not 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.060
 I know other youtubers are factors 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.950
 attacks with 15 and healers and heroes 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.770
 to do 100 percent rather than 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.140
 to do something cool and I said 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.000
 why not make an attack with solo 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.549
 healers mean just healers 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.590
 and nothing else and something might come 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.000
 very very interesting from what 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.700
 I have theoretically seen the healers 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.860
 they should stand still so maybe there 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.320
 we can place where we want how 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.000
 we want when we want and I don't know 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.950
 guys because the problem is that i am in 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.020
 kind when I try to attack one 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.909
 I say we hope to not do for 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.400
 we hope not to make films ie if you notice 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.530
 I always say here practically I am not 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.229
 that I can hope so much not to fail 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.780
 because it's an impossible thing 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.250
 I don't understand and then obviously when 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.080
 you have to find people with all the 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.390
 maximum are not to people with everything 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.340
 at best because this is the challenge 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.370
 of the youtuber that always records the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.159
 usual things and if now I had to find 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:56.360
 an abandoned village I swear to me 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.880
 shot no no no no no guys there 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.670
 be boys attack this 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.330
 look at this is like collapsing clash of 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:12.739
 france how to find clash of france 3 2 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:16.420
 1 go I go I go an attacker who knows 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.870
 that you don't have nano reggina ok ok ok 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.690
 third age bags 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.069
 no guys I don't believe you look at that 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.709
 ethical thing 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.220
 no no it is an abandoned village no 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.569
 look who has great qualities 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.650
 consider which children I am among 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:37.079
 the other day beautiful beautiful proud this 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.780
 is dying poor thing then boys of 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.239
 this kind of angels who are fine 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.030
 saying village among other things I have 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.810
 two more then we put them 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.620
 exactly where not 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.750
 so they will die great here 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.980
 great healers such as bulls that heart 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.440
 what a heart that color 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.760
 no guys this is the ballad of 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.470
 life ie the idea we can can 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.329
 we have between spells care 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:16.370
 so we can put them exactly 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:19.260
 so no no no this is san giovanni 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.170
 sammarco san matteo san luca 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.669
 sant'agostino san michele know of bee 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.519
 3000 cold san gaudenzio se therefore 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:32.250
 these last two here are doing 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.050
 something together I don't want to know it there 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.980
 we call san giuseppe and san giova 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.170
 nino giovannino because he is small 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.129
 39 38 37 still have thirty seconds to 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.209
 shoot crap 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.010
 also the apulia then my name is la 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.239
 fury the complete overwhelm never has him 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.920
 wanted new guys to win because 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.569
 this is a given mandate in this way 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.769
 I have blessed you to make a 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.450
 sigh and right santus of the village 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.069
 abandoned and with Italians where 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.390
 It seems to many till death do not shoot 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:01.010
 so let's hope they then find thousands 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:05.030
 minardi of better resources 7 6 5 4 3 2 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.459
 no I don't believe you guys this was it 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.590
 one of the most epic things in history 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:14.420
 no I don't have here you have to put I like 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:18.380
 regardless minus 30 trophies 00 elixir 0 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:22.100
 bonus 17 healers 3 healings one 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.539
 fury that balls true that is when I have to 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.740
 find villages in the tip I find them 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:28.760
 never when I have to do a video like that 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.020
 I always find them is that you do n't imagine me 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.850
 you this here that you see yours 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.740
 village was attacked by a 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.949
 level 113 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.169
 then look at zero for 117 healers ie 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:42.260
 I'm kind of here from the numbers I said of ho 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.910
 asked here or diu and so I hope that 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.530
 this video you liked an idea 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.419
 in my opinion very very original that 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.130
 no one in the whole world yet done 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.650
 because in any case it must really be 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.310
 crazy mind almost more than me to do 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.810
 these things 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.700
 therefore precisely on what he is 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.770
 liked in that case I recommend a 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.720
 nice I like it is always nice 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.130
 having said that I remind you to pass 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.960
 for the facebook page and for mine 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.690
 Instagram account you will find all this 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.650
 in the description enti boys we us 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.650
 let's see in the next
