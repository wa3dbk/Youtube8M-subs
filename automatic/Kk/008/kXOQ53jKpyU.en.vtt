hello<00:00:01.800> again<00:00:01.920> welcome<00:00:02.100> back<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:02.790> three

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hello again welcome back to the three

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.700 
hello again welcome back to the three
studio<00:00:03.389> max<00:00:03.570> tutorial<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.200> time<00:00:04.440> we<00:00:04.589> will

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
studio max tutorial this time we will

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.190 
studio max tutorial this time we will
cover<00:00:04.890> position<00:00:05.490> constraints<00:00:06.000> so<00:00:06.690> let's<00:00:06.960> go

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
cover position constraints so let's go

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.169 
cover position constraints so let's go
ahead<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.500> get<00:00:07.649> started<00:00:07.740> so<00:00:08.220> at<00:00:08.760> first<00:00:09.000> we'll

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
ahead and get started so at first we'll

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.089 
ahead and get started so at first we'll
just<00:00:09.330> create<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.630> box<00:00:09.870> I'll<00:00:10.290> set<00:00:10.530> this<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.800> cube

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
just create a box I'll set this to cube

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.259 
just create a box I'll set this to cube
and<00:00:11.809> draw<00:00:12.809> out<00:00:12.929> one<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.820> remember<00:00:14.820> from<00:00:14.969> other

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
and draw out one and remember from other

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.300 
and draw out one and remember from other
tutorials<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:16.080> duplicate<00:00:16.680> something<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.190> can

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
tutorials to duplicate something you can

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.800 
tutorials to duplicate something you can
hold<00:00:17.520> shift<00:00:17.580> left<00:00:17.970> click<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.330> just<00:00:18.359> drag<00:00:18.510> out

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
hold shift left click and just drag out

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.429 
hold shift left click and just drag out
to<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.990> side

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
to the side

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.040 
to the side
click<00:00:20.160> OK<00:00:20.430> for<00:00:20.490> copy<00:00:20.789> or<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.779> have<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.930> other

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
click OK for copy or you have the other

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.590 
click OK for copy or you have the other
option<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.500> control<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.160> then<00:00:23.310> V<00:00:23.519> does<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
option of control and then V does the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.960 
option of control and then V does the
same<00:00:24.750> exact<00:00:25.080> thing<00:00:25.109> copy<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.220> go<00:00:26.670> ahead<00:00:26.760> move

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
same exact thing copy and go ahead move

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.050 
same exact thing copy and go ahead move
it<00:00:27.470> so<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:29.160> what<00:00:29.310> we'll<00:00:29.460> do<00:00:29.609> here<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.029> show

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
it so for what we'll do here is to show

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.420 
it so for what we'll do here is to show
and<00:00:30.660> demonstrate<00:00:30.810> what<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.529> basic<00:00:31.890> position

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
and demonstrate what a basic position

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.549 
and demonstrate what a basic position
constraint<00:00:32.820> does<00:00:32.880> I'll<00:00:33.270> go<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:34.079> give<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
constraint does I'll go on just give a

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.959 
constraint does I'll go on just give a
little<00:00:34.770> hint<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.219> how<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.520> might<00:00:35.640> use<00:00:35.700> it

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
little hint as to how you might use it

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.369 
little hint as to how you might use it
in<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.420> character<00:00:36.870> rig<00:00:37.550> so<00:00:38.550> first<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:40.230> select

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
in a character rig so first you select

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.950 
in a character rig so first you select
the<00:00:40.649> object<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.610> be<00:00:41.700> driven<00:00:42.030> by<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the object is to be driven by the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.260 
the object is to be driven by the
constraint<00:00:43.440> itself<00:00:43.860> at<00:00:44.070> first<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.879> instance

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
constraint itself at first this instance

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.880 
constraint itself at first this instance
I<00:00:45.480> want<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.780> middle<00:00:46.079> box<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.680> that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
I want this middle box to have that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.860 
I want this middle box to have that
happen<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.090> go<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.239> animation

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
happen and then I go to animation

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.010 
happen and then I go to animation
constraints<00:00:49.760> position<00:00:50.760> constraint<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.960> I

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
constraints position constraint so I

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.900 
constraints position constraint so I
left<00:00:52.230> click<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.949> dotted<00:00:53.340> line<00:00:53.489> shows<00:00:53.730> up

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
left click the dotted line shows up

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.310 
left click the dotted line shows up
saying<00:00:54.120> pick<00:00:54.239> something<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.809> I'm<00:00:55.079> just

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
saying pick something and I'm just

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.439 
saying pick something and I'm just
grabbing<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.340> box<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> side

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
grabbing this box to here on the side

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.529 
grabbing this box to here on the side
and<00:00:57.960> I'm<00:00:58.350> left<00:00:58.559> clicking<00:00:59.180> you<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.210> see<00:01:00.420> what

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
and I'm left clicking you can see what

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.200 
and I'm left clicking you can see what
happens<00:01:00.780> right<00:01:00.899> away<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:02.190> first<00:01:02.789> cube<00:01:03.090> I

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
happens right away is the first cube I

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.450 
happens right away is the first cube I
had<00:01:03.359> selected<00:01:03.510> jumps<00:01:04.080> over<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.159> newly

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
had selected jumps over to the newly

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.370 
had selected jumps over to the newly
selected<00:01:05.580> box<00:01:06.000> -<00:01:06.270> that's<00:01:07.020> because<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
selected box - that's because the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.170 
selected box - that's because the
position<00:01:07.830> constraint

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
position constraint

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.560 
position constraint
kicked<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.080> essentially<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.420> sometimes<00:01:12.420> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
kicked in essentially and sometimes you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.359 
kicked in essentially and sometimes you
want<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.020> happen<00:01:13.140> other<00:01:13.470> times<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.070> want

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
want that to happen other times you want

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.520 
want that to happen other times you want
to<00:01:14.490> keep<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.790> at<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.570> rigid<00:01:15.750> original

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
to keep it at it's a rigid original

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.399 
to keep it at it's a rigid original
starting<00:01:17.430> location<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.229> you

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
starting location and to do that you

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.749 
starting location and to do that you
just<00:01:19.439> go<00:01:19.890> ahead<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.159> click<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.430> check<00:01:20.729> box

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
just go ahead and click this check box

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.830 
just go ahead and click this check box
here<00:01:21.060> saying<00:01:21.619> keep<00:01:22.619> initial<00:01:23.130> offset<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.659> put

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
here saying keep initial offset so I put

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.300 
here saying keep initial offset so I put
that<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.470> right<00:01:25.740> back<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.100> where<00:01:26.220> it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
that and it's right back to where it

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.480 
that and it's right back to where it
started<00:01:26.340> from<00:01:27.110> it's<00:01:28.110> also<00:01:28.259> with<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.680> initial

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
started from it's also with this initial

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.390 
started from it's also with this initial
box<00:01:29.700> selected<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.439> in<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.619> motion<00:01:32.009> tab<00:01:32.159> up

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
box selected and in the motion tab up

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.260 
box selected and in the motion tab up
here<00:01:33.020> you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.170> under<00:01:34.880> position<00:01:35.880> that

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
here you can see under position that

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.690 
here you can see under position that
position<00:01:36.869> constraint<00:01:37.680> has<00:01:38.159> been<00:01:38.369> added<00:01:38.670> to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
position constraint has been added to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.899 
position constraint has been added to
the<00:01:38.880> position<00:01:39.299> list<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.430> down<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.880> says

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
the position list and down here it says

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.719 
the position list and down here it says
target<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.930> then<00:01:43.079> weight<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.399> it's

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
target and then weight and it so it's

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.760 
target and then weight and it so it's
saying<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.390> target<00:01:45.780> right<00:01:45.869> now<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.200> box<00:01:46.439> two

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
saying the target right now is box two

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.800 
saying the target right now is box two
which<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.540> saying<00:01:48.689> that

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
which is this one so it's saying that

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.859 
which is this one so it's saying that
this<00:01:49.020> box<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.970> position<00:01:50.970> constrain<00:01:51.360> -<00:01:51.509> box<00:01:51.750> -

rotate that other cube but the other box

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.540 
rotate that other cube but the other box

the orientation constraint that I
covered<00:02:40.140> last<00:02:40.319> week<00:02:40.520> also<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.760> can<00:02:41.940> still<00:02:42.150> scale

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
covered last week also I can still scale

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.660 
covered last week also I can still scale
this<00:02:42.600> box<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.170> again<00:02:43.260> no<00:02:44.220> data<00:02:44.489> is

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
this box and again no data is

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.560 
this box and again no data is
transferred<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.390> other<00:02:46.110> box<00:02:46.410> so

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
transferred to this other box so

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.060 
transferred to this other box so
position<00:02:48.570> stays<00:02:48.810> even<00:02:49.200> after<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.500> rotate<00:02:49.950> or

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
position stays even after I rotate or

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.000 
position stays even after I rotate or
scale<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.790> object<00:02:52.670> okay<00:02:53.670> so<00:02:54.500> we<00:02:55.500> set<00:02:55.709> back<00:02:55.980> a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
scale the object okay so we set back a

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.949 
scale the object okay so we set back a
little<00:02:56.340> bit<00:02:56.459> here<00:02:56.670> another<00:02:57.510> cool<00:02:57.750> thing<00:02:57.780> you

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
little bit here another cool thing you

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.380 
little bit here another cool thing you
can<00:02:58.080> do<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.500> actually<00:02:58.950> have<00:02:59.430> this<00:02:59.910> object

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
can do is actually have this object

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.210 
can do is actually have this object
controlled<00:03:01.140> by<00:03:01.260> multiple<00:03:01.470> position

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
controlled by multiple position

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.180 
controlled by multiple position
constraints<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.480> let's<00:03:04.230> say<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.440> have<00:03:04.709> this<00:03:04.890> box

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
constraints so let's say I have this box

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.520 
constraints so let's say I have this box
here<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:06.090> also<00:03:06.239> have<00:03:06.360> this<00:03:06.780> other<00:03:06.959> box<00:03:07.260> over

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
here and I also have this other box over

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.080 
here and I also have this other box over
to<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.739> side<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.280> want<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.640> keep<00:03:08.790> this<00:03:09.030> one

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
to the side and I want to keep this one

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.810 
to the side and I want to keep this one
always<00:03:09.660> in<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.870> center<00:03:10.080> bit<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.739> two<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.760> I

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
always in the center bit of the two so I

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.280 
always in the center bit of the two so I
go<00:03:12.000> back<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.209> clicking<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:12.900> one<00:03:13.110> because

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
go back to clicking this one because

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.440 
go back to clicking this one because
this<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.620> one<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:13.769> want<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.070> have<00:03:14.280> driven<00:03:14.700> by

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
this is the one I want to have driven by

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.020 
this is the one I want to have driven by
the<00:03:16.019> other<00:03:16.230> box<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.160> go<00:03:17.310> up<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.400> animation

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the other box and I go up to animation

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.720 
the other box and I go up to animation
constraints<00:03:19.160> position<00:03:20.160> constraint<00:03:20.579> and

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
constraints position constraint and

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.940 
constraints position constraint and
again<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.060> dotted<00:03:21.390> line<00:03:21.540> shows<00:03:21.780> up<00:03:21.930> go<00:03:22.799> ahead

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
again the dotted line shows up go ahead

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.800 
again the dotted line shows up go ahead

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
we're still in the motion tab position

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.400 
we're still in the motion tab position
section<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:45.450> then<00:03:45.570> position<00:03:45.930> constraint<00:03:46.260> you

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
section and then position constraint you

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.650 
section and then position constraint you
can<00:03:46.530> see<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.799> target<00:03:47.250> now<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:47.430> box<00:03:47.970> two<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.420> box

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
can see the target now is box two in box

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.199 
can see the target now is box two in box
three<00:03:49.110> and<00:03:49.320> this<00:03:49.950> target<00:03:50.250> way<00:03:50.519> down<00:03:50.730> here<00:03:51.060> it

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
three and this target way down here it

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.530 
three and this target way down here it
was<00:03:51.450> locked<00:03:51.720> out<00:03:51.900> before<00:03:52.230> but<00:03:52.380> now<00:03:52.530> it's<00:03:53.540> 50%

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
was locked out before but now it's 50%

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.050 
was locked out before but now it's 50%
here<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.049> 50%<00:03:55.440> here<00:03:55.799> so<00:03:56.400> what<00:03:56.519> happens<00:03:56.880> is

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
here and 50% here so what happens is

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.259 
here and 50% here so what happens is
when<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:57.480> move<00:03:57.750> this<00:03:58.079> box<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:59.700> can<00:03:59.850> see<00:04:00.090> that's

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
when I move this box you can see that's

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.110 
when I move this box you can see that's
no<00:04:00.510> longer<00:04:00.900> fully<00:04:01.519> moving<00:04:02.519> at<00:04:02.640> a<00:04:02.670> one-to-one

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
no longer fully moving at a one-to-one

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.780 
no longer fully moving at a one-to-one
with<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.840> original<00:04:04.079> cube<00:04:04.620> because<00:04:05.430> it's<00:04:05.610> now

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
with that original cube because it's now

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.940 
with that original cube because it's now
also<00:04:06.150> getting<00:04:06.390> data<00:04:06.690> from<00:04:07.079> this<00:04:07.260> new<00:04:07.440> box<00:04:07.680> that

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
also getting data from this new box that

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.949 
also getting data from this new box that
we<00:04:08.040> assigned<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.609> so<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.299> can<00:04:09.420> always<00:04:09.630> have

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
we assigned to it so you can always have

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.949 
we assigned to it so you can always have
it<00:04:09.989> in<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.500> center<00:04:11.060> between<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.299> two<00:04:12.540> objects

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
it in the center between the two objects

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.520 
it in the center between the two objects
positions<00:04:13.970> which<00:04:14.970> is<00:04:15.090> kind<00:04:15.299> of<00:04:15.329> neat

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
positions which is kind of neat

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.370 
positions which is kind of neat
okay<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:17.489> now<00:04:17.790> we'll<00:04:17.850> move<00:04:18.030> on<00:04:18.269> I'll<00:04:18.540> just<00:04:18.750> make

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
okay so now we'll move on I'll just make

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.670 
okay so now we'll move on I'll just make
a<00:04:19.410> very<00:04:19.620> basic<00:04:20.180> bone<00:04:21.180> rig<00:04:21.480> it<00:04:22.290> kind<00:04:22.650> of

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
a very basic bone rig it kind of

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.860 
a very basic bone rig it kind of
approximates<00:04:23.460> what<00:04:23.760> an<00:04:24.030> arm<00:04:24.210> might<00:04:24.690> look<00:04:24.810> like

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
approximates what an arm might look like

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.650 
approximates what an arm might look like
for<00:04:25.320> our<00:04:25.410> character<00:04:25.740> rig<00:04:25.890> so<00:04:26.880> going<00:04:27.090> over<00:04:27.330> here

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
for our character rig so going over here

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.560 
for our character rig so going over here
to<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:27.990> top<00:04:28.200> view<00:04:28.670> go<00:04:29.670> into<00:04:29.820> animation<00:04:30.210> and

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
to the top view go into animation and

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.590 
to the top view go into animation and
then<00:04:30.990> down<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.590> bone<00:04:31.830> tools<00:04:32.240> just<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.360> quick

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
then down to bone tools just a quick

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.120 
then down to bone tools just a quick
easy<00:04:33.750> way<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:34.050> making<00:04:34.140> the<00:04:34.350> bones<00:04:34.560> so<00:04:34.890> I'm

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
easy way of making the bones so I'm

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.420 
easy way of making the bones so I'm
clicking<00:04:35.340> create<00:04:35.730> bone<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:37.040> these<00:04:38.040> settings

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
clicking create bone and these settings

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.480 
clicking create bone and these settings
should<00:04:38.940> work<00:04:39.750> for<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.500> scale<00:04:40.740> if<00:04:40.980> not<00:04:41.250> you<00:04:41.370> can

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
should work for the scale if not you can

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.940 
should work for the scale if not you can
always<00:04:41.610> change<00:04:41.790> that<00:04:41.940> later<00:04:42.560> I'll<00:04:43.560> go<00:04:43.770> ahead

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
then I'll turn it on so I can see these

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.010 
then I'll turn it on so I can see these
little<00:04:52.980> crosshairs<00:04:53.460> on<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.730> grid<00:04:53.940> and<00:04:54.120> I'll

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
little crosshairs on the grid and I'll

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.720 
little crosshairs on the grid and I'll
know<00:04:55.230> exactly<00:04:55.380> where<00:04:55.830> my<00:04:55.860> bones<00:04:56.220> will<00:04:56.430> end<00:04:56.580> up

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
know exactly where my bones will end up

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.000 
know exactly where my bones will end up
so<00:04:56.880> I'm<00:04:56.940> clicking<00:04:57.150> so<00:04:57.750> this<00:04:58.410> first<00:04:58.590> one<00:04:58.800> can

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
so I'm clicking so this first one can

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.220 
so I'm clicking so this first one can
act<00:04:59.250> almost<00:04:59.520> like<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.640> shoulder<00:05:00.000> joint<00:05:00.240> let's

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
act almost like a shoulder joint let's

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.830 
act almost like a shoulder joint let's
just<00:05:01.410> say<00:05:01.560> this<00:05:01.740> next<00:05:01.950> click<00:05:02.280> is<00:05:02.520> in<00:05:03.030> an<00:05:03.240> elbow

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
just say this next click is in an elbow

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.560 
just say this next click is in an elbow
and<00:05:04.169> maybe<00:05:04.560> this<00:05:04.950> third<00:05:05.430> one<00:05:05.640> can<00:05:05.970> act<00:05:06.150> as<00:05:06.330> our

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
and maybe this third one can act as our

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.570 
and maybe this third one can act as our
wrist<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:07.620> then<00:05:07.830> I'm<00:05:07.950> right<00:05:08.130> clicking<00:05:08.340> to

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
wrist and then I'm right clicking to

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.390 
wrist and then I'm right clicking to
finish<00:05:08.850> creating<00:05:09.660> of<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.169> joints<00:05:10.470> and<00:05:10.590> now

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
finish creating of the joints and now

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.590 
finish creating of the joints and now
you<00:05:11.460> can<00:05:11.610> see<00:05:11.760> here<00:05:11.910> bones<00:05:12.240> are<00:05:12.450> still

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
you can see here bones are still

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.240 
you can see here bones are still
activated<00:05:13.140> again<00:05:13.200> so<00:05:13.530> if<00:05:13.620> I<00:05:13.680> right<00:05:13.890> click<00:05:13.919> one

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
activated again so if I right click one

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.409 
activated again so if I right click one
more<00:05:14.280> time<00:05:14.520> it'll<00:05:15.300> deactivate<00:05:15.870> that<00:05:17.360> okay<00:05:18.360> so

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
more time it'll deactivate that okay so

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.630 
more time it'll deactivate that okay so
we<00:05:18.660> have<00:05:18.810> three<00:05:19.050> bones<00:05:19.340> but<00:05:20.340> no<00:05:20.460> way<00:05:20.610> to

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
we have three bones but no way to

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.700 
we have three bones but no way to
control<00:05:20.970> it<00:05:21.090> just<00:05:21.210> yet<00:05:21.570> so<00:05:21.780> we'll<00:05:22.410> take<00:05:22.530> care

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
control it just yet so we'll take care

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.310 
control it just yet so we'll take care
of<00:05:22.770> that<00:05:22.919> with<00:05:23.130> a<00:05:23.430> high<00:05:24.120> I<00:05:24.450> case<00:05:24.750> Oliver<00:05:25.140> and

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
of that with a high I case Oliver and

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.890 
of that with a high I case Oliver and
I'll<00:05:25.650> go<00:05:25.800> more<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:26.520> detail<00:05:26.850> on<00:05:26.970> rigging<00:05:27.419> at<00:05:27.840> a

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
I'll go more to detail on rigging at a

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.150 
I'll go more to detail on rigging at a
later<00:05:28.110> time<00:05:28.169> but<00:05:28.530> I'll<00:05:28.620> just<00:05:28.650> show<00:05:28.830> you<00:05:29.010> the

later time but I'll just show you the

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.340 
later time but I'll just show you the
basics<00:05:29.520> of<00:05:29.610> this<00:05:29.760> as<00:05:29.910> well<00:05:30.090> so<00:05:30.810> with<00:05:31.140> the

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
basics of this as well so with the

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.590 
basics of this as well so with the
shoulder<00:05:31.800> joint<00:05:32.100> selected<00:05:32.550> I'll<00:05:33.330> go<00:05:33.540> to

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
shoulder joint selected I'll go to

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.170 
shoulder joint selected I'll go to

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
solver and I'll click the object we have

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.390 
solver and I'll click the object we have
representing<00:05:39.419> our<00:05:39.540> wrist<00:05:40.130> so<00:05:41.130> you<00:05:41.220> can<00:05:41.310> now

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
representing our wrist so you can now

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.740 
representing our wrist so you can now
see<00:05:41.580> this<00:05:41.880> little<00:05:42.860> cross<00:05:43.860> herring<00:05:44.750> locator

essentially<00:05:46.470> popping<00:05:46.800> out<00:05:46.919> and<00:05:47.850> this<00:05:47.970> allows

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
essentially popping out and this allows

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.870 
essentially popping out and this allows
me<00:05:48.360> to<00:05:48.510> easily<00:05:48.630> drive<00:05:49.229> multiple<00:05:50.010> bone<00:05:50.370> objects

and<00:05:51.150> in<00:05:52.110> this<00:05:52.229> instance<00:05:52.440> it's<00:05:53.190> acting<00:05:53.490> kind<00:05:53.669> of

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
and in this instance it's acting kind of

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.090 
and in this instance it's acting kind of
like<00:05:53.850> an<00:05:53.970> arm<00:05:54.120> would<00:05:54.360> and<00:05:55.169> now<00:05:55.200> we<00:05:55.410> can<00:05:55.680> use<00:05:55.710> it

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
like an arm would and now we can use it

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.600 
like an arm would and now we can use it

this object if we wanted to so say this

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.190 
this object if we wanted to so say this

I'm going for the spines go ahead make a

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.200 
I'm going for the spines go ahead make a
circle<00:06:16.430> just<00:06:17.430> go<00:06:17.550> ahead<00:06:17.610> and<00:06:17.790> drag<00:06:17.970> that<00:06:18.150> out

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210

and<00:06:18.600> right<00:06:18.780> click<00:06:19.020> and<00:06:20.240> then<00:06:21.240> over<00:06:21.570> here<00:06:21.600> for

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
and right click and then over here for

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.750 
and right click and then over here for
rendering<00:06:22.260> you<00:06:22.560> can<00:06:22.710> say<00:06:22.890> naval<00:06:23.280> and<00:06:23.460> viewport

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
rendering you can say naval and viewport

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.880 
rendering you can say naval and viewport
and<00:06:24.030> now<00:06:24.330> it<00:06:24.599> turns<00:06:24.930> into<00:06:25.140> almost<00:06:25.320> like<00:06:25.530> into<00:06:25.860> a

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
and now it turns into almost like into a

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:26.959 
and now it turns into almost like into a
polygon<00:06:26.400> object

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:26.969 
polygon object

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.049

which<00:06:27.059> is<00:06:27.179> quite<00:06:27.719> handy<00:06:28.729> another<00:06:29.729> handy

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:30.059 
which is quite handy another handy

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:32.089 
which is quite handy another handy
feature<00:06:30.089> I'll<00:06:30.449> show<00:06:30.629> you<00:06:30.689> is<00:06:30.959> the<00:06:31.169> align<00:06:31.499> so<00:06:31.979> if

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:32.099 
feature I'll show you is the align so if

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:35.029 
feature I'll show you is the align so if
I<00:06:32.219> hit<00:06:32.519> Alt<00:06:32.759> +<00:06:32.999> a<00:06:33.149> and<00:06:33.749> click<00:06:34.289> the<00:06:34.409> i<00:06:34.439> key<00:06:34.769> here

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
I hit Alt + a and click the i key here

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.850 
I hit Alt + a and click the i key here
you<00:06:35.189> can<00:06:35.669> see<00:06:35.789> it<00:06:35.879> jumps<00:06:36.209> right<00:06:36.329> to<00:06:36.389> it<00:06:36.659> and

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
you can see it jumps right to it and

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.789 
you can see it jumps right to it and
then<00:06:37.860> I<00:06:38.219> can<00:06:38.459> also<00:06:38.519> tell<00:06:38.909> it<00:06:39.059> to<00:06:39.179> match<00:06:39.389> its

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:39.799 
then I can also tell it to match its

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:45.619 
then I can also tell it to match its
orientations<00:06:40.799> if<00:06:41.429> I<00:06:41.639> need<00:06:41.849> it<00:06:41.969> to<00:06:44.329> or<00:06:45.329> I<00:06:45.449> can

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:45.629 
orientations if I need it to or I can

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:51.549 
orientations if I need it to or I can
apply<00:06:45.929> and<00:06:46.799> then<00:06:47.610> I<00:06:47.759> can<00:06:47.909> also<00:06:48.029> just<00:06:48.269> rotate<00:06:48.659> it

00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:51.559 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:54.100 

okay

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
okay

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.869 
okay
scale<00:06:55.110> so<00:06:55.589> now<00:06:55.769> we<00:06:55.829> can<00:06:56.159> act<00:06:56.309> like<00:06:56.399> this<00:06:56.669> is

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:56.879 
scale so now we can act like this is

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:59.209 
scale so now we can act like this is
outside<00:06:57.419> of<00:06:57.449> our<00:06:57.629> characters<00:06:58.079> geometry<00:06:58.589> it's

00:06:59.209 --> 00:06:59.219 
outside of our characters geometry it's

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:01.039 
outside of our characters geometry it's
okay<00:06:59.459> it's<00:06:59.729> an<00:06:59.789> easy<00:06:59.969> locator<00:07:00.419> to<00:07:00.599> find<00:07:00.629> to

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:01.049 
okay it's an easy locator to find to

00:07:01.049 --> 00:07:03.350 
okay it's an easy locator to find to
move<00:07:01.349> the<00:07:01.529> rig<00:07:01.679> around<00:07:01.819> so<00:07:02.819> first<00:07:03.059> I'll<00:07:03.209> just

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
move the rig around so first I'll just

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.639 
move the rig around so first I'll just
go<00:07:03.449> ahead<00:07:03.509> and<00:07:03.689> freeze<00:07:03.899> this<00:07:04.019> real<00:07:04.229> fast

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:04.649 
go ahead and freeze this real fast

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:09.019 
go ahead and freeze this real fast
so<00:07:05.579> yes<00:07:05.879> and<00:07:06.749> now<00:07:07.079> I'll<00:07:07.229> use<00:07:07.259> the<00:07:07.769> power<00:07:07.919> of<00:07:08.099> our

00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:09.029 
so yes and now I'll use the power of our

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:13.189 
so yes and now I'll use the power of our
position<00:07:09.869> constraint<00:07:10.439> so<00:07:11.069> this<00:07:11.519> is<00:07:12.019> what<00:07:13.019> will

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 
position constraint so this is what will

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:16.850 
position constraint so this is what will
be<00:07:13.289> driven<00:07:13.559> by<00:07:13.999> this<00:07:15.259> so<00:07:16.259> I'm<00:07:16.349> selecting<00:07:16.559> the<00:07:16.829> I

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
be driven by this so I'm selecting the I

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.029 
be driven by this so I'm selecting the I
K<00:07:16.979> sank<00:07:17.879> animation<00:07:18.449> constraint<00:07:19.289> position

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 
K sank animation constraint position

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:21.739 
K sank animation constraint position
constraint<00:07:20.459> and<00:07:20.969> then<00:07:21.299> I'm<00:07:21.360> clicking<00:07:21.569> the

00:07:21.739 --> 00:07:21.749 
constraint and then I'm clicking the

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:27.229 
constraint and then I'm clicking the
circle<00:07:23.329> so<00:07:24.329> now<00:07:24.509> what<00:07:24.929> I<00:07:24.959> can<00:07:25.139> do<00:07:25.259> is<00:07:25.939> move<00:07:26.939> this

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:27.239 
circle so now what I can do is move this

00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:30.169 
circle so now what I can do is move this
control<00:07:27.839> object<00:07:28.289> and<00:07:28.589> have<00:07:29.279> it<00:07:29.399> follow<00:07:29.639> and

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:30.179 
control object and have it follow and

00:07:30.179 --> 00:07:33.529 
control object and have it follow and
drive<00:07:30.479> the<00:07:30.929> I<00:07:30.959> K<00:07:31.110> handle<00:07:31.769> which<00:07:32.279> is<00:07:32.399> great<00:07:32.610> so

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539 
drive the I K handle which is great so

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:36.819 
drive the I K handle which is great so
you<00:07:33.569> can<00:07:33.929> put<00:07:34.110> all<00:07:34.199> your<00:07:34.229> animation<00:07:34.769> data<00:07:34.949> on

00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:36.829 
you can put all your animation data on
