00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.639
 summer the welcome back and today's 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.190
 is all about the lifestyle theme 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.859
 Bodybuilding lifestyle is the lifestyle 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.050
 and is quite so called yes and 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.619
 In fact, quite often, one belongs to one 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.080
 a bit of lifestyle and we have to lead 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.210
 you have to ask this question 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.820
 particular lifestyle for and looks like 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.140
 you even out and so on 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.239
 on 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.950
 Here are the facts when you are in this bath 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.260
 Wildlife direction works 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.450
 Bodybuilding also means the body 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.329
 appropriate fashion style form 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.960
 everything to the beach figure sixpack or 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.370
 the whole meal is berlin and two and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.370
 Immediately fitness model 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.960
 So what that direction is all about then 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.750
 Be aware that we are specific 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.670
 have to do things that is to say their 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.100
 need at a particular fashion style 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.359
 trained and you have to one 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.240
 nourish certain way and 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.770
 regenerate accordingly 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.320
 They are three components that count 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.210
 most important I could not just go after 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.159
 lust and mood to go into training 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.740
 to do something and retrofit was 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.780
 somehow a water card so it comes 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.030
 There are certain things that one on the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.490
 you have to take care so that the body 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.780
 so to speak, adjust accordingly there at the end 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.850
 looks like we would like the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.829
 our ideals are also so 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.390
 I have to if I decide for it 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.159
 to go this way 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.659
 certain things in my life one 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.079
 film a specific training one 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.899
 certain trainings frequency one 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.540
 certain diet that is up 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.070
 must take certain things at least 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.880
 I see there are still differences there 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.579
 there are many ways 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.979
 but these basic principles I have to 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.170
 I must comply and comply 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.799
 of course, continue to know the muscles 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.520
 yes only or my body grow 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.940
 only changes in the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.860
 regeneration time so 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.110
 where I do not train , of course 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.320
 a particularly my body is spared 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.390
 By the way , a thousand other things 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.380
 Do not go to sleep and everything 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.230
 on and on 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.150
 All together, of course, leaves us 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.000
 somewhere or leads him to one 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.280
 have to lead certain lifestyle and 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.900
 think four areas just remember 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.380
 she comes to a different lifestyle 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.320
 for example, who is used to from friday 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.910
 until sunday party to make the night 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.490
 go through with alcohol 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.980
 volllaufen 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.740
 et cetera certain other things or 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.590
 to eat every day in the canteen 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.540
 or the dÃ¶nermann or whatever 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.430
 then you will just realize that it is 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.900
 of course not working because 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.890
 it does not give the corresponding results 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.630
 wants to lead 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.300
 We will, for example, if not enough 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.340
 sleep does not get bauer hans training 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.160
 to go and you have to decide 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.600
 okay what is more important for me what 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.420
 I would rather reach and then 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.430
 you will automatically notice that you 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.260
 your life must change and that he must 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.390
 to go in a certain direction 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.430
 Although you must nervously in all this 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.590
 Come on, just dangle lifestyle 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.190
 yes there would have to be pure you have to 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.500
 to comply with these rules 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.480
 so that you are accordingly fine 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.920
 Of course there is not only one way 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.020
 Every year he has different ones 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.989
 not really like that now 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.730
 to judge a professional like that every year 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.320
 different life circumstances and you 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.600
 must find and own way 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.340
 Nevertheless, I have the basic principles 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.920
 Adhere to it and now just adapt that 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.720
 So you will not come around for it 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.910
 if you change your body 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.800
 also wants her lifestyle to be his 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.900
 attitude and that actually in 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.670
 the most important of all of them 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.040
 still right nutrition even more important 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.340
 as the training is superior 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.269
 adjust accordingly or settings 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.010
 Accordingly, because he does not 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.660
 others do not work either 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.980
 Functionally , you become subconscious 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.300
 simply resist 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.700
 and in the end he will 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.500
 no decent results 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.870
 get that over a bit 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.550
 thoughts if you are still in the 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.590
 At the beginning you are what to expect 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.360
 that maybe live a life 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.870
 had to restructure no matter how yours 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.220
 Going out now also had to board or 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.630
 will decrease or whatever that 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.250
 not just a short-term thing 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.459
 but that's just like her 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.640
 living according to this would have to be more or 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.590
 less as I said if you 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.670
 wanted to receive corresponding results 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.450
 That's it 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.450
 thanks for watching
