00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
indie games it's the same thing except

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.150 
indie games it's the same thing except
it<00:04:15.890> brings<00:04:16.130> you<00:04:16.250> exactly<00:04:17.000> by<00:04:17.269> into<00:04:17.900> sort<00:04:18.289> by

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
release date so it's it basically it

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.420

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
same restrictions it's just I guess a

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.980 
same restrictions it's just I guess a
little<00:04:28.039> bit<00:04:28.190> more<00:04:28.370> intuitive<00:04:28.660> but<00:04:29.660> actually

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
little bit more intuitive but actually

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.110 
little bit more intuitive but actually
takes<00:04:30.139> more<00:04:30.979> button<00:04:31.310> presses<00:04:31.610> to<00:04:31.639> get<00:04:31.910> to<00:04:32.030> the

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
takes more button presses to get to the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.350 
takes more button presses to get to the
same<00:04:32.300> spot<00:04:32.600> it<00:04:33.530> just<00:04:33.590> it<00:04:34.100> gives<00:04:34.280> you<00:04:34.430> less<00:04:34.789> less

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
same spot it just it gives you less less

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.820 
same spot it just it gives you less less
options<00:04:35.570> I<00:04:35.900> think<00:04:36.139> that<00:04:36.260> this<00:04:36.350> is<00:04:36.500> actually<00:04:36.770> a

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
options I think that this is actually a

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.370 
options I think that this is actually a
better<00:04:37.210> interface<00:04:38.210> for<00:04:38.630> it<00:04:38.750> because<00:04:39.050> you<00:04:39.289> know

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
better interface for it because you know

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.689 
better interface for it because you know
you've<00:04:39.560> got<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.889> dream<00:04:40.039> built<00:04:40.280> play<00:04:40.490> right

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
you've got the dream built play right

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.370 
you've got the dream built play right
there<00:04:40.850> you've<00:04:41.000> got<00:04:41.030> Kotaku's<00:04:41.750> favorites

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
there you've got Kotaku's favorites

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.230 
there you've got Kotaku's favorites
right<00:04:42.500> up<00:04:42.650> there<00:04:42.800> and<00:04:43.729> I<00:04:43.820> think<00:04:43.970> it's<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.120> better

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
right up there and I think it's a better

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.270 
right up there and I think it's a better
showing<00:04:44.870> of<00:04:45.139> the<00:04:45.229> indie<00:04:45.410> games<00:04:45.590> but<00:04:46.070> either

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
showing of the indie games but either

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.040 
showing of the indie games but either
way<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.789> point<00:04:47.000> is<00:04:47.150> that<00:04:47.300> you<00:04:47.389> can<00:04:47.510> go<00:04:47.720> into

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
way the point is that you can go into

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.290 
way the point is that you can go into
game<00:04:48.320> type<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:48.800> then<00:04:49.580> you<00:04:49.729> can<00:04:49.910> choose<00:04:50.060> any

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
game type and then you can choose any

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.029 
game type and then you can choose any
games<00:04:51.099> and<00:04:52.840> you<00:04:53.840> can<00:04:54.080> you<00:04:54.410> know<00:04:54.440> then<00:04:54.710> look<00:04:54.919> at

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
games and you can you know then look at

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.850 
games and you can you know then look at
your<00:04:55.220> release<00:04:55.700> date<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.470> you<00:04:57.470> know<00:04:57.530> sort<00:04:57.770> of

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
your release date and you know sort of

one that needs to be brought up is the

can't<00:05:13.940> sort<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:14.300> by<00:05:14.419> genre<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:16.490> know<00:05:16.580> that

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
can't sort it by genre you know that

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.050 
can't sort it by genre you know that
this<00:05:17.270> is<00:05:17.449> it<00:05:17.630> and<00:05:18.340> not<00:05:19.340> only<00:05:19.490> that<00:05:19.610> but

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
this is it and not only that but

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.330 
this is it and not only that but
obviously<00:05:21.250> it's<00:05:22.250> just<00:05:23.000> not<00:05:23.270> very<00:05:23.830> intuitive<00:05:24.830> I

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
obviously it's just not very intuitive I

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.400 
obviously it's just not very intuitive I
don't<00:05:26.090> understand<00:05:26.720> why<00:05:26.870> I<00:05:26.900> would<00:05:27.169> care<00:05:27.380> more

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
don't understand why I would care more

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
don't understand why I would care more
about<00:05:27.680> add-ons<00:05:28.280> and<00:05:29.530> demos<00:05:30.530> than<00:05:31.039> I<00:05:31.190> would

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
about add-ons and demos than I would

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.960 
about add-ons and demos than I would
about<00:05:31.729> sorting<00:05:32.210> between<00:05:32.599> arcade<00:05:33.320> and<00:05:33.970> xbox

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
about sorting between arcade and xbox

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.110 
about sorting between arcade and xbox
indie<00:05:35.210> games<00:05:36.400> but<00:05:37.400> that's<00:05:37.760> where<00:05:37.970> we're<00:05:38.060> at

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
indie games but that's where we're at

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.580 
indie games but that's where we're at
right<00:05:38.270> now<00:05:38.479> so<00:05:38.690> I<00:05:38.930> just<00:05:39.080> want<00:05:39.229> to<00:05:39.440> make<00:05:39.560> sure

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
right now so I just want to make sure

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.260 
right now so I just want to make sure
that<00:05:39.949> that<00:05:40.070> was<00:05:40.250> covered<00:05:40.610> you<00:05:40.760> can<00:05:40.849> get<00:05:41.030> to<00:05:41.150> it

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
that that was covered you can get to it

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.000 
that that was covered you can get to it
by<00:05:41.449> game<00:05:41.690> type<00:05:41.930> and<00:05:42.580> again<00:05:44.680> it's<00:05:45.680> still<00:05:45.889> not

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
by game type and again it's still not

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.220 
by game type and again it's still not
good
