00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:12.490
 good review of a new speed cube 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:14.019
 the mailing then I now admit that the 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.910
 review of these spent cube 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.790
 especially these of the wife begin 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.009
 to become heavy in the sense that you 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.880
 characteristics are always those 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:28.689
 or cuts to 45 cuts approximately one verse 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:32.079
 thirty cubes fast at the limit someone 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.420
 more someone less controllable i 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.780
 stickers are always those 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:42.370
 ok a sprite with light blue with a blue 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.640
 clear of poor quality but for that 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.840
 some may even be fine 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.200
 because in short the characteristics well 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.420
 worth are those changes the feeling e 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.210
 change maybe has limits at the level of 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.890
 the parameters can be checked for the rest 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.410
 now they are always the same as the last ones 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.730
 cubes on the market 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.399
 let's say in the last year let's put it 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.030
 so more or less last year above all 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.010
 and the wife are all very similar to 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.430
 regarding the features from 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.159
 speed cube then someone a little faster 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.510
 a little less changes the feeling 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.720
 the main features are 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.090
 those we see very quickly with 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.290
 this cube in this cube which are the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.210
 main features 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.360
 in addition to the fact that those who put the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:33.960
 stickers I think was a blind person 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.960
 cut at 45 without problems 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.080
 and something more this is a bit 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.909
 particularly narrow or yellow glyphs 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.260
 kato the choir the chat plastic e 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:47.049
 dry cuts at 45 quietly 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:51.549
 different cut approximately operates at 30 degrees 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:54.450
 usual stall problem anyway 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.710
 then touch in the middle of the regular cut 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.520
 excellent as all the last nightmares 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.219
 generation 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:08.450
 let's see some finger tricks 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:10.599
 we can make a girl a piece had 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.599
 here 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.760
 in short, the cube is very fast 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.379
 all in all controllable there is a way 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.840
 out of the way among controllables not 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.730
 controllable because google fast le 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.780
 faces go a little bit on behalf 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.430
 their 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.489
 but not as much as maybe a weilong 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.090
 here's what else to say 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:38.450
 the size is a cube of I think 56 mm 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.790
 approximately perhaps between 55 56 and slightly 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.549
 small though it may be that I am 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.230
 wrong due to the size of 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.280
 stickers that is much smaller than 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.780
 before 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.610
 they are also saving on this 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.069
 maybe I do not know 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.099
 the logo of the wife so this is not 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.910
 of the ypsilon j 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.000
 among other things there is a little something 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.420
 particular I don't know if with light 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.940
 here is a layer of plastic 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:09.620
 transparent on the logo but protrudes into 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.299
 immoderate manner in the cube for which it is from 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.630
 eliminate by force and I think it is 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.280
 this thing transparent that this 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.100
 plastic transparency that contains the 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.380
 logo thus eliminating this is mine 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.870
 the logo but in short, not bad is not a 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:28.250
 problem for sure the speakers 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.319
 I suggest replacing them then cutting 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.959
 cutting people we saw speed 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:38.480
 we have sight and control and this is the 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:42.079
 feeling the noise heard the plastics 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.590
 they are a bit cheap to know about the cube 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:49.489
 cinesinho with bed in various stores that 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.650
 it is called one in version 2 but the 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:56.450
 name also on the box on the 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.950
 packaging is the ing for which I don't know if 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.520
 if it has anything to do with juan 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.680
 in god I show you the pieces maybe there 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.440
 we compare with an excellent only and for 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.840
 of winning here we have then here 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.030
 ning and so are edge and corner of the 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.410
 winning those pieces of the leading them 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:20.340
 let's compare immediately then here we have a 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.889
 right the edge of the winning then 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.580
 version 1 and here of the engineer who they say is 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:29.030
 al one in version 2 undeniably are 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.389
 very similar 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:38.270
 we see the details in light 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:44.070
 then this is the leaking and a guide 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:50.160
 here along the surface is a turbid a 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:53.389
 this part compared to the one in the 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.389
 cloudy and wider 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.100
 however the pieces are very similar 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.320
 enel warning there is no guide for 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.850
 we look so much like we see 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.560
 corners 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.430
 then I think the angles are 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.039
 completely different because the corners 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.660
 of the warning had the characteristic 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:16.789
 here it is evident that we have practically no 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:20.580
 on a walkable surface for which I am 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:24.660
 corners a bit special fees while 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.039
 the leading ones are open here 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:34.139
 in the area 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:36.150
 let's say flory al mod here though but I'm 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:40.889
 trying to look a bit if the pieces me 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:43.789
 they look quite different too 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:47.300
 the stem towards the coupling of the 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.479
 in the longest corner the 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.539
 fiend 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:56.569
 let's say version 1 so I don't know 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:59.009
 honestly it doesn't seem like a version 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.819
 everything seems like a good cube to me 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:02.069
 version 2 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:05.430
 yes he remembers it a little in the mechanism 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:09.349
 but as a cube of his wife he does not remember 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:12.360
 all the cubes are all a bit 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:15.120
 briquettes vary from other cubes or 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.949
 cubes of the same wife or cubes of others 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.930
 of other manufacturers 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.930
 let's see if I can inter only inside 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:27.240
 no I can't open anyway there isn't 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.500
 we have so much more to say the pieces 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.629
 given the characteristics we have 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.270
 views it seems ridiculous to go too 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:34.710
 forward on a cube that does not offer 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.360
 nothing particularly new if not 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.219
 a file in a different bit so e 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.409
 someone might like you 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:41.789
 features allow allow 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:44.909
 whatever cloves hoover also super 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:47.009
 advanced to do speed tubing like it 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:48.839
 It should have nothing to envy compared 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:51.120
 to all the cubes that came out recently 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:52.919
 and at this point it only depends on the tastes 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.449
 and I can only say approved low cost 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:57.569
 a very few euros if I remember correctly 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:59.659
 around 4 euros 5 euros but what of 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:59.659
 gender 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.050
 enter is part of collection one 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.610
 valid slice is evaluated on the film va 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.500
 good for your way your style 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.210
 and I would say we can see the 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.740
 next video maybe with the likes of that 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.189
 should arrive in the coming days 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.189
 See you soon
