begin though I should point out that I

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.130 
begin though I should point out that I
removed<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:19.910> front<00:00:20.029> coupler<00:00:20.509> in<00:00:20.630> my<00:00:20.720> memory

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
removed the front coupler in my memory

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.829 
removed the front coupler in my memory
because<00:00:21.589> I<00:00:22.009> just<00:00:22.970> don't<00:00:23.150> see<00:00:23.359> him<00:00:23.449> do<00:00:23.570> a<00:00:23.599> lot<00:00:23.810> of

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:23.839 
because I just don't see him do a lot of

because I just don't see him do a lot of
shunting<00:00:24.380> in<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:24.650> series<00:00:25.189> and<00:00:26.710> yeah<00:00:28.869> Bachman

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
has done a wonderful job on Henry and I

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.959 
has done a wonderful job on Henry and I
should<00:00:33.469> point<00:00:33.710> out<00:00:33.859> that<00:00:33.920> they<00:00:34.280> modelled<00:00:34.730> him

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
should point out that they modelled him

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.009 
should point out that they modelled him
on<00:00:35.210> his<00:00:35.449> new<00:00:36.379> shape<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.600> I<00:00:38.600> don't<00:00:38.750> get<00:00:38.899> why

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
on his new shape and I don't get why

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.080 
on his new shape and I don't get why
everybody<00:00:39.440> wants<00:00:39.590> Bachman<00:00:40.370> to<00:00:40.460> make<00:00:40.640> an<00:00:40.850> old

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
everybody wants Bachman to make an old

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.200 
everybody wants Bachman to make an old
shape<00:00:41.449> Henry<00:00:42.039> he<00:00:43.039> was<00:00:43.129> only<00:00:43.430> like<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:43.910> for

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
shape Henry he was only like that for

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:51.459 
shape Henry he was only like that for
about<00:00:45.340> 2<00:00:46.600> 5<00:00:47.769> episodes<00:00:48.769> and<00:00:50.019> for<00:00:51.019> the<00:00:51.109> rest<00:00:51.260> of

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
about 2 5 episodes and for the rest of

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.829 
about 2 5 episodes and for the rest of
the<00:00:51.559> series<00:00:51.800> he's<00:00:52.070> been<00:00:52.250> in<00:00:52.730> his<00:00:53.149> new<00:00:53.449> shape

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
the series he's been in his new shape

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.150 
the series he's been in his new shape
and<00:00:54.140> I<00:00:54.739> just<00:00:54.980> think<00:00:55.370> people<00:00:55.609> should<00:00:57.160> let

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
and I just think people should let

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.910 
and I just think people should let
Bachman<00:00:58.699> decide<00:00:59.390> what<00:01:00.079> version<00:01:00.530> they<00:01:00.620> want<00:01:00.829> to

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
Bachman decide what version they want to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.569 
Bachman decide what version they want to
make<00:01:01.039> Henry<00:01:01.249> in<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:02.499> just<00:01:03.499> for<00:01:03.800> kicks<00:01:04.040> I

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:04.579 
make Henry in and just for kicks I

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:07.569 
make Henry in and just for kicks I
replaced<00:01:05.479> one<00:01:05.840> of<00:01:05.960> Henry's<00:01:06.140> lamp<00:01:06.710> irons<00:01:07.159> with

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
replaced one of Henry's lamp irons with

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.730 
replaced one of Henry's lamp irons with
a<00:01:07.970> lamp<00:01:10.150> it<00:01:11.150> just<00:01:11.390> reminds<00:01:11.930> me<00:01:12.110> of<00:01:12.229> his<00:01:12.380> flying

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
a lamp it just reminds me of his flying

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.719 
a lamp it just reminds me of his flying
kipper<00:01:13.100> at<00:01:13.479> estimating<00:01:14.649> they've<00:01:15.649> got<00:01:16.009> a<00:01:16.040> short

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
kipper at estimating they've got a short

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.649 
kipper at estimating they've got a short
stumpy<00:01:17.240> funnel<00:01:17.509> right<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:19.790> wheel<00:01:20.149> arches

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
stumpy funnel right the wheel arches

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.980 
stumpy funnel right the wheel arches
match<00:01:21.140> up<00:01:21.439> perfectly<00:01:21.710> with<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.310> wheels

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
match up perfectly with the wheels

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.450 
match up perfectly with the wheels
there's<00:01:23.990> just<00:01:24.320> one<00:01:24.649> thing<00:01:24.680> I<00:01:25.070> want<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.310> point

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
there's just one thing I want to point

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.090 
there's just one thing I want to point
out<00:01:25.640> about<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.180> wheels<00:01:26.390> I<00:01:26.840> think<00:01:27.680> they<00:01:27.860> made

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
out about the wheels I think they made

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.020 
out about the wheels I think they made
the<00:01:28.420> rods<00:01:29.420> on<00:01:29.840> these<00:01:30.770> wheels<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.579> little<00:01:31.610> too

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
the rods on these wheels a little too

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.980 
the rods on these wheels a little too
thick<00:01:32.829> that's<00:01:33.829> just<00:01:34.250> in<00:01:34.430> my<00:01:34.579> opinion<00:01:35.149> but<00:01:35.840> it

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
thick that's just in my opinion but it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.600 
thick that's just in my opinion but it
doesn't<00:01:36.229> really<00:01:36.320> draw<00:01:36.680> a<00:01:36.710> fact<00:01:37.130> from<00:01:37.490> the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
doesn't really draw a fact from the

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.420 
doesn't really draw a fact from the
overall<00:01:37.909> quality<00:01:38.299> of<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.689> model<00:01:38.960> I<00:01:39.430> just

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
overall quality of the model I just

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.209 
overall quality of the model I just
think<00:01:40.670> they<00:01:40.759> should<00:01:40.939> be<00:01:41.060> thinner<00:01:41.479> like

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
think they should be thinner like

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:49.060 
think they should be thinner like
Spencer's<00:01:43.270> see<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.509> difference

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.600 

I'll<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.640> face<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:52.200> face<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.740> molded
