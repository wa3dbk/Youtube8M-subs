into<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.880> book<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.360> read<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.079> very<00:00:37.440> long

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
into this book and I read in a very long

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.020 
into this book and I read in a very long
time<00:00:37.649> ago<00:00:38.010> I'd<00:00:38.100> actually<00:00:38.250> probably<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
time ago I'd actually probably have to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.670 
time ago I'd actually probably have to
start<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.480> very<00:00:39.719> beginning<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.320> finish

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
start it in the very beginning to finish

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.490 
start it in the very beginning to finish
it<00:00:40.860> at<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.100> point<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.140> short

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
it at this point but it's so so so short

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.639 
it at this point but it's so so so short
like<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.190> short<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.820> i<00:00:45.600> feel<00:00:46.230> like<00:00:46.440> when<00:00:46.620> i

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
like so short but i feel like when i

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.260 
like so short but i feel like when i
started<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.430> i<00:00:47.520> really<00:00:47.550> liked<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.149> because

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
started it and i really liked it because

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.600 
started it and i really liked it because
I<00:00:48.420> loved<00:00:48.690> warm<00:00:48.930> bodies<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.680> was<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.460> as

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
I loved warm bodies and it was just as

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.060 
I loved warm bodies and it was just as
good<00:00:50.670> um<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.960> reason<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.350> didn't<00:00:52.710> finish<00:00:52.920> it

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
good um the reason I didn't finish it

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.590 
good um the reason I didn't finish it
was<00:00:53.370> because<00:00:53.670> they're<00:00:53.850> still<00:00:54.149> wasn't<00:00:54.510> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
through this and I remember everything

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.380 
through this and I remember everything
that<00:01:19.530> I've<00:01:19.799> read<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.130> far<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.210> see

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that I've read so far but as you can see

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.170 
that I've read so far but as you can see
this<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.689> actually<00:01:21.990> an<00:01:22.049> arc<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.549> got<00:01:24.060> about

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
this is actually an arc so I got about

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.609 
this is actually an arc so I got about
halfway<00:01:24.390> through<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.990> realized<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.530> I'd

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
halfway through and realized that I'd

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.020 
halfway through and realized that I'd
probably<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.130> wait<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.310> while<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
probably have to wait a while for the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.770 
probably have to wait a while for the
third<00:01:27.299> book<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.979> I<00:01:28.979> stopped<00:01:29.250> um<00:01:29.780> mainly

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
third book and I stopped um mainly

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.109 
third book and I stopped um mainly
because<00:01:31.049> these<00:01:31.920> books<00:01:32.220> are<00:01:32.340> actually<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:32.880> so

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
because these books are actually so so

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.899 
because these books are actually so so
so<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.600> good<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.590> prefer<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.460> read<00:01:35.700> them

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
so so good but I prefer to read them

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.749

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
over the summer this year because it

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.590 
over the summer this year because it
won't<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:46.979> long<00:01:47.579> until<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.329> wait

for the fourth book so that is the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.830

know why I haven't finished this because

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.780

pages left until I'm finished but I

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.750 
pages left until I'm finished but I
think<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.629> might<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:11.640> like

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
think it might be that like

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.429 
think it might be that like
maybe<00:02:13.450> it's<00:02:13.629> like<00:02:13.750> some<00:02:13.810> kind<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.260> like

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439 
maybe it's like some kind of like

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.990 
maybe it's like some kind of like
subconscious<00:02:14.980> thing<00:02:15.189> like<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.580> end<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.819> wing

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
subconscious thing like the end of wing

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.059 
subconscious thing like the end of wing
or<00:02:16.150> just<00:02:16.330> destroyed<00:02:16.870> my<00:02:16.900> heart<00:02:17.439> and<00:02:17.650> my<00:02:17.829> soul

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
or just destroyed my heart and my soul

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.369 
or just destroyed my heart and my soul
and<00:02:18.340> my<00:02:18.430> life<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.060> maybe<00:02:19.659> I'm<00:02:19.870> just<00:02:20.019> concerned

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
and my life and maybe I'm just concerned

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:21.780

that<00:02:20.530> this<00:02:20.739> one<00:02:20.920> will<00:02:21.040> do<00:02:21.189> the<00:02:21.340> same<00:02:21.370> thing

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
that this one will do the same thing

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.059 
that this one will do the same thing
subconsciously<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.900> don't<00:02:23.260> know<00:02:23.349> but<00:02:23.799> this<00:02:23.950> is

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
I'll completely forget that I was

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.710 
I'll completely forget that I was
partway<00:03:38.650> through<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.430> first<00:03:39.669> book<00:03:39.910> I<00:03:40.209> don't

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
partway through the first book I don't

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.089 
partway through the first book I don't
know<00:03:40.780> if<00:03:40.900> that<00:03:41.079> happens<00:03:41.379> to<00:03:41.500> any<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.680> you<00:03:41.919> but

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
know if that happens to any of you but

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.220 
know if that happens to any of you but
it<00:03:42.160> happens<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.549> me<00:03:42.669> quite<00:03:42.699> often<00:03:43.239> and<00:03:43.599> I<00:03:43.780> feel

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
it happens to me quite often and I feel

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.080 
it happens to me quite often and I feel
like<00:03:44.260> once<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:44.620> put<00:03:44.829> a<00:03:44.859> book<00:03:45.069> down<00:03:45.400> it's<00:03:45.819> a<00:03:45.940> lot

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
like once I put a book down it's a lot

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.229 
like once I put a book down it's a lot
harder<00:03:46.389> to<00:03:47.169> pick<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.620> back<00:03:47.829> up<00:03:48.069> than<00:03:48.699> it<00:03:48.730> is<00:03:48.970> to

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
harder to pick it back up than it is to

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.189 
harder to pick it back up than it is to
just<00:03:49.419> start<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.930> new<00:03:50.109> book<00:03:50.319> so<00:03:51.069> yeah<00:03:52.000> but<00:03:52.540> this

only have four short stories left in

only have four short stories left in
this<00:05:16.390> and<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:16.780> think<00:05:16.840> the<00:05:17.230> main<00:05:17.410> reason<00:05:17.440> I

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
this and I think the main reason I

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.440 
this and I think the main reason I
haven't<00:05:17.860> finished<00:05:18.190> it<00:05:18.310> is<00:05:18.460> that<00:05:18.970> it's<00:05:19.240> no

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
haven't finished it is that it's no

haven't finished it is that it's no

season and that's where this is based on

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.400 
season and that's where this is based on
and<00:05:24.550> it's<00:05:25.300> kind<00:05:25.480> of<00:05:25.540> a<00:05:25.630> little<00:05:25.840> bit<00:05:25.930> harder<00:05:26.260> to
