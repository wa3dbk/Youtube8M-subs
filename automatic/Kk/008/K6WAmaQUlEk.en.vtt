computer and it doesn't use an ATX size
power<00:00:30.010> supply<00:00:30.430> a<00:00:30.670> lot<00:00:31.000> of<00:00:31.090> times<00:00:31.270> it's<00:00:31.420> really

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
power supply a lot of times it's really

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.200 
power supply a lot of times it's really
hard<00:00:31.960> to<00:00:32.080> find<00:00:32.349> a<00:00:32.590> micro<00:00:33.340> ATX<00:00:33.400> power<00:00:33.760> supply<00:00:34.090> as

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
hard to find a micro ATX power supply as

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.729 
hard to find a micro ATX power supply as
a<00:00:34.239> matter<00:00:34.449> of<00:00:34.540> fact<00:00:34.600> it's<00:00:34.870> darn<00:00:35.500> near

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
a matter of fact it's darn near

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.619 
a matter of fact it's darn near
impossible<00:00:35.770> because<00:00:36.460> I've<00:00:36.550> almost<00:00:36.699> never

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
impossible because I've almost never

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:38.850 
impossible because I've almost never
been<00:00:37.720> able<00:00:37.870> to<00:00:37.989> find<00:00:38.080> one<00:00:38.320> that<00:00:38.350> needed<00:00:38.650> one

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
been able to find one that needed one

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.860 
been able to find one that needed one
they've<00:00:39.519> seemed<00:00:39.760> to<00:00:39.850> be<00:00:39.970> available<00:00:40.120> in<00:00:40.360> Europe

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
they've seemed to be available in Europe

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.869 
they've seemed to be available in Europe
and<00:00:41.110> in<00:00:41.290> Asia<00:00:41.470> but<00:00:42.100> never<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.519> United<00:00:42.730> States

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
and in Asia but never the United States

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.030 
and in Asia but never the United States
and<00:00:43.150> so<00:00:43.449> ultra<00:00:43.870> has<00:00:44.290> finally<00:00:44.710> brought<00:00:44.860> to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
and so ultra has finally brought to

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.399 
and so ultra has finally brought to
market<00:00:45.220> that's<00:00:45.519> very<00:00:45.699> popular<00:00:46.150> and<00:00:46.900> it's<00:00:47.260> very

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409 
market that's very popular and it's very

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:48.689 
market that's very popular and it's very
useful<00:00:47.650> to<00:00:47.710> a<00:00:47.769> lot<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.040> people<00:00:48.190> making<00:00:48.519> these

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
useful to a lot of people making these

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.549 
useful to a lot of people making these

the smallest case possible but get to

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.680 
the smallest case possible but get to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
use an ATX power supply and all sudden

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.719 
use an ATX power supply and all sudden
you<00:01:05.080> know<00:01:05.110> boom<00:01:05.770> this<00:01:06.010> huge<00:01:06.250> power<00:01:06.430> supply

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
you know boom this huge power supply

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.160 
you know boom this huge power supply
comes<00:01:07.000> in<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.450> that's<00:01:07.570> gonna<00:01:07.720> take<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:07.900> lot<00:01:08.110> of

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
comes in and that's gonna take a lot of

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.570 
comes in and that's gonna take a lot of
space<00:01:08.440> in<00:01:08.470> your<00:01:08.650> case<00:01:08.920> especially<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.460> case

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
space in your case especially the case

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.330 
space in your case especially the case
is<00:01:09.760> designed<00:01:10.479> for<00:01:10.750> you<00:01:10.900> TX<00:01:11.140> it<00:01:11.320> just<00:01:11.560> almost

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
is designed for you TX it just almost

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.950 
is designed for you TX it just almost
doubles<00:01:12.909> the<00:01:13.090> size<00:01:13.119> that<00:01:13.510> the<00:01:13.630> computer<00:01:13.930> needs

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
doubles the size that the computer needs

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.749 
doubles the size that the computer needs
to<00:01:14.380> be<00:01:14.530> you<00:01:15.070> don't<00:01:15.219> need<00:01:15.310> to<00:01:15.430> have<00:01:15.549> that<00:01:15.579> much

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
to be you don't need to have that much

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.849 
to be you don't need to have that much
wattage<00:01:16.060> it's<00:01:16.359> not<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.479> power<00:01:16.719> system<00:01:17.020> so<00:01:17.590> in

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
wattage it's not a power system so in

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:19.020 
wattage it's not a power system so in
the<00:01:17.950> end<00:01:17.979> it's<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.310> waste<00:01:18.520> you<00:01:18.640> get<00:01:18.759> a<00:01:18.789> bigger

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
the end it's a waste you get a bigger

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.270 
the end it's a waste you get a bigger
computer<00:01:19.299> than<00:01:19.420> you<00:01:19.479> want<00:01:19.689> so<00:01:20.649> if<00:01:21.039> you<00:01:21.130> go<00:01:21.219> to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
computer than you want so if you go to

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.789 
computer than you want so if you go to

with a breakable for so you can break
away<00:03:09.040> for<00:03:09.159> and<00:03:09.639> use<00:03:09.819> it<00:03:09.939> on<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.120> 20<00:03:10.389> or<00:03:10.540> a

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
away for and use it on the 20 or a

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.149 
away for and use it on the 20 or a
24-pin<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.680> going<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:11.859> provide<00:03:12.010> the

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
24-pin this is going to provide the

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.470 
24-pin this is going to provide the
power<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.609> your<00:03:12.730> motherboard<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.239> all<00:03:13.359> the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
power to your motherboard and all the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.440 
power to your motherboard and all the
peripherals<00:03:14.040> next<00:03:15.040> up<00:03:15.250> is<00:03:15.970> going<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.329> be

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
peripherals next up is going to be

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.470 
peripherals next up is going to be
static<00:03:16.989> cables<00:03:17.319> now<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:17.919> has<00:03:18.099> only<00:03:18.849> two<00:03:19.180> ports

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
static cables now it has only two ports

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.399 
static cables now it has only two ports
down<00:03:19.569> here<00:03:19.720> for<00:03:19.840> stator<00:03:20.049> so<00:03:20.169> it<00:03:20.230> makes<00:03:20.349> you

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
down here for stator so it makes you

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:21.720 
down here for stator so it makes you
think<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.769> only<00:03:20.889> have<00:03:21.069> you<00:03:21.370> know<00:03:21.459> up<00:03:21.609> to

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
think that you only have you know up to

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.099 
think that you only have you know up to
two<00:03:21.879> hard<00:03:22.120> drives<00:03:22.239> but<00:03:22.450> that<00:03:22.599> is<00:03:22.750> false

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
two hard drives but that is false

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.890 
two hard drives but that is false
because<00:03:23.919> if<00:03:24.159> you<00:03:24.280> look<00:03:24.459> at<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.329> connector

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
because if you look at the connector

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.970 
because if you look at the connector
this<00:03:26.049> is<00:03:26.169> what<00:03:26.260> goes<00:03:26.379> into<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.620> power<00:03:26.769> supply

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
this is what goes into the power supply

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.869 
this is what goes into the power supply
and<00:03:27.310> you<00:03:27.790> have<00:03:27.970> two<00:03:28.379> SATA<00:03:29.379> connections<00:03:29.829> /<00:03:30.159> /

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
and you have two SATA connections / /

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.369 
and you have two SATA connections / /
you<00:03:31.120> know<00:03:31.239> modular<00:03:31.780> connections<00:03:32.139> so<00:03:32.229> here's

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
you know modular connections so here's

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.110 
you know modular connections so here's
another<00:03:32.560> two<00:03:32.859> that<00:03:33.250> means<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.430> can<00:03:33.549> power<00:03:33.729> for

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
another two that means you can power for

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.099 
another two that means you can power for
hard<00:03:34.599> drives<00:03:34.870> or<00:03:35.049> for<00:03:35.349> ssds<00:03:35.919> with<00:03:36.909> this<00:03:37.840> power

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
hard drives or for ssds with this power

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.369 
hard drives or for ssds with this power
