00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:16.209
 if not 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.400
 very good people that such I am galen and 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.740
 Here I bring you the guide of how to pass it 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.450
 canoe pea of the quimbo because the truth that 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.910
 it's a somewhat complicated dungeon if 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.490
 we do not coordinate well and we have to know 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.649
 do a couple of things and well here you 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.059
 I leave the video already after being a 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.489
 time without internet that I could not 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:36.910
 record not even connect me funny aldo 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.710
 nothing or anything internet but good for 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.350
 start the dungeon we'll just have to 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.620
 speak with chacha and already use the hands of 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.220
 key or the key that we have to be able 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.570
 enter the cape in the dungeon the 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.920
 true that there is not much to mention anymore 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.420
 you see that the first room there are a couple of 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.010
 monsters and nothing that take away enough 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.520
 damage so I would recommend that we are 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.670
 delete to do it with level characters 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.040
 180 or more and you see that the fights are 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.470
 they finish considerably fast and do not 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.149
 we do not have much to do since 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.070
 we finish the first fight that is the room 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.200
 one 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.630
 and the only thing that we have to be careful 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.940
 with these shells that invoke some 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.830
 glyphs where if we start our turn 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.990
 there we will die instantly like days here 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.930
 we can take advantage of the glyphs of the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.119
 enemies to get another enemy and 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.010
 then do our normal turn 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.619
 and when the turn starts directly 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.460
 of the enemy die instantly as we see 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.440
 here he loses 3300 points of life and good 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.300
 You see that we continue to advance the 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.610
 dungeon that does not have much difficulty and 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.200
 the only thing on this side would be in that area 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.509
 day will always appear a monster 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.160
 so I recommend having another 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.170
 someone who attacks distance a sacrum 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.530
 to bring it or anything like that 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.330
 and well once we reached the end of 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.460
 the dungeon we have here the quimbo already 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.340
 their respective adversaries and we will enter 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.399
 in the fight as you see if we are four 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.009
 for they will be the shell tofu the tufo 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.690
 aerial I think and the clear plowman and the 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.009
 obviously chemo invoking the 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.030
 disciple of the quimbo which the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.009
 I will explain what you are going to do to 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.610
 continuation as you see nothing else to start 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.510
 they kill me more aluminum they take 3035 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.060
 of life 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.250
 and we continue the fight little by little 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.400
 killing all the first adversaries 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.739
 I recommend that kill everyone at all 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.540
 the enemies first of all and you see 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.620
 that here also taking advantage of the glyphs 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.530
 he killed the words and declared on his turn 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.510
 and the only thing is how I just said kill 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.340
 to all the enemies and then leave the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.790
 team for the end and we'll have to 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.569
 do a series of pretty processes 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.909
 complicated but that if we coordinate 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:49.349
 well with our allies we can 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:51.690
 do it fast and very simple well the 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.250
 quimbo is a monster that has 400 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.530
 100 percent resistance to all 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.989
 elements and we will have to choose to 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.700
 attack him with two pairs of elements 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.700
 we can choose to attack him with water and 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.319
 earth or if we prefer it with fire and 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.290
 air we have to choose one of these two 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.810
 pairs and each turn if we attack him with 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.609
 water will enter the state odd glyph is 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.349
 say that we will have to be in 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.750
 diagonal with the invocation just like 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.579
 if we attack with earth as we see here 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.909
 will continue to enter the ifo state 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.310
 odd if we did this with both 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.650
 following elements that are fire and 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.569
 extra air will enter the glyph state 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.250
 so then we will not have to 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.019
 end diagonally with the with the 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.000
 disciple of the quimbo here you see that 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.990
 invokes chess or puts it that way in 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.540
 game 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.680
 and then we will have to keep attacking 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.530
 water and earth to keep him 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.629
 King of the glyph and continue killing 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.269
 these doses and we do it with fire and with 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.569
 air, we'll have to put ourselves in a 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:53.030
 box not diagonal to him quimbo al 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.519
 disciple of the team and after two 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.590
 turns the quimbo will win will lose rather 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.379
 400 percent resistance to 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.659
 two elements that called her attacked the 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.459
 two so they are water and earth and fire and 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.439
 air I repeat it because you said you have to 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.090
 example with fire and earth because it is not going to 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:10.849
 serve for nothing and maybe you die 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.669
 towards the instant so be careful 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.530
 because chess is very random and what 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.389
 most important of all is to finish the 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.949
 turn in a white square never 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.780
 we see the turn in a black square 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.940
 because then we're going to die in the 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.930
 next turn since it always changes the 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.060
 role of the boxes and we will start the 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.860
 turn in a white square therefore 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.449
 we will die so we always finish the 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.099
 turn in a white square 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.749
 and you see that here we have to continue 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.659
 attacking him with the two elements that 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:40.860
 let's choose here we are a little water 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:43.800
 kimmel and a little but we do a little bit of 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.689
 force and we keep attacking him with water 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.969
 because my two people from here are 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:50.309
 of water the sacrum of water and ellen and of 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:52.409
 water and I also wanted to ask you if you 

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:54.240
 like the idea of making a guide to 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.129
 sacred scream of water because you put it on 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.499
 the comments and I will be happy to 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.749
 do it and well here we see that 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:02.879
 we sat the goal the final blow to the quimbo 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:05.069
 and it ends up dead and that's how easy the 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.659
 we finish this dungeon and good only 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.490
 it remains to say that at the end of the dungeon 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:10.729
 you will notice the relic of the quimbo which 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.300
 we can use on or take to be able 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.099
 redistribute the points of 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.110
 characteristics and the truth is that it comes 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.669
 pretty good if we have already used the 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.969
 the class temples or an orb or 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.710
 anything and good as I always say 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.419
 thank you very much for watching the video if 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.330
 you need anything you put it on 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.680
 comments a line never comes at all 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.599
 wrong to subscribe and see you in the 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.319
 next video with more many thanks and 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.319
 see you soon 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.330
 two
