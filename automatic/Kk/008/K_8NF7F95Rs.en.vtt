00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
paper they actually removed not one but

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.270 
paper they actually removed not one but
two<00:00:59.789> major<00:01:00.359> weaknesses<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.379> his<00:01:01.590> overall<00:01:02.010> kit

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
two major weaknesses in his overall kit

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.789 
two major weaknesses in his overall kit
that<00:01:02.910> being<00:01:03.180> his<00:01:03.359> mana<00:01:03.570> issues<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.170> his<00:01:04.559> early

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that being his mana issues and his early

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.609 
that being his mana issues and his early
game<00:01:05.150> Alistar<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.540> actually<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.200> tanky

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
game Alistar is not actually that tanky

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.200 
game Alistar is not actually that tanky
early<00:01:07.890> game<00:01:08.040> since<00:01:08.310> his<00:01:08.460> ultimate<00:01:08.939> needs

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
early game since his ultimate needs

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.630 
early game since his ultimate needs
items<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.930> scale<00:01:10.170> up<00:01:10.320> effectively<00:01:10.979> since<00:01:11.460> his

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
items to scale up effectively since his

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.609 
items to scale up effectively since his
base<00:01:11.850> stats<00:01:12.180> are<00:01:12.390> kind<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.780> around<00:01:13.049> average

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
base stats are kind of around average

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.590 
base stats are kind of around average
now<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.220> thing<00:01:14.520> about<00:01:14.580> Alistar<00:01:15.060> top<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.479> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
now the thing about Alistar top is that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.420 
now the thing about Alistar top is that
it<00:01:15.720> actually<00:01:15.900> has<00:01:16.259> some<00:01:16.530> major<00:01:16.740> weaknesses

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
it actually has some major weaknesses

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.370 
it actually has some major weaknesses
that<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.850> easily<00:01:18.030> capitalized<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:19.049> but

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
that can be easily capitalized on but

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.679 
that can be easily capitalized on but
also<00:01:19.590> some<00:01:20.310> major<00:01:20.520> strengths<00:01:21.119> allowing<00:01:21.600> you

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
also some major strengths allowing you

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.749 
also some major strengths allowing you
to<00:01:21.810> create<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> comp<00:01:22.470> based<00:01:22.770> around<00:01:23.159> him<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
to create a comp based around him to

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.840 
to create a comp based around him to
forego<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.390> weaknesses<00:01:25.040> first<00:01:26.040> off<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.549> that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
forego the weaknesses first off is that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.240 
forego the weaknesses first off is that
