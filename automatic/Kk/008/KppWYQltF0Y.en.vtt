 where are we going to talk about the 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.579
 ip telephony and good the origins that 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.579
 telephony has itself up to 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:33.290
 what is IP telephony today and good 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.750
 this is this series of tutorial videos 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.280
 video courses are oriented to all 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.940
 person who wants to learn a little more 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.430
 about what the phone and how 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.460
 You can implement it in your business in your 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.710
 companies whether you are an integrator or 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.420

 to serve likewise is going to serve you if you're 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.610
 a student who wants to know more 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.800
 about telephony and good too 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.170
 we will explain how to integrate 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.660
 ip telephony in your company with the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.350
 peru phone service but good for 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.210
 start 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.759
 know a little more about the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.280
 telephony we are going to talk about their 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:14.390
 origins and how is it that this has 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.610
 changed the life of all mankind 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.450
 let's start with the first 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.860
 slide 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.399
 it is said that the telephone was invented in 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.340
 1876 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.530
 by Mr. Antonio Meucci 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.640
 previously this invention was attributed 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.759
 Mr. alexa that Alexander Graham Bell 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.470
 which was changed until 2002 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.450
 many people thought that the lord 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.420
 gahan come graham bell like that had been 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.229
 the discoverer of the telephone device 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.610
 and the traditional telephony but good 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.299
 this was completely false since he 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.090
 only patented the invention but not 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.880
 had been the person who had 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.020
 invented the phone 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.420
 and well the main idea was to be audible 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.560
 the spoken word at long distances 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:12.330
 that is, communicate two points so that 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.000
 they can call each other and in this way 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:20.580
 establish a business relationship a 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.580
 communication relationship 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.430
 originally the transmission of the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.940
 traditional telephony was done on a 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.670
 iron thread and this communication yes 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.980
 It was a point - to - point 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.230
 done to this day all good 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.760
 households mostly in Latin America in 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.510
 more developed countries have already changed 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.510
 much 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.569
 this to the data system but it is used 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.150
 for point-to-point communication with 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.430
 a thread of a copper pair that is the one 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.069
 comes to our homes is that that couple of 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.900
 copper that arrives and that connects to 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.440
 a telephone rosette where we connect 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.530
 our phone adapter that is 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.030
 part of traditional telephony and 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.630
 well let's see a little more about the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.910
 evolution of traditional telephony 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.810
 we have also that presents a 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.269
 architecture where a user is 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.480
 communicates with another user through 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.120
 the same cable and that cable is not 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.940
 shared with other people is a 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.070
 unique communication between these people 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.620
 communication was point to point e 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.540
 initially used 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:37.040
 to a manual switching that is to say they had 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:40.190
 people inside of an area of 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.760
 commutation that was called they did the 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:47.120
 User-to- user switching 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.840
 manually this type of switching 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.430
 then it was good changed by the 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.230
 telephone switches that we're going to 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.360
 talk later they are but well 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.440
 we will explain on the blackboard how 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.440
 he made this type of commutation 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.340
 telephone and good is that previously 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.340
 they had 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.109
 we had 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.249
 companies telephone companies 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:18.280
 They had staff with a lot of personnel 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:22.510
 that did this type of switching 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.440
 we had here on the one hand if we see from 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.740
 this point 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.580
 subscribers phones we assume that 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.409
 will be the city ​​of Lima not 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.259
 and in the city of Lima well paid 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:40.139
 with their telephone lines and we had 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:42.349
 another city another point of the city ​​in 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.349
 where 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.030
 had other subscribers we put that 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.580
 this is the city of Arequipa a 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.190
 department of Lima we assume that 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.550
 If you were a subscriber, you wanted to communicate with a 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:59.590
 subscriber of arequipa to make possible 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.590
 that call had to 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.700
 settle down in direct communication 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:09.320
 between both points and for this there was a 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.770
 little person here of what 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.289
 put a little cable and connected that 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.409
 cable cited 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.899
 so that those points and of 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.889
 this form can be established could 

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:26.310
 establish that communication 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:29.310
 well basically communication 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:33.020
 traditional telephone works from that 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.599
 way communicates points 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.169
 each other to establish a 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:42.050
 communication between both points but that 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:44.360
 is that point is only for 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.099
 transport voice and data are not used 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.099
 as we will see later in the 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:54.560
 ip telephony well this was a brief 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:58.129
 start and explanation about about 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.289
 what is traditional telephony how 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.460
 it works and well its origins go to 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.669
 try that those videos are not 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.949
 completely comprehensive and try to make 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.050
 be as didactic as possible to be able 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.699
 help you see us in the next video 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.830
 let's talk a little more about 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.630
 the characteristics that the 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.169
 traditional telephony and having these 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:20.900
 characteristics we are going to also 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:24.650
 better understand the benefits that 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:27.590
 has the ip telephony that we use today 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.810
 in day they see a pleasure to say goodbye to you 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.629
 of you and your friend oscar salvador director 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.050
 from peru font puntocom
