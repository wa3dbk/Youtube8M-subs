00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
for any other test the problem is that

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.320 
for any other test the problem is that
by<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.279> time<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.880> get<00:00:24.000> through<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> first

you<00:00:41.010> know<00:00:41.160> how<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.730> use<00:00:42.120> speed<00:00:42.450> reading

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
you know how I use speed reading

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.660 
you know how I use speed reading
techniques<00:00:43.110> how<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.920> approach<00:00:44.309> different

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
techniques how I approach different

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.810 
techniques how I approach different
types<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.180> content<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.190> best<00:00:47.430> match

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
types of content and I can best match

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.110

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
different material to find what works

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.779 
different material to find what works
best<00:00:58.379> for<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.710> because<00:00:59.280> while<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.670> is
