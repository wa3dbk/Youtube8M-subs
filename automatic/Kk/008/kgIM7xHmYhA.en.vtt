00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:51.219
 at least taxed for lousy goal thurman and 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.219
 everything should go 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.210
 hautefort 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.820
 begins to make the good 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.820
 wallet 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.640
 Oh 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:29.600
 a concept which first it was risky 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.260
 for activision but which has borne fruit 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.710
 and profits quite a lot and with 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.450
 red 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.210
 what better than to own 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.210
 physically its downloadable content 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.690
 as for the first game the figurines 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.510
 of young skylanders are very good 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.460
 quality and very detailed besides being 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.010
 made of a material that seems long enough 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.160
 I am very impressed with the pdci green 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.570
 for the welcome and we are given 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.670
 but what if you have a 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.830
 tons of skylanders spyro's 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.170
 adventure is well stop crying 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.570
 because the lock figurines are 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.030
 compatible with skylanders jawad 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.230
 and yes you can reuse them and 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.090
 continue to ride them level if you 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.370
 already have a portal you can buy 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.740
 the game without wearing and save money 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.200
 20 pieces unless you want it 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.930
 xbox 360 version that you had the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.270
 wii version before or ps3 this moment to 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.989
 dawn a fuck you microsoft account the 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.940
 bearers of a console is compatible 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.410
 the point of sale of skylanders giants 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.410
 and of course the ga 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.170
 and yes indeed the extras of the giants 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.300
 are pretty big it's pretty obvious 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.520
 that puts them side by side and they are 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.959
 enormously detailed in addition to having some 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.270
 lights that turn on when you 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.130
 crazy on the portal 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.530
 apart from the giants what is new 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.019
 with the figures they are the figurines 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.430
 called the elite kors that lights up 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.070
 when you go crazy on the portal like 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.489
 I said with a light brief we resume 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.620
 figurines of these rumors then gave a 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.410
 new breath then this is not 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.200
 strip 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.880
 these are the same as the lock but 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.480
 in different poses that have 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.480
 more powers 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.500
 but is the game worth it? 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.560
 skylanders heinz is an improvement 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.540
 major on the first indeed here on 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.459
 focuses on the powers already and we 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.200
 must constantly this putsch and figurines 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.700
 to solve puzzles access to 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.159
 new territories and find the 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.840
 sacred brakes yo a lot of interaction 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.420
 in each level that requires a 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.920
 giant to advance change figurines 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.629
 all this has now become a 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.379
 practice much more common than 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.379
 in the first game 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.560
 the gameplay remains the same as in 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.120
 heroes adventures against europe and 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.850
 now the flynn boat 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.769
 it's on this boat when we have access to 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.169
 a multitude of rooms and options 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.380
 finally a reason to accumulate cash 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.449
 for us because one of them one thing that 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:45.240
 I have so much first game is 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:47.580
 convinced case on the boat of 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.229
 flines the central man of the game we can there 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.150
 buy various stuff to increase 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.250
 the strength of our scan of the rejection of the bars 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.410
 and other aspects of the game besides 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.060
 buying more shelters because by 2am 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.620
 morning scans 12 of his income 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.090
 can have the same powers as is 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.650
 serious but an extra step 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.650
 official apology 2 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.470
 the levels are much more elaborate 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.330
 we can spend a lot of time 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.250
 trout or circuits of a map 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.039
 entry into houses and caves 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.220
 to get objects too this is a 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.950
 thing that gives more rallies 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.420
 dean of accessible inner worlds 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.750
 a level experience to find 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.750
 taker 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.200
 depending on the poser some of these 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.730
 caverns are not accessible on 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.950
 youtube this project you have to be careful 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.950
 to the environment as to notes canada 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.550
 another improvement in cinematics 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.199

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.910

 contest nations in doha collecting 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.990
 mail headphones indicate that you have 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.280

 o cinematics is always fun 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.099
 in a video game 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.050
 it makes you dream that maybe one day there 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:30.789
 would have ten video game movies for 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.789
 share my bones with tucson 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.660
 I flew over the game at the time of 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.729
 creating videos 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.310
 but with what I experience and I 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:43.099
 can easily give one of 8 points 5 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.470
 out of 6 the region the Canadian betis is 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:47.660
 pretty important the game and come to an end 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.490
 we must not hide from collecting 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:07:01.280
