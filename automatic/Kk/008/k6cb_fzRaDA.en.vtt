00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.369
 Hello everyone, whoever speaks is Erica and 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.359
 mariane and today we will talk about the theory 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.340
 from disney 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.820
 the theory was created by a little guy 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.890
 user who also called oz close 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.890
 starting point of the timeline 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.200
 built by him is the second lion king 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.460
 theory a few seconds after the end 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.770
 of the animation to reconquer pedro and nobody 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.610
 less than field hercules would have appeared 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.719
 in the savannah of a movie about the hero 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.440
 Greek 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:02.640
 we have the following scene as if it were a 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.739
 lion of marea then we have the body 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.049
 hunchback of notre dame 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.600
 we see a gargoyle very similar to 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.100
 showing that the French of the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.799
 16th century 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.070
 it was also somehow past 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.100
 in their vain supposedly Africans to 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.390
 this hunch also shows the table of 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.610
 the beauty and the Beast 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.439
 walking the streets of paris with nose 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.869
 buried in a book and also the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.450
 seller shaking pt that looks like 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.329
 much with a magic led carpet 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.500
 let's talk about aladdin and the body of 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.670
 do not give me 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.479
 this theory, we 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.240
 animals 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.780
 the fact that we see a toy of the beast in the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.790
 half of the things of the sultan and aladdin 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.780
 means that the events of sailing and the beast 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.600
 have passed before it, however, as 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.950
 above we see the magic carpet in hump 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.810
 do not give me 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.840
 we can assume that this story 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.960
 happened before the tappedão ended up in jail 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.430
 in the cave of wonders in alvalade 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.489
 very confused, right? 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.890
 continuing in a film the scene 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.370
 view skeet skeet gathers 1 to 0 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.100
 of the 625 alien experiments of 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.830
 thousands to him and in the middle of the group 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.680
 we see the two familiar faces of the rudder 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.990
 and pumba is confusing hard to try 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.740
 understand but as well as the theory of 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.200
 Pizza 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.930
 Disney movies have gone into one 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.709
 universe too but we did not stop there 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.400
 not 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:39.450
 rapunzel and flynn rider coiled appears 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.540
 the week preceding the coronation of 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.880
 elza in frozen the same theory advocates 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.790
 that the wrecked ship of the film 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.250
 little mermaid is the same as what the 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.060
 Princess Elza's parents boarded when 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.130
 died 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.680
 the royal couple would be going to the wedding 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.070
 of rapunzel when faced with 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.040
 storm inside the conspiracy 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.769
 ana elza are cousins ​​of rapunzel by 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.170
 part of the mother explains the presence of 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.440
 queen at niece's wedding 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.930
 so these are just a few easter 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.910
 eggs appearing in the movies said
