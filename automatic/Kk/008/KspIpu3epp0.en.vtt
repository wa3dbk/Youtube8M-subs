00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
let's start off with the box it's just

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.120 
let's start off with the box it's just
it<00:00:33.570> looks<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.899> picture<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> dashboard

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
it looks like a picture of the dashboard

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.479 
it looks like a picture of the dashboard
right<00:00:35.309> there<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.850> then<00:00:36.950> right<00:00:37.950> here<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.460> have

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
right there and then right here we have

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.490 
right there and then right here we have
what<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.059> comes<00:00:39.329> included<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:39.989> which<00:00:40.320> I'll

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
what it comes included with which I'll

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
and then that looks like the Kinect

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.700 
and then that looks like the Kinect
right<00:00:43.200> there<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.590> then<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.969> Xbox

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
alright here let's get started with

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.130 
alright here let's get started with
what's<00:01:00.750> inside<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.289> first<00:01:01.980> off<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:03.140> Xbox

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
what's inside so first off we have Xbox

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.710 
what's inside so first off we have Xbox
one<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> quick<00:01:04.920> set-up<00:01:05.489> guide<00:01:05.610> that's<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.659> guess

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
one a quick set-up guide that's I guess

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.390 
one a quick set-up guide that's I guess
for<00:01:07.020> setting<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.380> up<00:01:07.439> I'm<00:01:07.710> sure<00:01:08.070> I'll<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.310> able

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
for setting it up I'm sure I'll be able

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.539 
for setting it up I'm sure I'll be able
to<00:01:08.490> figure<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:09.390> myself<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.409> then<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> get

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
to figure that out myself and then I get

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.550 
to figure that out myself and then I get
equipped<00:01:11.909> just<00:01:12.150> some<00:01:12.299> random<00:01:12.510> Oh<00:01:12.869> get<00:01:13.140> Xbox

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
actually flash this right in front of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.530 
actually flash this right in front of
the<00:01:16.320> Kinect<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.700> will<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.909> able<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
the Kinect and and it will be able to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.780 
the Kinect and and it will be able to
put<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.530> code<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.710> immediately<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.549> then<00:01:20.670> we

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
put the code in immediately and then we

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.070 
put the code in immediately and then we
have<00:01:20.880> another<00:01:20.970> little<00:01:21.330> guide<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.810> looks<00:01:21.960> like

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
have another little guide it looks like

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.210 
have another little guide it looks like
there<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.350> that's<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.619> stuff<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.070> don't

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
there but that's the stuff that we don't

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.820 
there but that's the stuff that we don't
care<00:01:23.400> about<00:01:23.460> here's<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.659> headsets<00:01:25.110> which

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
care about here's the the headsets which

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.130 
care about here's the the headsets which
I'll<00:01:26.220> probably<00:01:26.520> never<00:01:26.939> use<00:01:27.119> maybe<00:01:27.900> at<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
I'll probably never use maybe at the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.630 
I'll probably never use maybe at the
beginning<00:01:28.409> until<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> lot<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> other

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
beginning until a lot of the other

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.810 
beginning until a lot of the other
headsets<00:01:30.030> actually<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.369> adapter<00:01:32.369> I

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
headsets actually get the adapter I

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.580 
headsets actually get the adapter I
guess<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.240> would<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:34.110> work<00:01:34.229> within<00:01:34.380> your

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
guess it would be to work within your

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.350 
guess it would be to work within your
controllers<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.640> now<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.729> doubt<00:01:36.119> I'll<00:01:36.270> be

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
controllers but for now I doubt I'll be

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.670 
controllers but for now I doubt I'll be
using<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.840> guess<00:01:37.020> I'll<00:01:37.170> open<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.560> up

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
using it I guess I'll open that up

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.289 
using it I guess I'll open that up
really<00:01:37.920> quick<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.400> show<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.610> guys<00:01:38.820> how<00:01:39.090> it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
really quick to show you guys how it

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.510 
really quick to show you guys how it
looks<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.930> looks<00:01:40.290> exactly<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.490> original

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
looks it looks exactly like the original

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.960 
looks it looks exactly like the original
Xbox<00:01:42.560> 360<00:01:43.560> headset<00:01:43.710> accept<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.520> as<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> new

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
black kind of sleeker look to it and I

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.240 
black kind of sleeker look to it and I
probably<00:01:48.750> won't<00:01:49.079> use<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.680> mostly<00:01:50.009> just

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
probably won't use it it's mostly just

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.010 
probably won't use it it's mostly just
for<00:01:50.430> casual<00:01:50.850> gamers<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:51.420> if<00:01:51.720> you're<00:01:51.840> playing

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
next to my older controller from my 360

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.089 
next to my older controller from my 360
and<00:02:05.640> I'll<00:02:05.850> tell<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.090> guys<00:02:06.149> what<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.509> think<00:02:07.099> of

and I'll tell you guys what I think of

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.410 
and I'll tell you guys what I think of
the<00:02:08.250> actual<00:02:08.670> look<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.910> hope<00:02:09.030> I'm<00:02:09.179> actually

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
the actual look I hope I'm actually

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.330 
the actual look I hope I'm actually
catching<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.500> actually<00:02:10.830> does<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.099> feels

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
catching this it actually does it feels

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.660 
catching this it actually does it feels
a<00:02:11.459> bit<00:02:11.580> different<00:02:11.819> for<00:02:12.209> sure

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
a bit different for sure

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.570 
a bit different for sure
it<00:02:13.450> feels<00:02:13.750> more<00:02:13.930> like<00:02:14.110> a<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:14.860> don't<00:02:15.069> know<00:02:15.370> it

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
it feels more like a I don't know it

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.430 
it feels more like a I don't know it
feels<00:02:15.730> like<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.120> like<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> Nintendo<00:02:16.599> controller

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
feels like it like a Nintendo controller

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.770 
feels like it like a Nintendo controller
or<00:02:17.739> something<00:02:18.010> alright<00:02:18.250> but<00:02:18.670> here<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.239> my<00:02:19.450> old

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
or something alright but here is my old

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.130 
or something alright but here is my old
xbox<00:02:20.550> basic<00:02:21.550> controller<00:02:21.910> oldest<00:02:22.720> hell<00:02:22.900> and

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
xbox basic controller oldest hell and

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.260 
xbox basic controller oldest hell and
definitely<00:02:24.130> doesn't<00:02:24.459> work<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.760> anymore<00:02:25.090> this

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
definitely doesn't work to anymore this

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.270 
definitely doesn't work to anymore this
thing<00:02:25.510> actually<00:02:25.720> starts<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.680> just<00:02:26.920> sticks<00:02:27.160> to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
thing actually starts it just sticks to

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.220 
thing actually starts it just sticks to
the<00:02:27.459> side<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.390> was<00:02:28.480> definitely<00:02:28.840> time<00:02:29.170> for

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
the side so I it was definitely time for

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.979 
the side so I it was definitely time for
a<00:02:29.440> new<00:02:29.560> controller<00:02:29.920> anyways<00:02:30.400> but<00:02:31.390> there<00:02:31.780> we<00:02:31.870> go

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
a new controller anyways but there we go

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.390 
a new controller anyways but there we go
so<00:02:32.170> that's<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.410> controller<00:02:32.770> at<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.160> exact

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
so that's the controller at the exact

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.920 
so that's the controller at the exact
same<00:02:33.550> layout<00:02:33.790> pretty<00:02:34.120> much<00:02:34.270> looks<00:02:34.750> like<00:02:34.810> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
same layout pretty much looks like the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.170 
same layout pretty much looks like the
the<00:02:35.920> dashboard<00:02:36.370> buttons<00:02:36.610> just<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.850> bit<00:02:36.970> higher

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
the dashboard buttons just a bit higher

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.259 
the dashboard buttons just a bit higher
and<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:38.110> otherwise<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:39.519> internal<00:02:40.000> battery

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
and and otherwise the internal battery

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.240 
and and otherwise the internal battery
kind<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.840> pack<00:02:40.989> thing<00:02:41.230> there<00:02:41.410> isn't<00:02:41.920> as

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
kind of pack thing there isn't as

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.220 
kind of pack thing there isn't as
protruding<00:02:42.790> at<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.000> back<00:02:43.150> as<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.450> was<00:02:43.630> in<00:02:44.019> the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
protruding at the back as it was in the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.520 
protruding at the back as it was in the
older<00:02:45.069> ones<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:45.310> on<00:02:45.640> so<00:02:45.880> that's<00:02:46.000> controller

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
older ones so on so that's controller

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.170 
older ones so on so that's controller
over<00:02:47.530> here<00:02:47.800> I<00:02:47.830> have<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.489> power

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
over here I have the power

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.270 
over here I have the power
Korda<00:02:49.959> it<00:02:50.080> looks<00:02:50.290> like<00:02:50.500> I'll<00:02:50.739> open<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.010> up

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
Korda it looks like I'll open that up

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.360 
Korda it looks like I'll open that up
really<00:02:51.760> quickly<00:02:52.590> I'm<00:02:53.590> not<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.890> gentlest

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
really quickly I'm not the gentlest

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.059 
really quickly I'm not the gentlest
person<00:02:54.610> on<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.390> planet<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:56.410> there<00:02:56.830> we<00:02:56.950> go

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
person on the planet and there we go

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.699 
person on the planet and there we go
that's<00:02:57.670> just<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.269> thing<00:02:59.140> that<00:02:59.290> plugs<00:02:59.500> into

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
that's just the thing that plugs into

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.559 
that's just the thing that plugs into
the<00:02:59.950> Xbox<00:03:00.130> one<00:03:00.459> I'm<00:03:00.580> sure<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.060> then<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.390> cable

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
the Xbox one I'm sure and then the cable

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.600 
the Xbox one I'm sure and then the cable
here<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.110> then<00:03:02.290> coming<00:03:02.890> with<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.010> is<00:03:03.370> the

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
here and then coming with that is the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.420 
here and then coming with that is the
power<00:03:03.910> supply<00:03:04.150> brick<00:03:04.810> which<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.950> PlayStation

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
power supply brick which the PlayStation

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.330 
power supply brick which the PlayStation
4<00:03:06.459> actually<00:03:06.850> doesn't<00:03:07.480> have<00:03:07.660> one<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:07.959> these

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
4 actually doesn't have one of these

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.160 
4 actually doesn't have one of these
apparently<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.549> Xbox<00:03:09.970> one<00:03:10.269> guys<00:03:10.510> were<00:03:10.900> saying

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
apparently the Xbox one guys were saying

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.380 
apparently the Xbox one guys were saying
that<00:03:11.440> it<00:03:11.980> was<00:03:12.130> just<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:12.519> that<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.880> wouldn't

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
that it was just so that it wouldn't

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.580 
that it was just so that it wouldn't
overheat<00:03:13.660> it's<00:03:13.900> not<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.049> big<00:03:14.200> deal<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.470> it

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
overheat it's not a big deal and it

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.470 
overheat it's not a big deal and it
takes<00:03:14.769> up<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:14.980> little<00:03:15.069> bit<00:03:15.280> more<00:03:15.400> room<00:03:15.700> but

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
takes up a little bit more room but

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.530 
takes up a little bit more room but
overall<00:03:16.840> it's<00:03:17.109> not<00:03:17.260> gonna<00:03:17.530> be<00:03:17.739> a<00:03:17.769> big<00:03:18.100> deal

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
overall it's not gonna be a big deal

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.910 
overall it's not gonna be a big deal
open<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.660> really<00:03:19.870> quick<00:03:20.079> see<00:03:20.260> us<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.560> see<00:03:20.739> it

open that really quick see us you see it

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.680 
open that really quick see us you see it
looks<00:03:21.130> really<00:03:21.190> blocky<00:03:21.880> this<00:03:22.299> thing<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.600> a

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
looks really blocky this thing is a

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.020 
looks really blocky this thing is a
block<00:03:23.019> but<00:03:24.010> I'm<00:03:24.100> sure<00:03:24.310> I'll<00:03:24.430> be<00:03:24.459> able<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.790> find

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
block but I'm sure I'll be able to find

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.509 
block but I'm sure I'll be able to find
somewhere<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.570> put<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.200> then<00:03:26.260> uh<00:03:26.530> next<00:03:27.280> up

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
somewhere to put it and then uh next up

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.740 
somewhere to put it and then uh next up
we<00:03:27.730> have<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:29.220> HDMI<00:03:30.220> cables<00:03:30.670> so<00:03:30.910> you

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
we have the HDMI cables so you

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.940 
we have the HDMI cables so you
definitely<00:03:31.900> need<00:03:32.140> one<00:03:32.380> of<00:03:32.410> these<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.709> play

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
definitely need one of these to play

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.140 
definitely need one of these to play
obviously<00:03:34.859> required<00:03:35.859> thing<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:36.519> just<00:03:36.760> a<00:03:36.850> basic

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
obviously required thing so just a basic

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.060 
obviously required thing so just a basic
HDMI<00:03:37.660> cable<00:03:37.989> nothing<00:03:38.290> special<00:03:38.590> about<00:03:38.890> that

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
HDMI cable nothing special about that

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.130 
HDMI cable nothing special about that
thing<00:03:39.790> that<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:40.030> guys<00:03:40.180> are<00:03:40.390> probably<00:03:40.630> all

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
thing that you guys are probably all

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.560 
thing that you guys are probably all
waiting<00:03:41.680> for<00:03:41.709> is<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.579> oh<00:03:42.820> no<00:03:43.180> that's<00:03:43.420> the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
waiting for is the oh no that's the

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.349 
waiting for is the oh no that's the
Kinect<00:03:44.049> right<00:03:44.680> here<00:03:45.100> I<00:03:45.340> thought<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:46.060> was<00:03:46.120> taking

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
Kinect right here I thought I was taking

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.330 
Kinect right here I thought I was taking
up<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.690> Xbox<00:03:47.140> one<00:03:47.560> but<00:03:47.799> apparently<00:03:48.130> that's

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
up the Xbox one but apparently that's

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.370 
up the Xbox one but apparently that's
underneath<00:03:48.609> so<00:03:48.880> here's<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.239> Kinect<00:03:49.570> it's

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
underneath so here's the Kinect it's

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.150 
underneath so here's the Kinect it's
really<00:03:50.620> big

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
really big

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.220 
really big
I'll<00:03:51.280> take<00:03:51.519> out<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.880> film<00:03:52.299> or<00:03:52.810> I'll<00:03:52.930> take<00:03:53.079> off

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
I'll take out the film or I'll take off

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.870 
I'll take out the film or I'll take off
the<00:03:53.410> film<00:03:53.680> layer<00:03:53.890> that's<00:03:54.130> kind<00:03:54.340> of<00:03:54.370> on<00:03:54.519> top

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
the film layer that's kind of on top

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.360 
the film layer that's kind of on top
here<00:03:55.269> if<00:03:55.480> I<00:03:55.660> can<00:03:55.870> manage<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.470> do<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.069> there<00:03:57.280> we

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
here if I can manage to do it there we

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.150 
here if I can manage to do it there we
go<00:03:57.630> so<00:03:58.630> there<00:03:58.810> we<00:03:58.930> go<00:03:58.959> that's<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.470> camera<00:03:59.980> on

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
go so there we go that's the camera on

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.949 
go so there we go that's the camera on
that<00:04:00.190> side<00:04:00.670> if<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.000> guys<00:04:01.120> can<00:04:01.359> see<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.750> and

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
that side if you guys can see that and

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.340 
that side if you guys can see that and
we<00:04:02.049> check<00:04:02.319> and<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:03.190> there<00:04:03.340> we<00:04:03.489> have<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.940> Xbox

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
we check and and there we have the Xbox

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.330 
we check and and there we have the Xbox
kind<00:04:05.350> of<00:04:05.410> logo<00:04:05.500> there<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:05.950> this<00:04:06.100> thing<00:04:06.250> is

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
kind of logo there and this thing is

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.740 
kind of logo there and this thing is
huge<00:04:06.609> so<00:04:06.940> I'm<00:04:07.060> not<00:04:07.180> really<00:04:07.329> sure<00:04:07.540> where<00:04:07.690> I'm

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
huge so I'm not really sure where I'm

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.390 
huge so I'm not really sure where I'm
gonna<00:04:07.900> put<00:04:08.140> it<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:08.500> don't<00:04:08.920> really<00:04:09.040> plan<00:04:09.220> on

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
gonna put it I don't really plan on

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.160 
gonna put it I don't really plan on
using<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.819> Kinect<00:04:10.120> if<00:04:10.600> I<00:04:10.780> could<00:04:10.959> have<00:04:11.049> gotten

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
using the Kinect if I could have gotten

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.479 
using the Kinect if I could have gotten
the<00:04:11.260> Xbox<00:04:11.590> one<00:04:11.739> without<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.100> Kinect<00:04:12.370> I

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
the Xbox one without the Kinect I

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.670 
the Xbox one without the Kinect I
probably<00:04:12.700> probably<00:04:13.209> would<00:04:13.660> have<00:04:13.780> but<00:04:14.530> I<00:04:14.560> heard

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
probably probably would have but I heard

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.870 
probably probably would have but I heard
a<00:04:14.799> lot<00:04:14.920> of<00:04:14.950> people<00:04:15.220> are<00:04:15.310> actually<00:04:15.670> pretty

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
a lot of people are actually pretty

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.610 
a lot of people are actually pretty
pretty<00:04:16.419> happy<00:04:16.510> with<00:04:16.900> it<00:04:16.959> in<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:17.289> end<00:04:17.320> people

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
pretty happy with it in the end people

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.719 
pretty happy with it in the end people
that<00:04:17.829> didn't<00:04:18.130> think<00:04:18.340> that<00:04:18.519> they<00:04:18.579> were<00:04:18.639> gonna

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
that didn't think that they were gonna

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.370 
that didn't think that they were gonna
like<00:04:18.970> it<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.479> voice<00:04:19.660> control<00:04:20.139> from<00:04:20.289> the

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
like it the voice control from the

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.740 
like it the voice control from the
Kinect<00:04:20.650> is<00:04:20.709> actually<00:04:21.130> pretty<00:04:21.340> cool<00:04:21.609> and<00:04:21.940> stuff

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
Kinect is actually pretty cool and stuff

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.659 
Kinect is actually pretty cool and stuff
like<00:04:22.870> that<00:04:23.050> so<00:04:23.229> it's<00:04:23.590> pretty<00:04:23.740> big<00:04:23.950> but<00:04:24.640> uh

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
like that so it's pretty big but uh

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.510 
like that so it's pretty big but uh
let's<00:04:25.270> move<00:04:25.479> on<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.930> axe

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
let's move on to the axe

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.850 
let's move on to the axe
honk<00:04:26.910> now<00:04:27.150> which<00:04:27.419> is<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.870> most<00:04:28.020> important

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
honk now which is the most important

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:37.490 
honk now which is the most important
thing<00:04:29.479> in<00:04:30.479> this<00:04:30.720> box<00:04:35.720> alright<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:37.110> there<00:04:37.470> we

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
thing in this box alright so there we

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.969 
thing in this box alright so there we
have<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.759> Xbox<00:04:39.419> console<00:04:40.229> it's<00:04:40.349> pretty<00:04:40.650> big

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
have the Xbox console it's pretty big

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.339 
have the Xbox console it's pretty big
this<00:04:41.220> thing<00:04:41.430> actually<00:04:41.840> it<00:04:42.840> does<00:04:43.050> look<00:04:43.319> a

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
this thing actually it does look a

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.800 
this thing actually it does look a
little<00:04:43.650> bit<00:04:43.800> like<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.949> VCR<00:04:44.400> not<00:04:45.150> being<00:04:45.419> at<00:04:45.659> all

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
little bit like a VCR not being at all

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.619 
little bit like a VCR not being at all
of<00:04:45.930> Stella<00:04:46.169> kid<00:04:46.440> with<00:04:46.680> this<00:04:47.060> kind<00:04:48.060> of<00:04:48.180> little

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
of Stella kid with this kind of little

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:50.420 
of Stella kid with this kind of little
film<00:04:48.930> laying<00:04:49.139> way<00:04:49.319> up<00:04:49.440> on<00:04:49.590> top<00:04:49.830> there<00:04:50.069> and<00:04:50.250> then

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
film laying way up on top there and then

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.369 
film laying way up on top there and then
there's<00:04:50.699> the<00:04:50.879> Xbox<00:04:51.300> one<00:04:51.479> I<00:04:51.509> think<00:04:51.629> this<00:04:51.930> is<00:04:52.110> the

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
there's the Xbox one I think this is the

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:54.860 
there's the Xbox one I think this is the
front<00:04:52.740> side<00:04:53.180> that's<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.360> back<00:04:54.479> part<00:04:54.750> so<00:04:54.780> let's

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
front side that's the back part so let's

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.270 
front side that's the back part so let's
look<00:04:55.080> at<00:04:55.169> the<00:04:55.229> back<00:04:55.379> really<00:04:55.590> quick<00:04:55.949> it<00:04:56.099> looks

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
look at the back really quick it looks

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.820 
look at the back really quick it looks
like<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.610> power<00:04:56.879> supply<00:04:57.509> is<00:04:58.259> all<00:04:58.470> gonna<00:04:58.650> go<00:04:58.800> on

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
like the power supply is all gonna go on

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.070 
like the power supply is all gonna go on
right<00:04:59.009> there<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.370> have<00:04:59.490> HDMI<00:04:59.729> out<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.720> TV

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
right there you have HDMI out to TV

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.899 
right there you have HDMI out to TV
right<00:05:01.289> there<00:05:01.530> let<00:05:02.430> me<00:05:02.460> make<00:05:02.639> sure<00:05:02.669> I'm

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
right there let me make sure I'm

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:05.029 
right there let me make sure I'm
capturing<00:05:03.539> that<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.169> that<00:05:04.409> it's<00:05:04.560> actually<00:05:04.770> in

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
capturing that and that it's actually in

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.149 
capturing that and that it's actually in
focus<00:05:05.639> I<00:05:05.849> think<00:05:06.659> it<00:05:06.720> is<00:05:06.810> and<00:05:06.990> then<00:05:07.349> we<00:05:07.770> have<00:05:07.800> the

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159 
focus I think it is and then we have the

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.520 
focus I think it is and then we have the
HDMI<00:05:08.520> in<00:05:08.819> right<00:05:09.030> there<00:05:09.240> right<00:05:10.139> here<00:05:10.169> we<00:05:10.440> have

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
HDMI in right there right here we have

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.529 
HDMI in right there right here we have
two<00:05:10.680> USB<00:05:10.889> slots<00:05:11.490> and<00:05:11.759> then<00:05:12.060> out<00:05:12.210> right<00:05:12.389> there

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
two USB slots and then out right there

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.689 
two USB slots and then out right there
is<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:12.750> connect<00:05:13.050> cable<00:05:13.409> and<00:05:13.590> then<00:05:13.830> for<00:05:14.610> your

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 
is the connect cable and then for your

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.219 
is the connect cable and then for your
Ethernet<00:05:15.120> cable<00:05:15.150> and<00:05:15.569> then<00:05:15.720> I'm<00:05:15.900> guessing

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
Ethernet cable and then I'm guessing

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.350 
Ethernet cable and then I'm guessing
that's<00:05:16.319> some<00:05:16.949> sort<00:05:17.130> of<00:05:17.159> audio<00:05:17.370> port<00:05:17.759> not

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
that's some sort of audio port not

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.270 
that's some sort of audio port not
entirely<00:05:18.690> sure<00:05:18.840> and<00:05:19.199> then<00:05:19.409> and<00:05:19.770> here's<00:05:20.159> the

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
entirely sure and then and here's the

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.540 
entirely sure and then and here's the
top<00:05:20.490> of<00:05:20.729> the<00:05:21.389> Xbox<00:05:21.960> one<00:05:22.289> you<00:05:23.159> have<00:05:23.310> kind<00:05:23.430> of

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
top of the Xbox one you have kind of

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.249 
top of the Xbox one you have kind of
like<00:05:23.699> a<00:05:23.759> nice<00:05:24.030> shiny<00:05:24.300> black<00:05:24.569> layer<00:05:24.810> here<00:05:25.139> and

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
like a nice shiny black layer here and

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.770 
like a nice shiny black layer here and
then<00:05:25.860> a<00:05:25.889> kind<00:05:26.490> of<00:05:26.580> vented<00:05:27.060> sides<00:05:27.389> here<00:05:27.569> which

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
then a kind of vented sides here which

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.270 
then a kind of vented sides here which
hopefully<00:05:28.139> should<00:05:28.319> mean<00:05:28.590> that<00:05:28.620> it<00:05:28.889> has<00:05:29.039> good

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
hopefully should mean that it has good

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.760 
hopefully should mean that it has good
airflow<00:05:29.490> and<00:05:29.940> then<00:05:30.539> from<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:31.020> front<00:05:31.229> here<00:05:31.650> we

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
airflow and then from the front here we

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.399 
airflow and then from the front here we
have<00:05:31.889> the<00:05:32.039> Xbox<00:05:32.610> one<00:05:32.940> logo<00:05:33.719> again<00:05:34.080> on<00:05:34.289> the

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
have the Xbox one logo again on the

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:37.820 
have the Xbox one logo again on the
front<00:05:34.710> and<00:05:34.949> then<00:05:35.310> we<00:05:36.030> have<00:05:36.419> the<00:05:36.930> district

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
front and then we have the district

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.749 
front and then we have the district
right<00:05:37.860> there<00:05:38.130> it<00:05:38.219> looks<00:05:38.340> like<00:05:38.460> you<00:05:38.550> put<00:05:38.729> the

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 
right there it looks like you put the

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.480 
right there it looks like you put the
disc<00:05:39.000> directly<00:05:39.900> in<00:05:40.080> and<00:05:40.530> in<00:05:40.860> the<00:05:40.949> power<00:05:41.159> supply

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
disc directly in and in the power supply

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.909 
disc directly in and in the power supply
button<00:05:41.940> I'm<00:05:42.090> guessing<00:05:42.870> I'm<00:05:43.229> actually<00:05:43.500> not

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
button I'm guessing I'm actually not

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.029 
button I'm guessing I'm actually not
certain<00:05:44.460> where<00:05:45.060> that<00:05:45.270> is<00:05:45.539> on<00:05:45.930> here<00:05:46.259> but<00:05:46.500> I'm

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
certain where that is on here but I'm

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:48.499 
certain where that is on here but I'm
sure<00:05:47.250> I'll<00:05:47.370> figure<00:05:47.520> that<00:05:47.639> ello<00:05:48.000> looks<00:05:48.389> like

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509 
sure I'll figure that ello looks like

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.379 
sure I'll figure that ello looks like
it's<00:05:48.659> right<00:05:48.960> there<00:05:49.349> or<00:05:49.620> maybe<00:05:50.210> maybe<00:05:51.210> that's

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
it's right there or maybe maybe that's

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.089 
it's right there or maybe maybe that's
for<00:05:51.659> actually<00:05:52.050> ejecting<00:05:52.529> a<00:05:52.590> disc<00:05:52.830> I<00:05:52.949> would

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
for actually ejecting a disc I would

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:55.159 
for actually ejecting a disc I would
make<00:05:53.250> more<00:05:53.400> sense<00:05:53.479> but<00:05:54.479> there<00:05:54.750> we<00:05:54.840> go<00:05:54.930> I'll<00:05:55.139> put

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
make more sense but there we go I'll put

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.779 
make more sense but there we go I'll put
that<00:05:55.380> on<00:05:55.529> top<00:05:55.740> of<00:05:55.919> the<00:05:55.979> box<00:05:56.190> you<00:05:56.460> guys<00:05:56.610> can

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
that on top of the box you guys can

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.969 
that on top of the box you guys can
actually<00:05:56.969> see<00:05:57.300> that<00:05:57.599> I<00:05:57.659> so<00:05:57.990> here<00:05:58.229> is<00:05:58.409> the<00:05:58.650> final

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
actually see that I so here is the final

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.370 
actually see that I so here is the final
setup<00:05:59.550> I<00:05:59.729> actually<00:05:59.940> went<00:06:00.509> back<00:06:00.599> and<00:06:00.750> I<00:06:01.080> watched

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
setup I actually went back and I watched

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.920 
setup I actually went back and I watched
my<00:06:01.620> unboxing<00:06:02.430> video<00:06:02.729> and<00:06:02.789> I<00:06:03.389> realized<00:06:03.719> that

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
my unboxing video and I realized that

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.050 
my unboxing video and I realized that
the<00:06:04.110> camera<00:06:04.139> angle<00:06:04.830> that<00:06:05.400> I<00:06:05.430> was<00:06:05.729> recording

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
the camera angle that I was recording

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.999 
the camera angle that I was recording
for<00:06:06.419> him<00:06:06.509> really<00:06:06.779> wasn't<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.229> best<00:06:07.409> angle<00:06:07.860> at

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:08.009 
for him really wasn't the best angle at

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:09.350 
for him really wasn't the best angle at
the<00:06:08.130> time<00:06:08.340> when<00:06:08.490> I<00:06:08.550> set<00:06:08.789> it<00:06:08.819> up<00:06:09.029> it<00:06:09.180> looked

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
the time when I set it up it looked

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.300 
the time when I set it up it looked
pretty<00:06:09.479> good<00:06:09.750> but<00:06:09.900> I<00:06:09.930> didn't<00:06:10.319> take<00:06:11.099> him<00:06:11.190> to

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
pretty good but I didn't take him to

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.189 
pretty good but I didn't take him to
account<00:06:11.610> how<00:06:11.849> big<00:06:12.060> the<00:06:12.150> Xbox<00:06:12.569> one<00:06:12.750> actually

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
account how big the Xbox one actually

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.409 
account how big the Xbox one actually
was<00:06:13.409> and<00:06:13.860> once<00:06:14.370> I<00:06:14.490> put<00:06:14.639> on<00:06:14.789> top<00:06:14.909> of<00:06:15.000> the<00:06:15.060> box<00:06:15.240> at

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
was and once I put on top of the box at

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:16.879 
was and once I put on top of the box at
the<00:06:15.509> end<00:06:15.539> because<00:06:15.960> I<00:06:16.169> wanted<00:06:16.409> you<00:06:16.529> guys<00:06:16.650> to<00:06:16.710> be

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 
the end because I wanted you guys to be

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:17.659 
the end because I wanted you guys to be
able<00:06:16.979> to<00:06:17.069> see<00:06:17.279> it<00:06:17.370> better

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
able to see it better

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.820 
able to see it better
it<00:06:18.270> actually<00:06:18.630> kind<00:06:18.810> of<00:06:18.870> cut<00:06:19.110> off<00:06:19.259> most<00:06:19.500> of<00:06:19.740> it

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
it actually kind of cut off most of it

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.350 
it actually kind of cut off most of it
you<00:06:19.919> couldn't<00:06:20.190> see<00:06:20.279> anything<00:06:20.610> up<00:06:20.819> on<00:06:20.940> top<00:06:21.180> so

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
you couldn't see anything up on top so

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.839 
you couldn't see anything up on top so
here's<00:06:21.599> the<00:06:21.810> final<00:06:22.020> setup<00:06:22.440> there<00:06:23.130> I'm<00:06:23.729> just

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:23.849 
here's the final setup there I'm just

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:25.730 
here's the final setup there I'm just
setting<00:06:24.150> it<00:06:24.270> up<00:06:24.419> on<00:06:24.569> my<00:06:24.719> TV<00:06:24.779> right<00:06:25.380> now<00:06:25.560> I'm

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
setting it up on my TV right now I'm
