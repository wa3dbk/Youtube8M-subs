00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.810
 good day home 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.329
 today I offer you 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:11.119
 contemplate 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.119
 my favorite time of year 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.009
 winter 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.460
 the fact is that winter is in Russia 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.239
 and in Moscow 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.239
 she is especially beautiful 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.810
 White snow 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.769
 white veil 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.170
 gets covered 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.910
 all you can around 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.340
 then 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.830
 Christmas moods 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.990
 prevail 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.000
 when in the light 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.370
 enter the number and you are satisfied 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.370
 the sun is shining in the sky 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.030
 per barrel tons 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.220
 minus 2 degrees 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.530
 on the streets 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.530
 people are all happy 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.220
 At the moment 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.840
 We can observe 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.510
 how beautiful is in Moscow 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.920
 she is 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.950
 on the roads of Moscow 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.260
 this time of year 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.440
 when really 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.080
 I feel like it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.090
 tune in 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.470
 celebration 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.470
 for fun 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.270
 groups 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.870
 here is such flax happy 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.930
 positive people 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.340
 I hope 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.700
 you can watch now 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.880
 such happy people who are just 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.290
 burst with happiness 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.160
 of what they are 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
 watching in front of you 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.650
 you can 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.800
 Duma observers have already paid attention to 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.030
 how much 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.960
 quality cleaned 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.280
 snow 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.970
 if anyone else 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.540
 I do not know and did not guess 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.870
 are on 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.870
 third transport ring 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.550
 unique new roads 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.879
 which was 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.989
 designed by 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.639
 in the twenty first century 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.299
 Raul is unique 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.499
 unique development 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.969
 Beijing engineers 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.969
 this road designer 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:27.049
 in face 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.969
 would say frankly 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.219
 thank 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.609
 here in the face 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.149
 face said thank you because without this 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:37.329
 the road 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.049
 I do not know how 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.779
 go on living 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:43.359
 and Moscow baku 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.359
 I think the bar plunged into the abyss of chaos 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.599
 traffic collapse 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.909
 not built there 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.539
 third transport ring 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:57.959
 well, as you can see 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.839
 Naturally the problem of traffic jams 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:02.329
 processor 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.189
 so that yushchenko 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.769
 inspection design 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.989
 interchanges 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.659
 This usually happens in Russia 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.959
 in particular in Moscow 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.959
 here of course they immediately resolved 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.279
 difficult utility 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:29.009
 All clean money Russia and in particular 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.559
 Moscow is now a lot 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:33.579
 that's how you see they are spent 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.579
 pretty effective 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:44.719
 now we are watching the exit 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.359
 yourself 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.649
 third ring road 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:49.949
 she is 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.949
 Warsaw highway 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.879
 I can say that this congress 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.079
 done pretty well 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.269
 Here you see one glass 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.269
 second hundred to the soul 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.530
 really 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.869
 complicated 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:12.329
 modern 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.079
 engineering you engineering 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.689
 technical solutions 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.629
 which allowed 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:20.509
 untie 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.599
 This transport hub is so 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.059
 so good 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:27.689
 what 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:30.990
 you can see now 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.259
 all consequences are all positive 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.129
 consequences of this 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:37.509
 the construction of this 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.509
 this solution 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.909
 on my own I want to add that 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.919
 really like 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.189
 Rides on Moscow this 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:55.150
 it is a very nice city 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.800
 really year 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.210
 thats just before it takes pride thats 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.319
 especially at this time of year 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:03.249
 when you go around Moscow so here 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:05.020
 nice nice that 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.300
 here in the heart is breaking and and 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.360
 never want from here 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.249
 leave 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:13.249
 there is no such thought 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.900
 just want 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.439
 say thanks 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.439
 fight 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:21.400
 Vladimir Vladimirovich 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.300
 I take this opportunity to say 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.589
