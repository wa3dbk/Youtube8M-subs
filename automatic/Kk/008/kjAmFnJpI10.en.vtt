00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
spikes challenge now it seems like a lot

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.560 
spikes challenge now it seems like a lot
but<00:00:23.039> it's<00:00:23.189> really<00:00:23.250> not<00:00:23.789> because<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.269> it's

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
but it's really not because it it's

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.750 
but it's really not because it it's
actually<00:00:24.869> fairly<00:00:25.109> difficult<00:00:25.490> now<00:00:26.490> what<00:00:26.730> I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
actually fairly difficult now what I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.640 
actually fairly difficult now what I
have<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.090> use<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.390> pop<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.050> blue<00:00:28.230> what<00:00:28.560> I'm

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
have to use the pop the blue what I'm

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.960 
have to use the pop the blue what I'm
using<00:00:28.769> at<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> beginning<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.429> I'm<00:00:29.550> using<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
using at the beginning is I'm using the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.700 
using at the beginning is I'm using the
glue<00:00:30.420> gunner<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.929> I'm<00:00:31.170> obviously<00:00:31.320> using

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
glue gunner and I'm obviously using

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.620 
glue gunner and I'm obviously using
corrosive<00:00:32.160> glue<00:00:32.340> it's<00:00:32.610> not<00:00:32.940> actually<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
corrosive glue it's not actually the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.139 
corrosive glue it's not actually the
easiest<00:00:33.899> thing<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.380> world<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.920> do<00:00:35.730> now<00:00:36.090> you

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
easiest thing in the world to do now you

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.330 
easiest thing in the world to do now you
might<00:00:36.329> think<00:00:36.690> oh<00:00:37.320> well<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.800> know<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.070> seems

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
might think oh well you know that seems

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.610 
might think oh well you know that seems
like<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.489> lot<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> tower<00:00:38.910> as<00:00:39.180> well<00:00:39.500> number<00:00:40.500> one

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
like a lot of tower as well number one

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.530 
like a lot of tower as well number one
road<00:00:40.860> spikes<00:00:41.129> aren't<00:00:41.430> our<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.120> need<00:00:42.360> them

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
road spikes aren't our but I need them

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.569 
road spikes aren't our but I need them
to<00:00:42.570> pop<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> first<00:00:43.230> few<00:00:43.410> Moab's<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.070> you'll

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
to pop the first few Moab's and you'll

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.540 
to pop the first few Moab's and you'll
see<00:00:44.879> how<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.239> pop<00:00:45.719> those<00:00:45.989> later<00:00:46.379> Moab's<00:00:46.770> because

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
see how I pop those later Moab's because

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.979 
see how I pop those later Moab's because
obviously<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.910> can't<00:00:48.149> use<00:00:48.270> road<00:00:48.510> spikes<00:00:48.780> for

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
obviously I can't use road spikes for

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.569 
obviously I can't use road spikes for
everything<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.309> medium

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
everything and this is on medium

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.740 
everything and this is on medium

reason why I did it is because sometimes

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.200 
reason why I did it is because sometimes
you<00:01:18.689> get<00:01:18.869> videos<00:01:19.259> get<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.470> bit<00:01:20.009> too<00:01:20.220> long<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.759> I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
you get videos get a bit too long and I

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
try to think of something a bit

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.740 
try to think of something a bit
different<00:01:46.870> and<00:01:47.700> make<00:01:48.700> it<00:01:48.850> so<00:01:49.000> is<00:01:49.150> not<00:01:49.420> always

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
different and make it so is not always

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.600 
different and make it so is not always
on<00:01:50.140> hard<00:01:50.410> difficulty<00:01:50.800> so<00:01:51.130> make<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.430> like<00:01:51.580> a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
on hard difficulty so make it like a

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.070 
on hard difficulty so make it like a
difficult<00:01:51.880> challenge<00:01:52.390> i'm<00:01:52.720> not<00:01:52.840> saying

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
difficult challenge i'm not saying

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.530 
difficult challenge i'm not saying
making<00:01:53.530> them<00:01:53.680> any<00:01:53.950> easier<00:01:54.520> make<00:01:55.210> them<00:01:55.390> even

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
making them any easier make them even

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.510 
making them any easier make them even
harder<00:01:56.080> just<00:01:56.410> make<00:01:56.620> them<00:01:56.770> on<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:56.980> with<00:01:57.070> medium

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
harder just make them on it with medium

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.360 
harder just make them on it with medium
difficulty<00:01:57.940> because<00:01:58.350> honestly<00:01:59.350> most<00:02:00.070> of<00:02:00.280> the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
difficulty because honestly most of the

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.000 
difficulty because honestly most of the
times<00:02:00.640> if<00:02:00.880> i<00:02:00.940> can<00:02:01.090> beat<00:02:01.240> them<00:02:01.420> on<00:02:01.690> medium<00:02:02.680> i<00:02:02.830> can

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
times if i can beat them on medium i can

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.300 
times if i can beat them on medium i can
probably<00:02:03.310> beat<00:02:03.580> them<00:02:03.730> on<00:02:03.880> hard<00:02:04.240> because<00:02:05.310> quite

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
probably beat them on hard because quite

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.730 
probably beat them on hard because quite
frankly<00:02:06.369> it<00:02:07.060> seems<00:02:07.420> like<00:02:07.750> i<00:02:08.020> only<00:02:08.560> have

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
frankly it seems like i only have

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.260 
frankly it seems like i only have
difficulty<00:02:09.220> at<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.399> beginning<00:02:09.760> like<00:02:09.910> look<00:02:10.179> at

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
difficulty at the beginning like look at

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.540 
difficulty at the beginning like look at
this<00:02:10.450> i<00:02:10.630> am<00:02:10.660> losing<00:02:10.990> a<00:02:11.260> lot<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.680> lives<00:02:12.070> here<00:02:12.370> i

the<00:06:58.420> balloons<00:06:58.690> just<00:06:59.290> as<00:06:59.440> it<00:06:59.590> gets<00:06:59.740> to<00:06:59.890> the

00:06:59.970 --> 00:06:59.980 
the balloons just as it gets to the

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.820 
the balloons just as it gets to the
spikes<00:07:00.370> I<00:07:00.640> into<00:07:01.030> the<00:07:01.150> ice<00:07:01.330> shards<00:07:01.720> so<00:07:01.900> that<00:07:02.080> the

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
spikes I into the ice shards so that the

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.730 
spikes I into the ice shards so that the
ice<00:07:03.010> shards<00:07:03.400> get<00:07:03.660> to<00:07:04.660> them<00:07:04.840> and<00:07:04.990> pop<00:07:05.200> them<00:07:05.470> all

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
ice shards get to them and pop them all

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.770 
ice shards get to them and pop them all
like<00:07:06.040> that<00:07:06.340> that<00:07:06.550> is<00:07:06.670> just<00:07:06.700> mass<00:07:07.090> destruction

like that that is just mass destruction

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.200 
like that that is just mass destruction

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
you can even see the lag that it's just

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.850 
you can even see the lag that it's just
