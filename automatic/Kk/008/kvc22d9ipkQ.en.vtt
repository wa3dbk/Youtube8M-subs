 and then so you are going to serve on a fly and 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.030
 then you download it 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.790
 in the meantime you go to 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.390
 minecraft 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.390

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.270
 so for ship it no and minecraft 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.490
 and then you start it up 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.760

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.830
