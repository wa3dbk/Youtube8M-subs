and you can fly the cool bit about this
airplane<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.999> it<00:00:30.659> has<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.259> blow<00:00:31.679> molded<00:00:32.070> plastic

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
airplane is it has a blow molded plastic

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.020 
airplane is it has a blow molded plastic
piece<00:00:32.610> lon

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
piece lon

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.030 
piece lon
so<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.600> extremely<00:00:33.900> durable<00:00:34.440> which<00:00:34.860> is

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
so it is extremely durable which is

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.430 
so it is extremely durable which is
great<00:00:35.340> because<00:00:35.580> as<00:00:36.150> those<00:00:36.720> you<00:00:36.900> that<00:00:37.050> are<00:00:37.170> into

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
great because as those you that are into

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.290 
great because as those you that are into
slopes<00:00:37.800> or<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.100> know<00:00:38.250> sometimes<00:00:39.090> your

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
slopes or you know sometimes your

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.880 
slopes or you know sometimes your
landing<00:00:39.600> area<00:00:39.840> isn't<00:00:40.050> always<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.530> greatest

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
landing area isn't always the greatest

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.540 
landing area isn't always the greatest
so<00:00:41.670> plastic<00:00:42.600> fuselage<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.650> comes<00:00:43.950> with<00:00:44.160> molded

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
so plastic fuselage it comes with molded

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.410 
so plastic fuselage it comes with molded
epo<00:00:45.060> wing<00:00:45.900> and<00:00:46.140> tail<00:00:46.590> parts<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.030> servos

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
epo wing and tail parts all the servos

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.320 
epo wing and tail parts all the servos
are<00:00:48.630> pre-installed<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.830> there's<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.760> LAN

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330
