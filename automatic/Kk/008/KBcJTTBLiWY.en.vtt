get yes we got another boomerang suit
and<00:02:23.650> let's<00:02:24.650> say<00:02:24.770> toads<00:02:25.010> just<00:02:25.280> hanging<00:02:25.550> out

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
and let's say toads just hanging out

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.270 
and let's say toads just hanging out
here<00:02:25.910> all<00:02:26.180> right<00:02:26.569> we<00:02:27.140> can<00:02:27.290> now<00:02:27.440> make<00:02:27.920> our<00:02:28.100> way

nice<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:37.520> 3d<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.330> it<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.930> tough<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.230> play

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
nice in 3d and it is tough to play

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.410 
nice in 3d and it is tough to play
through<00:02:39.830> this<00:02:40.010> game<00:02:40.250> when<00:02:40.640> it's<00:02:40.790> in<00:02:40.940> 2d
