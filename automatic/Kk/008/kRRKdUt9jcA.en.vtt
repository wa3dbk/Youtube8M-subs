let's start off with springtime

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.700 
let's start off with springtime
springtime<00:00:22.249> which<00:00:22.630> it<00:00:23.630> is<00:00:23.779> not<00:00:23.960> spring<00:00:24.320> and

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
springtime which it is not spring and

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.329 
springtime which it is not spring and
now<00:00:24.919> moving<00:00:25.220> into<00:00:25.400> summer<00:00:26.409> springtime<00:00:27.409> tends

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:28.339 
now moving into summer springtime tends

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.099 
now moving into summer springtime tends
to<00:00:28.460> be<00:00:28.519> the<00:00:28.640> time<00:00:28.849> when<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.210> humidity<00:00:29.810> comes

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
to be the time when the humidity comes

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.090 
to be the time when the humidity comes
back<00:00:31.329> which<00:00:32.329> yeah<00:00:32.810> we<00:00:33.110> have<00:00:33.260> most<00:00:33.650> of<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:33.920> year

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
back which yeah we have most of the year

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.970 
back which yeah we have most of the year
in<00:00:34.250> Hong<00:00:34.400> Kong<00:00:35.079> it<00:00:36.079> tends<00:00:36.260> to<00:00:36.350> be<00:00:36.500> very<00:00:36.649> wet

usually quite cold but then after

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.289 
usually quite cold but then after
Chinese<00:01:19.040> New<00:01:19.250> Year<00:01:19.460> it<00:01:19.670> slowly<00:01:19.939> starts

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
Chinese New Year it slowly starts

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.069 
Chinese New Year it slowly starts
heating<00:01:20.479> up<00:01:21.040> he<00:01:22.040> gets<00:01:22.220> very<00:01:22.369> hot<00:01:22.970> very<00:01:23.810> hot

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
heating up he gets very hot very hot

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.380 
heating up he gets very hot very hot
days<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:24.350> then<00:01:24.680> very<00:01:24.829> cold<00:01:25.130> days<00:01:25.340> quite<00:01:26.180> often

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
days and then very cold days quite often

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.139 
days and then very cold days quite often
the<00:01:26.689> next<00:01:26.810> day<00:01:27.159> and<00:01:28.159> it<00:01:28.310> happens<00:01:28.850> that<00:01:28.970> quickly

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
the next day and it happens that quickly

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.670 
the next day and it happens that quickly
so<00:01:32.149> by<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.450> end<00:01:32.570> of<00:01:32.780> spring<00:01:32.869> is<00:01:33.259> this<00:01:33.380> usually

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
so by the end of spring is this usually

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.899 
so by the end of spring is this usually

another video which I'll do

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.850 
another video which I'll do
purely<00:02:11.030> on<00:02:11.240> typhoons<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:14.500> yeah<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.680> can<00:02:15.830> be

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
purely on typhoons and yeah it can be

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.320 
purely on typhoons and yeah it can be
very<00:02:16.100> hard<00:02:16.310> from<00:02:16.940> I<00:02:17.390> would<00:02:17.630> say<00:02:18.160> minimum<00:02:19.330> 25

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
very hard from I would say minimum 25

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.710 
very hard from I would say minimum 25
degrees<00:02:21.050> Celsius<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:22.240> mid<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.540> high<00:02:23.840> 30s<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:26.270> was
