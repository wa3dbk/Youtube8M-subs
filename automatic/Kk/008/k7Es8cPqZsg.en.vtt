00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.490 
they improve performance so thank God
they<00:05:13.790> are<00:05:13.820> here<00:05:14.180> and<00:05:14.420> as<00:05:14.690> you<00:05:14.780> can<00:05:14.900> see<00:05:14.960> opening

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
they are here and as you can see opening

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.520 
they are here and as you can see opening
the<00:05:15.620> briefing<00:05:16.040> now<00:05:16.220> is<00:05:16.540> super<00:05:17.540> fast<00:05:17.870> just<00:05:18.440> like

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
the briefing now is super fast just like

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.950 
the briefing now is super fast just like
the<00:05:18.830> camera<00:05:19.280> which<00:05:19.820> works<00:05:20.090> faster<00:05:20.510> and<00:05:20.720> the

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
the camera which works faster and the

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.000 
the camera which works faster and the
camera<00:05:21.350> is<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:22.310> is<00:05:22.670> the<00:05:22.820> one<00:05:22.970> from<00:05:23.060> the<00:05:23.180> galaxy

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
camera is the is the one from the galaxy

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.100 
camera is the is the one from the galaxy
s4<00:05:25.010> so<00:05:25.670> the<00:05:25.850> original<00:05:26.270> camera<00:05:26.510> which<00:05:26.720> is<00:05:26.870> also

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
s4 so the original camera which is also

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.420 
s4 so the original camera which is also
nice<00:05:27.410> to<00:05:27.470> have<00:05:27.710> since<00:05:29.080> since<00:05:30.080> cameras<00:05:30.980> ported

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
nice to have since since cameras ported

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.030 
nice to have since since cameras ported
from<00:05:31.580> other<00:05:31.910> devices<00:05:32.420> don't<00:05:33.350> normally<00:05:33.830> work

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
from other devices don't normally work

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.910 
from other devices don't normally work
good<00:05:34.400> because<00:05:35.270> of<00:05:35.450> the<00:05:35.650> cameras<00:05:36.650> of

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
good because of the cameras of

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.490 
good because of the cameras of
resolutions<00:05:37.640> and<00:05:37.850> all<00:05:38.000> those<00:05:38.810> things<00:05:39.200> that

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
resolutions and all those things that

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.470 
resolutions and all those things that
may<00:05:40.390> haven't<00:05:41.390> conflict<00:05:42.080> with<00:05:42.320> each<00:05:42.440> other<00:05:42.680> but

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
may haven't conflict with each other but

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.690 
may haven't conflict with each other but
but<00:05:44.480> overall<00:05:44.960> the<00:05:45.350> this<00:05:45.890> ROM<00:05:46.160> works<00:05:46.490> pretty

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
but overall the this ROM works pretty

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.400 
but overall the this ROM works pretty
fast<00:05:46.940> everything<00:05:47.270> I've<00:05:47.570> been<00:05:47.900> using<00:05:48.140> this

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
fast everything I've been using this

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.820 
fast everything I've been using this
room<00:05:48.650> for<00:05:48.890> about<00:05:49.100> 2<00:05:49.670> days<00:05:50.020> it<00:05:51.020> only<00:05:51.140> had<00:05:51.500> one

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
room for about 2 days it only had one

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.460 
room for about 2 days it only had one
force<00:05:52.550> close<00:05:52.850> and<00:05:53.150> it's<00:05:53.270> sometimes<00:05:54.260> when<00:05:54.440> I

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
force close and it's sometimes when I

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.860 
force close and it's sometimes when I
power<00:05:54.860> up<00:05:54.980> the<00:05:55.130> phone<00:05:55.370> I<00:05:55.580> get<00:05:55.820> a<00:05:55.850> message<00:05:56.240> that

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
power up the phone I get a message that

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.290 
power up the phone I get a message that
says<00:05:57.070> touch<00:05:58.070> with<00:05:58.280> stopped<00:05:58.610> but<00:05:58.910> then<00:05:59.120> I<00:05:59.150> do

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
says touch with stopped but then I do

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.540 
says touch with stopped but then I do
not<00:05:59.600> get<00:05:59.810> that<00:06:00.020> message<00:06:00.200> I<00:06:00.560> press<00:06:01.160> ok<00:06:01.520> and

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
not get that message I press ok and

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.480 
not get that message I press ok and
everything<00:06:02.060> is<00:06:02.750> fine<00:06:03.080> again<00:06:03.380> you<00:06:03.980> also<00:06:04.160> don't

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
everything is fine again you also don't

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.410 
everything is fine again you also don't
have<00:06:04.670> the<00:06:04.990> D<00:06:05.990> notifications<00:06:06.710> toggles<00:06:07.220> the

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
have the D notifications toggles the

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.790 
have the D notifications toggles the
navigation<00:06:08.420> now<00:06:08.570> the<00:06:09.020> quick<00:06:09.260> toggles<00:06:09.650> those

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
navigation now the quick toggles those

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.980 
navigation now the quick toggles those
giant<00:06:10.340> and<00:06:10.520> a<00:06:10.940> lot<00:06:11.180> of<00:06:11.210> quick<00:06:11.450> toggles<00:06:11.750> that<00:06:11.780> we

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
giant and a lot of quick toggles that we

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.160 
giant and a lot of quick toggles that we
use<00:06:12.140> to<00:06:12.350> have<00:06:12.530> now<00:06:13.130> we<00:06:13.190> don't<00:06:13.520> which<00:06:13.880> is<00:06:14.170> not

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.170 
use to have now we don't which is not

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
use to have now we don't which is not
good<00:06:15.640> since<00:06:16.640> it<00:06:16.970> was<00:06:17.330> a<00:06:17.360> faster<00:06:18.320> way<00:06:18.470> to<00:06:18.500> get<00:06:19.130> to

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
good since it was a faster way to get to

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.360 
good since it was a faster way to get to
NFC<00:06:19.880> and<00:06:20.120> Bluetooth<00:06:20.410> but<00:06:21.410> well<00:06:21.800> we<00:06:22.010> have<00:06:22.040> that

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
NFC and Bluetooth but well we have that

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.750 
NFC and Bluetooth but well we have that
