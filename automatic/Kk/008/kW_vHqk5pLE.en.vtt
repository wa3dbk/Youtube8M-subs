00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
okay so I snuck in a kind of where I had

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.030 
okay so I snuck in a kind of where I had

there's<00:02:06.510> a<00:02:06.570> really<00:02:06.810> interesting<00:02:06.840> thing<00:02:07.140> at

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
there's a really interesting thing at

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.719 
there's a really interesting thing at
the<00:02:07.409> very<00:02:07.590> beginning<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:08.100> this<00:02:08.220> one<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.580> whole

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
the very beginning of this one the whole

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.910 
the very beginning of this one the whole
thing<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.209> beginning<00:02:10.610> yeah

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
thing that beginning yeah

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.100 
thing that beginning yeah
that<00:02:13.920> was<00:02:14.069> originally<00:02:14.520> sequenced<00:02:15.209> okay<00:02:15.840> on<00:02:16.050> a

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
that was originally sequenced okay on a

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.440 
that was originally sequenced okay on a
synthesizer<00:02:16.830> they<00:02:17.459> sequenced<00:02:17.819> it<00:02:18.120> meaning

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
synthesizer they sequenced it meaning

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.750 
synthesizer they sequenced it meaning
that<00:02:18.480> they<00:02:18.870> put<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:19.890> typed<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.520> into<00:02:20.670> a

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
that they put that typed it into a

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.610 
that they put that typed it into a
computer<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.300> computer<00:02:21.780> played<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.260> right

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
computer in the computer played it right

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.160 
computer in the computer played it right
so<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:22.950> wasn't<00:02:23.730> anything<00:02:24.030> designed<00:02:24.870> for<00:02:25.110> a

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
so it wasn't anything designed for a

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.860 
so it wasn't anything designed for a
piano<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.680> play<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:26.030> at<00:02:27.030> first<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.510> wasn't<00:02:27.690> going

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
piano to play so at first I wasn't going

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.750 
piano to play so at first I wasn't going
to<00:02:27.930> touch<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.290> at<00:02:28.410> all<00:02:28.560> no<00:02:28.770> maybe<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.550> turn

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
to touch it at all no maybe I can turn

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.210 
to touch it at all no maybe I can turn
it<00:02:29.880> into<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.440> piano<00:02:31.440> thing<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.980> if<00:02:32.070> I

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
it into a piano thing and if I

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.070 
it into a piano thing and if I
harmonized<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.300> might<00:02:33.420> almost<00:02:33.690> sound<00:02:34.019> like

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
harmonized it it might almost sound like

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.500 
harmonized it it might almost sound like
a<00:02:34.170> little<00:02:34.470> Bach<00:02:34.680> Prelude<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:36.090> this<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.300> kind<00:02:36.480> of
