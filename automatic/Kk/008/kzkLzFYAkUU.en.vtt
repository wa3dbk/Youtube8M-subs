bit about how we're gonna do this write
a<00:00:32.250> curves<00:00:32.820> adjustment<00:00:33.329> layer<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.719> then<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
a curves adjustment layer and then a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.510 
a curves adjustment layer and then a
hue/saturation<00:00:34.230> layer<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> finish<00:00:35.460> it

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
hue/saturation layer and to finish it

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.400 
hue/saturation layer and to finish it
off<00:00:35.700> okay<00:00:36.360> well<00:00:36.600> let's<00:00:36.750> go<00:00:36.899> ahead<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.230> press

the i key to select our eyedropper tool

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.000 
the i key to select our eyedropper tool
next<00:00:39.600> navigate<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> sample<00:00:40.800> size

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
next navigate to the sample size

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.650 
next navigate to the sample size
something<00:00:41.489> other<00:00:41.730> than<00:00:41.940> point<00:00:42.180> sample<00:00:42.390> in

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
something other than point sample in

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.049 
something other than point sample in
this<00:00:42.750> case<00:00:42.989> 5x5<00:00:43.770> average<00:00:44.219> well<00:00:44.789> then<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
this case 5x5 average well then the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.520 
this case 5x5 average well then the
shift<00:00:45.270> key<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.899> we'll<00:00:46.020> click<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.320> at<00:00:46.500> a

shift key and we'll click this at a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.470 
shift key and we'll click this at a
point<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:46.860> off<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.370> highlight<00:00:47.789> here<00:00:48.059> and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
point just off of the highlight here and

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.790 
point just off of the highlight here and
that<00:00:48.600> looks<00:00:48.809> pretty<00:00:48.899> good<00:00:49.110> take<00:00:49.500> our<00:00:49.649> values

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
that looks pretty good take our values

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.970 
that looks pretty good take our values
to<00:00:50.070> CMYK<00:00:51.000> color<00:00:51.539> now<00:00:52.230> our<00:00:52.289> percentages<00:00:52.829> are

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
to CMYK color now our percentages are

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.130 
to CMYK color now our percentages are
all<00:00:53.100> pretty<00:00:53.309> high<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.850> cyan<00:00:54.270> amount<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.780> much

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
all pretty high that cyan amount is much

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.200 
all pretty high that cyan amount is much
too<00:00:55.469> high<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.890> need<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> fix<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.059> go

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
too high so I need to fix that so go

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.430 
too high so I need to fix that so go
into<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> adjustments<00:00:57.809> panel<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.079> click<00:00:58.320> on

to try to get my sine amount about 50%

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.330 
to try to get my sine amount about 50%
of<00:01:21.420> these<00:01:21.540> two<00:01:21.750> values<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.200> go<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
of these two values here go to that

of these two values here go to that
green<00:01:23.580> magenta<00:01:23.729> channel<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.960> bring<00:01:25.259> that

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
green magenta channel and bring that

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.010 
green magenta channel and bring that
down<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.619> little<00:01:25.860> bit<00:01:26.040> more<00:01:26.250> as<00:01:26.520> well<00:01:27.000> okay<00:01:27.840> well

down a little bit more as well okay well
we're<00:01:28.290> right<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.799> range<00:01:29.189> except<00:01:29.790> one<00:01:29.939> of

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
we're right in the range except one of

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.460 
we're right in the range except one of
things<00:01:30.150> we're<00:01:30.299> noticing<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:30.990> image<00:01:31.290> has

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
things we're noticing is this image has

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.620 
things we're noticing is this image has
too<00:01:31.680> much<00:01:31.829> red<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.670> right<00:01:32.850> let's<00:01:33.450> take<00:01:33.570> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
too much red in it right let's take a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.850 
too much red in it right let's take a
look<00:01:33.840> at<00:01:33.900> our<00:01:33.990> before<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.320> after<00:01:34.470> here's

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
look at our before and after here's

before and now here's after well in this
case<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.280> skin<00:01:38.520> tone<00:01:38.759> was<00:01:39.000> green<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.570> didn't

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
case the skin tone was green it didn't

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.330 
case the skin tone was green it didn't
look<00:01:39.990> very<00:01:40.049> good<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.530> was<00:01:40.619> kind<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.799> green<00:01:41.070> cyan

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
look very good it was kind of green cyan

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.999 
look very good it was kind of green cyan
here<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> looks<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.630> little<00:01:42.750> bit<00:01:42.930> better<00:01:43.140> now<00:01:43.860> if

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
here it looks a little bit better now if

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.859 
here it looks a little bit better now if
we<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.280> err<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.880> side<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.149> warming-up

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
we have to err on the side of warming-up

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.719 
we have to err on the side of warming-up
skin<00:01:46.320> typically<00:01:46.950> that's<00:01:47.100> what<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.340> want<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.610> do

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
skin typically that's what we want to do

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.609 
skin typically that's what we want to do
right<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:48.899> where<00:01:49.079> we're<00:01:49.290> at<00:01:49.320> right

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
right and so that's where we're at right

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.440 
right and so that's where we're at right
now<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.369> next<00:01:50.700> step<00:01:50.850> though<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.329> be

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
now the next step though is going to be

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.030 
now the next step though is going to be
to<00:01:51.570> navigate<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.290> adjustment<00:01:52.740> layer<00:01:52.860> icon

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
to navigate to the adjustment layer icon

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.670 
to navigate to the adjustment layer icon

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
adjustment tool and then click on the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.700 
adjustment tool and then click on the
skin<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.630> will<00:01:57.719> take<00:01:57.930> us<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.320> reds<00:01:58.560> and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
skin that will take us to the reds and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.929 
skin that will take us to the reds and
we're<00:01:58.890> going<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.040> click<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.399> drag<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.880> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
we're going to click and drag to the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.730 
we're going to click and drag to the
left<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.479> order<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> remove<00:02:01.229> some<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.619> those

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
left in order to remove some of those

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.709 
left in order to remove some of those
now<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:02.430> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> increase<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.329> cyan

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
now that's going to increase the cyan

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.690 
now that's going to increase the cyan
amount<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:04.799> there<00:02:05.040> yet<00:02:05.579> I'm

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
amount that we can see there yet I'm

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.889 
amount that we can see there yet I'm
going<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.909> do<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.329> because<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.689> think<00:02:06.750> that

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
going to do that because I think that

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.900 
going to do that because I think that
looks<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.439> little<00:02:07.560> bit<00:02:07.740> better<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.640> here<00:02:08.819> we

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
looks a little bit better and here we

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.520 
looks a little bit better and here we
can<00:02:09.030> see<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.300> now<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.720> amount<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.170> even

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
can see that now this amount is even

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.260 
can see that now this amount is even
higher<00:02:10.770> but<00:02:11.160> here's<00:02:11.489> our<00:02:11.670> before-and-after

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
higher but here's our before-and-after

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.200 
higher but here's our before-and-after
with<00:02:12.750> that

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
with that

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.540 
with that
bringing<00:02:13.720> down<00:02:13.870> those<00:02:14.230> Reds<00:02:14.590> now<00:02:15.130> we<00:02:15.190> may<00:02:15.370> want

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
bringing down those Reds now we may want

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.950 
bringing down those Reds now we may want
to<00:02:15.580> work<00:02:15.730> on<00:02:15.910> this<00:02:16.030> yellow<00:02:16.330> channel<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> little

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
to work on this yellow channel a little

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.300 
to work on this yellow channel a little
bit<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:17.230> we<00:02:17.320> can<00:02:17.410> double-click<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:18.010> curves

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
bit so we can double-click the curves

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.280 
bit so we can double-click the curves
adjustment<00:02:18.880> layer<00:02:18.910> icon<00:02:19.270> now<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:19.900> get<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.170> that

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
adjustment layer icon now we get to that

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.140 
adjustment layer icon now we get to that
blue<00:02:20.560> yellow<00:02:20.890> channel<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.460> again<00:02:21.610> just

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
blue yellow channel and again just

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.360 
blue yellow channel and again just
subjectively<00:02:22.900> begin<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.740> see<00:02:23.890> how<00:02:24.040> we<00:02:24.100> can

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
subjectively begin to see how we can

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.860 
subjectively begin to see how we can
move<00:02:24.520> this<00:02:24.730> one<00:02:24.970> way<00:02:25.150> or<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.330> other<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.810> keep

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
move this one way or the other and keep

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.990 
move this one way or the other and keep
in<00:02:26.170> mind<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.620> lot<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.920> times<00:02:27.220> what's<00:02:27.850> going

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
in mind that a lot of times what's going

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.070 
in mind that a lot of times what's going
to<00:02:28.030> happen<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.480> we're<00:02:28.630> going<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.780> have<00:02:28.930> a

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
to happen is we're going to have a

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.110 
to happen is we're going to have a
little<00:02:29.440> bit<00:02:29.530> more<00:02:29.740> of<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:29.920> range<00:02:30.220> or<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.880> little

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
little bit more of a range or a little

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.700 
little bit more of a range or a little
bit<00:02:31.210> more<00:02:31.330> difference<00:02:31.780> between<00:02:31.840> our<00:02:32.170> magenta

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
bit more difference between our magenta

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.960 
bit more difference between our magenta
and<00:02:32.860> our<00:02:32.950> yellow<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.490> yellow<00:02:33.520> will<00:02:33.850> be<00:02:33.880> a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
and our yellow the yellow will be a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.970 
and our yellow the yellow will be a
touch<00:02:34.270> higher<00:02:34.510> there<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.050> then<00:02:35.470> again<00:02:35.710> we<00:02:35.830> can

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
touch higher there and then again we can

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.710 
touch higher there and then again we can
kind<00:02:36.190> of<00:02:36.220> subjectively<00:02:36.850> dial<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.330> in<00:02:37.540> I'm

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
kind of subjectively dial that in I'm

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
kind of subjectively dial that in I'm
just<00:02:37.900> going<00:02:38.020> to<00:02:38.080> go<00:02:38.200> ahead<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.410> experiment

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
just going to go ahead and experiment

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.140 
just going to go ahead and experiment
with<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.160> little<00:02:39.490> bit<00:02:39.670> more<00:02:39.880> see<00:02:40.030> what

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
with this a little bit more see what

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.580 
with this a little bit more see what
happens<00:02:40.360> if<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.480> bring<00:02:40.720> in<00:02:40.900> just<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.320> touch<00:02:41.560> more

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
happens if I bring in just a touch more

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.860 
happens if I bring in just a touch more
yellow<00:02:42.160> there<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.700> let's<00:02:43.360> see<00:02:43.480> our<00:02:43.570> overall
