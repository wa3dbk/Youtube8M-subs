00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.460
 Hi everyone, you are very welcome. 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.410
 to my office san andrÃ©s izarra ebx 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.630
 the endocrinologist and look that I 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.480
 I prepared a coffee table for you 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.550
 talk about the importance of our 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.990
 breakfast when we want 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.010
 and also when we do not 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.590
 want to lose weight 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.019
 clinical studies say that most 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.760
 of people who are overweight or 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:37.769
 with obesity are people who do not 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.780
 they take breakfast early in the morning from 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.940
 regularly and sometimes they never take 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.040
 either because they are late or because 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.590
 gets a little more sick in the early morning 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.340
 But when we stay a long time in 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.980
 fasting 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.690
 the tendency of our organism is always 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.440
 that people are all food that people 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.120
 to feed 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.969
 it is touched in the form of fat 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.610
 then one of the ways we get 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.620
 changing our habits is doing a good job 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.199
 breakfast before leaving home 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.720
 Of course it does not and that whole amount 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.170
 which I prepared but two slices of bread 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.360
 whole- grain toast or cereals 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.210
 integral are a good choice of 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.520
 carbohydrate that will offer fiber and 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.340
 will make you have society 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.619
 throughout the day and in the morning 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.820
 in addition foods containing 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.030
 calcium as white cheese and curd urt 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.009
 supply the calcium and phosphorus 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.580
 proteins to get you started on your 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.250
 day 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.049
 here we also separated fruits that 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.299
 people can also ingest the amount 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.460
 will depend on the amount of calories 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.040
 What are you going to be able to do throughout the day? 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.350
 An apple 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.230
 but half apple this will depend on your 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.220
 diet and also I separated two juices 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.710

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.110

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.300
