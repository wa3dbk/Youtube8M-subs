this<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.069> something<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.480> white<00:02:30.480> might<00:02:31.290> have

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
this is something that white might have

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.110 
this is something that white might have
been<00:02:31.620> thinking<00:02:32.069> black<00:02:32.489> would<00:02:32.700> do<00:02:32.849> at<00:02:33.000> this

been thinking black would do at this

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.960 
been thinking black would do at this
point<00:02:33.560> if<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.860> did<00:02:35.130> come<00:02:35.280> about<00:02:35.550> if<00:02:35.670> Bishop

point if that did come about if Bishop

takes Knight the Queen just grabs the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.949 
takes Knight the Queen just grabs the
knight<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.860> white<00:02:38.670> as<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.030> side<00:02:39.239> is<00:02:39.420> just<00:02:39.630> up<00:02:39.840> a

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
knight in white as the side is just up a

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.259 
knight in white as the side is just up a
minor<00:02:40.170> piece<00:02:40.440> but<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.489> trick<00:02:41.730> here<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.090> not

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
minor piece but the trick here is to not

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.630 
minor piece but the trick here is to not

switch<00:04:17.160> that<00:04:17.340> up<00:04:17.780> and<00:04:18.780> now<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.049> can<00:04:19.260> have

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
switch that up and now you can have

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.129 
switch that up and now you can have
Bishop<00:04:19.739> here<00:04:20.160> Bishop<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.090> g5<00:04:21.479> as<00:04:21.690> well<00:04:21.870> and

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
Bishop here Bishop to g5 as well and

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.170 
Bishop here Bishop to g5 as well and
this<00:04:22.560> is<00:04:22.740> an<00:04:22.889> interesting<00:04:23.160> move<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.820> run<00:04:24.000> with

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
this is an interesting move to run with

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.990 
this is an interesting move to run with
at<00:04:24.450> this<00:04:24.750> point<00:04:25.110> we<00:04:26.010> are<00:04:26.039> threatening<00:04:26.520> made<00:04:26.820> at

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
at this point we are threatening made at

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.020 
at this point we are threatening made at
this<00:04:27.120> point<00:04:27.240> we're<00:04:27.750> also<00:04:28.020> on<00:04:28.169> this<00:04:28.349> Bishop<00:04:28.800> and

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
this point we're also on this Bishop and

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.270 
this point we're also on this Bishop and
so<00:04:30.030> Bishop<00:04:30.960> takes<00:04:31.140> Knight<00:04:31.260> pawn<00:04:31.409> takes

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
so Bishop takes Knight pawn takes

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.010 
so Bishop takes Knight pawn takes
of<00:04:32.370> course<00:04:32.670> if<00:04:32.910> Queen<00:04:33.150> takes<00:04:33.330> pawn<00:04:33.510> and<00:04:33.900> this

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
of course if Queen takes pawn and this

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.620 
of course if Queen takes pawn and this
has<00:04:34.170> happened<00:04:34.350> countless<00:04:34.950> times<00:04:35.250> in<00:04:35.880> games

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
has happened countless times in games

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.140 
has happened countless times in games
that<00:04:36.810> I've<00:04:36.960> played<00:04:37.230> in<00:04:37.380> Bullitt<00:04:38.150> converging

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
that I've played in Bullitt converging

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.270 
that I've played in Bullitt converging
on<00:04:39.240> h2<00:04:39.690> for<00:04:39.960> whatever<00:04:40.230> the<00:04:40.470> reason<00:04:40.860> when<00:04:41.160> the

on h2 for whatever the reason when the

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.760 
on h2 for whatever the reason when the
queen<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:41.850> rook<00:04:42.450> are<00:04:42.630> not<00:04:42.840> let's<00:04:43.139> say<00:04:43.350> trained

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
queen and rook are not let's say trained

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.580 
queen and rook are not let's say trained
along<00:04:44.460> just<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:45.030> h-file<00:04:45.540> becomes<00:04:46.320> more

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
along just the h-file becomes more

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.310 
along just the h-file becomes more
difficult<00:04:46.880> to<00:04:47.880> see<00:04:48.240> that<00:04:48.510> there<00:04:48.810> is<00:04:48.840> actually

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
difficult to see that there is actually

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.710 
difficult to see that there is actually
a<00:04:49.350> main<00:04:49.620> threat<00:04:49.889> happening<00:04:50.370> on<00:04:50.520> h2<00:04:51.300> if<00:04:51.450> Queen

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
a main threat happening on h2 if Queen

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.250 
a main threat happening on h2 if Queen
takes<00:04:51.960> that's<00:04:52.740> just<00:04:53.070> game<00:04:53.220> over<00:04:53.360> but<00:04:54.360> worst

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
takes that's just game over but worst

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.230 
takes that's just game over but worst
case<00:04:55.380> scenario<00:04:56.100> should<00:04:56.430> this<00:04:56.550> position<00:04:57.030> come

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
case scenario should this position come

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.650 
case scenario should this position come
about<00:04:57.540> is<00:04:58.310> well<00:04:59.310> white<00:04:59.820> is<00:04:59.850> having<00:05:00.270> to<00:05:00.360> defend

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
about is well white is having to defend

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.159 
about is well white is having to defend
mate<00:05:01.020> like<00:05:01.830> this<00:05:02.360> for<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.419> most<00:05:03.630> part<00:05:03.930> and

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
mate like this for the most part and

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.270 
mate like this for the most part and
well<00:05:05.010> this<00:05:05.430> pawn<00:05:05.730> is<00:05:05.760> going<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.180> fall<00:05:07.070> it's<00:05:08.070> an

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
well this pawn is going to fall it's an

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.430 
well this pawn is going to fall it's an
interesting<00:05:08.600> final<00:05:09.600> position<00:05:10.020> because

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
interesting final position because

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.630 
interesting final position because
there's<00:05:12.500> cool<00:05:13.500> compensation<00:05:14.220> here<00:05:14.430> what

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
there's cool compensation here what

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.190 
there's cool compensation here what
would<00:05:14.820> we<00:05:14.970> have<00:05:15.120> we<00:05:15.300> have<00:05:15.390> a<00:05:15.419> half-open<00:05:15.840> file

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
would we have we have a half-open file

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.470 
would we have we have a half-open file
for<00:05:16.440> the<00:05:16.530> rook<00:05:16.710> we<00:05:17.340> have<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:17.610> bishop<00:05:17.940> pair<00:05:18.180> and

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
for the rook we have the bishop pair and

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.860 
for the rook we have the bishop pair and
with<00:05:18.900> this<00:05:19.080> last<00:05:19.410> move<00:05:20.060> last<00:05:21.060> pawn<00:05:21.419> move<00:05:21.660> for

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
with this last move last pawn move for

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.930 
with this last move last pawn move for
white<00:05:22.020> that<00:05:22.380> g3<00:05:22.830> move<00:05:23.010> note<00:05:23.280> that<00:05:23.460> these<00:05:23.610> light

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
white that g3 move note that these light

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.700 
white that g3 move note that these light
squares<00:05:24.300> are<00:05:24.540> incredibly<00:05:24.990> weakened<00:05:25.530> and

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
squares are incredibly weakened and

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.880 
squares are incredibly weakened and
there's<00:05:26.700> certainly<00:05:27.590> compensation<00:05:28.590> in<00:05:28.770> this

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
there's certainly compensation in this

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.500 
there's certainly compensation in this
final<00:05:29.280> position<00:05:29.460> right<00:05:29.940> here<00:05:29.970> out<00:05:30.300> of<00:05:30.330> the

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
final position right here out of the

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.750 
final position right here out of the
Sicilian<00:05:30.900> so<00:05:31.169> this<00:05:31.320> is<00:05:31.470> again<00:05:31.800> just<00:05:32.550> a

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
Sicilian so this is again just a

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.020 
Sicilian so this is again just a
worst-case<00:05:33.210> scenario<00:05:34.520> black<00:05:35.520> being<00:05:35.790> down

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
worst-case scenario black being down

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.390 
worst-case scenario black being down
upon<00:05:36.360> but<00:05:36.600> certainly<00:05:37.080> there<00:05:37.740> is<00:05:37.770> compensation

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
upon but certainly there is compensation

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.750 
upon but certainly there is compensation
should<00:05:39.110> white<00:05:40.110> not<00:05:40.380> fall<00:05:40.710> for<00:05:41.010> that<00:05:41.040> mate<00:05:41.490> on

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
should white not fall for that mate on

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:50.740 
should white not fall for that mate on
the<00:05:42.450> h2<00:05:42.960> square

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750
