00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.570 
ensemble drumming we had the chance to
run<00:02:36.660> through<00:02:36.840> all<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.170> songs<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.650> make

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
run through all the songs and make

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.630 
run through all the songs and make
adjustments<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.630> scores<00:02:40.310> before<00:02:41.310> heading

it<00:02:49.990> sounds<00:02:50.200> really<00:02:50.260> good<00:02:50.530> but<00:02:50.590> for<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.950> first

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.220 
it sounds really good but for the first
eight<00:02:51.370> bars<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:52.090> still<00:02:52.660> think<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.900> needs<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.110> be

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
eight bars I still think it needs to be

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.140 
eight bars I still think it needs to be
two<00:02:53.470> individuals<00:02:54.160> rather<00:02:54.490> than<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.910> group
