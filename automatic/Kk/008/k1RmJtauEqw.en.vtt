00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 how about friends in the previous video 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.170
 we had seen how to create an android 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.840
 backup and how to pass it to the pc to be able 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.059
 have it in a more secure way in this 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.639
 video what we are going to do is restore 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.630
 that backup we had done for that 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.630
 let's turn off our device 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.430
 let's go on facebook we're going to 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.430
 recovery 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.800
 once we enter the double teide erp 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.230
 we are going to subtract as you can see 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.570
 we have the backup that we made in our 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.100
 internal memory in case what 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.110
 we have done in the external memory and 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.610
 to be able to visualize what we are going to 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.730
 do is go back on the screen 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.720
 main we connect our otg or 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.720
 our cable or tg 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.520
 once it has been recognized we go 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:58.860
 a mount we give in usb protects 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:03.070
 that asset we go back we go to backup 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.920
 we change this from internal storage and 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.430
 we put usb or tg 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.610
 we give it back ok we go to 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.250
 restore and we can see the backup that 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.140
 we have done in our external memory 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.930
 from now on the steps are 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.730
 similar for both situations I'm going to 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.600
 return to internal memory 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.960
 select storage and change it 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.990
 internet storage then in jockey 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.330
 step back and before going to execute the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.300
 action to restore itself let's do 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.390
 the 4 gbytes that we always do to 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:46.040
 install some custom room we go to white 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.840
 advanced white tal big data cache system 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.030
 once we have those four 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.030
 Selected we give you in suite to white 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.900
 let's go back we go back once more and 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.840
 now if we are going to subtract 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.730
 we select there tells us what it is that 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.820
 we want to restore from the copy that we have 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.430
 done we leave everything selected and 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.060
 we add this to enable the 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:15.190
 md5 verification we give you a click and once 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.030
 that is already marked we give in sweet 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.450
 tour store 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.700
 this process takes the same time as 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.010
 the creation of the backup or even a little 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.750
 more depending as always on everything 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.790
 that we have installed in our team 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.290
 I'll wait for it to be a little longer 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.630
 advanced so they can see that 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.910
 it works correctly ready friends we 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.069
 has finished making the restoration 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.140
 of the backup we will give in reboot 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.670
 system 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.600
 again we are going to give him that 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.400
 we want to install your weight 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.130
 and the start-up and the 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.190
 phone as you can see this part of 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.200
 the restoration is quite simple if 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.020
 is that they do not perform an installation 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.670
 clean the folder tw erp will continue 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.970
 current so it will not be necessary 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.340
 that we completely copy it the only thing 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.430
 what we should do is just catch our 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.070
 folder that has the date and time and 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.230
 copy it to that space in this way the 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:16.020
 we will be able to visualize once 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.020
 let's go to tw rp from restore 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.810
 already the income we will unlock 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.350
 as you can see is everything I had 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.350
 previously 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.940
 for example I will enter 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.910
 page administrator 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.190
 it has not been necessary to enter again 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.020
 my account since everything has been restored 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.730
 from where we had left it 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.770
 friends that would be all for this video 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.930

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.760
