00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
sewing over here let's just do it this

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.979 
sewing over here let's just do it this
way<00:02:46.060> on<00:02:47.060> top<00:02:48.850> now<00:02:49.850> I<00:02:49.880> already<00:02:50.329> did<00:02:50.569> wind<00:02:50.840> a

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
way on top now I already did wind a

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.650 
way on top now I already did wind a
bobbin<00:02:51.170> earlier<00:02:51.799> but<00:02:52.069> to<00:02:52.730> do<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.299> put<00:02:53.540> it

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
bobbin earlier but to do that you put it

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.750 
bobbin earlier but to do that you put it
on<00:02:53.780> here<00:02:56.049> turn<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.290> center<00:02:58.130> wheel<00:02:58.280> back<00:02:58.519> on

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
on here turn the center wheel back on

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.610 
on here turn the center wheel back on
like<00:02:59.000> on<00:02:59.209> all<00:02:59.329> singer<00:02:59.630> machines<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.319> wheel

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
like on all singer machines and wheel

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.340 
like on all singer machines and wheel
turns<00:03:00.889> towards<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:02.540> you'd<00:03:02.810> be<00:03:02.959> winding

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
turns towards you so you'd be winding

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.120 
turns towards you so you'd be winding
the<00:03:03.470> bobbin

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
the bobbin

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.580 
the bobbin
there<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.180> they<00:03:06.270> would<00:03:06.390> click<00:03:07.050> off<00:03:07.260> when<00:03:07.500> it

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
there and they would click off when it

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.680 
there and they would click off when it
was<00:03:07.710> done<00:03:09.260> tighten<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.380> back<00:03:10.590> down<00:03:11.240> now<00:03:12.240> it's

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
was done tighten that back down now it's

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.460 
was done tighten that back down now it's
real<00:03:12.870> easy<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.320> put<00:03:13.530> bobbins<00:03:13.950> in<00:03:14.160> in<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.910> 201

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
real easy to put bobbins in in a 201

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.750 
real easy to put bobbins in in a 201
because<00:03:16.470> there's<00:03:16.770> no<00:03:16.890> bobbin<00:03:17.220> case<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.610> mess

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
because there's no bobbin case to mess

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.260 
because there's no bobbin case to mess
with<00:03:17.940> it's<00:03:18.210> just<00:03:18.450> drop<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.880> hold<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:20.970> bottom
