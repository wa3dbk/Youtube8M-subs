00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
between a garlic and a scallion right so

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.709 
between a garlic and a scallion right so
it's<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.590> garlicky<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.609> as<00:01:24.179> Ken<00:01:24.479> Mudge

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:24.719 
it's a really garlicky but as Ken Mudge

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.520 
it's a really garlicky but as Ken Mudge
was<00:01:24.749> saying<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.709> really<00:01:26.009> peppery<00:01:26.280> too<00:01:27.530> so

was saying it's really peppery too so
it's<00:01:28.679> a<00:01:28.740> mix<00:01:29.429> between<00:01:29.810> your<00:01:30.810> garden<00:01:31.350> onion<00:01:32.009> or

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
it really has a strong aftertaste that

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.289 
it really has a strong aftertaste that
comes<00:01:43.600> in<00:01:43.899> kicks<00:01:44.710> in<00:01:44.920> like<00:01:45.159> a<00:01:45.429> minute<00:01:45.969> or<00:01:46.119> so
