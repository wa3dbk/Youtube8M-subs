caught just don't eat carbs all by

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.970 
caught just don't eat carbs all by
yourself<00:04:01.820> if<00:04:02.299> you<00:04:02.480> do<00:04:02.690> eat<00:04:02.930> carbs<00:04:03.380> by<00:04:03.620> itself

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
yourself if you do eat carbs by itself

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.870 
yourself if you do eat carbs by itself
make<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.519> snack<00:04:04.820> and<00:04:05.090> keep<00:04:05.630> it<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:05.930> about<00:04:06.880> 15

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
make it a snack and keep it to about 15

grams<00:04:08.239> of<00:04:08.780> carbs

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
grams of carbs

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.440 
grams of carbs
yeah<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:09.980> you<00:04:10.070> probably<00:04:10.400> notice<00:04:10.790> what's<00:04:11.329> the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
yeah and you probably notice what's the

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.150 
yeah and you probably notice what's the
difference<00:04:11.810> between<00:04:11.989> a<00:04:12.019> white<00:04:12.260> potato<00:04:12.500> and

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
difference between a white potato and

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.050 
difference between a white potato and
sweet<00:04:13.400> taters

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
sweet taters

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.390 
sweet taters
they're<00:04:14.420> not<00:04:14.570> even<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:15.200> same<00:04:15.440> genetic<00:04:16.250> makeup

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
they're not even the same genetic makeup

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.940 
they're not even the same genetic makeup
sweet<00:04:17.000> potato<00:04:17.299> is<00:04:17.570> not<00:04:18.049> even<00:04:18.260> a<00:04:18.320> potato<00:04:18.650> is<00:04:18.919> a

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
sweet potato is not even a potato is a

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.969 
sweet potato is not even a potato is a
root<00:04:19.220> so<00:04:20.150> so<00:04:20.750> sweet<00:04:20.959> taters<00:04:21.380> slow<00:04:21.620> digestion

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
root so so sweet taters slow digestion

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.890 
root so so sweet taters slow digestion
of<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.340> white<00:04:22.550> potatoes<00:04:23.030> faster<00:04:23.479> just<00:04:23.690> makes

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
of the white potatoes faster just makes

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.450 
of the white potatoes faster just makes
you<00:04:23.990> fat<00:04:24.289> so<00:04:24.530> eat<00:04:24.710> go<00:04:25.190> into<00:04:25.430> sweet<00:04:25.669> potatoes

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
you fat so eat go into sweet potatoes

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.240 
you fat so eat go into sweet potatoes
yeah<00:04:26.970> but<00:04:27.300> uh<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.900> major<00:04:28.139> thing<00:04:28.500> cut<00:04:28.889> back<00:04:29.100> on

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
yeah but uh the major thing cut back on

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.249 
yeah but uh the major thing cut back on
your<00:04:29.280> calories<00:04:29.759> a<00:04:29.789> little<00:04:30.060> bit<00:04:30.240> you<00:04:31.139> know

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
your calories a little bit you know

your calories a little bit you know
first<00:04:31.590> find<00:04:31.800> out<00:04:31.889> how<00:04:32.100> many<00:04:32.160> calories<00:04:32.490> your

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
first find out how many calories your

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.120 
first find out how many calories your
body<00:04:33.030> needs<00:04:33.479> to<00:04:33.660> maintain<00:04:33.900> your<00:04:34.470> weight<00:04:34.530> yeah

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
body needs to maintain your weight yeah

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.120 
body needs to maintain your weight yeah
once<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.699> figure<00:04:36.030> that<00:04:36.060> out<00:04:36.770> cut<00:04:37.770> back<00:04:37.979> on

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
once you figure that out cut back on

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.620 
once you figure that out cut back on
your<00:04:38.280> calories<00:04:38.639> I'll<00:04:38.789> provide<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.180> link<00:04:39.419> in<00:04:39.570> the

idea of how many calories you can eat

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.529 
idea of how many calories you can eat
it's<00:04:46.530> not<00:04:46.710> an<00:04:46.860> exact<00:04:47.280> science<00:04:47.419> but<00:04:48.419> it's<00:04:48.509> a

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
it's not an exact science but it's a

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:49.610 
it's not an exact science but it's a
good<00:04:48.720> place<00:04:48.930> to<00:04:48.960> start

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
good place to start

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.700 
good place to start
yeah<00:04:49.860> um<00:04:50.310> but<00:04:51.300> make<00:04:51.570> sure<00:04:51.810> you<00:04:52.139> always<00:04:52.410> eat

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
yeah um but make sure you always eat

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.430 
yeah um but make sure you always eat
your<00:04:52.949> protein<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:53.639> carbs<00:04:53.940> together<00:04:54.300> keep<00:04:54.960> per

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
your protein and carbs together keep per

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.969 
your protein and carbs together keep per
meal

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
meal

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.740 
meal
keep<00:04:56.550> your<00:04:56.759> carbs<00:04:57.300> to<00:04:57.930> about<00:04:58.759> 30<00:04:59.759> carbs<00:05:00.300> max

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
keep your carbs to about 30 carbs max

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.540 
keep your carbs to about 30 carbs max
but<00:05:01.199> always<00:05:01.440> make<00:05:01.800> sure<00:05:01.830> you<00:05:02.070> have<00:05:02.250> a<00:05:02.280> good

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
but always make sure you have a good

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.010 
but always make sure you have a good
lean<00:05:02.789> protein<00:05:03.270> with<00:05:03.419> it<00:05:03.570> because<00:05:03.690> when<00:05:03.930> you

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
lean protein with it because when you

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.439 
lean protein with it because when you
eat<00:05:04.169> protein<00:05:04.380> and<00:05:04.770> carbs<00:05:05.009> together<00:05:05.310> it<00:05:06.060> slows

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
eat protein and carbs together it slows

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.080 
eat protein and carbs together it slows
down<00:05:06.479> the<00:05:06.750> digestion<00:05:07.289> of<00:05:07.560> those<00:05:07.830> carbs<00:05:08.310> okay

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
down the digestion of those carbs okay

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.480 
down the digestion of those carbs okay
no<00:05:09.240> reason<00:05:09.539> why<00:05:09.630> you<00:05:09.690> need<00:05:10.110> to<00:05:10.320> make<00:05:11.039> sure<00:05:11.280> your

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
no reason why you need to make sure your

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.540 
no reason why you need to make sure your
food<00:05:11.789> that<00:05:11.970> dish<00:05:12.800> digests<00:05:13.800> more<00:05:13.979> slowly<00:05:14.280> and

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
food that dish digests more slowly and

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.310 
food that dish digests more slowly and
eat<00:05:14.669> you<00:05:14.910> know<00:05:15.060> slower<00:05:15.449> digesting<00:05:15.630> carbs<00:05:16.229> that

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
eat you know slower digesting carbs that

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.260 
eat you know slower digesting carbs that
keeps<00:05:16.530> your<00:05:16.650> insulin<00:05:17.160> from<00:05:17.340> being<00:05:17.610> spiked<00:05:17.970> and

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
keeps your insulin from being spiked and

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.600 
keeps your insulin from being spiked and
when<00:05:18.990> your<00:05:19.110> insulin<00:05:19.440> spike<00:05:19.860> your<00:05:20.130> body's<00:05:20.460> in

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
when your insulin spike your body's in

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.700 
when your insulin spike your body's in
fat<00:05:20.849> storing<00:05:21.300> mode<00:05:21.509> and<00:05:21.870> start<00:05:22.139> a<00:05:22.169> fat-burning

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
fat storing mode and start a fat-burning

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.320 
fat storing mode and start a fat-burning
young<00:05:22.979> so<00:05:23.610> that's<00:05:23.789> why<00:05:23.970> it's<00:05:24.120> so<00:05:24.300> critical

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
young so that's why it's so critical

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.240 
young so that's why it's so critical
yeah<00:05:24.990> when<00:05:25.169> you<00:05:25.259> eat<00:05:25.410> those<00:05:25.560> foods<00:05:25.889> that<00:05:26.070> green
