00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
because of some of the ingredients so I

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:30.900 
because of some of the ingredients so I
decided<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.750> make<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.140> video

the gel was going to go on with water
and<00:00:38.690> applied<00:00:39.500> a<00:00:39.710> really<00:00:40.129> generous<00:00:40.519> amount<00:00:40.850> of

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
even after I put the gel on there's

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.730 
even after I put the gel on there's
still<00:01:04.729> fuzzies<00:01:05.300> and<00:01:05.570> that's<00:01:06.140> what<00:01:06.350> she<00:01:06.500> wanted

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
of those little fuzzy edges so I tied it

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.890 
of those little fuzzy edges so I tied it
up<00:01:13.850> overnight

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
up overnight

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.460 
up overnight
the<00:01:16.590> result<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.160> I<00:01:17.840> was<00:01:18.840> actually<00:01:18.930> gonna<00:01:19.170> rush

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470

the result was I was actually gonna rush
that<00:01:19.680> morning<00:01:20.160> so<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:20.880> went<00:01:21.060> ahead<00:01:21.150> and

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
that morning so I just went ahead and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.750 
that morning so I just went ahead and
put<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.960> bun<00:01:22.200> anyways<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.580> can

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
put it in a bun anyways but as you can

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.450 
put it in a bun anyways but as you can
see<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.180> looks<00:01:24.300> exactly<00:01:24.690> like<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.230> did<00:01:25.410> when<00:01:25.470> I

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.380 
couple hours later it lay down really
nicely<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.340> would<00:02:02.670> definitely<00:02:02.820> be

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
nicely so I would definitely be

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.840 
nicely so I would definitely be
repurchasing<00:02:03.720> this<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.950> it'll<00:02:05.400> stretch<00:02:05.760> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
repurchasing this and it'll stretch a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.280 
repurchasing this and it'll stretch a
little<00:02:06.060> longer<00:02:06.270> instead<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.780> putting<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.110> all

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
little longer instead of putting it all

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.410 
little longer instead of putting it all
over<00:02:07.320> your<00:02:07.979> hair<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.580> use<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.880> as<00:02:09.060> just

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
over your hair you can use it as just

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.900 
over your hair you can use it as just
something<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.260> lay<00:02:10.410> your<00:02:10.530> edges<00:02:10.860> down<00:02:11.040> and<00:02:11.670> not

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
something to lay your edges down and not

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.780 
something to lay your edges down and not
giving<00:02:12.240> migraines
