two<00:01:23.689> to<00:01:23.899> three<00:01:23.929> weeks<00:01:24.649> before<00:01:25.460> I<00:01:25.490> done<00:01:26.270> you

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:26.749 
two to three weeks before I done you

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:32.800 
two to three weeks before I done you
doing<00:01:26.990> less<00:01:27.170> city<00:01:27.850> so<00:01:28.850> yeah<00:01:29.780> I<00:01:31.359> guess<00:01:32.359> that's

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
doing less city so yeah I guess that's

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.359 
doing less city so yeah I guess that's
it<00:01:33.109> uh<00:01:34.960> yeah<00:01:36.700> also<00:01:38.170> I'm<00:01:39.170> redoing<00:01:39.530> my<00:01:39.710> firehouse

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369

again<00:01:40.939> I've<00:01:41.840> redone<00:01:42.469> three<00:01:43.159> updates<00:01:43.579> so<00:01:44.060> I

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
again I've redone three updates so I

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.879 
again I've redone three updates so I
gotta<00:01:46.069> put<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:46.310> video<00:01:46.490> out<00:01:46.639> for<00:01:46.939> that<00:01:47.889> but

gotta put a video out for that but

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:52.840 
gotta put a video out for that but
overall<00:01:49.429> I<00:01:49.490> think<00:01:49.819> that's<00:01:50.179> it<00:01:51.399> okay<00:01:52.399> try<00:01:52.729> to
