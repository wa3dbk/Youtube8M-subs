guys<00:04:34.330> because<00:04:34.630> I<00:04:34.840> wanted<00:04:34.870> something<00:04:35.410> really

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
guys because I wanted something really

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.950

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
really muted and well I guess it does

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.870 
really muted and well I guess it does
look<00:04:38.170> pretty<00:04:38.410> muted<00:04:38.680> there<00:04:38.980> but<00:04:39.160> still<00:04:39.490> like<00:04:39.730> I

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
look pretty muted there but still like I

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.760 
look pretty muted there but still like I
wanted<00:04:40.240> something<00:04:40.450> really<00:04:40.780> muted<00:04:41.140> and<00:04:41.290> I<00:04:41.590> wish

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
wanted something really muted and I wish

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.130 
wanted something really muted and I wish
it<00:04:41.920> was<00:04:42.040> almost<00:04:42.190> a<00:04:42.430> little<00:04:42.550> more<00:04:42.850> gray<00:04:43.150> so<00:04:43.900> now

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
it was almost a little more gray so now

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.140 
it was almost a little more gray so now
I'm<00:04:44.500> kind<00:04:44.710> of<00:04:44.830> thinking<00:04:45.010> if<00:04:45.490> I<00:04:45.610> want<00:04:45.880> something

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
I'm kind of thinking if I want something

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.210 
I'm kind of thinking if I want something
more<00:04:46.570> gray<00:04:47.080> maybe<00:04:47.440> I<00:04:47.530> should<00:04:47.770> just<00:04:47.800> go<00:04:48.070> with

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
more gray maybe I should just go with

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.300 
more gray maybe I should just go with
like<00:04:48.310> a<00:04:48.370> blue-gray<00:04:49.180> color<00:04:49.210> like<00:04:49.900> a<00:04:50.140> slate<00:04:50.980> gray

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
like a blue-gray color like a slate gray

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.350 
like a blue-gray color like a slate gray
to<00:04:51.850> type<00:04:52.300> color<00:04:52.600> for<00:04:52.930> this<00:04:53.020> room<00:04:53.730> so<00:04:54.730> I<00:04:54.760> guess<00:04:55.120> I

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
to type color for this room so I guess I

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.820 
to type color for this room so I guess I
wasn't<00:04:55.540> a<00:04:55.690> set<00:04:55.900> on<00:04:55.930> that<00:04:56.020> color<00:04:56.350> as<00:04:56.500> I<00:04:56.620> thought

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
wasn't a set on that color as I thought

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.800 
wasn't a set on that color as I thought
so<00:04:57.760> I'm<00:04:57.820> going<00:04:57.850> to<00:04:57.970> go<00:04:58.090> ahead<00:04:58.210> and<00:04:58.360> just<00:04:58.570> kind

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
so I'm going to go ahead and just kind

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.659 
so I'm going to go ahead and just kind
of<00:04:58.900> like<00:04:59.080> sit<00:04:59.590> on<00:04:59.740> it<00:04:59.890> and<00:05:00.040> look<00:05:00.310> at<00:05:00.460> it<00:05:00.520> a

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
of like sit on it and look at it a

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.210 
of like sit on it and look at it a
little<00:05:00.880> bit<00:05:01.120> over<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:02.320> next<00:05:02.620> couple<00:05:02.830> of<00:05:03.010> days

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
little bit over the next couple of days

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.130 
little bit over the next couple of days
and<00:05:03.700> before<00:05:03.910> I<00:05:04.090> really<00:05:04.390> make<00:05:04.540> a<00:05:04.570> decision<00:05:05.050> on

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
and before I really make a decision on

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.300
