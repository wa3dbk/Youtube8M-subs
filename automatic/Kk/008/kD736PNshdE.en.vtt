00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.710
 Hey, guys, youtube channel fox brothers. 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.720
 in the area and I'm maico 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.789
 Good guys, can you prepare more here? 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.609
 a video of the series profiting from marketing 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.890
 and today we will address the mpc fiona 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.590
 I will choose a list of six items from 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.610
 start to pick it up and see what it's like 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.940
 profiting from marketing with a profile 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.670
 good 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.030
 The first item here is the ball that groups 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.750
 of bunnies that is sold for 35 gps 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.280
 Anyway, it's very easy to be there. 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.649
 marketed by the simple fact that 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.809
 there are many bunny there is too much 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.960
 which inlay a colant then is more or 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.039
 The less you imagine I do not 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.270
 I bought 7700 single player balls is 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.570
 seeing at bule offers for 20 gps each 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.299
 well the second item here looks is pretty 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:18.270
 ugly or beautiful and is asked by 210 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.009
 gps in profile is not grouped with good bis 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.650
 or is not so normal you 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.299
 however you do not have 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.460
 no competition then becomes a 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.439
 very good item for you to market the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.460
 by the same scheme as the first 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.079
 is the carioca and the funk measure by 35 gps that 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.630
 It is from the father of Caius both do not need 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.930
 say nothing good 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.829
 another item here is the one of munique skeleton 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.159
 randy what happens here dropar of the 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.960
 demon skeletons and is sold for 80 gps 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.670
 no inpc 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.490
 that makes them pretty cool and 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.380
 Domain negotiate because it has a lot of 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.200
 cool people where that ends up hunting the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.189
 mosquito so it's very easy to be 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.580
 purchased in the fifth is that of a horn that is 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.030
 sold by a car 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.649
 the lpc fiona and is changed of demos and this 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.460
 It's a little more angry that you can 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.890
 meet 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.660
 however no one has little competition and 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.070
 you can put a lot with it 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.110
 well the last one is the dragons tail that is 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.350
 sold for 100 gps and went into 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.120
 water and dragos headline what happens 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.080
 this here too as there are a lot of people 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.750
 passing well 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.360
 It's very easy to become very competitive 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.360
 but the 11 very good item to be 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.000
 I bought so I did here a spreadsheet 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.780
 as an example let's say that day let's 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.850
 Take the example of that day bought 7723 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.709
 I liked to buy 154 home so I 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.120
 I finally understood, but I go. 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.930
 resell the 7,700 for 35 gps there ever 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.180
 this movie 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:01.209
 so I 'll get 269 and get one 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.850
 115 and a half houses only 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.430
 buying office and red remembering 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.000
 You can also put the second 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.170
 example what it was is caio marin funk 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.230
 I quoted it here 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.019
 say you bought 300 to 19 gps that 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.739
 also generate purchases of 10 to 19 and 20 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.980
 weight 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.709
 then you will spend 5 thousand and 700 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.519
 so you reselling the 300 meets 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.950
 five gps 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.459
 you will have a gross profit of 10,000 and 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.380
 500 gps totals net profit of 4 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.320
 one thousand eight hundred and gps 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.690
 good let's take the example of good I have 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.860
 the mainstay ball it is not so easy 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.470
 to be sold but let's say you 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.630
 buy at 100 gps as it has little 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.269
 As it has little competition you can 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.820
 put a price a little lower then 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.970
 let's say the body is hake 1 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.410
 then you will spend 10 thousand gps are 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.860
 reselling these into parts that you 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.069
 bought the 210 of ps will give a profit of 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.730
 21k gross 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.439
 totaling a net profit of 11 fighters 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.170
 now the last example that I have prepared 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:10.139
 Here is the bites do not you buy and 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.420
 20 monsoons to four gps as you have 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.340
 little competition is not as 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.169
 hard to find the brother you go 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.639
 spend 8 cas then resell these 20 per 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.310
 one each 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.580
 in the unipÃª fiona you will totalize a 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.229
 profit of 20 houses that totaling group 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.220
 a net profit of 12 fighters 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.560
 bombers more or less to realize 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.139
 How does the learner's part work? 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.620
 with more 53 and fiona in the future I will 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.229
 bring more items there and you will like them 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.710
 very many items that are not usually 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:49.020
 pick up and negotiate who is making a profit 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.300
 huge on the good market as we go 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.180
 showing here the path from where it arrives 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.550
 This Portuguese film is not only 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.030
 I will also say but some things here 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.870
 O 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.690
 I always took care of the cioff part. 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.810
 a lot of people selling me at least 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.070
 the value that is sold on the pc or 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.139
 35 gps 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.759
 you can buy very well for less 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.530
 This is what is interesting guys always 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:17.009
 with them or if they do not put themselves in the goal 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.509
 although the first AFI nec this site here and 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.400
 I would like to say the following guys 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.289
 I also stopped here 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.449
