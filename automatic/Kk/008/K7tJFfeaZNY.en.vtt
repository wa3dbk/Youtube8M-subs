00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.700 

what<00:04:32.820> size<00:04:33.060> engine<00:04:33.300> was<00:04:33.630> that<00:04:33.840> it's<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.260> 283

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
what size engine was that it's a 283

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.370 
what size engine was that it's a 283
it's<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.250> v8<00:04:35.430> so<00:04:35.880> smallest<00:04:36.270> v8<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.600> Chevy<00:04:37.140> made

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
it's a v8 so smallest v8 the Chevy made

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.100 
it's a v8 so smallest v8 the Chevy made
so<00:04:37.980> I<00:04:38.010> still<00:04:38.400> got<00:04:38.550> power<00:04:38.760> for<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.210> VA<00:04:39.390> but<00:04:39.780> a

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
so I still got power for the VA but a

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.080 
so I still got power for the VA but a
little<00:04:40.830> bit<00:04:40.920> better<00:04:41.070> on<00:04:41.190> gas<00:04:41.340> than<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:41.910> bigger

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
little bit better on gas than the bigger

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:51.590 
little bit better on gas than the bigger
v8<00:04:46.520> does<00:04:47.520> it<00:04:47.640> have<00:04:47.760> AC<00:04:47.970> no<00:04:48.840> no<00:04:49.200> no<00:04:50.160> I<00:04:50.730> think<00:04:51.360> you

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
v8 does it have AC no no no I think you

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.150 
v8 does it have AC no no no I think you
could<00:04:51.720> add<00:04:51.930> a<00:04:51.960> CI<00:04:52.440> think<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.830> might<00:04:52.980> have<00:04:53.010> been

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
could add a CI think I might have been

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.190 
could add a CI think I might have been
an<00:04:53.280> option<00:04:53.430> so<00:04:54.330> I<00:04:54.360> think<00:04:54.480> it<00:04:54.660> might<00:04:54.780> have<00:04:54.930> the

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
an option so I think it might have the

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.580 
an option so I think it might have the
accessories<00:04:56.040> on<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.400> dash<00:04:56.700> to<00:04:57.030> add<00:04:57.180> it<00:04:57.420> but<00:04:58.410> um

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
accessories on the dash to add it but um

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.460 
accessories on the dash to add it but um
