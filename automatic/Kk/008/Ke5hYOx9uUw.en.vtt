00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770

audiobahn<00:00:22.289> sa<00:00:22.590> right<00:00:22.800> fort<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.580> also<00:00:23.910> Iggy

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
audiobahn sa right fort and I also Iggy

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.210 
audiobahn sa right fort and I also Iggy
I<00:00:24.869> think<00:00:25.140> as<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> left<00:00:25.529> forward<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:25.980> thought

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
I think as a left forward so I thought

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.769 
I think as a left forward so I thought
it<00:00:26.820> would<00:00:26.880> maybe<00:00:27.060> serve<00:00:27.420> him<00:00:27.539> off<00:00:27.630> or

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
it would maybe serve him off or

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.210 
it would maybe serve him off or
something<00:00:28.080> maybe<00:00:28.199> for<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> better<00:00:28.920> player

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
something maybe for a better player

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.800 
something maybe for a better player
because<00:00:29.670> he<00:00:29.880> was<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.029> only<00:00:30.269> player<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.570> was

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
because he was the only player that was

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.600 
because he was the only player that was
on<00:00:30.929> little<00:00:31.140> chemistry<00:00:31.410> but<00:00:31.769> my<00:00:32.160> opponent

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
on little chemistry but my opponent

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.430 
on little chemistry but my opponent
decide<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.149> do<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.110> went<00:00:34.230> into

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
decide not to do that so we went into

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.170 
decide not to do that so we went into
this<00:00:34.620> game<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.070> after<00:00:35.160> 30<00:00:35.579> minutes<00:00:35.880> he

you robbing from a free-kick roll saved
it<00:01:41.759> not<00:01:41.939> really<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> best<00:01:42.299> safe<00:01:42.720> because<00:01:43.140> from

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
it not really the best safe because from

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.929 
it not really the best safe because from
the<00:01:43.590> Rio<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.920> he<00:01:44.009> got<00:01:44.340> himself<00:01:44.490> another

the Rio and he got himself another

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.880 
the Rio and he got himself another
chance<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.450> luckily<00:01:45.659> enough<00:01:45.960> girl<00:01:46.500> saved<00:01:46.770> it

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.740 
chance but luckily enough girl saved it
once<00:01:47.130> again<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:48.090> ended<00:01:48.329> up<00:01:48.390> winning<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
once again so we ended up winning the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.539 
once again so we ended up winning the
game<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.409> know<00:01:49.530> which<00:01:49.710> was<00:01:49.860> not<00:01:50.040> too<00:01:50.159> bad<00:01:50.369> I

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
game to to know which was not too bad I

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.190 
game to to know which was not too bad I
think<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.119> were<00:01:51.240> sort<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.630> dominating<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
think we were sort of dominating the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.929 
think we were sort of dominating the
whole<00:01:52.320> game<00:01:52.530> especially<00:01:52.740> shots<00:01:53.340> wise<00:01:53.549> because

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
whole game especially shots wise because

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.520 
whole game especially shots wise because
i<00:01:53.970> think<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:54.420> six<00:01:54.780> shots<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.170> target<00:01:55.200> in

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
i think that like six shots on target in

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.530 
i think that like six shots on target in
the<00:01:55.649> very<00:01:55.829> end<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.189> my<00:01:56.549> opponent<00:01:56.909> only<00:01:57.180> at<00:01:57.270> two

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
the very end a my opponent only at two

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.780 
the very end a my opponent only at two
so<00:01:57.899> we<00:01:58.290> move<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.590> into<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.799> next<00:01:59.130> game<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.549> you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
so we move it into the next game and you

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.370 
so we move it into the next game and you
can<00:01:59.909> see<00:02:00.090> from<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.360> steam<00:02:00.570> rating<00:02:00.930> was<00:02:01.170> pretty

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
can see from a steam rating was pretty

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.800 
can see from a steam rating was pretty
low<00:02:01.560> only<00:02:02.159> 68<00:02:02.549> midfield<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.299> then<00:02:03.450> look<00:02:03.689> at

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.319 
that's what sorta was the case in this
game<00:02:24.040> because<00:02:24.189> after<00:02:24.609> three<00:02:24.790> minutes<00:02:24.939> or<00:02:25.180> so

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
game because after three minutes or so

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.000 
game because after three minutes or so
we<00:02:25.480> already<00:02:25.780> made<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.049> one<00:02:26.260> nil<00:02:26.439> there<00:02:26.650> what<00:02:26.799> ya

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
we already made it one nil there what ya

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.500 
we already made it one nil there what ya
to<00:02:27.280> where<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.459> picked<00:02:27.670> up<00:02:27.760> another<00:02:28.000> skill<00:02:28.329> go

to where I picked up another skill go

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.390 
to where I picked up another skill go
and<00:02:28.689> straight<00:02:29.319> from<00:02:29.530> kickoff<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:30.010> decide<00:02:30.280> to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
and straight from kickoff you decide to

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.800 
and straight from kickoff you decide to
boot<00:02:30.609> the<00:02:30.700> ball<00:02:30.819> forward<00:02:31.150> with<00:02:31.389> Neymar<00:02:31.780> and

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
actually rage quit as well so despite

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.610 
actually rage quit as well so despite
the<00:02:34.030> fact<00:02:34.299> we<00:02:34.510> get<00:02:34.930> against<00:02:35.260> messi<00:02:35.590> ronaldo

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
the fact we get against messi ronaldo
