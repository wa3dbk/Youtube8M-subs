00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello everyone today will not be quite 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.379
 normal video I'm not quite in the usual way 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.610
 in front of the camera but I really wanted to 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.559
 you share the fact that I have 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.849
 there was such an interesting set for 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.130
 creating hairstyles 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.410
 I bought it just out of curiosity 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.850
 try how it works and stayed 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.980
 im very happy so decided 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.279
 tell you what is included in this 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.670
 The set includes: 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.789
 little ones 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.029
 month call them plastic snails 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.410
 which are such 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.960
 plastic bags all these bags 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.100
 different lengths for example pink 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.320
 a bit shorter 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.940
 there are bags long here and there are 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.370
 medium-length bags of this one 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.410
 again blue is a little bit shorter than 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.199
 previous now straighten together 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.960
 something you are convinced and there is still 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.399
 green bags they are 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.320
 average in its length here you see 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.359
 one short 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.909
 the pink was different in length 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.280
 short and now show you gave 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.049
 green 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.650
 like this green is calculated on the average 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.380
 strand is not very long 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.460
 yellow on the longest heels in this 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.830
 the set also includes another one so u hook 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.340
 it's detachable you need to assemble from two 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.939
 parts boredom is long enough like this 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.939
 and in order to get the right strand I 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.549
 I'll show you first how to attach and then 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.439
 show you what I did for 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.409
 to get the right press for you 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.630
 you must first select the strand that 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.549
 you are going to wind up a little bit 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.770
 improved the mechanism since 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.520
 the hardest ones are stretching the locks here 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.680
 in this hole 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.979
 so to simplify a little bit 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.759
 the mechanism I take the usual pin like this 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:01.110
 I put it on through my hair and forked 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.500
 I spend the end of the bow so the whole strand 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.160
 uniformly turns inside and 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.009
 I fix it in this abalone which 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.500
 reminds not 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.930
 leg crochet hook for it's hiding 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.090
 fixed now we will need 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.640
 thread the other end of the stick into the bag on 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.659
 The end of this pouch is such plastic 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.090
 clamps that is basically they are enough 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:31.739
 tightly holding a strand after this strand 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.290
 we distribute all over 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.079
 plastic bag like this pulling out 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.109
 and she twists herself so I did 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.640
 such a cheat at night and now show 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.459
 you what I got by the way 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.650
 shoot it easy enough show you 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:55.090
 I will shoot the farthest you see 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:03:04.560
 I have wound my lock 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:04.560
 following so now following 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.700
 By the way, you are comfortable enough to shoot. 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.450
 see what happens is enough 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.110
 beautiful smooth curls left to take off 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.110
 this side 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.459
 pulling take down every side here 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.380
 and now you can actually stack it 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.780
 how are you used to me now a little bit of them 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.510
 form a styling gel and after 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.459
 this will deliver and I needed shape Well 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.370
 until you see that enough tight 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.620
 curls turned out I think it is very 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.440
 it is convenient to think of taking such a set 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.200
 by himself he doesnâ€™t weigh much 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.000
 takes a lot of space spinning enough 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.030
 easy to use but perhaps the most 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.160
 a long moment is when you push 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.670
 hair here in this device as well 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.209
 In principle, it seems to me comfortable with myself 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.760
 to carry 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.340
 small enough this hook any 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.160
 cosmetic bag he will enter plus in the morning you 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.709
 stand with ready locks on them not 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.540
 it will be necessary to spend a lot of time but here 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.430
 This is a video I hope you had 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.400
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:33.380
 I will show this set again like this 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.870
 Looks and I hope that you thought 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.310
 interesting waiting for your comments and up 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.310
 new videos for now
