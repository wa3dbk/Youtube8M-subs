Rangers would eliminate them that's when
I<00:00:13.769> said<00:00:13.920> heading<00:00:14.400> into<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.670> series<00:00:14.969> and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
I said heading into the series and

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.730 
I said heading into the series and
ultimately<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.139> what<00:00:16.379> happened<00:00:16.710> but

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.460

away<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.580> idea<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.150> Sidney<00:01:15.750> Crosby<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
away is the idea that Sidney Crosby and

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.690 
away is the idea that Sidney Crosby and
of<00:01:16.560> Jenny<00:01:16.740> Malkin<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.340> been<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> one

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
of Jenny Malkin have been the one

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.249 
of Jenny Malkin have been the one
screwing<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.509> up<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.930> Penguins

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
screwing this up for the Penguins

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.749 
screwing this up for the Penguins
because<00:01:19.560> that's<00:01:19.710> all<00:01:19.979> I've<00:01:20.280> been<00:01:20.430> hearing

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
because that's all I've been hearing

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.850 
because that's all I've been hearing
granted<00:01:21.210> Malkin<00:01:21.720> didn't<00:01:21.960> do<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.290> hot<00:01:22.320> didn't

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
granted Malkin didn't do so hot didn't

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.710 
granted Malkin didn't do so hot didn't
have<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> very<00:01:23.220> good<00:01:23.340> playoffs<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.030> think<00:01:24.299> he's
