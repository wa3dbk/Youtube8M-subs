00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.400
 hello to all manta friends in blogs 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.740
 we are here at outdoor 2014 to present 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.590
 a totally new collection in 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.650
 then mountain hiking area one 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.689
 collection that the sport offers in 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.090
 totally innovative way for the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.890
 first time in your own 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.080
 of its product range 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.330
 we have developed the concept together with 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.420
 gore tex using technology 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.910
 goretex or round and working with them in 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.000
 synergy to build all the all 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.879
 concept concerning the upper and therefore 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.030
 giving maximum breathability and maximum 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.950
 waterproof we have adopted on 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.289
 this line which consists of three 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.899
 models then detail the high cut 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.610
 medium cut the low cut is one 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.039
 derivative concert series either 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.710
 from the scope of the company's ring mounds 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.199
 therefore in particular the sole that is in 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.149
 vibram made with plugs a 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.150
 impact brake differentiated thickness 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.980
 system 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.420
 other elements derived from the heritage 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.370
 approach then technical approach 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.590
 is substantiated in the very lacquer 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.570
 advanced and very precise and therefore also 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.750
 in the possibility of adjusting the volumes e 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.820
 a part also from the heritage from 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.650
 knowledge from upstream know-how 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.000
 so all that is the part 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.540
 dynamic is linked to the stability of the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.370
 produced the type of construction in fact 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.400
 he hugs in the upper embraces the 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.780
 sole the midsole and with a system that 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.900
 we have defined stability control 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.200
 system and that is derived from ours 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.360
 bushido launched innovations 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.310
 already in 2013 therefore a very wide range 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.960
 complex that among other things has seen in the 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.310
 synthesis model which is what I hold 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.860
 in my hands 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.190
 one of the winners of the awards among 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.619
 by the authors of the industry awards e will be 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:06.100
 available on the market together with all 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.100
 the collection in March 2015
