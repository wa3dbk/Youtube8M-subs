00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.040
 there is a minute now we see one of the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.010
 important characteristics of the year 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.050
 antonio that are woven as I had 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.900
 seen in a video ie the levels 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.500
 organizational must remember that we 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.890
 we have atoms and molecules the cells 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.500
 and fabrics but we will find the organ 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.849
 and equipment systems if you have not seen the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.650
 videos on organizational levels you have to 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.900
 go see it because it helps you a lot 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.170
 understand how organized ours 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.730
 visit my site puts body 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.790
 linking description for all 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.100
 information for testing and so on 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.450
 then we see the fabrics as we have 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.910
 said the fabrics are mainly 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.280
 four peter halley woven fabrics 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.329
 connective liked to play and the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.890
 nervous tissue 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.309
 then how we saw the fabrics 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.629
 constitute an important component 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.930
 for the emotional one because the fabric 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.270
 represents the unit that essentially 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.090
 it constitutes an organ 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.760
 the organ is formed by a series precisely 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.250
 of cells that are organized in fabrics 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.350
 the characteristic of the fabric is 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.140
 that of having characteristics 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.820
 similar 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.280
 when just dirty questions 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.570
 organize in various types for example of 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.340
 under the material that fabric 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.650
 connective tissue for example 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.640
 muscle will then form an organ for 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.830
 example the intestine 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.500
 because an organ because it is formed by a 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.910
 epithelium that is inside one 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.740
 formed intermediate portion 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.060
 essentially some TV and proportion 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.619
 muscular 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.270
 the fact that there are these three types of 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:39.700
 fabric means that it is an organ 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.440
 precisely for this reason therefore fabrics 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.050
 they are mainly four jesus the 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.240
 bitter wings connect nerve muscle and 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.880
 features then have the south and 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.430
 peter to her is this here what is there 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.259
 under the connective tissue why 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.869
 you iniquitous times crisis the riale the 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.550
 epithelial tissue let us remember that ce 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.960
 there are different types but the 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.670
 most important feature of the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.520
 epithelial tissue that is a tissue of 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.259
 coating 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.329
 ready under the coating then yes 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.060
 often found in the portions they are 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.039
 always in contact with the outside and this 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.410
 epithelium is characterized by the sky and 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.379
 all attached to each other in desert e 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.569
 with a substance interposed between the 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.769
 very poor cells as you can see not 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.120
 there is space 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.459
 connective tissue instead yes 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.410
 characterizes to have cells that 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.910
 they are scattered are not found in gods 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.910
 cold cuts to others with plenty of it 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.769
 extracellular component that takes the 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.299
 name of matrices how to provide evidence of 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.480
 this is not the only cell almost 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.799
 all the collective precisely around 600 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.799
 cognitive is characterized precisely by 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.870
 this this feature instead yes 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.940
 submuscular from the things characterized 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.650
 the muscle tissue characterized by 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.540
 this of structures that you see here that yes 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.280
 they call figuro cells and tissues 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.860
 there are different types of muscles 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.540
 decorated is mainly divided 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.709
 incredible skeletal muscle is 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.840
 essentially also the one then precisely 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.090
 volunteers and the involuntary one that 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.239
 instead precisely it is out of control 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.859
 voluntary bargaining in the south 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.389
 moscati is precisely this one 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.670
 she as I told you are the fibers 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.530
 cells as you can see 4 minute this 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.290
 particular paneling component and that 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.209
 made up of important proteins 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.799
 it will be the chain and so are the nuclei 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.480
 of the cells and therefore they are really 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.849
 features 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.349
 as for the last fabric 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.209
 and that under the roses of nervous spa 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.129
 characteristically formed these 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:33.510
 these structures that rewards the names of 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:36.120
 neurons liked nervous and precisely for 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.890
 example present at the system level 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.200
 central and peripheral and later 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.299
 rightly the result of the vote yes 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.030
 found in organs that are innervated 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.769
 therefore all these fabrics put 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.079
 together they will constitute the level 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.730
 next which is the organ the level 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.190
 inferior to the fabric remembered are 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.110
 precisely the cells 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.140
 even for this video everything is the same 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.540
 sign up links to do tests for 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.489
 deepening this topic is also 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.989
 to see the other topics you video 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.640
 I liked to put like subscribe 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.460
 to the channel to stay updated when 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.870
 I make other videos 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.870
 see you soon hello
