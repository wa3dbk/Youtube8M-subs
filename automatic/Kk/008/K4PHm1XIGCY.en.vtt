some difficulty now here is the front of
the<00:01:22.140> chain<00:01:22.350> notice<00:01:22.830> those<00:01:23.040> V's<00:01:23.369> keep<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.420> in

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the chain notice those V's keep that in

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.810 
the chain notice those V's keep that in
mind<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.290> flip<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.650> chain<00:01:26.009> over<00:01:26.250> you're

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
mind if you flip the chain over you're

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.460 
mind if you flip the chain over you're
gonna<00:01:26.909> see<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.479> humps<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.990> back<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.380> a

and I don't know what's going on with
this<00:04:00.459> tutorial<00:04:01.030> so<00:04:01.599> make<00:04:01.930> sure<00:04:01.959> that<00:04:02.680> you<00:04:03.220> work

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
this tutorial so make sure that you work

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.300 
this tutorial so make sure that you work
all<00:04:04.299> of<00:04:04.569> your<00:04:04.780> stitches<00:04:05.079> and<00:04:05.560> again<00:04:05.889> once<00:04:06.159> you

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
all of your stitches and again once you

now<00:04:14.519> what<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:14.730> like<00:04:14.909> to<00:04:15.060> do<00:04:15.269> is<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.810> count<00:04:16.049> my

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
now what I like to do is to count my

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.219 
now what I like to do is to count my
stitches<00:04:16.470> on<00:04:17.190> one<00:04:17.549> row<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:18.509> then<00:04:18.750> count<00:04:19.079> them

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
stitches on one row and then count them

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.170 
stitches on one row and then count them
on<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.709> second<00:04:20.070> row<00:04:20.160> so<00:04:20.220> if<00:04:20.400> you<00:04:20.459> have<00:04:20.609> 32<00:04:20.940> on

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
on the second row so if you have 32 on

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.909 
on the second row so if you have 32 on
the<00:04:21.209> bottom<00:04:21.600> you<00:04:21.690> should<00:04:21.720> have<00:04:21.989> 32<00:04:22.470> on<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.680> top

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
the bottom you should have 32 on the top

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.950 
the bottom you should have 32 on the top
now<00:04:23.430> there's<00:04:23.699> gonna<00:04:23.940> come<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.240> point<00:04:24.330> in<00:04:24.690> time

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
now there's gonna come a point in time

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.350 
now there's gonna come a point in time
where<00:04:25.410> you're<00:04:25.590> going<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:26.130> run<00:04:26.430> out<00:04:26.759> of<00:04:26.820> yarn

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
where you're going to run out of yarn

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.240 
where you're going to run out of yarn
unless<00:04:27.720> you<00:04:27.840> have<00:04:27.990> like<00:04:28.139> this<00:04:28.259> big<00:04:28.320> massive

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
unless you have like this big massive

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.969 
unless you have like this big massive
yarn<00:04:29.639> ball<00:04:30.180> so<00:04:30.840> I'm<00:04:30.960> gonna<00:04:31.110> show<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:31.380> how<00:04:31.680> I

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
yarn ball so I'm gonna show you how I

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.249 
yarn ball so I'm gonna show you how I
changed<00:04:32.550> my<00:04:32.759> yarn<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:33.479> we're<00:04:33.660> going<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:34.020> act

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
changed my yarn so we're going to act

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.230 
changed my yarn so we're going to act
like<00:04:34.380> we're<00:04:34.800> just<00:04:34.830> crocheting<00:04:35.610> cuz<00:04:35.970> we<00:04:36.210> are

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
like we're just crocheting cuz we are

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.969 
like we're just crocheting cuz we are
approaching<00:04:36.900> so<00:04:37.199> I<00:04:37.229> guess<00:04:37.440> we're<00:04:37.620> not<00:04:37.710> acting

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
approaching so I guess we're not acting

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.379 
approaching so I guess we're not acting
like<00:04:38.009> we're<00:04:38.190> pushing<00:04:38.310> so<00:04:38.820> you're<00:04:39.000> going<00:04:39.360> to

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.100 
like we're pushing so you're going to
yarn<00:04:39.990> over<00:04:40.350> twice<00:04:41.270> insert<00:04:42.270> it<00:04:42.449> in<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.780> next

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
yarn over twice insert it in the next

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.430 
yarn over twice insert it in the next
stitch<00:04:43.590> now<00:04:44.250> usually<00:04:44.669> we<00:04:45.030> would<00:04:45.600> yarn<00:04:46.080> over

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
stitch now usually we would yarn over

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.080 
stitch now usually we would yarn over
and<00:04:46.620> grab<00:04:46.860> that<00:04:47.099> yarn<00:04:47.310> but<00:04:47.580> we're<00:04:47.699> not<00:04:47.849> going

to do that we're going to yarn over and

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.779 
to do that we're going to yarn over and

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
you the whole process cuz it's the same

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.839 
you the whole process cuz it's the same
thing<00:05:21.419> okay<00:05:21.690> so<00:05:22.020> once<00:05:22.770> I<00:05:22.830> get<00:05:23.010> to<00:05:23.159> the<00:05:23.280> end<00:05:23.490> I

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
thing okay so once I get to the end I

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.480 
thing okay so once I get to the end I
pull<00:05:24.389> my<00:05:24.570> yarn<00:05:24.599> through<00:05:25.020> that<00:05:25.590> last<00:05:25.919> hoop<00:05:26.310> and

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
pull my yarn through that last hoop and

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.889 
pull my yarn through that last hoop and
it<00:05:26.580> kind<00:05:26.789> of<00:05:26.880> secures<00:05:27.360> it<00:05:27.599> there

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:30.899 

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:34.919 

now<00:05:31.899> we<00:05:31.959> have<00:05:32.619> to<00:05:33.039> join<00:05:33.639> this<00:05:33.999> because<00:05:34.449> after

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:34.929 
now we have to join this because after

00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:36.959 
now we have to join this because after
all<00:05:34.959> this<00:05:35.349> is<00:05:35.619> a<00:05:35.889> circle<00:05:36.309> now<00:05:36.429> as<00:05:36.579> you<00:05:36.759> can<00:05:36.909> see

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:36.969 
all this is a circle now as you can see

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.849 
all this is a circle now as you can see
when<00:05:37.449> I<00:05:37.479> first<00:05:37.569> started<00:05:38.139> crocheting<00:05:38.529> it<00:05:38.769> was

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:38.859 
when I first started crocheting it was

00:05:38.859 --> 00:05:40.079 
when I first started crocheting it was
really<00:05:39.099> tight<00:05:39.279> by<00:05:39.459> the<00:05:39.519> time<00:05:39.699> I<00:05:39.729> got<00:05:39.879> to<00:05:39.999> the

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:40.089 
really tight by the time I got to the

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.029 
really tight by the time I got to the
end<00:05:40.269> it<00:05:40.659> was<00:05:40.839> really<00:05:41.109> loose<00:05:41.319> I<00:05:41.589> don't<00:05:41.769> know<00:05:41.859> why

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
end it was really loose I don't know why

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.149 
end it was really loose I don't know why
that<00:05:42.339> happens<00:05:42.789> but<00:05:42.909> yeah<00:05:43.869> so<00:05:44.379> what<00:05:44.619> we<00:05:44.799> need<00:05:45.009> to

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
that happens but yeah so what we need to

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.699 
that happens but yeah so what we need to
do<00:05:45.369> is<00:05:45.759> join<00:05:46.329> these<00:05:46.749> two<00:05:47.279> so<00:05:48.279> you're<00:05:48.939> going<00:05:49.419> to

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:49.709 
do is join these two so you're going to

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:52.319 
do is join these two so you're going to
remember<00:05:50.709> that<00:05:50.859> V<00:05:51.129> I<00:05:51.399> told<00:05:51.669> you<00:05:51.819> about<00:05:51.879> we're

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:52.329 
remember that V I told you about we're
