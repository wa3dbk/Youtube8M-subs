on the end it grips to the surface of

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.209 
on the end it grips to the surface of
the<00:01:00.660> ipad<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.289> when<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.500> try<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.770> draw<00:01:02.010> with

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
it it's not very smooth because you have

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.380 
it it's not very smooth because you have
to<00:01:07.100> apply<00:01:08.100> quite<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> bit<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.610> force<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
to apply quite a bit of force for the

force<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.150> just<00:01:27.150> not<00:01:27.299> very<00:01:27.420> pleasant<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.869> use

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.979 
so when you're drawing with this one you
barely<00:04:11.220> have<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.640> touch<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.970> screen<00:04:12.180> in<00:04:12.600> there

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
barely have to touch the screen in there

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.229 
barely have to touch the screen in there
and<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.410> iPad<00:04:13.860> just<00:04:14.010> recognizes<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.880> and<00:04:15.090> it's

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
and the iPad just recognizes it and it's

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.830 
and the iPad just recognizes it and it's
just<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.720> just<00:04:15.900> draws<00:04:16.290> beautifully<00:04:17.840> one

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
just it just draws beautifully one

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.930 
just it just draws beautifully one
disadvantage<00:04:19.260> of<00:04:19.680> this<00:04:19.739> one<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.310> because<00:04:20.609> the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
disadvantage of this one is because the

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.230 
disadvantage of this one is because the
tip<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.479> quite<00:04:21.900> big<00:04:22.590> if<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.640> trying<00:04:24.000> to<00:04:24.060> draw

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
tip is quite big if you trying to draw

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.520 
tip is quite big if you trying to draw
fine<00:04:24.570> details<00:04:25.050> or

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
fine details or

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.160 
fine details or
you<00:04:25.590> going<00:04:25.889> to<00:04:26.130> be<00:04:26.850> drawing<00:04:27.030> very<00:04:27.300> thin<00:04:27.870> lines

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
you going to be drawing very thin lines

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.980 
you going to be drawing very thin lines
like<00:04:28.920> I<00:04:29.100> am<00:04:29.280> here<00:04:29.460> for<00:04:29.639> example<00:04:29.760> you<00:04:30.720> can't

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
like I am here for example you can't

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.960 
like I am here for example you can't
actually<00:04:31.290> depending<00:04:31.920> on<00:04:32.010> your<00:04:32.130> viewing<00:04:32.460> angle

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
actually depending on your viewing angle

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.510 
actually depending on your viewing angle
you<00:04:33.240> may<00:04:33.450> not<00:04:33.660> be<00:04:33.840> able<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:34.410> see<00:04:34.680> exactly<00:04:35.010> where

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
you may not be able to see exactly where

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.940 
you may not be able to see exactly where
your<00:04:35.639> stylus<00:04:36.060> is<00:04:36.210> going<00:04:36.570> unless<00:04:37.440> you<00:04:37.680> change

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
your stylus is going unless you change

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.590 
your stylus is going unless you change
your<00:04:38.070> perspective<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.910> kind<00:04:39.120> of<00:04:39.210> look<00:04:39.389> from

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
your perspective and kind of look from

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.040 
your perspective and kind of look from
the<00:04:39.750> side<00:04:41.000> but<00:04:42.000> I<00:04:42.030> generally<00:04:42.450> find<00:04:42.660> that<00:04:42.840> if<00:04:42.930> i

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
the side but I generally find that if i

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.040 
the side but I generally find that if i
zoom<00:04:43.080> in<00:04:43.820> if<00:04:44.820> i<00:04:45.030> zoom<00:04:45.060> in<00:04:45.419> to<00:04:45.510> what<00:04:45.660> I'm<00:04:45.750> doing

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
zoom in if i zoom in to what I'm doing

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.530 
zoom in if i zoom in to what I'm doing
then<00:04:46.200> it<00:04:46.320> Sam<00:04:46.880> doesn't<00:04:47.880> really<00:04:48.120> cause<00:04:48.330> any

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
then it Sam doesn't really cause any

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.590 
then it Sam doesn't really cause any
problems<00:04:48.960> but<00:04:49.470> um<00:04:49.850> yeah<00:04:50.850> just<00:04:50.880> one<00:04:51.360> thing<00:04:51.540> to

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
problems but um yeah just one thing to

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.940 
problems but um yeah just one thing to
be<00:04:52.350> aware<00:04:52.470> of<00:04:52.680> what<00:04:52.950> this<00:04:53.070> I<00:04:53.250> with<00:04:53.639> this<00:04:53.820> some
