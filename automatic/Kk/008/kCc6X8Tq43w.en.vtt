00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.380 
it's a socks proxy you want to select
that<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.280> most<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> time<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.090> really

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
that but for most of the time you really

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.660 
that but for most of the time you really
just<00:01:51.540> want<00:01:51.600> an<00:01:51.780> HTTP<00:01:52.409> proxy<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:53.280> you're<00:01:53.490> just

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
just want an HTTP proxy so you're just

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.950 
just want an HTTP proxy so you're just
going<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.180> paste<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.470> domain<00:01:55.950> or<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.960> IP

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
going to paste in the domain or the IP

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.020 
going to paste in the domain or the IP
address<00:01:58.729> once<00:01:59.729> we<00:01:59.909> have<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.119> configured<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
address once we have that configured and

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.160 
address once we have that configured and
like<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> said<00:02:03.180> sometimes<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.659> do<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.930> try

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
like I said sometimes you do have to try

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.649 
like I said sometimes you do have to try
a<00:02:04.200> few<00:02:04.380> times<00:02:04.759> we're<00:02:05.759> basically<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.360> going

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
a few times we're basically just going

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.350 
a few times we're basically just going
to<00:02:06.840> I'm<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.680> just<00:02:08.069> go<00:02:08.640> ahead<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.849> say<00:02:09.119> ok

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
to I'm going to just go ahead and say ok

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.850 
to I'm going to just go ahead and say ok
I<00:02:10.140> want<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.590> use<00:02:10.920> proxy<00:02:11.550> test<00:02:11.849> for<00:02:12.540> all<00:02:12.660> URLs

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
I want to use proxy test for all URLs

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.340 
I want to use proxy test for all URLs
and<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.220> going<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.610> start<00:02:15.270> using<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:15.840> proxy

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
and it's going to start using this proxy

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.820 
and it's going to start using this proxy
for<00:02:16.560> all<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.800> my<00:02:16.920> tests<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.420> one<00:02:19.350> way<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.500> check

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
for all of my tests so one way to check

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.750 
for all of my tests so one way to check
this<00:02:20.010> out<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:21.740> first<00:02:22.740> want<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> see<00:02:23.160> if<00:02:23.310> you

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
private that's not really the point so

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.160 
private that's not really the point so
if<00:03:16.350> you're<00:03:16.470> trying<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:17.780> privatize<00:03:18.780> your

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
content you're going to want to use

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.400 
content you're going to want to use
either<00:03:20.400> some<00:03:20.850> sort<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.060> tunnel<00:03:21.270> or<00:03:21.660> tour<00:03:22.020> or<00:03:22.350> a

either some sort of tunnel or tour or a

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.660 
either some sort of tunnel or tour or a
VPN<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:24.230> it's<00:03:25.230> obviously<00:03:25.770> not<00:03:25.890> going<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.370> be

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.610 

this<00:03:29.670> is<00:03:29.820> always<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.300> fastest<00:03:30.780> option<00:03:30.990> it

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
this is always the fastest option it

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.350 
this is always the fastest option it
might<00:03:31.920> take<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.130> few<00:03:32.220> tries<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:32.760> find<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:33.000> proxy

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
might take a few tries to find a proxy

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.030 
might take a few tries to find a proxy
that<00:03:33.480> works<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.900> finds<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.200> find<00:03:34.710> a<00:03:34.770> proxy

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
that works that finds a find a proxy

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.310 
that works that finds a find a proxy
that's<00:03:35.220> fast<00:03:35.480> but<00:03:36.480> with<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:36.930> little<00:03:37.020> bit<00:03:37.260> of

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
that's fast but with a little bit of

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.050 
that's fast but with a little bit of
effort<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.740> can<00:03:37.860> do<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.190> find<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.910> if<00:03:39.030> I

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
effort you can do that I find that if I

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.240 
effort you can do that I find that if I
try<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:40.020> off-peak<00:03:40.500> times<00:03:40.800> from<00:03:41.070> whether

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
the US you can do the same thing just

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.010 
the US you can do the same thing just
use<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.190> US<00:03:47.610> proxy<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.330> there<00:03:48.570> are<00:03:48.660> tons<00:03:48.900> and

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
use a US proxy and there are tons and

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.020 
use a US proxy and there are tons and

tons of us proxy servers and insert that

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.110 
tons of us proxy servers and insert that
and<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:52.140> have<00:03:52.320> instant<00:03:52.890> access<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.610> it's

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
and you have instant access and it's

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.250 
and you have instant access and it's
just<00:03:54.240> something<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:54.510> can<00:03:54.630> very<00:03:54.780> easily<00:03:54.840> turn

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
just something you can very easily turn

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.190 
just something you can very easily turn
on<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:55.530> off<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:56.520> immediately<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.510> have<00:03:57.720> access
