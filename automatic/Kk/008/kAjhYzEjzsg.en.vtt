now is about eleven and a half miles and
the<00:01:47.689> average<00:01:47.960> speed<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:48.680> can't<00:01:49.310> read<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:49.610> from

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
the average speed I can't read it from

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.830 
the average speed I can't read it from
here<00:01:49.789> but<00:01:50.740> it's<00:01:51.740> about<00:01:51.950> fifty<00:01:52.549> fifty<00:01:53.420> nine

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
here but it's about fifty fifty nine

yeah<00:01:55.750> unfortunately<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:57.350> can't<00:01:57.590> really<00:01:57.740> read

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
yeah unfortunately you can't really read

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.969 
yeah unfortunately you can't really read
it<00:01:58.159> because<00:01:58.310> it's<00:01:58.520> blurry<00:01:58.880> but<00:02:02.890> they're<00:02:03.890> about

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
it because it's blurry but they're about

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.399 
it because it's blurry but they're about
right
