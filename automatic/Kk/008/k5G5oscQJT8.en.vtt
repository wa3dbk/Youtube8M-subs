00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.920 
tale is being replaced by an anime
called<00:03:08.920> dry<00:03:09.220> land<00:03:09.490> so<00:03:09.790> bleach<00:03:10.600> is<00:03:10.630> going<00:03:10.870> to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
called dry land so bleach is going to

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.870 
called dry land so bleach is going to
have<00:03:11.050> its<00:03:11.080> own<00:03:11.520> time<00:03:12.520> slot<00:03:12.790> if<00:03:13.210> it<00:03:13.600> does<00:03:13.810> return

have its own time slot if it does return

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.560 
have its own time slot if it does return
but<00:03:15.880> this<00:03:16.690> also<00:03:16.930> shows<00:03:17.440> that<00:03:17.950> no<00:03:18.790> anime<00:03:19.270> is

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
but this also shows that no anime is

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.810 
but this also shows that no anime is
safe<00:03:20.140> honestly<00:03:21.130> except<00:03:22.560> naruto<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.860> one

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
safe honestly except naruto and one

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.300 
safe honestly except naruto and one
piece<00:03:25.290> basically<00:03:26.290> because<00:03:26.440> more<00:03:26.890> piece<00:03:27.100> is

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
piece basically because more piece is

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.229 
piece basically because more piece is
always<00:03:27.730> first<00:03:27.970> never<00:03:28.720> gonna<00:03:28.959> probably<00:03:29.200> leave

always first never gonna probably leave

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.000 
always first never gonna probably leave
