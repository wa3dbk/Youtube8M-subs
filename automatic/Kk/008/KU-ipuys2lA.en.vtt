00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.900 
visual studio and this is one of the
errors<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.210> just<00:00:15.480> received<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.910> this

error is coming off from my other

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.230 
error is coming off from my other
computer<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.410> trying<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.519> access<00:00:23.730> the

common and really easy to fix and so how

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.170 
common and really easy to fix and so how
you<00:00:33.809> fix<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.320> error<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:35.760> got<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.059> go

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
security what we got to do is that we

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.080 
security what we got to do is that we

sequel server to be accessed from other

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.510 
sequel server to be accessed from other
systems<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.489> don't<00:00:54.090> mean<00:00:54.270> access<00:00:54.809> as<00:00:55.020> in

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
systems and so I don't mean access as in

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.580 
systems and so I don't mean access as in
browsing<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> website<00:00:57.539> what<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.930> mean<00:00:58.320> is

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
browsing to a website what I mean is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.189 
browsing to a website what I mean is
being<00:00:58.890> able<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.219> create<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> connection<00:01:00.420> on

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
being able to create a connection on

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.950 
being able to create a connection on
another<00:01:01.710> computer<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.550> accesses<00:01:03.510> this

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
another computer that accesses this

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.859 
another computer that accesses this
system<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.640> way<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.880> would<00:01:06.270> access

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
system so like the way you would access

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.370 
system so like the way you would access
your<00:01:07.530> hosting<00:01:08.040> providers<00:01:08.670> sequel<00:01:09.390> server<00:01:09.630> you

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
your hosting providers sequel server you

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.399 
your hosting providers sequel server you
would<00:01:10.500> create<00:01:10.950> your<00:01:11.390> link<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
would create your link to it on the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.320 
would create your link to it on the
outside<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.640> test<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.119> make<00:01:15.270> sure

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
outside to test to make sure

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.760 
outside to test to make sure
everything's<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:16.080> right<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.560> that's

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
everything's going right but that's

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.950 
everything's going right but that's
especially<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.220> same<00:01:17.490> concept<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.840> so

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
especially the same concept here and so

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.510 
especially the same concept here and so

we're going to do is that we're going to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.990 
we're going to do is that we're going to
