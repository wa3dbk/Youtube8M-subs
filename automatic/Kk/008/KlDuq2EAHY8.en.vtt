hey everyone its blue-raspberry today
I'm<00:00:18.090> bringing<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> tutorial<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.529> sorts<00:00:19.560> but

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
I'm bringing you a tutorial of sorts but

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.210 
I'm bringing you a tutorial of sorts but
this<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.520> more<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.060> safety<00:00:22.039> lecture<00:00:23.039> on

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
this is more of a safety lecture on

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.589 
this is more of a safety lecture on
fusion<00:00:23.730> reactors<00:00:24.980> if<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:27.180> had<00:00:27.420> any

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
fusion reactors if you have had any

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.359 
fusion reactors if you have had any
experience<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:28.230> them<00:00:28.470> or<00:00:28.619> have<00:00:28.830> seen<00:00:29.130> them

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
experience with them or have seen them

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.250 
experience with them or have seen them
being<00:00:29.640> played<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.449> will<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.869> probably

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
being played with you will have probably

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.690 
being played with you will have probably
seen<00:00:31.529> somebody<00:00:31.890> get<00:00:32.040> electrocuted

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
seen somebody get electrocuted

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.060 
seen somebody get electrocuted
now<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.500> superconductor<00:00:34.500> wires<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.950> are

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
now the superconductor wires that are

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.590 
now the superconductor wires that are
coming<00:00:35.370> out<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.610> fusion<00:00:35.790> reactor<00:00:36.329> are

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
coming out of the fusion reactor are

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.440 
coming out of the fusion reactor are
extremely<00:00:37.590> high<00:00:37.739> voltage<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:39.030> much<00:00:39.239> it's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
extremely high voltage so much it's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.180 
extremely high voltage so much it's
millions<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.290> it's<00:00:40.500> not<00:00:40.649> even<00:00:40.890> it's

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
millions of you you it's not even it's

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.900 
millions of you you it's not even it's
not<00:00:41.309> even<00:00:41.489> funny

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
not even funny

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.750 
not even funny
so<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.809> can<00:00:43.079> leave<00:00:43.260> people<00:00:43.469> stranded<00:00:43.760> where

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
so it can leave people stranded where

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.029 
so it can leave people stranded where
their<00:00:45.149> stuff<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> ground<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.890> is

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
their stuff is on the ground and this is

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.799 
their stuff is on the ground and this is
very<00:00:47.280> expensive<00:00:47.489> stuff<00:00:47.879> mind<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.510> they

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
very expensive stuff mind you and they

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.110 
very expensive stuff mind you and they
can't<00:00:49.050> get<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:50.100> I've<00:00:50.430> got<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> little

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
can't get to it so I've got a little

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.330 
can't get to it so I've got a little
trick<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.770> able<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.010> kind<00:00:53.280> of

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
trick for you to be able to kind of

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.939 
trick for you to be able to kind of
bypass<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.270> your<00:00:54.360> stuff<00:00:54.629> back<00:00:54.949> it's

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
bypass that and get your stuff back it's

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.500 
bypass that and get your stuff back it's
a<00:00:56.100> very<00:00:56.309> good<00:00:56.489> thing<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:56.910> around<00:00:57.239> all

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
a very good thing to have around all

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.500 
a very good thing to have around all
your<00:00:57.660> fusion<00:00:58.050> reactors<00:00:58.550> just<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.730> case<00:00:59.969> you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
your fusion reactors just in case you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.869 
your fusion reactors just in case you
get<00:01:00.629> too<00:01:00.960> close<00:01:01.309> but<00:01:02.309> I'm<00:01:02.430> also<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.760> show

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
get too close but I'm also going to show

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.310 
get too close but I'm also going to show

ok so as you can see here I've got my
power<00:01:42.810> armor<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.939> if<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.090> click<00:01:45.360> through<00:01:45.540> here

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
power armor on if you click through here

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.340 
power armor on if you click through here
I've<00:01:46.920> put<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.000> battery<00:01:48.390> about<00:01:48.600> half<00:01:48.869> way<00:01:49.140> I

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
I've put in the battery about half way I

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.149 
I've put in the battery about half way I
have<00:01:49.530> put<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> full<00:01:50.310> strength<00:01:50.880> energy<00:01:51.299> shield

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
have put a full strength energy shield

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.230 
have put a full strength energy shield
let's<00:01:53.159> see<00:01:53.340> I've<00:01:53.460> got<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.270> solar<00:01:54.479> generator

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
let's see I've got the solar generator

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.120 
let's see I've got the solar generator
so<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.869> can<00:01:58.200> highlight<00:01:58.469> over<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:59.100> I

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
so I I can highlight over this but I

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.440 
so I I can highlight over this but I
just<00:01:59.369> kind<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.579> wanted<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.880> show<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.149> this

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
just kind of wanted to show you this

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.039 
just kind of wanted to show you this
really<00:02:01.049> quickly<00:02:01.850> so<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:02.969> actually<00:02:03.180> got<00:02:03.479> very

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
really quickly so it's actually got very

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.780 
really quickly so it's actually got very
strong<00:02:04.200> shields<00:02:04.890> there<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.399> very<00:02:05.430> good

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
strong shields there it's a very good

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.460 
strong shields there it's a very good
set<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.479> armor

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
set of armor

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.980 
set of armor

with<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.380> grab<00:02:26.620> suit<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:28.390> power<00:02:28.660> armor

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
with the grab suit the power armor

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.660 
with the grab suit the power armor
itself<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.410> pretty<00:02:29.650> strong<00:02:29.980> but<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:30.430> is

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
itself is pretty strong but this is

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.010 
itself is pretty strong but this is
supposed<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.000> be<00:02:31.120> some<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.510> best<00:02:31.630> armor<00:02:31.930> in

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
supposed to be some of the best armor in

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.710 
supposed to be some of the best armor in
the<00:02:32.050> game<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:33.030> you'll<00:02:34.030> see<00:02:34.210> it<00:02:34.330> pretty<00:02:34.570> much

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
the game and you'll see it pretty much

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.430 
the game and you'll see it pretty much
right<00:02:34.930> away<00:02:35.260> boom<00:02:36.240> now<00:02:37.240> think<00:02:38.050> about<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.320> this

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
right away boom now think about it this

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
right away boom now think about it this
way<00:02:38.620> what<00:02:39.580> if<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:40.750> had<00:02:41.320> this<00:02:41.590> but<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.010> was<00:02:42.100> in<00:02:42.310> a

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
way what if you had this but it was in a

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.090 
way what if you had this but it was in a
hole<00:02:42.820> instead<00:02:43.330> of<00:02:43.450> being<00:02:43.660> up<00:02:43.870> above<00:02:44.200> in<00:02:44.860> the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
hole instead of being up above in the

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.950 
hole instead of being up above in the
air<00:02:45.250> which<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:46.120> probably<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.660> best<00:02:46.810> way<00:02:46.930> to

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
air which is probably the best way to

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.270 
air which is probably the best way to
have<00:02:47.200> your<00:02:47.320> fusion<00:02:47.560> reactors<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.130> that<00:02:48.220> you

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
have your fusion reactors so that you

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.520 
have your fusion reactors so that you
can<00:02:48.430> reach<00:02:48.580> it<00:02:48.730> without<00:02:48.930> fear<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:49.960> touching

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
can reach it without fear of touching

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.800 
can reach it without fear of touching
any<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.800> these<00:02:50.920> wires<00:02:51.430> well<00:02:52.060> you'd<00:02:52.450> have<00:02:52.630> this

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
any of these wires well you'd have this

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.390 
any of these wires well you'd have this
all<00:02:53.140> right<00:02:53.440> near<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:53.980> can't<00:02:54.160> get<00:02:54.280> back

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
all right near it and you can't get back

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.060 
all right near it and you can't get back
to<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.790> so<00:02:55.030> you're<00:02:55.150> thinking<00:02:55.300> huh<00:02:55.830> what<00:02:56.830> can<00:02:57.010> I

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
to it so you're thinking huh what can I

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.000 
to it so you're thinking huh what can I
do<00:02:57.570> I'm<00:02:58.570> stuck<00:02:58.810> without<00:02:58.960> my<00:02:59.200> stuff<00:02:59.470> this<00:02:59.770> is

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
do I'm stuck without my stuff this is

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.650 
do I'm stuck without my stuff this is
very<00:03:00.400> expensive<00:03:00.760> things<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.570> know

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
very expensive things that you know

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.210 
very expensive things that you know
especially<00:03:01.870> if<00:03:02.230> you've<00:03:02.410> worked<00:03:02.890> really<00:03:03.100> hard

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
especially if you've worked really hard

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.990 
especially if you've worked really hard
to<00:03:03.430> get<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.640> iridium<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.150> you've<00:03:04.270> got<00:03:04.710> well

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
to get the iridium that you've got well

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.690 
to get the iridium that you've got well
the<00:03:07.000> answer<00:03:07.300> is<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.690> hazmat<00:03:08.080> suit<00:03:08.550> I'm<00:03:09.550> gonna

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
the answer is the hazmat suit I'm gonna

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.670 
the answer is the hazmat suit I'm gonna
go<00:03:09.880> ahead<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.330> load<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.490> like<00:03:12.490> so<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.680> I'm

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
go ahead and load it like so and I'm

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.050 
go ahead and load it like so and I'm
gonna<00:03:14.890> show<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.520> this<00:03:20.040> as<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.190> can<00:03:21.220> see<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.730> am

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
gonna show you this as you can see I am

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.510 
gonna show you this as you can see I am
taking<00:03:22.510> damage<00:03:24.810> but<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:26.200> can<00:03:26.680> safely<00:03:26.980> jump

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
taking damage but I can safely jump

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.960 
taking damage but I can safely jump
around<00:03:27.940> and<00:03:28.900> collect<00:03:29.620> my<00:03:29.800> things<00:03:29.970> without

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
around and collect my things without

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.800 
around and collect my things without
fear<00:03:31.450> of<00:03:31.570> dying<00:03:32.310> mind<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:34.300> do<00:03:34.480> need<00:03:34.660> the

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
fear of dying mind you you do need the

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.110 
fear of dying mind you you do need the
whole<00:03:34.959> suit<00:03:35.230> on<00:03:35.380> because<00:03:35.800> watch<00:03:36.040> as<00:03:36.459> I<00:03:36.940> take

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
whole suit on because watch as I take

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.490 
whole suit on because watch as I take
the<00:03:37.270> helmet<00:03:37.540> off<00:03:38.970> death

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
the helmet off death

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.840 
the helmet off death
so<00:03:42.460> there<00:03:43.210> you<00:03:43.360> have<00:03:43.390> it<00:03:43.620> it's<00:03:44.620> very<00:03:45.190> simple

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
so there you have it it's very simple

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.880 
so there you have it it's very simple
mind<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:46.630> even<00:03:46.660> though<00:03:47.050> these<00:03:47.200> also<00:03:47.470> have

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
mind you even though these also have

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.710 
mind you even though these also have
damage<00:03:48.700> on<00:03:48.820> them<00:03:49.000> now<00:03:49.090> they<00:03:49.240> will<00:03:49.360> still<00:03:49.600> work

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
damage on them now they will still work

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.560 
damage on them now they will still work
I've<00:03:50.020> tested<00:03:50.740> it<00:03:50.830> before<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:53.500> if<00:03:53.920> you're<00:03:54.130> ever

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
I've tested it before so if you're ever

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.480 
I've tested it before so if you're ever
working<00:03:55.570> with<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:55.840> fusion<00:03:56.200> reactor<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:57.160> best

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
working with a fusion reactor the best

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.580 
working with a fusion reactor the best
thing<00:03:57.670> to<00:03:57.700> have<00:03:57.940> is<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.150> hazmat<00:03:58.330> suit<00:03:58.840> because

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
thing to have is a hazmat suit because

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.370 
thing to have is a hazmat suit because
it<00:04:00.010> will<00:04:00.220> absorb<00:04:00.460> the<00:04:01.450> electricity<00:04:02.140> that<00:04:02.320> is

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
it will absorb the electricity that is

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.830 
it will absorb the electricity that is
being<00:04:02.740> shot<00:04:03.040> through<00:04:03.370> you<00:04:03.610> and<00:04:03.880> shot<00:04:04.690> through

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
being shot through you and shot through

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.110 
being shot through you and shot through
these<00:04:05.020> wires<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.830> it<00:04:06.010> is<00:04:06.130> just<00:04:06.430> very<00:04:06.760> very

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
these wires and it is just very very

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.450 
these wires and it is just very very
helpful<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:07.900> have<00:04:08.110> so<00:04:08.710> there<00:04:08.890> you<00:04:08.980> have<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:09.190> the

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
helpful to have so there you have it the

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.100 
helpful to have so there you have it the
hazmat<00:04:09.850> suit<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.300> perfect<00:04:10.660> solution<00:04:10.960> to<00:04:10.990> your

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
hazmat suit the perfect solution to your

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.260 
hazmat suit the perfect solution to your
electrocution<00:04:11.770> problems<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:12.460> hope<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.180> you

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270
