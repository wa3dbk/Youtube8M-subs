with it is a nice sounds of good volume
it's<00:01:19.290> not<00:01:19.380> trouser<00:01:19.740> flapping<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:20.400> become

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
it's not trouser flapping now become

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.850 
it's not trouser flapping now become
fairly<00:01:21.120> it<00:01:21.450> will<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.660> ample<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.320> volume<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.830> I

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
fairly it will be ample get volume so I

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.110 
fairly it will be ample get volume so I
think<00:01:23.010> it's<00:01:23.310> quite<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.490> fair<00:01:23.730> representation

on<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> 410<00:02:10.019> think<00:02:11.009> we<00:02:11.099> had<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> sh<00:02:11.550> down<00:02:11.790> for<00:02:12.060> 10<00:02:12.330> i

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
on a 410 think we had a sh down for 10 i

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.650 
on a 410 think we had a sh down for 10 i
had<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.019> the<00:02:13.800> mic<00:02:14.069> staring<00:02:14.940> right<00:02:15.300> into<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
had a the mic staring right into the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.229 
had a the mic staring right into the
middle<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.550> cabinet<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.000> we<00:02:18.090> had<00:02:18.209> a

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
middle of the cabinet so we had a

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.820 
middle of the cabinet so we had a
speaker<00:02:18.480> here<00:02:18.720> speaker<00:02:19.110> here<00:02:19.349> speaking<00:02:19.709> is

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
speaker here speaker here speaking is

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.650 
speaker here speaker here speaking is
bigger<00:02:20.190> than<00:02:20.340> mines<00:02:20.580> dead<00:02:20.849> center<00:02:21.209> obviously

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
bigger than mines dead center obviously

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.750 
bigger than mines dead center obviously
no<00:02:21.810> horn<00:02:22.080> engaged<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:23.190> got<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.430> really

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
no horn engaged and that got a really

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.210 
no horn engaged and that got a really
good<00:02:24.120> point<00:02:24.720> face<00:02:25.050> time<00:02:25.400> but<00:02:26.400> again<00:02:26.610> blend

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
good point face time but again blend

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.650 
good point face time but again blend
with<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.430> DI<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:29.490> always<00:02:30.490> if<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.760> can<00:02:30.970> split

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
with the DI so always if you can split

I've<00:02:48.010> also<00:02:48.250> got<00:02:48.460> an<00:02:48.550> active<00:02:48.880> one<00:02:49.200> which<00:02:50.200> again

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
I've also got an active one which again

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.050 
I've also got an active one which again
brigham<00:02:50.950> results<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.430> it's<00:02:51.520> worth<00:02:51.700> having

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
brigham results and it's worth having

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.000 
brigham results and it's worth having
both<00:02:52.270> options<00:02:52.570> available<00:02:53.020> just<00:02:53.530> in<00:02:53.620> case<00:02:53.830> you

drum track which I'll he play in the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.390 
drum track which I'll he play in the
video<00:03:15.190> I'll<00:03:15.550> do<00:03:15.940> also<00:03:16.410> do<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.440> bit<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:17.620> both<00:03:17.860> so

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
video I'll do also do a bit of both so

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.370 
video I'll do also do a bit of both so
you<00:03:18.459> can<00:03:18.610> hear<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.910> bass<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.630> drums<00:03:20.050> together

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
you can hear the bass and drums together

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.140 
you can hear the bass and drums together
and<00:03:20.650> based<00:03:21.520> on<00:03:21.670> its<00:03:21.820> own<00:03:23.430> yeah<00:03:24.430> it's<00:03:24.970> quite<00:03:25.060> a

and based on its own yeah it's quite a
nice<00:03:25.300> little<00:03:25.690> setup<00:03:26.400> nothing<00:03:27.400> too<00:03:27.520> fancy

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
nice little setup nothing too fancy

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
with the using my marshall head is very

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.120 
with the using my marshall head is very
limited<00:03:33.040> in<00:03:33.310> tone<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:34.170> gained<00:03:35.170> but<00:03:35.860> there<00:03:36.010> is

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130
