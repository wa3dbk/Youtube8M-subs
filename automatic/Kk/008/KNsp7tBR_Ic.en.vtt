maybe a little bit of a dramatization
here<00:00:47.610> typically<00:00:48.360> Powder<00:00:48.690> Springs<00:00:48.809> Creek<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.649> a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
here typically Powder Springs Creek is a

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.340 
here typically Powder Springs Creek is a
rather<00:00:50.610> docile<00:00:51.210> little<00:00:51.420> Creek<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.050> back

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
rather docile little Creek and it's back

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.770 
rather docile little Creek and it's back
over<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.860> tree<00:00:53.160> line<00:00:53.399> alright<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.120> it's

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
over in that tree line alright and it's

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.260 
over in that tree line alright and it's
probably<00:00:55.050> not<00:00:55.230> as<00:00:55.500> wide<00:00:55.770> as<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.760> even<00:00:57.149> this

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
probably not as wide as is even this

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.479 
probably not as wide as is even this
road<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.780> you're<00:00:58.079> looking<00:00:58.379> at<00:00:58.500> here<00:00:58.530> now

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
road is that you're looking at here now

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.910 
road is that you're looking at here now
I<00:00:59.940> would<00:01:00.270> say<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.809> Powder<00:01:01.050> Springs<00:01:01.170> Creek<00:01:01.680> has

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
I would say the Powder Springs Creek has

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.130 
I would say the Powder Springs Creek has
gotten<00:01:02.340> at<00:01:02.550> least<00:01:02.760> at<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.059> point<00:01:03.359> up<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
gotten at least at this point up to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.929 
gotten at least at this point up to
about<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.769> hundred<00:01:04.979> maybe<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.489> little<00:01:05.610> over<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
about a hundred maybe a little over a

about a hundred maybe a little over a
hundred<00:01:06.210> yards<00:01:06.360> wide<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.920> just

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
hundred yards wide and it is just

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.000 
hundred yards wide and it is just
gushing<00:01:08.970> over<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.360> roadway<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.080> continuing

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
gushing over this roadway and continuing

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.789 
gushing over this roadway and continuing
to<00:01:11.670> rise<00:01:11.909> since<00:01:12.840> I've<00:01:13.049> been<00:01:13.290> here

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
to rise since I've been here

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.070 
to rise since I've been here
if<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.220> look<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.820> see<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.180> 35<00:01:15.659> mile<00:01:15.960> an

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
if you look out you see that 35 mile an

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
hour speed limit sign there you could

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.969 
hour speed limit sign there you could
walk<00:01:18.150> out<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.110> dry<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:19.770> about

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
walk out to that and be dry here about

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.160 
walk out to that and be dry here about
three<00:01:20.250> hours<00:01:20.400> ago<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.390> no<00:01:21.630> way<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.869> can

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
three hours ago there is no way you can

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.740 
three hours ago there is no way you can
do<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.470> now<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.799> fact<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.280> would<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> little

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
do that now in fact I would be a little

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.300 
do that now in fact I would be a little
bit<00:01:24.869> hesitant<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.380> try<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.740> walk<00:01:25.950> out<00:01:26.130> there

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
bit hesitant to try to walk out there

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.100 
bit hesitant to try to walk out there
even<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.729> my<00:01:26.850> waders<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.840> probably

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
even in my waders because I probably

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.690 
even in my waders because I probably
could<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.500> knocked<00:01:28.680> off<00:01:28.890> my<00:01:28.920> feet<00:01:29.400> there's<00:01:29.610> a

were going in to inspect that building a

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.250 
were going in to inspect that building a
little<00:01:52.270> bit<00:01:52.420> earlier<00:01:52.690> they<00:01:52.840> actually<00:01:53.110> even

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
little bit earlier they actually even

had a boat out over there a little bit

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.450 
had a boat out over there a little bit
earlier<00:01:55.360> as<00:01:55.540> well<00:01:55.750> now<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.560> question<00:01:57.040> is<00:01:57.160> is

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
earlier as well now the question is is

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.430 
earlier as well now the question is is
the<00:01:58.120> rain<00:01:58.270> over<00:01:58.600> with<00:01:58.750> and<00:01:58.990> I<00:01:59.050> unfortunately

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
the rain over with and I unfortunately

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.190 
the rain over with and I unfortunately
have<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.190> say<00:02:00.340> probably<00:02:00.760> not<00:02:01.030> we<00:02:01.720> still<00:02:01.780> have

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
have to say probably not we still have

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.719 
have to say probably not we still have
rain<00:02:02.440> in<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.650> forecast<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:03.430> we<00:02:03.520> have<00:02:03.700> a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
rain in the forecast and we have a

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.820 
rain in the forecast and we have a
graphic<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.360> show<00:02:04.420> you<00:02:04.600> that<00:02:05.200> will<00:02:05.350> probably

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
graphic to show you that will probably

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.340 
graphic to show you that will probably
see<00:02:06.070> one<00:02:06.790> to<00:02:07.000> two<00:02:07.210> more<00:02:07.420> inches<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.900> rain<00:02:08.170> now

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
see one to two more inches of rain now

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.290 
see one to two more inches of rain now
when<00:02:08.500> you<00:02:08.590> stack<00:02:08.860> that<00:02:09.039> on<00:02:09.220> top<00:02:09.429> of<00:02:09.490> both<00:02:10.090> we've

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
when you stack that on top of both we've

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.780 
when you stack that on top of both we've
already<00:02:10.450> had<00:02:10.690> 14<00:02:11.200> 15<00:02:11.590> 16<00:02:11.800> inches<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.340> rain<00:02:12.580> here

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
already had 14 15 16 inches of rain here

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.610 
already had 14 15 16 inches of rain here
it<00:02:13.030> was<00:02:13.450> called<00:02:13.720> County<00:02:14.020> that<00:02:14.170> doesn't<00:02:14.500> seem

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
it was called County that doesn't seem

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.530 
it was called County that doesn't seem
like<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.830> lot<00:02:15.100> but<00:02:15.310> any<00:02:15.790> additional<00:02:16.330> water

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
like a lot but any additional water

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.630 
like a lot but any additional water
folks<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.200> going<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.830> just<00:02:18.010> add<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.310> the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
folks is going to just add to the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.090 
folks is going to just add to the
problems<00:02:19.180> here<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.690> get<00:02:20.080> this<00:02:20.230> water<00:02:20.470> continues

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
problems here I get this water continues

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.300 
problems here I get this water continues
to<00:02:21.130> rise<00:02:21.280> here<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:22.739> I'm<00:02:23.739> afraid<00:02:24.040> it's

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
to rise here and I'm afraid it's

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.620 
to rise here and I'm afraid it's
probably<00:02:24.580> even<00:02:24.730> going<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.000> get<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.180> bit<00:02:25.420> higher

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
probably even going to get a bit higher

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.600 
probably even going to get a bit higher
than<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:26.080> once<00:02:26.709> again<00:02:26.890> we've<00:02:27.220> talked<00:02:27.489> to

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
than this once again we've talked to

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.610 
than this once again we've talked to
some<00:02:27.790> folks<00:02:28.000> here<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:28.450> many<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.320> them<00:02:29.440> come

down and say they have never ever seen
the<00:02:32.200> water<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:32.830> high<00:02:33.100> this<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.610> almost<00:02:33.910> an

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
the water this high this is almost an

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.660 
the water this high this is almost an
unprecedented<00:02:34.840> flooding<00:02:35.470> situation<00:02:36.250> here<00:02:36.489> in

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
unprecedented flooding situation here in

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.970 
unprecedented flooding situation here in
North<00:02:36.910> Atlanta<00:02:37.420> guys<00:02:37.720> back<00:02:38.020> to<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.860> of

course death you know you've lived in

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.330 
course death you know you've lived in
Atlanta<00:02:40.480> for<00:02:40.840> about<00:02:41.170> 25<00:02:41.650> years<00:02:41.860> now<00:02:42.010> you've

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
Atlanta for about 25 years now you've

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.240 
Atlanta for about 25 years now you've
also<00:02:42.730> covered<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.390> lot<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:44.230> tropical<00:02:44.800> systems

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
also covered a lot of tropical systems

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.820 
also covered a lot of tropical systems
so<00:02:45.400> let's<00:02:45.610> do<00:02:45.790> some<00:02:46.180> comparisons<00:02:47.019> on<00:02:47.500> what

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
so let's do some comparisons on what

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.699 
so let's do some comparisons on what
you've<00:02:48.010> seen<00:02:48.040> in<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> past<00:02:49.260> well<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.290> mean<00:02:50.500> when

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
you've seen in the past well I mean when

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.050 
you've seen in the past well I mean when
you<00:02:50.800> get<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:51.010> big<00:02:51.220> hurricane<00:02:51.400> or<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.880> tropical

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
you get a big hurricane or a tropical

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.940 
you get a big hurricane or a tropical
storm<00:02:52.450> coming<00:02:52.930> in<00:02:53.019> and<00:02:53.170> move<00:02:53.260> slowly<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.860> will

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
storm coming in and move slowly it will

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.590 
storm coming in and move slowly it will
dump<00:02:54.190> torrential<00:02:54.549> amounts<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.180> rain<00:02:55.360> like

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
dump torrential amounts of rain like

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.060 
dump torrential amounts of rain like
this<00:02:55.840> oh<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.380> there's<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.709> little<00:02:56.769> bit<00:02:57.010> of

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
this oh and there's a little bit of

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.070 
this oh and there's a little bit of
thunder<00:02:57.459> so<00:02:57.700> there's<00:02:58.209> some<00:02:58.390> storms<00:02:58.720> not<00:02:58.900> that

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
thunder so there's some storms not that

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.479 
thunder so there's some storms not that
far<00:02:59.290> away<00:02:59.410> from<00:02:59.530> where<00:02:59.890> I'm<00:03:00.010> standing

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
far away from where I'm standing

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.360 
far away from where I'm standing
but<00:03:00.880> Heather<00:03:01.690> this<00:03:01.959> is<00:03:02.080> very<00:03:02.320> comparable<00:03:02.830> to<00:03:03.220> a

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
but Heather this is very comparable to a

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.610 
but Heather this is very comparable to a
tropical<00:03:03.820> system<00:03:04.299> typically<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.320> would<00:03:05.500> look

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
tropical system typically you would look

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.020 
tropical system typically you would look
at<00:03:05.799> something<00:03:05.980> like<00:03:06.130> this<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.579> say<00:03:06.670> oh<00:03:06.700> oh<00:03:06.790> you

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
at something like this and say oh oh you

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.330 
at something like this and say oh oh you
had<00:03:07.299> a<00:03:07.329> storm<00:03:08.079> or<00:03:08.320> hurricane<00:03:08.350> spit<00:03:08.980> over<00:03:09.130> you

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
had a storm or hurricane spit over you

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.949 
had a storm or hurricane spit over you
for<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.549> day<00:03:09.730> or<00:03:09.760> two<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.150> dump<00:03:10.360> all<00:03:10.510> this<00:03:10.690> water

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
for a day or two and dump all this water

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.840 
for a day or two and dump all this water
but<00:03:11.530> that's<00:03:11.620> not<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.010> case<00:03:12.220> here<00:03:12.459> this<00:03:12.640> is

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
but that's not the case here this is

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.850 
but that's not the case here this is
this<00:03:13.299> is<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.480> different<00:03:14.140> situation<00:03:14.350> it's

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
this is a different situation it's

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.039 
this is a different situation it's
tropical<00:03:15.340> moisture<00:03:15.549> but<00:03:16.450> it<00:03:16.570> didn't<00:03:16.780> have<00:03:16.870> any

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
tropical moisture but it didn't have any

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:17.759 
tropical moisture but it didn't have any
name<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.470> it

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
name to it

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.400 
name to it
the<00:03:18.040> only<00:03:18.160> David<00:03:18.519> has<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:19.090> trouble<00:03:19.720> I<00:03:19.930> think

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
the only David has is trouble I think

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.160 
the only David has is trouble I think
we're<00:03:21.070> looking<00:03:21.190> at<00:03:21.459> here<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:22.079> Jennifer<00:03:23.079> you

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
we're looking at here and Jennifer you

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.390 
we're looking at here and Jennifer you
know<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.350> question<00:03:23.680> now<00:03:23.799> for<00:03:23.860> a<00:03:24.010> lot<00:03:24.130> of<00:03:24.250> folks

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
know the question now for a lot of folks

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.890 
know the question now for a lot of folks
I<00:03:24.489> think<00:03:24.519> in<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:24.910> Atlanta<00:03:25.150> area<00:03:25.180> is<00:03:25.510> how<00:03:25.690> much

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
I think in the Atlanta area is how much

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.870 
I think in the Atlanta area is how much
worse<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:26.739> going<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.100> get<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.430> maybe<00:03:27.579> now

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
worse is this going to get and maybe now

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.850 
worse is this going to get and maybe now
is<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.870> time<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.170> start<00:03:29.440> thinking<00:03:29.620> about

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
is the time to start thinking about

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.470 
is the time to start thinking about
whether<00:03:30.190> or<00:03:30.310> not<00:03:30.370> we<00:03:30.549> should<00:03:30.610> come<00:03:30.910> home<00:03:31.060> early

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
whether or not we should come home early

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.759 
whether or not we should come home early
from<00:03:31.600> work<00:03:31.690> that<00:03:32.110> type<00:03:32.290> of<00:03:32.320> thing<00:03:32.560> apparently

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
from work that type of thing apparently

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.770 
from work that type of thing apparently

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
I would I would I would think that's the

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.030 
I would I would I would think that's the
case<00:03:43.090> in<00:03:43.540> fact<00:03:43.810> we're<00:03:44.440> going<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.620> pan<00:03:44.769> over

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
case in fact we're going to pan over

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.650 
case in fact we're going to pan over
there<00:03:45.160> you<00:03:45.340> can<00:03:45.489> see<00:03:45.640> one<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.209> guys<00:03:46.360> coming

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
there you can see one of the guys coming

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.750 
there you can see one of the guys coming
out<00:03:46.900> of<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.140> museum<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.250> water<00:03:48.489> that's

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
out of the museum and the water that's

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.819 
out of the museum and the water that's
up<00:03:48.970> taking<00:03:49.299> some<00:03:49.510> waste<00:03:49.810> there<00:03:50.049> but<00:03:50.230> I<00:03:50.410> think

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
up taking some waste there but I think

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.280 
up taking some waste there but I think

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
are open because you know if everybody

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.219 
are open because you know if everybody
