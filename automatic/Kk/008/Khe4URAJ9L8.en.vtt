00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.189 
against millennium how confident were
you<00:00:25.740> coming<00:00:26.039> into<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> games<00:00:26.900> we<00:00:27.900> were<00:00:28.019> quite

you coming into the games we were quite

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.019 
you coming into the games we were quite
confident<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:29.519> didn't<00:00:29.699> really<00:00:29.730> know<00:00:30.000> what

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
confident but we didn't really know what

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.290 
confident but we didn't really know what
to<00:00:30.179> expect<00:00:31.189> we<00:00:32.189> prepared<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.610> strategy<00:00:33.059> for<00:00:33.090> our

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
to expect we prepared a strategy for our

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.860 
to expect we prepared a strategy for our
first<00:00:33.600> game<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:34.079> quite<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> big<00:00:34.680> one<00:00:34.829> and

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
first game like quite a big one and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.330 
first game like quite a big one and
turns<00:00:36.870> out<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.559> were<00:00:37.710> blue<00:00:37.890> side<00:00:38.129> che

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
turns out that we were blue side che

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.770 
turns out that we were blue side che
games<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.760> row<00:00:38.790> because<00:00:39.030> they<00:00:39.270> chose<00:00:39.480> purple

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
games in a row because they chose purple

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.470 
games in a row because they chose purple
so<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.280> used<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> same<00:00:41.760> strategy<00:00:42.270> and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
so we just used the same strategy and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.330 
so we just used the same strategy and
felt<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.260> they<00:00:43.379> didn't<00:00:43.559> really<00:00:43.739> adapt<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.219> it

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
felt like they didn't really adapt to it

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.920 
felt like they didn't really adapt to it
and<00:00:44.460> they<00:00:44.550> didn't<00:00:44.730> know<00:00:44.789> what<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> do<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.510> yeah

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
and they didn't know what to do so yeah

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.080 
and they didn't know what to do so yeah
we<00:00:46.530> ended<00:00:46.710> up<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.010> using<00:00:47.100> one<00:00:47.370> strategy<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
we ended up just using one strategy and

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.240 
we ended up just using one strategy and
the<00:00:48.149> whole<00:00:48.270> best<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.629> five<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.680> how<00:00:49.980> did<00:00:50.039> your

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the whole best of five so how did your

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.569 
the whole best of five so how did your
preparation<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.390> match<00:00:51.570> look<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:51.989> and

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
especially with the new patch I think

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
especially with the new patch I think
the<00:00:56.910> new<00:00:57.030> patch<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.390> really<00:00:57.600> good<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:57.930> us<00:00:58.010> got

the new patch is really good for us got
rid<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.370> few<00:00:59.520> problems<00:00:59.730> am<00:01:00.149> pions<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
rid of a few problems am pions like the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.389 
rid of a few problems am pions like the
gragas<00:01:01.079> knife<00:01:01.320> wasn't<00:01:01.829> really<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.250> our

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
gragas knife wasn't really one of our

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.850 
gragas knife wasn't really one of our
best<00:01:02.609> champions<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.350> champion<00:01:04.739> is

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
best champions but so that champion is

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.670 
best champions but so that champion is
out<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.790> Malachi<00:01:06.600> coming<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.260> really

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
out and the Malachi coming in I really

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.130 
out and the Malachi coming in I really
like<00:01:07.890> marker<00:01:08.310> because<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> old<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.990> can

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
like marker because of the old you can

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.600 
like marker because of the old you can
just<00:01:10.320> go<00:01:10.619> wherever<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.979> want<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.310> do<00:01:11.460> what

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
just go wherever you want and do what

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.870 
just go wherever you want and do what
you<00:01:11.760> want<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.830> now<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.040> Alistair<00:01:14.460> coming<00:01:14.760> in

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you want and now that Alistair coming in

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.210 
you want and now that Alistair coming in
as<00:01:15.000> well<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.509> i<00:01:15.869> think<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.500> patch<00:01:16.710> /<00:01:17.009> 0<00:01:17.040> is

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
as well so i think this patch / 0 is

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.390 
as well so i think this patch / 0 is
really<00:01:17.460> good<00:01:17.610> for<00:01:17.790> us<00:01:19.100> talking<00:01:20.100> about<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
really good for us talking about the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.730 
really good for us talking about the
games<00:01:20.580> themselves<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.750> all<00:01:22.049> three<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> them<00:01:22.590> it

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
games themselves in all three of them it

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.800 
games themselves in all three of them it
looked<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.280> were<00:01:23.430> from<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> bar<00:01:24.689> named

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
looked like you were from the bar named

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.980 
looked like you were from the bar named
big<00:01:25.049> face<00:01:25.290> do<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.070> agree<00:01:26.159> with<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.570> yeah<00:01:27.570> I

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
big face do you agree with that yeah I

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.450 
big face do you agree with that yeah I
think<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.530> did<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.009> huge<00:01:29.310> advantage

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
think we did get a huge advantage

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.130 
think we did get a huge advantage
especially<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.360> first<00:01:30.540> two<00:01:30.720> games<00:01:30.750> from

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
especially in the first two games from

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.230 
especially in the first two games from
the<00:01:31.229> band's<00:01:31.439> own<00:01:31.590> pics<00:01:31.799> looks<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:32.880> i<00:01:33.030> said<00:01:33.210> i

the band's own pics looks like i said i

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.580 
the band's own pics looks like i said i
don't<00:01:33.450> think<00:01:33.659> they<00:01:33.780> knew<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.350> they

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
don't think they knew what to do they

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.539 
don't think they knew what to do they
didn't<00:01:34.799> expect<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> bands<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.740> yeah<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:38.280> I

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
didn't expect the bands and yeah like I

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.760 
didn't expect the bands and yeah like I

these<00:02:06.659> days<00:02:07.250> I<00:02:08.599> knew<00:02:09.599> we<00:02:09.750> wouldn't<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.200> was

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
these days I knew we wouldn't I was

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.050 
these days I knew we wouldn't I was
expecting<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.950> get<00:02:11.129> him<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.430> first<00:02:11.610> game<00:02:11.819> I

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
expecting to get him in the first game I

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.490 
expecting to get him in the first game I
wasn't<00:02:12.450> sure<00:02:12.599> about<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.020> second<00:02:13.379> on<00:02:13.440> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
wasn't sure about the second on the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.820 
wasn't sure about the second on the
third

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
third

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.240 
third
but<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:15.030> thing<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:16.010> they<00:02:17.010> knew<00:02:17.220> that

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
but the thing is that they knew that

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.610 
but the thing is that they knew that
whatever<00:02:17.670> they<00:02:17.940> picked<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.300> top<00:02:18.510> lane<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:19.020> would

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
whatever they picked in top lane I would

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.240 
whatever they picked in top lane I would
have<00:02:19.740> an<00:02:19.830> answer<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:21.120> unless<00:02:22.010> they<00:02:23.010> banned

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
have an answer so unless they banned

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.860 
have an answer so unless they banned
like<00:02:23.490> she<00:02:23.730> top<00:02:23.910> lane<00:02:24.120> champions<00:02:24.570> which<00:02:24.720> they

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
like she top lane champions which they

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.600 
like she top lane champions which they
can't<00:02:25.080> do<00:02:25.200> anyway<00:02:25.500> then<00:02:25.770> they<00:02:26.250> would<00:02:26.400> have<00:02:26.430> had

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
can't do anyway then they would have had

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.190 
can't do anyway then they would have had
trouble<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.210> they<00:02:27.240> had<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.630> let<00:02:27.780> them<00:02:27.810> out<00:02:28.020> go

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
trouble so they had to let them out go

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.380 
trouble so they had to let them out go
through<00:02:28.410> because<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:29.790> was<00:02:29.940> either<00:02:30.060> play

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
through because it was either play

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.360 
through because it was either play
against<00:02:30.600> Malachi<00:02:31.050> or<00:02:31.200> play<00:02:31.590> against<00:02:31.830> nidalee

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
against Malachi or play against nidalee

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.210 
against Malachi or play against nidalee
or<00:02:32.930> eight<00:02:33.930> rooks<00:02:34.230> like<00:02:34.410> our<00:02:34.590> champions<00:02:35.100> as

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
or eight rooks like our champions as

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.180 
or eight rooks like our champions as
well<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.500> they<00:02:37.500> had<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.800> give<00:02:37.920> them<00:02:38.070> out

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
well so they had to give them out

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.210 
well so they had to give them out
carrying<00:02:38.990> so<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.260> first<00:02:40.440> game<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:41.010> played

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
carrying so the first game you played

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.530 
carrying so the first game you played
really<00:02:41.520> cautious<00:02:41.760> even<00:02:42.180> though<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:42.390> were<00:02:42.510> a

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
really cautious even though you were a

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.480 
really cautious even though you were a
hit<00:02:42.870> for<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.230> majority<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.770> game<00:02:43.950> was

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
hit for the majority of the game was

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.490 
hit for the majority of the game was
that<00:02:44.610> because<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.240> was<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.900> first<00:02:45.930> game<00:02:46.290> and

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
that because it was the first game and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.800 
that because it was the first game and
you<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:47.400> get<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> big<00:02:47.940> confidence<00:02:48.270> boost<00:02:48.660> if

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
you you get a big confidence boost if

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
you you get a big confidence boost if
you<00:02:48.930> wind<00:02:49.110> up<00:02:49.230> yeah<00:02:50.630> we<00:02:51.630> were<00:02:51.750> ahead<00:02:51.840> but<00:02:52.230> we<00:02:52.410> r

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
you wind up yeah we were ahead but we r

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.490 
you wind up yeah we were ahead but we r
a<00:02:53.190> bit<00:02:53.370> sloppy<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.970> play<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.390> we<00:02:55.080> didn't

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
a bit sloppy and a play and we didn't

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.250 
a bit sloppy and a play and we didn't
want<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.709> fry<00:02:55.890> later<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.150> had<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:58.140> was

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
want to fry later so I had that was

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.930 
want to fry later so I had that was
basically<00:02:58.440> nerves<00:02:58.980> because<00:02:59.370> we<00:02:59.790> all<00:02:59.910> know

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
basically nerves because we all know

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.030 
basically nerves because we all know
what's<00:03:00.209> on<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.390> line<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:01.020> after<00:03:01.530> we<00:03:01.800> won<00:03:01.920> the

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
what's on the line but after we won the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.150 
what's on the line but after we won the
first<00:03:02.250> game<00:03:02.459> confidential<00:03:03.450> screw<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.860> second

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
first game confidential screw the second

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.240 
first game confidential screw the second
was<00:03:05.310> really<00:03:05.550> fast<00:03:05.790> but<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.810> third<00:03:06.990> game<00:03:07.250> you

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
was really fast but the third game you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.340 
was really fast but the third game you
got<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.490> bit<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.880> problems<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.930> mid<00:03:10.170> late

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
got a bit of problems in the mid late

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.740 
got a bit of problems in the mid late
game<00:03:10.590> when<00:03:10.800> you<00:03:10.920> they<00:03:11.910> got<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.180> Baron<00:03:12.480> and

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
game when you they got the Baron and

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.600 
game when you they got the Baron and
stuff<00:03:13.020> were<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.620> worried<00:03:14.160> at<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.490> point

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
stuff were you worried at that point

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.240 
stuff were you worried at that point
that<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:15.030> might<00:03:15.180> have<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.450> play<00:03:15.600> fourth<00:03:15.840> game

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
that you might have to play fourth game

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.630 
that you might have to play fourth game
mmm<00:03:17.250> no<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:19.260> only<00:03:19.350> time<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:20.040> was<00:03:20.280> worried

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
mmm no the only time I was worried

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.979 
mmm no the only time I was worried
during<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.000> third<00:03:21.180> game<00:03:21.360> was<00:03:21.420> at<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.959> very

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
during the third game was at the very

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.680 
during the third game was at the very
start<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.650> think<00:03:22.830> we've<00:03:22.980> got<00:03:23.130> 02<00:03:23.580> down<00:03:23.790> but

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
start and I think we've got 02 down but

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.320 
start and I think we've got 02 down but
I<00:03:24.959> mean<00:03:25.739> we<00:03:26.190> threw<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.519> game<00:03:26.700> at<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.880> end<00:03:27.090> but

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
I mean we threw the game at the end but

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.300 
I mean we threw the game at the end but
they<00:03:28.019> couldn't<00:03:28.260> push<00:03:28.530> because<00:03:28.830> we<00:03:28.980> had<00:03:29.070> zigs

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
they couldn't push because we had zigs

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.610 
they couldn't push because we had zigs
and<00:03:29.550> we<00:03:30.150> had<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.330> comp<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.750> just<00:03:30.930> stool<00:03:31.440> them

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
and we had the comp to just stool them

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.470 
and we had the comp to just stool them
out<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:31.950> wait<00:03:32.370> for<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.610> Nash<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.910> go<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.360> we

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
out and wait for the Nash to go and we

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.030 
out and wait for the Nash to go and we
were<00:03:33.540> still<00:03:33.750> far<00:03:33.959> ahead<00:03:34.110> after<00:03:34.320> that<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:34.800> I

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
were still far ahead after that so I

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.979 
were still far ahead after that so I
wasn't<00:03:35.700> worried<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.300> we<00:03:36.420> have<00:03:36.600> to<00:03:36.690> go<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.870> a

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
wasn't worried that we have to go to a

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.860 
wasn't worried that we have to go to a
fourth<00:03:37.230> game<00:03:37.640> so<00:03:38.640> your<00:03:38.880> performance

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
fourth game so your performance

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.410 
fourth game so your performance
throughout<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.200> speed<00:03:40.470> wasn't<00:03:40.709> super

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
throughout the speed wasn't super

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.509 
throughout the speed wasn't super
confident<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.660> consistent<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.709> maybe<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:44.250> bit

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
confident and consistent and maybe a bit

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.759 
confident and consistent and maybe a bit
worse<00:03:44.700> than<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.090> last<00:03:45.269> bit<00:03:45.510> how<00:03:46.140> would<00:03:46.650> you

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
worse than the last bit how would you

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.540 
worse than the last bit how would you
rate<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:46.980> as<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.459> whole<00:03:48.170> hmm<00:03:49.170> yeah<00:03:49.980> we<00:03:50.190> had<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.370> lot

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
rate it as a whole hmm yeah we had a lot

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.240 
rate it as a whole hmm yeah we had a lot
of<00:03:50.580> ups<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:50.940> downs<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.920> it's<00:03:52.920> been<00:03:53.070> said

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
of ups and downs and it's been said

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.830 
of ups and downs and it's been said
before<00:03:53.430> about<00:03:53.610> our<00:03:53.910> training<00:03:54.300> we<00:03:54.450> started<00:03:54.750> to

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
before about our training we started to

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.000 
before about our training we started to
slack<00:03:55.110> so<00:03:55.500> that's<00:03:56.160> what<00:03:56.310> caused<00:03:56.550> our<00:03:56.760> down<00:03:58.010> but

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
slack so that's what caused our down but

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.979 
slack so that's what caused our down but
yeah<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.459> lot<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.000> people<00:04:00.120> started<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.750> doubt<00:04:00.959> us

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
yeah a lot of people started to doubt us

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.750 
yeah a lot of people started to doubt us
and<00:04:01.410> say<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.830> we<00:04:01.950> hit<00:04:02.130> our<00:04:02.190> skill<00:04:02.550> ceiling

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
and say that we hit our skill ceiling

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.490 
and say that we hit our skill ceiling
and<00:04:03.150> now<00:04:03.360> we're<00:04:03.510> just<00:04:03.540> going<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.840> fall<00:04:04.050> off<00:04:04.080> but

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
and now we're just going to fall off but

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.640 
and now we're just going to fall off but
I<00:04:04.769> think<00:04:05.640> we<00:04:05.820> proved<00:04:06.150> that<00:04:06.180> we're<00:04:06.570> not<00:04:06.750> that's

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
I think we proved that we're not that's

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.780 
I think we proved that we're not that's
not<00:04:07.800> going<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.010> happen<00:04:08.070> to<00:04:08.280> us<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.670> we're

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
not going to happen to us and we're

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.479 
not going to happen to us and we're
going<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:08.940> be<00:04:09.090> here<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.360> stay<00:04:09.420> so<00:04:09.870> it's<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.860> in<00:04:11.459> a

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
going to be here to stay so it's a in a

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:12.949 
going to be here to stay so it's a in a
way<00:04:11.670> it's<00:04:11.820> a<00:04:11.880> good<00:04:12.060> thing<00:04:12.209> for<00:04:12.269> us<00:04:12.480> so<00:04:12.720> we<00:04:12.840> can

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
way it's a good thing for us so we can
