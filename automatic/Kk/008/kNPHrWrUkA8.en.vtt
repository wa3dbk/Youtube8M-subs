00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.710
 the eye of the enemy stirs 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.270
 the end has come 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:22.760
 every day frodo deeper into mordor 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.450
 How do we know that foto lives? 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.450
 what does your heart have to you 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:45.840
 This is a test of each of his paths 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:51.570
 through fitness or war leads itself 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:55.400
 to this path the enemy leaves 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.400
 aragon never heard the sound of bonndorf 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:09.120
 give him the king's smoldering follow now 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:12.890
 to bring your provision I would have 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.890
 I do not want to send him away 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:22.710
 train to train move the figure he is 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.710
 here 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.250
 so it is 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.220
 In your eyes I see the fear of them 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.680
 nor could tolerate 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.490
 the day x there comes the courage of the people 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.590
 fails when we have our friends in the prick 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.150
 let and the wonder community 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.330
 But this day is not broken 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.330
 today 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.410
 knows today 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.340
 you just have to decide what to do with the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.840
 The beginning of the time is given 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.379
 we see that too 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.379
 7 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.540
 so there was the grace of immortality 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.540
 I can not protect you anymore 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.550
 can grow through strength he can 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.490
 low 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.450
 not for ourselves but so happy 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.450
 reach his goal
