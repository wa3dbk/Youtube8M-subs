00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.770 
maybe you know maybe she had like a
couple<00:02:49.519> months<00:02:49.669> in<00:02:49.939> her<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.269> she<00:02:50.389> just<00:02:50.419> wasn't

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
couple months in her and she just wasn't

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.349 
couple months in her and she just wasn't
feeling<00:02:51.230> well<00:02:51.319> that<00:02:51.470> one<00:02:51.829> day<00:02:52.069> and<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.909> could

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
feeling well that one day and I could

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.929 
feeling well that one day and I could
have<00:02:53.450> waited<00:02:53.689> I<00:02:54.370> don't<00:02:55.370> know<00:02:55.459> I'm<00:02:55.700> sure<00:02:55.909> I

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:55.939 
have waited I don't know I'm sure I

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.270 
have waited I don't know I'm sure I
couldn't<00:02:56.389> have<00:02:56.569> and<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:56.900> know<00:02:56.959> I'm<00:02:57.739> sure<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.129> was

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
couldn't have and I know I'm sure it was

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.920 
couldn't have and I know I'm sure it was
the<00:02:58.430> best<00:02:58.579> thing<00:02:58.819> especially<00:02:59.299> if<00:02:59.629> the<00:02:59.750> vet

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
the best thing especially if the vet

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
the best thing especially if the vet
said<00:03:00.200> so<00:03:00.439> but<00:03:02.109> the<00:03:03.109> guilt<00:03:03.349> is<00:03:03.530> still<00:03:03.769> really

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
said so but the guilt is still really

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.860 
said so but the guilt is still really
there<00:03:04.219> and<00:03:04.459> I<00:03:04.549> still<00:03:04.849> really<00:03:05.120> really<00:03:05.359> miss<00:03:05.659> her

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
there and I still really really miss her

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.500 
there and I still really really miss her
so<00:03:06.590> that's<00:03:06.799> I<00:03:07.040> guess<00:03:07.310> if<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:08.120> wanted<00:03:08.389> to

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
so that's I guess if I wanted to

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.349 
so that's I guess if I wanted to
complain<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:08.989> was<00:03:09.379> the<00:03:09.620> main<00:03:09.799> thing<00:03:09.829> that<00:03:10.359> I
