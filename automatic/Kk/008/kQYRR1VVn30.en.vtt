00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
then this segment we're going to learn

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.210 
then this segment we're going to learn
all<00:00:05.490> about<00:00:05.520> how<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:06.120> control<00:00:06.600> bagworms<00:00:07.220> now

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
all about how to control bagworms now

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.549 
all about how to control bagworms now
bagworms<00:00:08.760> are<00:00:09.059> generally<00:00:09.450> found<00:00:09.480> east<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
bagworms are generally found east of the

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.020 
bagworms are generally found east of the
Rocky<00:00:10.800> Mountains<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.550> they're<00:00:11.700> not<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.820> big

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
Rocky Mountains so they're not a big

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.810 
Rocky Mountains so they're not a big
problem<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.630> west<00:00:12.809> coast<00:00:12.929> luckily<00:00:13.820> but

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
problem on the west coast luckily but

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.640 
problem on the west coast luckily but
there<00:00:15.000> have<00:00:15.240> become<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> problem<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.470> East

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
there have become a problem on the East

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.130 
there have become a problem on the East
Coast<00:00:16.850> now<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.000> happens<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.690> there's<00:00:18.930> some

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
Coast now what happens is there's some

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.460 
Coast now what happens is there's some
moss<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.859> lay<00:00:20.699> their<00:00:21.300> eggs<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.900> these<00:00:22.170> bags

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
moss that lay their eggs in these bags

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.179 
moss that lay their eggs in these bags
they<00:00:22.920> look<00:00:23.100> just<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.490> silken<00:00:24.029> bag<00:00:24.330> and

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
they look just like a silken bag and

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.880 
they look just like a silken bag and
they<00:00:26.189> hang<00:00:26.490> from<00:00:26.519> pine<00:00:27.090> trees<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.619> when

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
they hang from pine trees and so when

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.880 
they hang from pine trees and so when
you<00:00:28.980> look<00:00:29.130> at<00:00:29.310> them<00:00:29.340> they<00:00:29.460> look<00:00:29.640> just<00:00:30.359> like

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
you look at them they look just like

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.440 
you look at them they look just like
little<00:00:31.890> bags<00:00:32.160> hanging<00:00:32.730> from<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.120> tree<00:00:33.270> and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
little bags hanging from a tree and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.120 
little bags hanging from a tree and
you're<00:00:33.510> wondering<00:00:33.690> what<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.469> well

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
you're wondering what is that well

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.160 
you're wondering what is that well
inside<00:00:35.520> those<00:00:35.760> bags<00:00:36.030> there's<00:00:36.450> thousands<00:00:37.020> of

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
inside those bags there's thousands of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.240 
inside those bags there's thousands of
little<00:00:37.350> legs<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.730> when<00:00:39.210> they<00:00:39.239> hatch<00:00:39.690> they

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
little legs and so when they hatch they

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.190 
little legs and so when they hatch they
make<00:00:41.250> these<00:00:41.460> little<00:00:41.579> larvae<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.450> get<00:00:42.960> all

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
make these little larvae that get all

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.650 
make these little larvae that get all
over<00:00:43.230> your<00:00:43.649> trees<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.579> eat<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.329> needles

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
over your trees and eat all the needles

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.560 
over your trees and eat all the needles
and<00:00:45.960> into<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.620> wood<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.120> it'll<00:00:48.120> do<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> lot<00:00:48.539> of

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
and into the wood and it'll do a lot of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.600 
and into the wood and it'll do a lot of
damage<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:49.079> your<00:00:49.110> trees<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.219> there's<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.489> few

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
damage on your trees so there's a few

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.819 
damage on your trees so there's a few
ways<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.780> control<00:00:52.140> them<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
ways that you can control them so the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.380 
ways that you can control them so the
first<00:00:53.039> thing<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.520> should<00:00:53.550> do<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.149> always

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
first thing that you should do is always

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.689 
first thing that you should do is always
rake<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.930> all<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.649> your<00:00:55.770> pine<00:00:56.039> cones<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.520> your

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
rake up all of your pine cones in your

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.420 
rake up all of your pine cones in your
leaves<00:00:56.879> under<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.390> trees<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.079> when<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.190> looks

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
leaves under the trees and when it looks

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.490 
leaves under the trees and when it looks
like<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> pine<00:01:00.030> cone<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.660> tree<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.199> might

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
like a pine cone in the tree it might

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.439 
like a pine cone in the tree it might
actually<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> bag<00:01:02.640> worm<00:01:02.879> because<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.270> look

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
actually be a bag worm because they look

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.840 
actually be a bag worm because they look
just<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.719> pant<00:01:04.049> at<00:01:04.409> pine<00:01:04.769> cones<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.670> whenever

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
just like pant at pine cones so whenever

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.640 
just like pant at pine cones so whenever
you<00:01:06.119> find<00:01:06.360> them<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> fall<00:01:07.049> pull<00:01:07.470> them<00:01:07.619> down

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
you find them in the fall pull them down

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.800 
you find them in the fall pull them down
and<00:01:08.189> get<00:01:08.310> rid<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> them<00:01:08.760> physically<00:01:09.299> that's

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
and get rid of them physically that's

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.899 
and get rid of them physically that's
the<00:01:09.990> first<00:01:10.200> thing<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.619> should<00:01:10.650> do<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.760> in

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the first thing that you should do so in

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.539 
the first thing that you should do so in
early<00:01:12.299> spring<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:13.290> caterpillars<00:01:14.040> hatch<00:01:14.280> out

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
early spring the caterpillars hatch out

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.510 
early spring the caterpillars hatch out
of<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> bags<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.380> at<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.799> time<00:01:17.159> that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
of the bags so it is at that time that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.240 
of the bags so it is at that time that
you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.759> try<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> control<00:01:18.540> them<00:01:18.780> chemically

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
you can try to control them chemically

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.640 
you can try to control them chemically
so<00:01:20.250> there's<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.580> spray<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.570> use<00:01:22.229> and

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
so there's a spray that you can use and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.399 
so there's a spray that you can use and
it's<00:01:22.890> called<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.340> bacillus<00:01:23.939> thuringiensis

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
it's called the bacillus thuringiensis

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.990 
it's called the bacillus thuringiensis
and<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.860> an<00:01:26.009> organic<00:01:26.159> control<00:01:26.820> for

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
and it's an organic control for

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.330 
and it's an organic control for
caterpillars<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.110> spray<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.159> whole

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
caterpillars and you spray the whole

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.640 
caterpillars and you spray the whole
tree<00:01:29.670> down<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:30.119> early<00:01:30.390> spring<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:31.500> you

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
tree down in early spring because you

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.649 
tree down in early spring because you
can't<00:01:31.860> really<00:01:32.130> kill<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.759> larvae<00:01:33.180> until

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
can't really kill the larvae until

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.140 
can't really kill the larvae until
they've<00:01:33.869> hatched<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.490> want<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.000> make<00:01:36.030> sure

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
they've hatched so you want to make sure

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.539 
they've hatched so you want to make sure
and<00:01:36.689> spraying<00:01:37.229> as<00:01:37.530> soon<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:38.009> come<00:01:38.189> out<00:01:38.250> of

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
and spraying as soon as they come out of

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.020 
and spraying as soon as they come out of
their<00:01:38.759> little<00:01:39.090> bags<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.369> BTW<00:01:41.369> as<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.880> also

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
their little bags and BTW as it's also

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.630 
their little bags and BTW as it's also
known<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.689> safe<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.409> animals<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.460> also

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
known is safe to animals but it also

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.700 
known is safe to animals but it also
kills<00:01:44.970> all<00:01:45.299> types<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.810> caterpillars<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.560> it'll

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
kills all types of caterpillars so it'll
