00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
classes at ICP and other places so this

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.320 
classes at ICP and other places so this
was<00:01:46.390> really<00:01:46.770> hard<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:47.890> start<00:01:48.399> I<00:01:48.729> would<00:01:48.850> say<00:01:49.210> at

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
was really hard to start I would say at

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.310 
was really hard to start I would say at
my<00:01:49.450> photographic<00:01:49.960> career

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.550 

I<00:01:55.270> think<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.540> reason<00:01:57.080> I<00:01:57.170> became<00:01:57.380> a

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
I think the reason I became a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.530 
I think the reason I became a
photographer<00:01:57.800> I<00:01:58.340> think<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.760> reason<00:01:59.030> probably

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
photographer I think the reason probably

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.110 
photographer I think the reason probably
why<00:01:59.630> most<00:01:59.900> photographers<00:02:00.550> get<00:02:01.550> into<00:02:01.970> this

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
why most photographers get into this

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.810 
why most photographers get into this
profession<00:02:02.420> is<00:02:02.930> in<00:02:03.170> foreign<00:02:03.890> people<00:02:04.280> or<00:02:04.430> tell

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
profession is in foreign people or tell

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.870 
profession is in foreign people or tell
stories<00:02:05.030> about<00:02:06.280> trouble<00:02:07.280> places<00:02:07.670> in<00:02:07.790> the
