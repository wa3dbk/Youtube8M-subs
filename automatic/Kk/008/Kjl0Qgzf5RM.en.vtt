00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.869 
the top in the bottom of the figure
eight<00:00:40.170> that's<00:00:41.129> where<00:00:41.399> we're<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.640> pass

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
eight that's where we're going to pass

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.970 
eight that's where we're going to pass
our<00:00:42.090> double<00:00:42.390> line<00:00:42.540> through<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.680> want<00:00:43.890> to

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
our double line through and we want to

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.700 
our double line through and we want to
be<00:00:44.070> sure<00:00:44.280> when<00:00:44.520> those<00:00:44.700> two<00:00:45.059> loops<00:00:45.660> flatten<00:00:46.559> out

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
be sure when those two loops flatten out

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.290 
be sure when those two loops flatten out
that<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.190> double<00:00:47.489> line<00:00:47.640> passes<00:00:48.120> straight

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
that the double line passes straight

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.229 
that the double line passes straight
through<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.780> figure<00:00:49.079> eight<00:00:50.120> next<00:00:51.120> we're

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
through the figure eight next we're

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.680 
through the figure eight next we're
going<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.390> take<00:00:53.000> our<00:00:54.000> class<00:00:54.270> Tippett<00:00:54.660> and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
going to take our class Tippett and

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.770 
going to take our class Tippett and
we're<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> double<00:00:55.260> over<00:00:56.480> eighteen<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
we're going to double over eighteen to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.020 
we're going to double over eighteen to
twenty-four<00:00:58.469> inches<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.789> we've<00:00:59.910> got

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
twenty-four inches of that so we've got

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.930 
twenty-four inches of that so we've got
plenty<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.449> work<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:02.670> we're<00:01:02.789> going<00:01:02.910> to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
plenty to work with and we're going to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.119 
plenty to work with and we're going to
pass<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.390> through<00:01:03.420> top<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.710> figure<00:01:04.860> eight

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
figure eight I want to pull about 10 to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.070 
figure eight I want to pull about 10 to
12<00:01:14.610> inches<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.060> double<00:01:15.450> line<00:01:15.630> through<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
12 inches of double line through the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.260 
12 inches of double line through the
figure<00:01:16.380> eight<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.770> we've<00:01:16.920> got<00:01:17.130> again<00:01:17.880> plenty

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
figure eight so we've got again plenty

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.810 
figure eight so we've got again plenty
of<00:01:18.360> double<00:01:18.689> line<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.960> work<00:01:19.110> with<00:01:19.580> next<00:01:20.580> we're

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
of double line to work with next we're

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.330 
of double line to work with next we're
going<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.970> lubricate<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.740> figure<00:01:22.740> eight<00:01:22.890> knot

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.050 

and<00:01:26.340> we're<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.000> take<00:01:27.270> our<00:01:27.450> pliers<00:01:29.060> and

them between the double line and the
shock<00:01:43.909> to<00:01:44.909> hold<00:01:45.119> open<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.479> gap<00:01:45.689> while<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.110> make

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
shock to hold open a gap while we make

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.520 
shock to hold open a gap while we make
our<00:01:46.320> wraps<00:01:46.770> we're<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.790> wrap<00:01:48.000> down

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
our wraps we're going to wrap down

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.200 
our wraps we're going to wrap down
around<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.710> shock<00:01:49.920> tip<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.369> four<00:01:50.640> times<00:01:50.880> with

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.359 
around the shock tip it four times with
the<00:01:51.299> double<00:01:51.570> line<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.020> then<00:01:52.710> back<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:53.130> over

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the double line and then back up over

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.300 
the double line and then back up over
itself<00:01:53.909> three<00:01:54.329> more<00:01:54.509> times<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.110> pass<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.159> end

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
itself three more times and pass the end

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.249 
itself three more times and pass the end
of<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> double<00:01:56.670> line<00:01:56.939> through<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.270> gap<00:01:57.450> so

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
of the double line through the gap so

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:05.160 
of the double line through the gap so
let's<00:01:58.409> go<00:01:58.530> ahead<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.799> do<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.899> one<00:02:01.310> two<00:02:03.170> three

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
let's go ahead and do that one two three

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.109 
let's go ahead and do that one two three
four<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.430> then<00:02:06.580> back<00:02:06.790> up<00:02:06.820> three<00:02:07.240> times<00:02:07.410> one
