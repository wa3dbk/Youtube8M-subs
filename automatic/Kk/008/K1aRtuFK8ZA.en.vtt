00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.100
Hello! Welcome to Archana's Kitchen.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.600
This is the ideal season for green leafy
vegetables.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.100
Only the elders in the family eat leafy
greens. The kids hate them.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.600
A mother somehow finds tricks to feed her
child with some leafy greens.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.100
So today I shall teach you to make
Radish paratha.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.600
So stay tuned to Archana's Kitchen.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.300
Let's see the ingredients needed to make
Radish paratha.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.000
Water for kneading the dough.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.500
Wheat flour as much as required.
Radish leaves finely chopped.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.700
4 - 5 chopped green chillies.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.200
2 - 3 tablespoons of oil.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.700
Grated Radish.
Salt to taste.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.200
Shall we start cooking?

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.400
Take a cup of wheat flour.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Add the chopped radish leaves to it.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.200
Now add 2 - 3 green chillies.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If not chopped, you may crush or grind
them as per your liking.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.100
A grated radish.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.200
Salt to taste.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.200
1 - 2 tablespoons of oil.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.700
Mix all the ingredients well.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.100
We need to try and see if we can knead the
dough with the moisture of grated radish.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Add water only if needed.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.500
I don't think it will be needed.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Add minimal water if needed.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600
The dough is kneaded properly now.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We need to make balls out of it.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.500
Then we shall roll flat breads out of them.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.500
Let's make the balls of the dough.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200
Make the balls slightly big in size.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.700
Let's give it a slightly different shape.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We're going to give it a slightly
different shape.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The balls are ready and now we cal roll them.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.500
Meanwhile, we will keep the pan for
heating.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.500
We have kept the dough-balls ready. We'll roll
all of them one by one and then roast them.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Dip in dry flour and then roll them
into a triangular shape.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.600
Apply some oil.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.100
Dip in the fine flour after applying
the oil.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Make a triangle of it.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.600
Roll it into a triangle.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.100
Parathas are always made bit thick.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.600
However do ensure that it doesn't remain
raw after cooking.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.200
Roll all the parathas in the same manner.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.600
The pan is heating up and we can now fry
all the parathas one by one.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.100
We will use oil a bit generously.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200
Fry all of them.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.700
We've rolled them a bit thick as parathas
are always made thick.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.000
Apply oil on the top.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.100
Turn it to the other side.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.200
Apply some oil on this side too.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.400
Fry properly on both sides.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.200
The paratha should be nice and crispy.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The parathas are ready. We can take them
off the pan.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.100
Hot and fresh Radish parathas are ready.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.900
Now all mothers and kids need not 
worry at all, isn't it?
