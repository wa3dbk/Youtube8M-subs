00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120

little rip that happens in all these
cars<00:00:11.480> for<00:00:11.900> some<00:00:12.110> reason<00:00:12.560> I<00:00:12.740> don't<00:00:12.860> know<00:00:13.010> why

but I guess just the wear and tear of
getting<00:00:15.620> in<00:00:15.710> and<00:00:15.860> out<00:00:15.980> just<00:00:16.010> you<00:00:16.519> just<00:00:16.699> rub<00:00:16.910> up

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
hole so I also noticed as I'm looking

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.070 
hole so I also noticed as I'm looking
I've<00:02:07.759> got<00:02:07.969> another<00:02:08.209> little<00:02:08.300> hole<00:02:08.660> here

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
I've got another little hole here

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.690 
I've got another little hole here
starting<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:10.120> you<00:02:11.120> can<00:02:11.420> see<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:12.620> metal<00:02:12.920> here

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
starting and you can see the metal here

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.180 
starting and you can see the metal here
and<00:02:14.050> just<00:02:15.050> really<00:02:15.290> starting<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.650> thin<00:02:15.800> out<00:02:15.950> so

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
and just really starting to thin out so

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.410 
and just really starting to thin out so
it<00:02:16.280> won't<00:02:16.430> be<00:02:16.550> long<00:02:16.730> before<00:02:16.880> we're<00:02:17.180> doing<00:02:17.240> the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
it won't be long before we're doing the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.630 
it won't be long before we're doing the
same<00:02:17.630> thing<00:02:17.690> that<00:02:18.050> we're<00:02:18.200> doing<00:02:18.230> here

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
same thing that we're doing here

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.220 
same thing that we're doing here
probably<00:02:19.640> here<00:02:19.880> what<00:02:20.540> I'd<00:02:20.630> really<00:02:20.870> like<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:21.140> do

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
probably here what I'd really like to do

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.600 
probably here what I'd really like to do
to<00:02:21.319> these<00:02:21.440> seats<00:02:21.739> is<00:02:21.890> take<00:02:22.069> it<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.280> someone<00:02:22.520> who

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
to these seats is take it to someone who

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.309 
to these seats is take it to someone who
can<00:02:22.730> really<00:02:22.910> upholsterer<00:02:23.660> very<00:02:23.870> well<00:02:24.080> and

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
can really upholsterer very well and

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.800 
can really upholsterer very well and
separate<00:02:25.310> this<00:02:25.520> fabric<00:02:25.970> from<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:26.270> black<00:02:26.480> and

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
separate this fabric from this black and

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.589 
separate this fabric from this black and
then<00:02:27.580> replace<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:28.760> black<00:02:29.030> fabric<00:02:29.300> with

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
then replace this black fabric with

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.850 
then replace this black fabric with
something<00:02:29.870> else<00:02:29.989> black<00:02:30.350> or<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:30.770> know

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
something else black or you know

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.990 
something else black or you know
something<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.220> looks<00:02:31.489> comparable

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
something that looks comparable

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.840 
something that looks comparable
something<00:02:32.720> maybe<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.959> little<00:02:33.020> more<00:02:33.290> sturdier

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
something maybe a little more sturdier

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.250 
something maybe a little more sturdier
and<00:02:34.850> then<00:02:35.360> just<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.690> know<00:02:35.720> like<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.140> said

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
and then just you know like I said

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.010 
and then just you know like I said
stitch<00:02:36.680> this<00:02:37.310> middle<00:02:37.700> design<00:02:38.030> straight<00:02:38.870> to

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
stitch this middle design straight to

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.840 
stitch this middle design straight to
that<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.500> don't<00:02:39.920> see<00:02:40.069> why<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:40.280> couldn't<00:02:40.519> be<00:02:40.640> done

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
that I don't see why it couldn't be done

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.640 
that I don't see why it couldn't be done
if<00:02:41.630> somebody<00:02:41.900> knows<00:02:42.080> what<00:02:42.200> they're<00:02:42.260> doing

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
if somebody knows what they're doing

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.800 
if somebody knows what they're doing
it'll<00:02:43.069> look<00:02:43.220> pretty<00:02:43.880> much<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.120> same<00:02:44.239> I<00:02:44.660> think

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
it'll look pretty much the same I think

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.570 
it'll look pretty much the same I think
the<00:02:44.959> closest<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.560> can<00:02:45.620> get<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:45.860> authentic<00:02:46.430> the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
the closest you can get to authentic the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.600 
the closest you can get to authentic the
best<00:02:46.819> so<00:02:47.720> let's<00:02:48.140> see<00:02:48.380> how<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.560> idea<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.430> what

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
best so let's see how the idea so what

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.380 
best so let's see how the idea so what
it<00:02:49.700> looks<00:02:49.850> like<00:02:49.940> we're<00:02:50.060> going<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.209> go<00:02:50.330> ahead

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
it looks like we're going to go ahead

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.699 
it looks like we're going to go ahead
and<00:02:50.569> end<00:02:50.690> up<00:02:50.780> doing<00:02:51.019> is<00:02:51.140> just<00:02:51.260> taking<00:02:51.410> this

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
and end up doing is just taking this

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.059 
and end up doing is just taking this
sponge<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:53.630> just<00:02:54.350> kind<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:54.560> placing<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.010> in

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
sponge and just kind of placing it in

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.789 
sponge and just kind of placing it in
here<00:02:55.280> as<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.610> can<00:02:55.670> see<00:02:55.790> I<00:02:55.910> can<00:02:56.150> move<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.420> seat

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
here as you can see I can move the seat

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.080 
here as you can see I can move the seat
kind<00:02:57.799> of<00:02:57.950> however<00:02:58.130> I<00:02:58.340> need<00:02:58.519> to<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:58.880> I<00:02:58.910> can

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
kind of however I need to so I can

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.000 
kind of however I need to so I can
actually<00:02:59.239> place<00:02:59.660> this<00:03:00.489> something<00:03:01.489> like<00:03:01.519> this

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
actually place this something like this

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.440 
actually place this something like this
alright<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.190> then<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.519> can<00:03:04.700> probably<00:03:04.850> stop<00:03:05.299> it

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
alright and then I can probably stop it

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.240 
alright and then I can probably stop it
over<00:03:05.830> just<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:06.920> kind<00:03:07.100> of<00:03:07.160> fill<00:03:07.850> like<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:08.959> said

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
over just to kind of fill like I said

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.199 
over just to kind of fill like I said
and<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:10.370> create<00:03:10.730> some<00:03:11.000> type<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.410> cushion<00:03:12.410> there

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
and I create some type of cushion there

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.789 
and I create some type of cushion there
and<00:03:14.209> I'll<00:03:14.510> be<00:03:14.690> able<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.900> place<00:03:15.049> our<00:03:15.230> patch<00:03:15.500> in

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.569 
actually see it right there yeah it's
round<00:03:33.109> one<00:03:33.430> two<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:34.850> three<00:03:35.690> here<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:37.250> I<00:03:37.280> guess

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
round one two and three here so I guess

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.550 
round one two and three here so I guess
it<00:03:37.730> doesn't<00:03:37.850> look<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.090> best<00:03:38.239> but<00:03:38.810> the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
it doesn't look the best but the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.259 
it doesn't look the best but the
temporary<00:03:40.010> fix<00:03:40.340> at<00:03:40.489> least<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:40.850> your<00:03:41.090> seat

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
temporary fix at least so your seat

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:42.160 
temporary fix at least so your seat
doesn't<00:03:41.420> tear<00:03:41.660> anymore

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
doesn't tear anymore

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.960 
doesn't tear anymore
it's<00:03:42.530> kind<00:03:42.739> of<00:03:42.829> stuff<00:03:43.160> it<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.430> then<00:03:43.640> just<00:03:43.820> you

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
it's kind of stuff it and then just you

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.479 
it's kind of stuff it and then just you
know<00:03:44.000> patch<00:03:44.239> it<00:03:44.450> so<00:03:45.350> how<00:03:45.950> we're<00:03:46.160> doing<00:03:46.370> right

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489
