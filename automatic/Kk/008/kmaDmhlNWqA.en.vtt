00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.400
 here 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.289
 that is the team is well we wanted 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.630
 win and sometimes we can confuse an 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.270
 little but the point is valid for either 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.340
 we are very important not to lose anymore 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.610
 that we are when the low zone already today 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.220
 lose meant 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.180
 much much worse for us 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.250
 emotionally and for what comes like this is 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.170
 that the draw is not bad we are not 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.480
 conformists but this draw is going to 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.240
 Serve a lot to continue working in 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.300
 the week and so the next tournament 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.580
 come on let's remember this point 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.780
 that we have rescued we are playing very 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.460
 matter the rival that comes because 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.080
 after america we have another 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.360
 match with you is important and this 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.060
 mistakes can can they kill us like this 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.620
 is that with the equalizer rescued by the 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.970
 effort of colleagues who have 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.870
 come from behind too and they have 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.150
 tried hard but if the mistakes we 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.370
 they can cost a lot and we have to be 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.650
 with much more attention to the definition 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.440
 sometimes we keep making mistakes 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.659
 that cost us a lot and in the end the 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.509
 team does not go by the arms 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.829
 we managed to add a very important point 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:22.560
 if it's something that I say has happened in 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:25.880
 many parties we have not committed that 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.880
 kinds of mistakes cost us goals 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.250
 it's something we should focus on 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.340
 a lot with many remaining matches 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.610
 well I think we witnessed that a 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.080
 change today we do not achieve things that we do not today 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.230
 we had achieved in previous matches 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.570
 as in the 3 annotations in a match 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.120
 it had been hard to score goals today 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.440
 we had substitute goals too 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.440
 ability to react 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.950
 in adverse situations then not 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.950
 we can get out of there 2
