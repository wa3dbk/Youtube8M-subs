00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
just turn around look at all that green

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.820 
just turn around look at all that green
right<00:01:54.369> here<00:01:54.400> see<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:54.880> if<00:01:55.410> Austin<00:01:56.410> just<00:01:56.500> turns

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
right here see that if Austin just turns

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.650 
right here see that if Austin just turns
around<00:01:57.660> right<00:01:58.660> there<00:01:58.899> we<00:01:59.170> got<00:01:59.350> it<00:01:59.560> I<00:01:59.770> mean<00:02:00.100> why

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
around right there we got it I mean why

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.090 
around right there we got it I mean why
try<00:02:01.660> to<00:02:01.690> go<00:02:01.929> back<00:02:02.080> to<00:02:02.259> that<00:02:02.289> corner<00:02:02.770> when<00:02:03.009> you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
try to go back to that corner when you

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.380 
try to go back to that corner when you
can<00:02:03.220> just<00:02:03.250> still<00:02:03.580> right<00:02:03.700> here<00:02:03.729> but<00:02:04.000> either<00:02:04.149> way

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
can just still right here but either way

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.240 
can just still right here but either way
either<00:02:04.899> way<00:02:05.050> works<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:05.590> I<00:02:05.649> guess<00:02:05.860> when<00:02:06.130> I'm

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
either way works and I guess when I'm

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.380 
either way works and I guess when I'm
was<00:02:06.369> thinking<00:02:06.640> one<00:02:06.789> thing<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.000> one<00:02:07.149> of<00:02:07.270> them

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
was thinking one thing and one of them

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.970 
was thinking one thing and one of them
to<00:02:07.539> take<00:02:07.690> an<00:02:07.780> elder<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:09.750> boom<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.680> that's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
to take an elder and boom and that's

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.490 
to take an elder and boom and that's
what<00:02:12.130> happens<00:02:13.170> look<00:02:14.170> at<00:02:14.260> after<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:16.780> see

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
what happens look at after that like see

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:27.080 
what happens look at after that like see
my<00:02:17.920> knee<00:02:18.130> just<00:02:18.160> now<00:02:18.430> turn<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.700> around<00:02:18.910> oh<00:02:25.620> wow

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
turned around on one plane I think as a
