00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:05.120
 surfing and we see it from here I would like to teach a product that is 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.250
 somewhat unusual in the world of radio because it is a product without 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.559
 worth for which the product 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.919
 Well, the typical one manufactured in China and brought large quantities 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:21.409
 matters little bigger when everyone sleeps when he participated in the cup 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.160
 It is true that we are seeing a carpet for a month 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.939
 a driver's mat all this is a competition 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:32.540
 luminous 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.190
 with a budget of 1 point 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.160
 monarchs also tour that made its triple-double with well remarked that the pp 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.400
 and mayor with port was headquarters 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.470
 then we can comment on things like a keyboard from the field itself 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.180
 no matter what the rest, keep in mind that having a 1-point bone 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.370
 1 the transmission speeds are very small 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.810
 therefore there is no need that makes mourning more interesting 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.710
 already referred that they have 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.580
 I have heard 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.190
 of the kind 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.120
 A) Yes 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.440
 sando group 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.750
 I remember a little bit of the freeways was particularly saving the distances 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.320
 iii below what we see is a green surface of oppression 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.520
 hedegaard that came out of power 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.930
 then almost any surface 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.600
 apart burgos as we have said nesta el javo s / 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.890
 Four ports nicknames how to connect with the viewer 2 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.659
 He argued that purging as the case may be must take into account that as 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.300
 I was externally powered 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.780
 well this only a very limited power the 800 while more or less 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.590
 therefore with Muscovite bodies apparatuses that do not consume 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.420
 too much energy 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.420
 we are already the devices that consume more reliable 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.940
 The most likely thing is that they do not work 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.570
 no one can happen this more or less than October there is not much more to say 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.010
 on its side a very economical device 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.979
 and yes he will question how he concludes being safe xliii nothing else 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.519
 when we meet with local time 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:18.749
 so said this is all 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:22.109
 and you see how as headquarters at night 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.719
 Filomena young crisis having the sector 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:27.459
 by the way
