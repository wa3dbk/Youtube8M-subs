00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:08.740
 Hello 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:12.050
 I have an old cabinet got a load with 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.570
 rusanovskaya apartment 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.330
 on Rusanovka very high humidity 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.680
 air therefore 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.680
 varnish and sprinkled 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.609
 block this cabinet is a problem 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.730
 polish with conventional means 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.660
 useless 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.660
 sorry to throw out 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.470
 try to restore shine to the old 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:42.090
 in the old-fashioned way we will need 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:45.770
 a little beeswax for impregnation 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.770
 and building hair dryer 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.250
 hair dryer, we warm up the surface 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.070
 Here are pepalo absorbed in warmed 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.070
 greece 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.710
 here the main thing is not to overheat the clouds we 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.710
 finally take away 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.320
 one version we love so much 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.030
 Now you need to take a rag and 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.030
 grow uniformly rarely throughout the kitchen 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.660
 now take a napkin and rub up 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.660
 brilliance 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.390
 the cabinet floor is perfect 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:09.010
 there is a difference 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.920
 also very steep processed 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:32.780
 wardrobe as good as new and no unpleasant 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:32.780
 smells thank you all for your attention
