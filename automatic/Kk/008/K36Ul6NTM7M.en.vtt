you<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.680> locking<00:00:44.160> set<00:00:44.399> feature<00:00:44.670> well

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
you have a locking set feature well

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.479 
you have a locking set feature well
let's<00:00:45.390> say<00:00:45.600> if<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.469> see<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> 2<00:00:46.950> D<00:00:47.100> that

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
let's say if you can see the 2 D that

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.619 
let's say if you can see the 2 D that
means<00:00:47.550> dog<00:00:47.940> 2<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.289> see<00:00:49.379> dog<00:00:49.710> 1<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.700> at

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
means dog 2 and you can see dog 1 is at

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.560 
means dog 2 and you can see dog 1 is at
25<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.610> you<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.820> switch<00:00:54.030> back<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.329> forth

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
25 and you can switch back and forth

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.470 
25 and you can switch back and forth
between<00:00:54.960> dogs<00:00:55.500> 1<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.550> 2<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.910> there<00:00:57.390> are

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
between dogs 1 and 2 and there are

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.510 
between dogs 1 and 2 and there are
different<00:00:57.809> simulation<00:00:58.469> levels<00:00:58.770> no<00:00:59.250> all<00:00:59.370> there

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
different simulation levels no all there

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.610 
different simulation levels no all there

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
of can do that now with the Einstein

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.320 
of can do that now with the Einstein
ikana<00:01:05.070> it's<00:01:05.250> called<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> locking<00:01:05.880> set

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
ikana it's called a locking set

ikana it's called a locking set
let's<00:01:07.049> say<00:01:07.260> my<00:01:07.500> dog<00:01:07.710> number<00:01:08.040> 2<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.820> super

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
let's say my dog number 2 is super

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.030 
let's say my dog number 2 is super
sensitive<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.619> I'm<00:01:10.920> gonna<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:11.520> 10<00:01:11.960> now

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
sensitive so I'm gonna have it at 10 now

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.800 
sensitive so I'm gonna have it at 10 now
I'm<00:01:14.040> gonna<00:01:14.340> lock<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.610> push<00:01:15.060> by<00:01:15.270> pushing<00:01:15.509> this

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
I'm gonna lock it push by pushing this

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.179 
I'm gonna lock it push by pushing this
top<00:01:16.110> button<00:01:16.350> down<00:01:16.619> my<00:01:17.310> row<00:01:17.790> 2<00:01:17.850> stat<00:01:18.119> dial<00:01:18.390> down

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
now it's locked I can you know roll that

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.490 
now it's locked I can you know roll that
back<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.700> forth<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.600> won't<00:01:24.750> go<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.409> won't
