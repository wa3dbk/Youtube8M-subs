00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.450 
shoots will form and like I said you can
do<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.300> for<00:02:12.660> over<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.050> year<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:14.010> keep<00:02:14.190> it's<00:02:14.370> a

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
do this for over a year just keep it's a

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.390 
do this for over a year just keep it's a
very<00:02:14.640> small<00:02:14.970> part<00:02:15.270> I'm<00:02:16.050> very<00:02:16.110> big<00:02:16.530> at<00:02:16.650> all<00:02:16.770> you

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
very small part I'm very big at all you

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.490 
very small part I'm very big at all you
can<00:02:17.580> do<00:02:17.700> them<00:02:17.820> bigger<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.420> wouldn't<00:02:19.260> go<00:02:19.350> any

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
can do them bigger I wouldn't go any

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.430 
can do them bigger I wouldn't go any
smaller<00:02:19.620> than<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:20.760> size<00:02:21.060> pot<00:02:21.480> which<00:02:22.320> is

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
smaller than this size pot which is

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.140 
smaller than this size pot which is
probably<00:02:22.710> about<00:02:22.830> our<00:02:23.010> 12<00:02:23.940> inch<00:02:24.090> pot<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:25.860> is

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
probably about our 12 inch pot this is

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.190 
probably about our 12 inch pot this is
let's<00:02:27.150> see<00:02:27.980> 2<00:02:28.980> 4<00:02:29.459> 6<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:30.030> get<00:02:30.150> about<00:02:30.330> 6<00:02:30.959> in<00:02:31.140> a

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
let's see 2 4 6 you get about 6 in a

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.880 
let's see 2 4 6 you get about 6 in a
bunch<00:02:32.180> this<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.360> about<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.600> bunch<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:34.260> put<00:02:34.709> in

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
bunch this is about a bunch I put in

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.970 
bunch this is about a bunch I put in
this<00:02:35.130> one<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:35.520> have<00:02:35.760> some<00:02:35.970> other<00:02:36.120> pots<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:37.560> bigger

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
this one I have some other pots a bigger

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.400 
this one I have some other pots a bigger
pot<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.610> can<00:02:38.760> put<00:02:38.910> 2<00:02:39.060> bunches<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.290> know

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
pot you can put 2 bunches just you know

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.150 
pot you can put 2 bunches just you know
however<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.160> see<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.239> I'll<00:02:42.830> give<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.950> pause
