00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.849 
today I'm going to be talking a little
bit<00:00:13.830> about<00:00:14.210> cataract<00:00:15.210> surgery<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.049> glaucoma

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
bit about cataract surgery and glaucoma

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.779 
bit about cataract surgery and glaucoma
and<00:00:17.930> many<00:00:18.930> patients<00:00:19.199> have<00:00:19.560> glaucoma<00:00:19.890> but<00:00:20.640> then

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
and many patients have glaucoma but then

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.460 
and many patients have glaucoma but then
develop<00:00:21.240> cataracts<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:22.020> all<00:00:22.140> there's<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> lot

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
develop cataracts and all there's a lot

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.620 
develop cataracts and all there's a lot
of<00:00:22.500> questions<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.010> come<00:00:23.340> up<00:00:23.369> about<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.269> ok

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
of questions that come up about is it ok

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.330 
of questions that come up about is it ok
to<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:24.900> cataract<00:00:25.410> surgery<00:00:25.830> if<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.160> have

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
to have cataract surgery if you have

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.120 
to have cataract surgery if you have
glaucoma<00:00:26.810> the<00:00:27.810> answer<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.439> question<00:00:28.710> is

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
glaucoma the answer to that question is

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.820 
glaucoma the answer to that question is
an<00:00:29.369> undeniable<00:00:29.699> yes<00:00:30.410> cataract<00:00:31.410> surgery

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
an undeniable yes cataract surgery

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.630 
an undeniable yes cataract surgery
actually<00:00:32.550> helps<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.149> coma<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.809> many<00:00:34.200> times<00:00:34.640> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
actually helps a coma and many times the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.330 
actually helps a coma and many times the
cataract<00:00:36.210> itself<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.140> cause<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
cataract itself is the cause of the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.880 
cataract itself is the cause of the
glaucoma<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.780> we're<00:00:40.020> finding<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.620> when<00:00:40.800> we

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
glaucoma so we're finding that when we

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.619 
glaucoma so we're finding that when we
take<00:00:41.100> out<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> cataract<00:00:41.879> than<00:00:42.059> someone<00:00:42.360> who<00:00:42.450> has

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
take out a cataract than someone who has

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.660 
take out a cataract than someone who has
glaucoma<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.440> pressure<00:00:43.710> sometimes<00:00:44.160> comes

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
glaucoma the pressure sometimes comes

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.279 
glaucoma the pressure sometimes comes
down<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.090> its<00:00:45.270> own<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.629> by<00:00:45.899> getting<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
down on its own just by getting the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.100 
down on its own just by getting the
cataract<00:00:46.770> out<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.250> people<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.329> go<00:00:48.539> off<00:00:48.809> of

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
cataract out and people can go off of

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.250 
cataract out and people can go off of
their<00:00:49.320> drops<00:00:49.940> at<00:00:50.940> least<00:00:51.300> one<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.750> them<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.110> not

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
their drops at least one of them is not

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.709 
their drops at least one of them is not
all<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.739> them<00:00:52.890> after<00:00:53.219> cataract<00:00:54.000> surgery<00:00:54.420> just

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
all of them after cataract surgery just

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.619 
all of them after cataract surgery just
by<00:00:54.899> getting<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.289> cataract<00:00:55.710> surgery<00:00:56.129> done<00:00:56.629> so

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
by getting the cataract surgery done so

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.110 
by getting the cataract surgery done so
that's<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.870> very<00:00:58.050> important<00:00:58.469> feature<00:00:58.820> got<00:00:59.820> coma

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
that's a very important feature got coma

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.760 
that's a very important feature got coma
does<00:01:00.390> not<00:01:00.570> make<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> cataract<00:01:01.289> surgery<00:01:01.620> any

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
does not make the cataract surgery any

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.680 
does not make the cataract surgery any
harder<00:01:02.219> if<00:01:02.760> someone<00:01:03.120> wants<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.420> get<00:01:03.539> their

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
harder if someone wants to get their

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.570 
harder if someone wants to get their
stigmatism<00:01:04.260> corrected<00:01:04.860> they<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.129> still<00:01:05.430> do

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
stigmatism corrected they can still do

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.480 
stigmatism corrected they can still do
that<00:01:05.610> even<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.240> they<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.659> glaucoma<00:01:07.170> if<00:01:07.770> they

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
that even if they have glaucoma if they

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.789 
that even if they have glaucoma if they
want<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.760> get<00:01:08.850> laser<00:01:09.090> cataract<00:01:09.600> surgery<00:01:10.049> most

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
want to get laser cataract surgery most

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.770 
want to get laser cataract surgery most
of<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.070> time<00:01:11.280> that's<00:01:11.549> okay<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.180> well<00:01:12.420> unless

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
of the time that's okay as well unless

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.780 
of the time that's okay as well unless
it's<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> very<00:01:13.350> very<00:01:13.439> severe<00:01:14.159> advanced<00:01:14.490> black

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it's a very very severe advanced black

it's a very very severe advanced black
hole<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.530> addition<00:01:16.530> sometimes<00:01:17.130> people<00:01:18.000> have

there's<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.310> new<00:01:20.490> procedure<00:01:20.850> we're<00:01:21.150> doing<00:01:21.390> now

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
there's a new procedure we're doing now

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.410 
there's a new procedure we're doing now
where<00:01:22.380> we<00:01:22.500> put<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.130> little<00:01:23.460> drainage<00:01:23.909> device

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
where we put in a little drainage device

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.450 
where we put in a little drainage device
very<00:01:24.900> quickly<00:01:25.259> right<00:01:25.830> at<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> end<00:01:26.310> of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
very quickly right at the end of

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.850 
very quickly right at the end of
cataract<00:01:26.939> surgery<00:01:27.420> which<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:27.990> another<00:01:28.530> way<00:01:28.829> to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
cataract surgery which is another way to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.200 
cataract surgery which is another way to
reduce<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.759> need<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.920> drops<00:01:31.920> after<00:01:32.369> cataract

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
reduce the need for drops after cataract

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.060 
reduce the need for drops after cataract
surgery<00:01:33.540> meaning<00:01:33.689> glaucoma<00:01:34.229> drops<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
surgery meaning glaucoma drops and

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.630 
surgery meaning glaucoma drops and
that's<00:01:35.490> called<00:01:35.820> mix<00:01:36.210> its<00:01:36.570> micro<00:01:37.200> invasive<00:01:38.040> la

calma surgery using these tiny little
non-invasive<00:01:43.220> drains<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.970> put<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
non-invasive drains that you put in the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.170 
non-invasive drains that you put in the
angle<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.040> drain<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.820> eye<00:01:47.850> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
angle of the I the drain of the eye that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.960 
angle of the I the drain of the eye that
helps<00:01:48.509> fluid<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.049> out<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.470> faster<00:01:50.130> and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
helps fluid get out of the I faster and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
helps fluid get out of the I faster and
we're<00:01:51.090> doing<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.360> right<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> end<00:01:51.930> of

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
we're doing that right at the end of

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.340 
we're doing that right at the end of
cataract<00:01:52.320> surgery<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.740> might<00:01:52.890> take<00:01:53.070> them

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
cataract surgery it might take them

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.940 
cataract surgery it might take them
too<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:54.570> cataract<00:01:55.570> surgery<00:01:56.110> in<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.680> face<00:01:56.920> of

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
too so cataract surgery in the face of

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.820 
too so cataract surgery in the face of
glaucoma<00:01:57.729> is<00:01:58.119> a<00:01:58.299> good<00:01:58.630> thing<00:01:58.869> cataract

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
glaucoma is a good thing cataract

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.280 
glaucoma is a good thing cataract
surgery<00:02:00.250> is<00:02:00.460> many<00:02:00.909> times<00:02:01.060> good<00:02:01.780> for<00:02:02.080> someone

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
surgery is many times good for someone

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.440
