00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
to do this in football there was too

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.910 
to do this in football there was too
much<00:00:35.579> talent<00:00:35.969> falling<00:00:36.899> out<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.380> game<00:00:37.590> I

felt<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.850> wanted<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.180> do<00:00:39.300> something<00:00:39.329> about<00:00:39.629> that

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
which i think is worked out quite well

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.520 
which i think is worked out quite well
so<00:03:35.820> far<00:03:36.000> for<00:03:36.660> me<00:03:36.810> it's<00:03:36.989> still<00:03:37.200> about<00:03:37.380> the

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
so far for me it's still about the

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.930 
so far for me it's still about the
development<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.220> players<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.579> I've<00:03:38.760> got

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
development of the players and I've got

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.849 
development of the players and I've got
to<00:03:39.030> make<00:03:39.150> sure<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.720> Academy<00:03:40.200> comes
