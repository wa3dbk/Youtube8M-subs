00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
mass airflow sensor is you see this plug

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.980 
mass airflow sensor is you see this plug
right<00:03:11.410> here<00:03:11.970> when<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.060> take<00:03:13.270> this<00:03:13.420> out<00:03:13.690> the

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
when your mass airflow sensor is dirty

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.050 
when your mass airflow sensor is dirty
but<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.850> guy<00:03:31.000> told<00:03:31.240> me<00:03:31.450> that<00:03:31.740> this<00:03:32.740> was<00:03:33.100> open

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
and it's filled all over and it probably

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.880 
and it's filled all over and it probably
went<00:03:37.630> on<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.930> inside<00:03:38.260> if<00:03:38.410> you<00:03:38.500> can<00:03:38.680> notice

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
went on the inside if you can notice

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.430 
went on the inside if you can notice
it's<00:03:39.220> kind<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.520> wet<00:03:39.760> around<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:41.110> so<00:03:41.260> maybe

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
it's kind of wet around it so maybe

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.910 
it's kind of wet around it so maybe
someone<00:03:41.830> I<00:03:41.920> got<00:03:42.130> down<00:03:42.340> is<00:03:42.550> inside<00:03:42.970> of<00:03:43.120> it<00:03:43.920> all

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
someone I got down is inside of it all

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.280 
someone I got down is inside of it all
right<00:03:45.070> so<00:03:45.400> that's<00:03:45.490> the
