nice soft cushiony part right around the
iPad<00:00:31.040> okay<00:00:32.329> we're<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.540> set<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.870> down

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930

for a moment and then we've got this
apart<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:38.210> comes<00:00:39.210> apart<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:40.910> so<00:00:42.230> then<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
apart it comes apart like so then the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.430 
apart it comes apart like so then the
two<00:00:43.559> halves<00:00:43.829> separate<00:00:47.420> iPad<00:00:48.420> with<00:00:49.050> all<00:00:49.289> its

cushioning<00:00:49.920> now<00:00:50.449> goes<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:52.340> believe<00:00:54.800> right<00:00:55.800> here

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
cushioning now goes I believe right here

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.549 
cushioning now goes I believe right here
let's<00:00:56.730> try<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.210> way

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.570 

now<00:01:01.160> we<00:01:01.640> have<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.059> front<00:01:02.539> part<00:01:02.629> here<00:01:03.580> make

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
now we have the front part here make

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.140 
now we have the front part here make
sure<00:01:04.610> this<00:01:05.000> is<00:01:05.210> going<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.659> correct<00:01:05.960> way<00:01:06.170> -<00:01:06.229> I

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
sure this is going the correct way - I

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.460 
sure this is going the correct way - I
think<00:01:08.150> this<00:01:08.299> is<00:01:08.450> correct

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:30.340 

Beauty<00:01:16.700> now<00:01:17.700> these<00:01:18.000> edges<00:01:18.840> go<00:01:19.020> on

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.410 

there<00:01:30.920> we<00:01:31.100> go

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
there we go

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.560 
there we go
now<00:01:32.990> we<00:01:33.050> have<00:01:33.409> four<00:01:33.710> holes<00:01:33.920> here<00:01:34.640> well<00:01:35.420> that

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
now we have four holes here well that

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.399 
now we have four holes here well that
lends<00:01:35.900> to<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:38.479> screws<00:01:38.870> that<00:01:39.110> would<00:01:39.229> normally

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
lends to the screws that would normally

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.590 
lends to the screws that would normally
be<00:01:39.680> in<00:01:39.830> here<00:01:40.280> are<00:01:40.640> fairly<00:01:41.060> small<00:01:42.159> and<00:01:43.600> those

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
be in here are fairly small and those

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.920 
be in here are fairly small and those
would<00:01:44.780> normally<00:01:45.290> go<00:01:45.470> into<00:01:45.680> these<00:01:45.950> holes<00:01:46.220> now

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
would normally go into these holes now

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.980 
would normally go into these holes now
to<00:01:47.930> make<00:01:48.140> this<00:01:48.320> thing<00:01:48.619> very<00:01:49.280> secure<00:01:49.820> but<00:01:50.810> we've

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
to make this thing very secure but we've

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.859 
to make this thing very secure but we've
done<00:01:51.259> here<00:01:51.530> because<00:01:51.710> we<00:01:52.070> have<00:01:52.220> holes<00:01:52.570> as<00:01:53.570> we've

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
done here because we have holes as we've

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.560 
done here because we have holes as we've
been<00:01:54.050> able<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.350> take<00:01:54.590> these<00:01:54.860> very<00:01:55.550> strong<00:01:55.940> key

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
rings and put these into the holes to

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.190 
rings and put these into the holes to
give<00:02:02.210> ourselves<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:03.080> nice<00:02:03.530> good<00:02:04.509> place<00:02:05.509> to<00:02:05.930> clip

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
give ourselves a nice good place to clip

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.779 
give ourselves a nice good place to clip
now<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:07.000> rubbish<00:02:08.000> trap<00:02:08.239> situation<00:02:09.550> it's<00:02:10.550> almost

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
now a rubbish trap situation it's almost

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.520 
now a rubbish trap situation it's almost
like<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.120> was<00:02:11.150> meant<00:02:11.510> just<00:02:11.840> for<00:02:12.050> our<00:02:12.170> special

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
like it was meant just for our special

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.830
