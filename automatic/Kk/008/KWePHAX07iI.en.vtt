00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
notice there's a lock and unlock go

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.590 
notice there's a lock and unlock go
ahead<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:47.970> spin<00:00:48.420> your<00:00:48.600> your<00:00:48.870> blade<00:00:49.140> on

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
ahead and spin your your blade on

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.870 
ahead and spin your your blade on
trailing<00:00:51.600> edge<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.930> always<00:00:52.170> tightening

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
trailing edge is always tightening

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.700 
trailing edge is always tightening
leading<00:00:53.880> edge<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.180> always<00:00:54.420> loosening<00:00:55.140> so

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
leading edge is always loosening so

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.200 
leading edge is always loosening so
we're<00:00:55.890> gonna<00:00:56.010> spin<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.520> until<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
we're gonna spin it on until it

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.350 
we're gonna spin it on until it
basically<00:00:57.420> hits<00:00:58.200> the<00:00:58.470> rubber<00:00:58.820> o-ring<00:00:59.820> you'll

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
basically hits the rubber o-ring you'll

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.209 
basically hits the rubber o-ring you'll
then<00:01:00.540> grab<00:01:00.780> your<00:01:00.989> prop<00:01:01.200> installation<00:01:01.980> tool

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
slide it on and give it a full turn to a

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.960 
slide it on and give it a full turn to a
turn<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.159> half<00:01:08.870> and<00:01:10.430> that<00:01:11.430> will<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.700> fully

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
turn and a half and that will be fully

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.770 
turn and a half and that will be fully
installed<00:01:12.770> we<00:01:13.770> repeat<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.700> process<00:01:15.090> for<00:01:15.390> B

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
installed we repeat this process for B

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.469 
installed we repeat this process for B
just<00:01:16.409> know<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.220> spins<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.000> opposite

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
just know be it spins in the opposite
