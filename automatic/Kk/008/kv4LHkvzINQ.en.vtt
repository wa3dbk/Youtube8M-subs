on<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.170> far<00:00:56.409> side<00:00:56.710> of<00:00:56.739> it

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
on the far side of it

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.100 
on the far side of it
all<00:00:59.120> these<00:00:59.360> rocks<00:01:00.640> cool<00:01:01.640> I<00:01:02.030> think<00:01:02.630> the<00:01:02.900> pool

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
all these rocks cool I think the pool

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.200 
all these rocks cool I think the pool
always<00:01:03.530> fishes<00:01:03.920> best<00:01:04.250> when<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:05.300> water<00:01:05.540> is

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
always fishes best when the water is

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.970 
always fishes best when the water is
slightly<00:01:08.210> lower<00:01:08.570> than<00:01:08.870> that<00:01:09.170> rocks<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:09.740> if<00:01:09.890> you

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
slightly lower than that rocks so if you

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.980 
slightly lower than that rocks so if you
can<00:01:10.160> see<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:10.520> rocks<00:01:10.760> they're<00:01:11.150> not<00:01:11.390> quite<00:01:11.690> good

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
can see the rocks they're not quite good

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.920 
can see the rocks they're not quite good
here<00:01:13.120> to<00:01:14.120> the<00:01:14.240> neck<00:01:14.480> to<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:14.780> pool<00:01:16.570> close<00:01:17.570> over

here to the neck to the pool close over

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.540 
here to the neck to the pool close over
because<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.200> pools<00:01:18.440> access<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.160> phosphate

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
because the pools access the phosphate

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.090 
because the pools access the phosphate
the<00:01:19.670> pools<00:01:19.880> accessed<00:01:20.360> from<00:01:20.570> this<00:01:20.810> Bank<00:01:21.110> and
