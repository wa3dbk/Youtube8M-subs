hopefully it'll get better soon but as

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.780 
hopefully it'll get better soon but as
of<00:01:06.570> now<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.780> sucks<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.549> next<00:01:08.580> question

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
of now it sucks so the next question

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.429 
of now it sucks so the next question
comes<00:01:09.409> from<00:01:10.409> dlk<00:01:11.060> 6232<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.450> they<00:01:12.630> asked<00:01:12.840> fruit

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
comes from dlk 6232 and they asked fruit

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.620 
comes from dlk 6232 and they asked fruit
loops<00:01:13.710> or<00:01:13.920> frost<00:01:14.189> flakes<00:01:14.460> fruit<00:01:15.270> loops<00:01:15.479> all

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
loops or frost flakes fruit loops all

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.270 
loops or frost flakes fruit loops all
the<00:01:15.750> way<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.900> love<00:01:16.290> fruit<00:01:16.530> loops<00:01:16.770> I'd<00:01:16.950> eat<00:01:17.070> them

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the way I love fruit loops I'd eat them

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.950 
the way I love fruit loops I'd eat them
more<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.030> feel<00:01:18.540> like<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.810> eat

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
more but I feel like you have to eat

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.080 
more but I feel like you have to eat
them<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.290> fast<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.340> they're<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
them so fast because if they're in the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.240 
them so fast because if they're in the
milk<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.540> more<00:01:21.750> than<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.320> couple<00:01:22.950> minutes

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
milk for more than like a couple minutes

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
milk for more than like a couple minutes
they<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:23.549> super<00:01:24.000> soggy<00:01:24.330> well<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.200> guess<00:01:25.350> that's

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
they get super soggy well I guess that's

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.109 
they get super soggy well I guess that's
with<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.619> cereal<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.189> especially<00:01:26.430> fruit

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
with all cereal but especially fruit

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.310 
with all cereal but especially fruit
loops<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:27.869> reason<00:01:27.960> i<00:01:28.110> don't<00:01:28.170> like

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
loops and that's one reason i don't like

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.080 
loops and that's one reason i don't like
them<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:28.619> definitely<00:01:29.159> over<00:01:29.430> frosted<00:01:29.850> flakes

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
them but definitely over frosted flakes

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.749 
them but definitely over frosted flakes
so<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:31.020> next<00:01:31.140> question<00:01:31.259> comes<00:01:31.590> from<00:01:32.009> tallinn

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
so the next question comes from tallinn

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.550 
so the next question comes from tallinn
i<00:01:32.790> believe<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.450> they<00:01:33.540> asked<00:01:33.689> what<00:01:34.290> do<00:01:34.439> you

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
i believe and they asked what do you

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.289 
i believe and they asked what do you
want<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:34.920> when<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.100> were<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.340> kid<00:01:35.430> I've

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
want to be when you were a kid I've

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.760 
want to be when you were a kid I've
actually<00:01:36.600> always<00:01:37.020> wanted<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> lawyer

gonna<00:05:11.680> feel<00:05:12.010> if<00:05:12.070> you<00:05:12.460> don't<00:05:12.790> you<00:05:13.000> know<00:05:13.120> like

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
gonna feel if you don't you know like

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.560 
gonna feel if you don't you know like
you<00:05:13.690> passed<00:05:14.020> up<00:05:14.320> five<00:05:14.790> hundred<00:05:15.790> thousand

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.050 
you passed up five hundred thousand
dollars<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:17.230> feel<00:05:17.500> like<00:05:17.680> going<00:05:18.610> for<00:05:18.790> the<00:05:18.850> fifty

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
dollars I feel like going for the fifty

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.690 
dollars I feel like going for the fifty
percent<00:05:19.630> chance<00:05:19.900> is<00:05:20.290> almost<00:05:20.710> greedy<00:05:21.310> in<00:05:21.550> my

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
percent chance is almost greedy in my

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.520 
percent chance is almost greedy in my
opinion<00:05:22.030> because<00:05:22.330> it's<00:05:22.600> like<00:05:22.750> you<00:05:23.140> can<00:05:23.350> have

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
opinion because it's like you can have

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.310 
opinion because it's like you can have
500,000<00:05:24.430> but<00:05:24.730> i'd<00:05:25.150> rather<00:05:25.210> have<00:05:25.630> double<00:05:26.170> that

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
500,000 but i'd rather have double that

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.140 
500,000 but i'd rather have double that
and<00:05:26.440> maybe<00:05:26.680> not<00:05:26.980> win<00:05:27.190> you<00:05:27.430> know<00:05:27.520> i<00:05:27.550> feel<00:05:27.790> like<00:05:27.970> i

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
and maybe not win you know i feel like i

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.240 
and maybe not win you know i feel like i
would<00:05:28.570> just<00:05:28.780> take<00:05:28.990> the<00:05:29.110> 500,000<00:05:29.950> cut<00:05:30.100> my

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250

crazy so i would definitely have to go
five<00:05:41.950> hundred<00:05:42.250> thousand<00:05:42.610> but<00:05:42.700> that's<00:05:42.820> a

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
five hundred thousand but that's a

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.640 
five hundred thousand but that's a

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
you do would you rather have the 500,000

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.310 
you do would you rather have the 500,000
instantly<00:05:48.250> or<00:05:48.550> the<00:05:49.000> fifty<00:05:49.390> percent<00:05:49.660> chance<00:05:49.990> of

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
instantly or the fifty percent chance of

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.460 
instantly or the fifty percent chance of
winning<00:05:50.890> 1<00:05:51.520> million<00:05:52.060> dollars<00:05:52.330> which<00:05:52.360> yeah<00:05:52.750> it

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
winning 1 million dollars which yeah it

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.890 
winning 1 million dollars which yeah it
is<00:05:53.590> a<00:05:53.620> big<00:05:53.890> difference<00:05:54.100> in<00:05:54.520> a<00:05:55.360> million<00:05:55.630> dollars

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
is a big difference in a million dollars

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.090 
is a big difference in a million dollars
is<00:05:55.960> amazing<00:05:56.350> but<00:05:56.470> still<00:05:56.740> I<00:05:56.770> think<00:05:56.890> I'd

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
is amazing but still I think I'd

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.250 
is amazing but still I think I'd
probably<00:05:57.310> have<00:05:57.670> to<00:05:57.850> go<00:05:57.940> with<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.150> 500,000<00:05:58.990> so

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
probably have to go with the 500,000 so
