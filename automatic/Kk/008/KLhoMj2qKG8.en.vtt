 have problems 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.510
 of my classmates' bullying 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.570
 towards me because it was fundamental to say 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.740
 that directly that I was weird is 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.299
 crazy I was ugly I was fat the 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.190
 continued abuse of other children 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.020
 they made nuria's self - esteem 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.460
 fell to the ground to the degree of

 begin to cause damage to the body 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.770
 I was so prostrate so desperate that 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.680
 I did not find a way out I felt fat 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.330
 and I could not be thin and I felt bad 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.000
 to be treated by the media that was 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.060
 using to make thin and not 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.850
 achieve that because the frustration was such 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.090
 that I hurt myself with knives and with 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.500
 crystals according to the

 bullying and a lot of having problems of 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.130
 school level but mainly 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.130
 so much for the differences there are of 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.390
 likes that is the case of society 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.770
 tends to attack we say the elements 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.330
 that is shown closed that has to have 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.280
 resistance versus what is different 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.560
 also with children 50 in something that does not 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.480

 good and there to see in this case a 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.020
 difference of tastes that will generate 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.810

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.560
 designed to detect the greatest number

 possible of gifted children in agreement 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.080

 he has studied and defined the 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.680
 major criticisms these children true 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.080
 it's your first time present in 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.540
 hyperactivity and also that tend to 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.310
 Easily distract this activity 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.530
 this distraction really occurs when 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.940
 the child is bored but that many 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.410
 sometimes gets confused with what they are 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.330
 children with deficit disorder 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.130
 attention and hyperactivity but the 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.200
 difference between a child with tdh and a 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.750
 level with overcapacity is that when 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.460
 is this case about voting the child but 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.500
 if you get distracted and bored but if you 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.300
 presented something of interest that is that 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.130
 this disappears those children are concentrated 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.350
 and they do not present any problem in that 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.790
 case of hyperactivity or of so much 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.950
 coast tension learning something that you 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.300
 interest 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.580
 the investigations that Andrew has 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.500
 carried out determine that in Mexico there 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.930
 more than 3 million people with high

 wrongly with deficit disorder 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.020
