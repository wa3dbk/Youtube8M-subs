actually was from my Marineland tank
that<00:00:51.270> i<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.480> no<00:00:51.630> longer<00:00:51.660> use<00:00:52.200> because<00:00:52.739> I

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
that i can no longer use because I

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.310 
that i can no longer use because I
cracked<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.570> but<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> light<00:00:54.809> still<00:00:55.110> works

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
cracked it but the light still works

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.150 
cracked it but the light still works
perfectly<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.870> it<00:00:57.870> has<00:00:58.020> 12<00:00:58.320> LEDs<00:00:58.800> which<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
perfectly and it has 12 LEDs which is a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.680 
perfectly and it has 12 LEDs which is a
lot<00:00:59.280> better<00:00:59.430> than<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> data<00:01:00.239> light<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> was

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
lot better than the data light I was

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.900 
lot better than the data light I was
using<00:01:00.840> before<00:01:00.989> which<00:01:01.410> only<00:01:01.830> had<00:01:02.040> 5<00:01:02.280> LEDs<00:01:02.699> so

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
using before which only had 5 LEDs so

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.660 
using before which only had 5 LEDs so
there's<00:01:03.090> lights<00:01:03.269> the<00:01:03.449> tank<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:04.019> lot<00:01:04.320> better

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:16.260 

and<00:01:08.670> i'm<00:01:08.759> still<00:01:08.970> using<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.509> a<00:01:09.540> zune<00:01:09.869> filter

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.660 

and<00:01:16.869> this<00:01:16.990> is<00:01:17.109> more<00:01:17.259> of<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.500> decorative<00:01:18.429> look

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
and this is more of a decorative look

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.639 
and this is more of a decorative look
compared<00:01:19.179> to<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.390> natural<00:01:20.380> look<00:01:20.439> ahead

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
compared to the natural look ahead

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:21.810 
compared to the natural look ahead
before<00:01:20.740> so<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:21.159> thought<00:01:21.310> I'd<00:01:21.429> just<00:01:21.460> try<00:01:21.759> this

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820
