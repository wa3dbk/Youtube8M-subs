that<00:00:19.150> was<00:00:19.300> on<00:00:19.480> top<00:00:19.720> of<00:00:19.750> this<00:00:20.050> thing<00:00:20.400> at<00:00:21.400> least

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
that was on top of this thing at least

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.090 
that was on top of this thing at least
we<00:00:21.880> thought<00:00:22.119> we<00:00:22.330> were<00:00:22.570> but<00:00:22.960> I<00:00:23.199> sucked<00:00:23.770> too<00:00:23.920> much

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
we thought we were but I sucked too much

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.519 
we thought we were but I sucked too much
at<00:00:24.220> the<00:00:24.340> game<00:00:24.550> too<00:00:24.850> actually<00:00:25.840> this<00:00:25.930> jump<00:00:26.199> is<00:00:26.320> a

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
at the game too actually this jump is a

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.500 
at the game too actually this jump is a
little<00:00:26.949> hard<00:00:27.310> to<00:00:27.520> make<00:00:27.970> to<00:00:28.630> be<00:00:28.779> honest<00:00:29.170> I<00:00:30.510> think

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
little hard to make to be honest I think

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.279 
little hard to make to be honest I think
the<00:00:31.570> distance<00:00:32.020> did<00:00:32.259> a<00:00:32.289> bit<00:00:32.500> too<00:00:32.680> far<00:00:34.109> but<00:00:35.109> there

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:35.289 
the distance did a bit too far but there

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.329

thing
it's<00:03:19.360> going<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.750> fill<00:03:19.930> up<00:03:20.080> with<00:03:20.260> dark<00:03:20.530> eco

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
it's going to fill up with dark eco

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.970 
it's going to fill up with dark eco
which<00:03:21.100> you<00:03:21.370> know<00:03:21.520> isn't<00:03:21.790> night<00:03:22.360> well<00:03:22.660> for<00:03:23.020> us<00:03:23.050> I

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.040 

don't<00:03:26.980> like<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.280> camera<00:03:27.700> angle<00:03:27.790> Adam<00:03:28.360> all<00:03:28.600> in

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
don't like the camera angle Adam all in

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.400 
don't like the camera angle Adam all in
this<00:03:29.260> part<00:03:30.090> because<00:03:31.090> as<00:03:31.270> you<00:03:31.420> can<00:03:31.450> see<00:03:31.600> I<00:03:32.020> can't

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
this part because as you can see I can't

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.500 
this part because as you can see I can't
see<00:03:32.530> what<00:03:32.860> I'm<00:03:32.950> doing<00:03:32.980> it's<00:03:33.790> more<00:03:34.000> focused<00:03:34.390> on

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
see what I'm doing it's more focused on

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.690 
see what I'm doing it's more focused on
the<00:03:34.600> dark<00:03:34.780> eco<00:03:35.140> so<00:03:35.830> that<00:03:36.010> makes<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.310> just<00:03:36.370> so

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
the dark eco so that makes it just so

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.190 
the dark eco so that makes it just so
much<00:03:36.850> more<00:03:37.090> difficult<00:03:37.270> because<00:03:37.660> you<00:03:37.930> can't

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
much more difficult because you can't

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.200 
much more difficult because you can't
see<00:03:38.410> where<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:38.710> are<00:03:38.740> until<00:03:39.520> you're<00:03:39.790> already

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
see where you are until you're already

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.970 
see where you are until you're already
dead<00:03:41.880> there<00:03:42.880> we<00:03:43.030> go<00:03:43.440> now<00:03:44.440> we<00:03:44.500> just<00:03:44.620> need<00:03:44.830> to

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
dead there we go now we just need to

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.250 
dead there we go now we just need to
continue<00:03:45.460> going<00:03:45.640> up<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.000> spiral<00:03:46.300> this<00:03:46.990> seems

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
continue going up the spiral this seems

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.420 
continue going up the spiral this seems
like<00:03:47.500> it'll<00:03:47.680> never<00:03:47.980> end<00:03:49.980> till<00:03:50.980> we<00:03:51.070> get<00:03:51.190> another

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
like it'll never end till we get another

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.420 
like it'll never end till we get another

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
burst of blue eco and do our final jump

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.340 
burst of blue eco and do our final jump
out<00:03:54.640> of<00:03:54.820> here<00:03:55.090> ok<00:03:55.630> maybe<00:03:56.200> not<00:03:57.810> good<00:03:58.810> just
