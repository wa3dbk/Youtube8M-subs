smartphone so Tim tell us a little bit

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.150 
smartphone so Tim tell us a little bit
about<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.750> differences<00:00:13.110> between<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.500> c7<00:00:14.040> and

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
about the differences between the c7 and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.779 
about the differences between the c7 and
the<00:00:14.790> n8<00:00:15.619> well<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.650> think<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.949> most<00:00:17.340> important

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
the n8 well I think the most important

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.150 
the n8 well I think the most important
things<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.090> stretch<00:00:18.330> really<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.560> c7

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
things a stretch really is that the c7

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.370 
things a stretch really is that the c7
and<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.609> na<00:00:20.880> both<00:00:21.300> have<00:00:21.600> exactly<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.320> same

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
and the na both have exactly the same

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.769 
and the na both have exactly the same
Hardware<00:00:23.070> engine<00:00:23.460> it's<00:00:24.000> exactly<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.630> same

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
Hardware engine it's exactly the same

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.349 
Hardware engine it's exactly the same
processor<00:00:25.500> that's<00:00:25.949> powering<00:00:26.279> both<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.240> we

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
processor that's powering both so we

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.540 
processor that's powering both so we
have<00:00:27.510> all<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.930> same<00:00:28.109> UI<00:00:28.439> capabilities<00:00:29.340> all

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
have all the same UI capabilities all

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.389 
have all the same UI capabilities all
the<00:00:29.670> same<00:00:29.910> same<00:00:30.630> processing<00:00:31.289> abilities<00:00:31.710> on

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the same same processing abilities on

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.729 
the same same processing abilities on
both<00:00:32.880> devices<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.780> real<00:00:33.960> differences<00:00:34.500> come

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
both devices the real differences come

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.780 
both devices the real differences come
from

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
from

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.080 
from
the<00:00:36.050> peripherals<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.110> are<00:00:37.260> attached<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.190> in

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the peripherals that are attached so in

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.600 
the peripherals that are attached so in
this<00:00:39.420> case<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:40.470> the<00:00:40.590> c7<00:00:41.100> we've<00:00:41.250> got<00:00:41.400> eight

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
this case on the c7 we've got eight

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.820 
this case on the c7 we've got eight
gigabytes<00:00:42.060> of<00:00:42.210> internal<00:00:42.360> memory<00:00:42.830> compared

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
gigabytes of internal memory compared

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.730 
gigabytes of internal memory compared
with<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.190> 16<00:00:44.580> gigabytes<00:00:45.060> on<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.290> n8

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
with the 16 gigabytes on the on the n8

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.180 
with the 16 gigabytes on the on the n8
the<00:00:47.610> c7<00:00:48.240> has<00:00:48.360> got<00:00:48.510> an<00:00:48.630> eight<00:00:48.930> megapixel<00:00:49.410> full

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the c7 has got an eight megapixel full

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.840 
the c7 has got an eight megapixel full
focus<00:00:50.430> camera<00:00:51.140> whereas<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.350> n8<00:00:52.830> comes<00:00:53.489> with

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
focus camera whereas the n8 comes with

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.140 
focus camera whereas the n8 comes with
the<00:00:54.030> carl<00:00:54.450> zeiss<00:00:54.660> 12<00:00:55.350> megapixel<00:00:55.890> autofocus

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
the carl zeiss 12 megapixel autofocus

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.820 
the carl zeiss 12 megapixel autofocus
camera<00:00:57.150> and<00:00:57.570> then<00:00:58.110> probably<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> other

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
camera and then probably the other

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.610 
camera and then probably the other
biggest<00:00:59.220> difference<00:00:59.580> really<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.970> that<00:01:00.330> the<00:01:00.620> c7

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
biggest difference really is that the c7

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
biggest difference really is that the c7
had<00:01:02.430> an<00:01:02.640> analog<00:01:03.120> TV<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.290> whereas<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.949> n8

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
had an analog TV out whereas the n8

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.270 
had an analog TV out whereas the n8
comes<00:01:06.330> with<00:01:06.660> the<00:01:06.810> hdmi<00:01:07.170> digital<00:01:10.160> photos<00:01:11.160> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
comes with the hdmi digital photos of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.859 
comes with the hdmi digital photos of
power<00:01:11.460> you're<00:01:11.729> talking<00:01:12.270> more<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:12.509> less<00:01:12.660> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
power you're talking more or less the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.660 
power you're talking more or less the
same<00:01:12.900> sort<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.590> aerial<00:01:14.130> they're<00:01:14.310> exactly

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
same sort of a aerial they're exactly

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.370 
same sort of a aerial they're exactly
the<00:01:14.850> same<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.210> terms<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.810> MIPS<00:01:16.050> and<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the same in terms of the MIPS and the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.280 
the same in terms of the MIPS and the
number-crunching<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:19.020> that's

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
number-crunching and so on that that's

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.400 
number-crunching and so on that that's
all<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.560> same<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.369> when<00:01:20.550> we're<00:01:20.729> rendering

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
all the same so so when we're rendering

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.010 
all the same so so when we're rendering
HD<00:01:22.410> for<00:01:22.680> example<00:01:23.100> 720p<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:24.300> being<00:01:24.600> rented<00:01:24.780> by

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
HD for example 720p it's being rented by

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.930 
HD for example 720p it's being rented by
exactly<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> same<00:01:25.740> engine<00:01:26.160> on<00:01:26.280> both<00:01:26.729> devices

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
exactly the same engine on both devices

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.800 
exactly the same engine on both devices
we<00:01:27.840> also<00:01:28.020> get<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.440> same<00:01:28.680> same<00:01:29.160> capability

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
we also get the same same capability

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.749 
we also get the same same capability
just<00:01:32.740> have<00:01:32.860> a<00:01:32.890> look<00:01:33.040> sir<00:01:33.220> if<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.369> start<00:01:33.640> the

exactly<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.150> same<00:01:51.360> performance<00:01:51.750> will<00:01:52.470> be

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
exactly the same performance will be

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.840 
exactly the same performance will be
experienced<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.370> the<00:01:53.400> n8<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.660> all<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
experienced on the n8 so all the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.870 
experienced on the n8 so all the
processing<00:01:56.850> that's<00:01:57.030> doing<00:01:57.330> that

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.200
