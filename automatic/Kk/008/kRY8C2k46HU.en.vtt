architecture and they're basically the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.709 
architecture and they're basically the

together<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.189> there's<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.369> bunch<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.580> cool

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
together and there's a bunch of cool

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.130 
together and there's a bunch of cool
ways<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.060> kind<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.330> connects<00:01:18.630> more<00:01:18.810> people

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
ways this kind of connects more people

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.780 
ways this kind of connects more people
and<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.500> pretty<00:01:19.710> cool<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.130> way<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.340> even

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
and it's pretty cool in that way so even

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.070 
and it's pretty cool in that way so even
though<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> Windows<00:01:21.299> 10<00:01:21.360> edition<00:01:21.780> isn't<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
though the Windows 10 edition isn't the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.359 
though the Windows 10 edition isn't the
most<00:01:22.229> played<00:01:22.500> edition<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.920> world<00:01:23.159> it's

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
most played edition in the world it's

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.649 
most played edition in the world it's
still<00:01:23.610> nice<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.180> starts<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
still nice that this starts the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.179 
still nice that this starts the
cross-platform<00:01:24.990> thing<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:25.860> it's

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
cross-platform thing and I think it's

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.800 
cross-platform thing and I think it's
gonna<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.490> their<00:01:26.729> way<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> actually<00:01:27.299> test<00:01:27.600> how

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
gonna be their way to actually test how

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.450 
gonna be their way to actually test how
this<00:01:27.960> whole<00:01:28.170> thing<00:01:28.380> works<00:01:28.590> because<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.189> know

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
this whole thing works because you know

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.890 
this whole thing works because you know
having<00:01:29.729> people<00:01:29.880> different<00:01:30.299> machines<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.750> is

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
having people different machines it is

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.179 
having people different machines it is
something<00:01:31.229> that's<00:01:31.350> possible<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.070> to

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
something that's possible to have to

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.800 
something that's possible to have to
Frost<00:01:32.430> play<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:32.939> there<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.180> still<00:01:33.329> some<00:01:33.630> weird

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
Frost play but there is still some weird

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.240 
Frost play but there is still some weird
ways<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.079> exactly<00:01:34.409> how<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.590> works<00:01:34.799> anyway<00:01:35.189> so

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
ways in exactly how that works anyway so

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.399 
ways in exactly how that works anyway so
after<00:01:36.119> they<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.600> for<00:01:36.840> hoping<00:01:37.140> running

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
after they have that for hoping running

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.319 
after they have that for hoping running
up<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.159> running<00:01:38.220> their<00:01:38.549> next<00:01:39.000> move<00:01:39.180> is

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
up and up and running their next move is

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.359 
up and up and running their next move is
actually<00:01:39.509> they<00:01:39.840> mentioned<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.350> bring<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> 360

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
actually they mentioned to bring the 360

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.609 
actually they mentioned to bring the 360
and<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> one<00:01:41.970> players<00:01:42.329> into<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:42.960> fold<00:01:43.380> so

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
and the one players into the fold so

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.380 
and the one players into the fold so
like<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.280> mentioned<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.729> was<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> Microsoft

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
like I mentioned this was a Microsoft

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.789 
like I mentioned this was a Microsoft
press<00:01:45.540> conference<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.079> assume<00:01:46.500> they<00:01:46.649> mean

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
press conference so I assume they mean

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.950 
press conference so I assume they mean
the<00:01:46.950> ps3<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.670> ps4<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.329> there<00:01:48.450> too<00:01:48.600> but

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the ps3 and the ps4 is in there too but

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.899 
the ps3 and the ps4 is in there too but
regards<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.350> they<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> next

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
regards that they do this is the next

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.550 
regards that they do this is the next
logical<00:01:51.060> step<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:51.990> confuses<00:01:52.439> people

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
logical step that really confuses people

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.139 
logical step that really confuses people
how<00:01:53.100> would<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.369> play<00:01:53.579> with<00:01:53.790> people<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.060> the

from a PC like the

dragon-like redstone stuff like this is

dragon-like redstone stuff like this is
all<00:02:16.050> still<00:02:16.350> missing<00:02:16.710> so<00:02:16.950> basically<00:02:17.910> because

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
all still missing so basically because

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.910 
all still missing so basically because
the<00:02:18.420> pocket<00:02:18.630> engine<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:18.960> so<00:02:19.170> far<00:02:19.410> behind<00:02:19.560> you

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
the pocket engine is so far behind you

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.710 
the pocket engine is so far behind you
might<00:02:20.070> think<00:02:20.340> oh<00:02:20.460> so<00:02:20.880> they<00:02:21.030> have<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.300> catch<00:02:21.450> up

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
might think oh so they have to catch up

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.360 
might think oh so they have to catch up
so<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:22.200> means<00:02:22.470> plug<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.920> down<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.190> right

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
so this means plug is down the right

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.920 
so this means plug is down the right
line<00:02:23.580> right<00:02:23.790> however<00:02:24.150> I'm<00:02:24.570> not<00:02:24.750> necessarily

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
line right however I'm not necessarily

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.810 
line right however I'm not necessarily
sure<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.590> does<00:02:25.830> mean<00:02:26.040> they<00:02:26.160> have<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.400> catch<00:02:26.580> up

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
sure it does mean they have to catch up

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.520 
sure it does mean they have to catch up

same<00:02:34.770> point<00:02:35.070> together<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.490> think<00:02:35.760> it's<00:02:36.090> always

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
same point together I think it's always

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.670 
same point together I think it's always
going<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.510> be<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.690> matter<00:02:36.960> of<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.500> know<00:02:37.530> they

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
going to be a matter of you know they

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.990 
going to be a matter of you know they
always<00:02:37.770> can<00:02:37.950> be<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.130> different<00:02:38.340> places<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.940> I

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
always can be in different places and I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.790 
always can be in different places and I
think<00:02:39.690> this<00:02:39.840> cross-platform<00:02:40.260> will<00:02:40.650> perhaps

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
think this cross-platform will perhaps

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.100 
think this cross-platform will perhaps
go<00:02:41.250> past<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.060> for<00:02:42.390> instance<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.810> think<00:02:42.840> the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
go past that so for instance I think the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.210 
go past that so for instance I think the
easiest<00:02:43.410> way<00:02:43.530> they<00:02:43.770> could<00:02:43.920> deal<00:02:44.040> this

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
easiest way they could deal this

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.070 
easiest way they could deal this
multiplier<00:02:44.610> issue<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.360> just<00:02:45.540> make<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.870> so

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
multiplier issue is to just make it so

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.690 
multiplier issue is to just make it so
there's<00:02:46.260> multiplayer<00:02:46.860> which<00:02:47.040> uses<00:02:47.310> realms

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
there's multiplayer which uses realms

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.670 
there's multiplayer which uses realms
and<00:02:47.790> then<00:02:48.240> only<00:02:48.510> certain<00:02:49.200> features<00:02:49.560> are

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
and then only certain features are

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.320 
and then only certain features are
accessible<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.250> if<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.460> think<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:51.120> know<00:02:51.210> if

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
accessible so if you think you know if

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.880 
accessible so if you think you know if
you<00:02:51.420> think<00:02:51.540> about<00:02:51.660> like<00:02:51.870> some<00:02:52.050> for<00:02:52.170> PvP<00:02:52.650> server

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
you think about like some for PvP server

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.470 
you think about like some for PvP server
it<00:02:53.220> would<00:02:53.370> be<00:02:53.459> entirely<00:02:53.820> possible<00:02:54.120> for<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.450> to

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
it would be entirely possible for you to

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.880 
it would be entirely possible for you to
players<00:02:54.720> on<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.050> Pocket<00:02:55.320> Edition<00:02:55.350> because

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
players on the Pocket Edition because

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.710 
players on the Pocket Edition because
they<00:02:56.100> have<00:02:56.340> mostly<00:02:56.700> PvP<00:02:57.180> stuff<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.510> lot<00:02:57.660> of

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
they have mostly PvP stuff a lot of

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.850 
they have mostly PvP stuff a lot of
their<00:02:57.840> features<00:02:58.110> aren't<00:02:58.320> in<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.530> do<00:02:58.620> with<00:02:58.709> that

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
their features aren't in to do with that

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.770 
their features aren't in to do with that
and<00:02:59.010> therefore<00:02:59.640> if<00:02:59.850> you<00:02:59.970> if<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.390> were<00:03:00.600> gonna

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
and therefore if you if you were gonna

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.120 
and therefore if you if you were gonna
have<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.200> know<00:03:01.320> some<00:03:01.530> poor<00:03:01.680> multiplayer

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
have you know some poor multiplayer

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.590 
have you know some poor multiplayer
functionality<00:03:02.280> you'd<00:03:03.000> have<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.270> make<00:03:03.390> it

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
functionality you'd have to make it

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.240 
functionality you'd have to make it
somewhere<00:03:03.990> where<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.650> features<00:03:05.100> which

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
somewhere where the features which

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.770 
somewhere where the features which
aren't<00:03:05.520> available<00:03:05.580> in<00:03:05.910> both<00:03:06.120> wouldn't<00:03:06.720> be

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
aren't available in both wouldn't be

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.240 
aren't available in both wouldn't be
accessible<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.290> either<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.040> would<00:03:08.130> be<00:03:08.220> a

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
accessible to either and that would be a

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.370 
accessible to either and that would be a
really<00:03:08.580> weird<00:03:08.880> thing<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.180> manage<00:03:09.480> but<00:03:10.110> the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
really weird thing to manage but the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.690 
really weird thing to manage but the
benefits<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:11.040> doing<00:03:11.160> something<00:03:11.430> like<00:03:11.520> that

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
benefits of doing something like that

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.430 
benefits of doing something like that
even<00:03:12.090> though<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.360> means<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.020> console

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
even though it means that on the console

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.990 
even though it means that on the console
you'd<00:03:13.680> lose<00:03:13.830> something<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.520> know<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.850> lose

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
you'd lose something you know you lose

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.490 
you'd lose something you know you lose
the<00:03:15.180> ability<00:03:15.270> to<00:03:15.540> fight<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.900> river<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.290> would

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
the ability to fight the river it would

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.199 
the ability to fight the river it would
still<00:03:16.770> bring<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:17.100> lot<00:03:17.310> more<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.790> game<00:03:18.000> if

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
still bring a lot more to the game if

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.550 
still bring a lot more to the game if
you<00:03:18.300> have<00:03:18.420> friends<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:18.750> only<00:03:18.989> have<00:03:19.230> mobile

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
you have friends that only have mobile

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.960 
you have friends that only have mobile
versions<00:03:19.890> of<00:03:19.980> game<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.430> have<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.580> console

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
versions of game and you have a console

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.580 
versions of game and you have a console
version<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.450> both<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.840> know<00:03:21.959> semi-casual

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
version that both you know semi-casual

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.140 
version that both you know semi-casual
level<00:03:22.830> so<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.010> means<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.610> you<00:03:23.700> could<00:03:23.880> just

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
level so it means that you could just

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.460 
level so it means that you could just
play<00:03:24.390> together<00:03:24.600> even<00:03:24.959> if<00:03:25.050> it's<00:03:25.140> just<00:03:25.320> for<00:03:25.440> some

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
play together even if it's just for some

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.170 
play together even if it's just for some
basic<00:03:25.950> building<00:03:26.310> stuff<00:03:26.580> even<00:03:26.850> if<00:03:26.910> it's<00:03:27.000> just

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
basic building stuff even if it's just

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.840 
basic building stuff even if it's just
within<00:03:27.330> PvP<00:03:27.750> or<00:03:27.900> even<00:03:28.440> if<00:03:28.620> somehow<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.310> realms

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
within PvP or even if somehow the realms

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.520 
within PvP or even if somehow the realms
issue<00:03:30.030> can<00:03:30.330> actually<00:03:30.600> bypass<00:03:31.110> all<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.410> this

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
issue can actually bypass all of this

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.960 
issue can actually bypass all of this
and<00:03:31.709> allow<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.130> do<00:03:32.250> stuff<00:03:32.430> like<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:32.640> I

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
and allow you to do stuff like that I

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.580 
and allow you to do stuff like that I
think<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.510> would<00:03:33.570> be<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.720> really<00:03:34.140> cool<00:03:34.200> option

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
think it would be a really cool option

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.410 
think it would be a really cool option
there<00:03:34.860> so<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.340> next<00:03:35.580> question<00:03:35.790> is<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.390> know

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
there so the next question is you know

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.150 
there so the next question is you know
if<00:03:36.630> there's<00:03:36.840> like<00:03:36.989> that<00:03:37.170> whole<00:03:37.380> okay<00:03:37.769> so<00:03:37.830> if<00:03:38.070> we

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
if there's like that whole okay so if we

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.860 
if there's like that whole okay so if we
just<00:03:38.340> turn<00:03:38.820> off<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.000> lot<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.330> features<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.750> make

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
just turn off a lot of features and make

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.210 
just turn off a lot of features and make
the<00:03:40.019> games<00:03:40.230> kind<00:03:40.530> of<00:03:40.620> similar<00:03:40.830> if<00:03:40.890> that's<00:03:41.040> up

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
the games kind of similar if that's up

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.920 
the games kind of similar if that's up
you<00:03:41.400> know<00:03:41.489> kind<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.790> setting<00:03:42.150> how<00:03:42.510> exactly

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
you know kind of setting how exactly

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.509 
you know kind of setting how exactly
will<00:03:43.080> it<00:03:43.140> technically<00:03:43.590> work<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.100> reason

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
will it technically work and the reason

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.310 
will it technically work and the reason
that<00:03:44.670> consoles<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.330> Pocket<00:03:45.840> Edition<00:03:45.870> can

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
that consoles and Pocket Edition can

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.259 
that consoles and Pocket Edition can
cross<00:03:46.590> play<00:03:46.800> and<00:03:47.040> is<00:03:47.370> actually<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.820> reasonable

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
cross play and is actually a reasonable

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.970 
cross play and is actually a reasonable
thing<00:03:48.360> to<00:03:48.420> want<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:48.870> because<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.350> console

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
thing to want is because the console

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.590 
thing to want is because the console
Edition<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.760> runs<00:03:50.970> in<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.180> same<00:03:51.390> language

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
Edition it runs in the same language

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.970 
Edition it runs in the same language
that<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.930> POC<00:03:52.080> Edition<00:03:52.380> does<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.650> believe<00:03:52.680> it's

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
that the POC Edition does I believe it's

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.190 
that the POC Edition does I believe it's
a<00:03:53.100> C++<00:03:53.670> or<00:03:53.700> C<00:03:53.820> hash<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.690> basically<00:03:54.810> means

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
a C++ or C hash and it basically means

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.810 
a C++ or C hash and it basically means
that<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.470> two<00:03:55.650> versions<00:03:56.280> could<00:03:56.489> connect

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
that the two versions could connect

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.640 
that the two versions could connect
reasonably<00:03:57.239> well<00:03:57.420> because<00:03:57.780> if<00:03:57.959> they<00:03:58.290> both<00:03:58.440> use

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
reasonably well because if they both use

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.080 
reasonably well because if they both use
realms<00:03:59.010> for<00:03:59.100> instance<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.670> could<00:03:59.850> be<00:03:59.940> the

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
realms for instance that could be the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.000 
realms for instance that could be the
same<00:04:00.269> realm<00:04:00.660> even<00:04:01.080> that<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.260> use<00:04:01.380> across<00:04:01.800> your

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
same realm even that you use across your

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.509 
same realm even that you use across your
Pocket<00:04:02.250> Edition

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
and your console edition and you know

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.150 
and your console edition and you know
there's<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.260> bunch<00:04:04.410> of<00:04:04.500> cool<00:04:04.709> things<00:04:04.890> you<00:04:04.980> could

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
there's a bunch of cool things you could

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.520 
there's a bunch of cool things you could
do<00:04:05.340> in<00:04:05.550> regards<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.030> so<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.690> reason<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.140> PC

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
do in regards that so the reason the PC

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.350 
do in regards that so the reason the PC
is<00:04:07.709> much<00:04:08.040> later<00:04:08.280> down<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.459> line<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.910> reason<00:04:09.060> I

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
is much later down the line the reason I

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.759 
is much later down the line the reason I
don't<00:04:09.420> think<00:04:09.720> I'll<00:04:10.049> be<00:04:10.170> making<00:04:10.200> video<00:04:10.590> on<00:04:10.650> how

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
don't think I'll be making video on how

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.259 
don't think I'll be making video on how
the<00:04:10.830> PC<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.280> cross<00:04:11.489> playing<00:04:11.730> but<00:04:11.940> you<00:04:12.180> know

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
the PC is cross playing but you know

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.640 
the PC is cross playing but you know
with<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.570> population<00:04:13.049> anytime<00:04:13.320> soon<00:04:13.500> is

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
with the population anytime soon is

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.710 
with the population anytime soon is
because<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.310> PC<00:04:14.700> is<00:04:14.850> coded<00:04:15.180> in<00:04:15.269> an<00:04:15.390> entirely

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
because the PC is coded in an entirely

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.020 
because the PC is coded in an entirely
separate<00:04:16.200> language<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.890> Windows<00:04:17.190> 10<00:04:17.220> the

you know the Pocket Edition and the

you know the Pocket Edition and the
console<00:04:20.010> Edition<00:04:20.280> because<00:04:20.580> it's<00:04:20.880> actually

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
console Edition because it's actually

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.600 
console Edition because it's actually
coded<00:04:21.390> in<00:04:21.479> Java<00:04:21.810> so<00:04:22.080> Java<00:04:22.440> is<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:22.680> very<00:04:23.310> outdated

language at this point and it's also you

language at this point and it's also you
know<00:04:26.430> very<00:04:26.550> difficult<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.270> work

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
know very difficult to work

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.720 
know very difficult to work
stuff<00:04:27.900> which<00:04:28.230> means<00:04:28.470> until<00:04:29.040> they<00:04:29.340> switch<00:04:29.610> over

be in the next too soon then

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.620 
be in the next too soon then
there's<00:04:35.520> gonna<00:04:35.640> be<00:04:35.760> extreme<00:04:36.210> problems<00:04:36.540> of

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
there's gonna be extreme problems of

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.330 
there's gonna be extreme problems of
getting<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.110> PC<00:04:37.470> version<00:04:37.770> of<00:04:37.830> Minecraft<00:04:38.220> to

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
cross play is coming at some point in

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.070 
cross play is coming at some point in
the<00:04:44.190> next<00:04:44.310> you<00:04:44.640> know<00:04:44.730> year<00:04:45.060> or<00:04:45.240> two<00:04:45.420> and<00:04:45.600> then

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
the next you know year or two and then

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.380 
the next you know year or two and then
as<00:04:46.530> far<00:04:46.710> as<00:04:46.770> getting<00:04:47.460> all<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.820> crap<00:04:48.000> laughing

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
as far as getting all the crap laughing

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.150 
as far as getting all the crap laughing
together<00:04:48.750> that<00:04:49.080> is<00:04:49.230> their<00:04:49.410> end<00:04:49.590> goal<00:04:49.890> it's

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
together that is their end goal it's

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.980 
together that is their end goal it's
like<00:04:50.340> a<00:04:50.370> 5-10<00:04:51.090> year<00:04:51.300> girl<00:04:51.510> but<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:51.960> is

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
like a 5-10 year girl but it is

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.360 
like a 5-10 year girl but it is
something<00:04:52.320> that<00:04:52.470> you<00:04:52.560> will<00:04:52.800> be<00:04:52.950> able<00:04:53.070> to<00:04:53.190> see

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
something that you will be able to see

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.100 
something that you will be able to see
at<00:04:53.520> some<00:04:53.550> point<00:04:54.000> for<00:04:54.090> Minecraft<00:04:54.480> if<00:04:54.630> minecraft

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
at some point for Minecraft if minecraft

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.420 
at some point for Minecraft if minecraft
is<00:04:55.260> still<00:04:55.410> alive<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:55.830> kicking<00:04:55.890> in<00:04:56.100> five<00:04:56.310> or

is still alive and kicking in five or

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.010 
is still alive and kicking in five or
ten<00:04:56.580> years<00:04:56.760> it<00:04:57.000> will<00:04:57.090> be<00:04:57.210> so<00:04:57.390> much<00:04:57.540> cooler<00:04:57.720> in<00:04:57.960> a

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
ten years it will be so much cooler in a

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.690 
ten years it will be so much cooler in a
lot<00:04:58.200> of<00:04:58.290> ways<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.680> one<00:04:58.920> of<00:04:59.010> those<00:04:59.160> ways<00:04:59.400> will

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
lot of ways and one of those ways will

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.310 
lot of ways and one of those ways will
be<00:04:59.730> cross-platform<00:05:00.360> anyway<00:05:01.080> I<00:05:01.140> hope<00:05:01.260> you

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
be cross-platform anyway I hope you

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.440 
be cross-platform anyway I hope you
