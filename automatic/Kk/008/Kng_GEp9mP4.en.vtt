00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.429
 We don't walk at all to be expensive 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:24.079

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.759

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.869

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.819
 still in a few in the cupboard 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.559

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:35.900

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.990
 start and sunglasses some nice roses 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.920
 to tape ribbon and superglue or 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.170
 double himself 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.000
 I like to have happy feet this summer 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.280
 not just because of my nail polish but 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.990
 also through these slippers all of these 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.610
 make time because this is an old commodity 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.230
 that at the start I had the cupboard and that 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.130
 I'm going today to hip slippers 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.960
 conjure with ribbons roses 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.300
 my blog and but you can also dust 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.590
 use or other embellishment 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.480
 well what i start with is the material 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.750
 slipper below 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.460
 You can slide it all the way down and down 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.119
 what is useful to do for a while 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.619
 do a little bit of line here so that 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.939
 He was right from the start 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.579
 from ship 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.869
 does with glue gun I opted for 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.889
 white 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.770
 but of course you can also enjoy 

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:23.569
 choose orange or horse it's only just 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.710
 where you assume this should match well 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:27.439
 not at all 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.999
 namely very hip he goes to the 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.990
 get started with my sunglasses there now i go 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:31.249
 sticking with all kinds 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.840
 decorations 

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:34.880
 I use them for that 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.920
 I heard that polyethylene somewhere 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.990
 plastic that you underline there 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.420
 can use for but yes I do not know 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.799
 what polyethylene plastic is well I do 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.659
 a little test for that 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.729
 namely throwing sunglasses into one 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.560
 bake with water and if it floats 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.929
 I can not stick it because then is 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.969
 the polyethylene 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.560
 these those diseases that camp just use 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.409
 but for example a village of one 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.479
 marker to see if you do 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.069
 of which remains floating and it can 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.069
 so don't line up 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.740
 well I'll continue with the ribbon around it 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.000
 wrap to the end 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.890
 and when i 'm done the couch gets over there 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.410
 also stick it again 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.610
 apart from that, a nice club can be in between 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.590
 let's get started with these glasses 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.420
 just the sticker off well 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.280
 we are totally pastel in this 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.230
 summer so let me make it romantic 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.360
 and also pass my bridge with 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.040
 all kinds of pastel shades and some nice ones 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.040
 found roses that I will also grab 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.050
 with the seconds long call along it 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.650
 edge not here at the top you see nothing of it 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.650
 locked 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.820
 now decorating can start from this 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.830
 those roses that you find in many 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.930
 different stores really should not 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.930

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.920
 super easy you can then these roses 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.700
 you can swallow the flower in front of you 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.740
 to stick 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.200
