00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
but nothing too horrible like I forgot

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.729 
but nothing too horrible like I forgot
to<00:03:59.000> put<00:03:59.150> my<00:03:59.239> tablecloth<00:03:59.810> on<00:04:00.049> I<00:04:00.290> brought<00:04:00.590> the

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
to put my tablecloth on I brought the

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.809 
to put my tablecloth on I brought the
tablecloth<00:04:01.220> but<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.459> didn't<00:04:01.760> use<00:04:02.329> it<00:04:02.359> um<00:04:03.190> it<00:04:04.190> was

tablecloth but I didn't use it um it was
my<00:04:04.940> first<00:04:05.180> time<00:04:05.359> using<00:04:05.780> a<00:04:06.049> tablet<00:04:06.319> as<00:04:06.680> a

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
my first time using a tablet as a

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.490 
my first time using a tablet as a
portfolio<00:04:07.459> and<00:04:07.760> I<00:04:08.150> thought<00:04:08.329> it<00:04:08.720> went<00:04:09.350> really

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
portfolio and I thought it went really

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.190 
portfolio and I thought it went really
well<00:04:09.920> it<00:04:10.310> looked<00:04:10.549> really<00:04:11.030> cool<00:04:11.510> on<00:04:11.840> my<00:04:11.870> table

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
well it looked really cool on my table

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.319 
well it looked really cool on my table
although<00:04:12.739> part<00:04:13.430> way<00:04:13.549> through<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.850> convention

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
although part way through the convention

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:15.759 
although part way through the convention
I<00:04:14.389> had<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.660> give<00:04:14.810> my<00:04:14.900> tablet<00:04:15.319> a<00:04:15.380> break<00:04:15.650> because

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
I had to give my tablet a break because

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.159 
I had to give my tablet a break because
it<00:04:15.889> started<00:04:16.310> overheating<00:04:16.669> a<00:04:17.060> little<00:04:17.299> bit<00:04:17.450> so<00:04:18.139> I

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
it started overheating a little bit so I

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.990 
it started overheating a little bit so I
guess<00:04:18.380> that<00:04:18.590> was<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.709> only<00:04:18.889> thing<00:04:19.010> maybe<00:04:19.729> next

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
guess that was the only thing maybe next

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.370 
guess that was the only thing maybe next
time<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.269> might<00:04:20.450> borrow<00:04:20.660> someone<00:04:21.049> else's

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
time I might borrow someone else's
