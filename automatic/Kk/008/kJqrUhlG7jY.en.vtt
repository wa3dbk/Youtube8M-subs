Before testing the tea, you should eat a traditional sweet.
It brings out the flavor of matcha tea.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:52.010
Finally it's time to drink the matcha tea made by the master.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:11.790
Now it's our turn trying to make mactha tea!

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.090
Men wield the "chasen" with the index finger, while 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.590
women use both the index and middle fingers, as you can see now.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.090
How to mix? For 3 times, mix it gently creating 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.790
the letter "hi" in hiragana, this one ひ.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.890
Then mix vigorously several time until you see

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.690
a cream on the surface. Try! ^^

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.090
My friend Indri's working! :) "Ganbatte" (do your best)!

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.090
It's my turn.. :/

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.090
Well, it's not so bad thinking it was my first time, no? :)
