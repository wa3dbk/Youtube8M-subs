00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.040
 guys girls hello all yes cores 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.290
 needed and this is minecraft today os 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.410
 I bring like every Sunday one of 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.140
 guides today's guide is about fires 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.050
 artificial ok so let's go to 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.580
 start the truth that is very complete 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.400
 but very complete you will like 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.039
 pretty good the first all know the 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.730
 artificial game we have them with effects 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.880
 hub with effects and without effects without 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.079
 effects the character would give that this 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.719
 OK 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.550
 gunpowder is going to mean the number of 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.129
 blocks 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.440
 the one that is going to ascend in the rocket 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.579
 agreement if we can well do 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.019
 with a rocket is worth a paper and gunpowder and 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.780
 if we put one of gunpowder 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.839
 the rocket will go up between 12 and 21 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.930
 blocks of height since we throw them 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:59.570
 if we put two in you mind three and 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.180
 thirty eight blocks height and yes 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.460
 we put three of gunpowder between forty and 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.140
 fifty seven height blocks worth 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.890
 esteban we will reach the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.670
 stratosphere at least 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.940
 well let's see more things with 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.820
 effects 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.510
 let's say that he's going to get this he's going to go to 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.470
 short range of agreement and this would be the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.750
 effect 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.780
 You are not here this rock you see here 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.909
 it would be like the artificial star is 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.440
 they call in the game according 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.890
 and well this would be the first effect worth 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.350
 we can put a two-effect rocket 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.510
 three effects four effects this would be 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.450
 the agreement character remember that here 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.630
 is the height tube you can combine as 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.390
 want with four effects and two of 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.480
 gunpowder height half height as 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.690
 see effects we can put 5 we can 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.340
 put 6 to 7 effects according to this 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.719
 would be the plans as you see 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:08.229
 and how to get good paper the 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:10.709
 gunpowder and these fire stars 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.709
 artificial 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.880
 let's see 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.340
 the paper and then take out the pineapples from 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.450
 sugar with this character three reeds 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.819
 sugar let's get paper 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.060
 we are going to take out the powder 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.470
 witches creepers or gast the place ya 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.180
 you know that the swamps come out 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.550
 clippers randomly the bugs 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.830
 greens that explode and gas come out and 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.290
 I think it's that white thing that 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.079
 goes flying around spitting fire 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.209
 and good the crafter would be this for 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.390
 get that ball then the gunpowder in 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.760
 medium and here a dye does not matter the color 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.850
 be the gray to white the one that gives you the 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.320
 win according 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.930
 Star types of fire 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.230
 artificial remember that is the kind of 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.280
 the ss the firework star 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.940
 we can get it from chlorine 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.120
 red 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.739
 Brown Green 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.300
 blue strong color the blue moradillo 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.680
 Clear 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:19.000
 the grayish whitish and gray gold 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:23.980
 the pink yellow 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.280
 the green fusion of that blue sky the 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.600
 passion pink the orange 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.690
 great hall from the fruit and the white 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.160
 more little effects for these games 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.010
 we are worth there after having got 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.140
 all the little things we can put 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.900
 effects to fireworks if 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.460
 we put a pen this would be the search 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.730
 to make the star because if we add 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.980
 a feather we will have a blast culotte 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.200
 of explosion is worth now you will see more 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.580
 ahead what is that because I'm going 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.550
 to do a couple of tests 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.140
 the ecri but you can get the clipper 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.910
 scale of a skeleton any kind of 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.550
 face it and know that these faces the 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.760
 you have to kill the bugs and they come out very 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.700
 rarely 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.260
 and nothing like what the ball would be 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:17.410
 of that and we add this effect effect 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.989
 star because the same this I search and already 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.120
 you will see then it will give you the ball now it is 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.900
 that will have star effect 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.340
 and circle effect equal the post I 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.460
 random you know what to put what is 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.150
 the color you want and that's it and 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.150
 this element 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.520
 and then extra effects is to say this is 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.210
 the primary effect and this would be the 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.060
 side effect we have this from 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.420
 agreement you remember that this was the effect 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.920
 star if we add a little bit 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.530
 balloon 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.930
 to the component we will obtain the effect 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.730
 star that had before now 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.080
 with a kind of expansion over 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.550
 agreement now you see a little bit more 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.680
 ahead 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.810
 if for example you remember this here 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.670
 that exploded the rocket and in the 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.790
 explosion exclusion if we add a 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:11.960
 diamond then we will have great effect of 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.820
 light exists and for this purpose the call it 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.380
 we can add to any of these 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.660
 four that we have seen just like the 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.000
 cluster any one of these four and 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.020
 the color then you have it there all that 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.020
 row of colors you can put 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:31.080
 let us begin 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.080
 without which without effects 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.210
 Well, I'm going to make it 11 because 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.210
 so it's all nicer 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.400
 Oh 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.540
 I throw and do nothing is a rocket without 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.270
 effect and effect with effect 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.680
 basically what he has done is put him 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.680
 a colored ball and that's it 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:56.089
 is the one that was the color red 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.230
 and it does this a very small circle 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:06.599
 it will always be the same color effect 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:07.769
 that is if you put more colors 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.589
 possibilities more different colors 

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:12.539
 obviously the explosion of explosion the 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:15.200
 chords that we've talked about this that 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:18.350
 It was the feather age 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:22.390
 6 as the explosion of the 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:25.750
 explosion do a circus also makes 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.729
 Well, I do not like that much 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:32.490
 game 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.490
 clipper face every time you perez this 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.410
 you see 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.289
 you are very down to me this I like 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.289
 quite 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.270
 star 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.030
 a star 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.940
 that is 3d you see it has gone up between 12 and 20 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.590
 what is it does not rise anymore because I've put 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.360
 if I had put more 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:06.120
 come higher 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.120
 to espanyol we approach the circle 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.159
 hears 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:15.990
 you see a circle also in 3d 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:18.770
 pretty rough and I like it a lot 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:21.370
 incredible is muscle 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.979
 to see more things 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.000
 star more time that we have put 

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:26.680
 with groove 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.310
 I do not know how to call these rockets because 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.310
 they do not have the eye 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:36.080
 explode and you see that does that the 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.080
 little star makes like chiribitas 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:45.350
 more little things 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:47.340
 and then the double effect and he called it that 

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:50.810
 but see if what he does 

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.810
 it's like a double effect 

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:57.210
 you see 

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.710
 It's very cool I've put it with a 

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.300
 skeleton face but it's been 

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.699
 scripps obviously will not always come out 

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.780
 anti flu you can use the one 

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:05.790
 really hell you want 

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.560
 Well, this has been today's guide 

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.940
 I think it's pretty complete about 

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.970
 fireworks but if needed 

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.650
 something then leaving in the comments and 

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:17.000
 nothing if you liked giving it like i 

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:17.000
 subscribe until later
