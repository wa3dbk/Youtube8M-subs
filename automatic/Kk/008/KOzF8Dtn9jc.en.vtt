the<00:00:35.309> same<00:00:35.640> way<00:00:36.270> they<00:00:36.809> should<00:00:37.079> be<00:00:37.290> all<00:00:38.120> sharp<00:00:39.120> as

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
the same way they should be all sharp as

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.139 
the same way they should be all sharp as
equal<00:00:40.410> sharpness<00:00:40.890> now<00:00:41.129> granted<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.910> blade

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
equal sharpness now granted the blade

shapes<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.570> little<00:00:42.750> differently<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.680> geometry

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
shapes a little differently the geometry

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.470 
shapes a little differently the geometry
of<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> edge<00:00:44.610> might<00:00:44.910> be<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> little<00:00:45.300> different

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
of the edge might be a little different

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.410 
of the edge might be a little different
but<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:47.219> think<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:47.820> should<00:00:47.969> be<00:00:48.030> able<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.210> see

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
but I think we should be able to see

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.290 
but I think we should be able to see
some<00:00:48.719> real<00:00:48.960> interesting<00:00:49.320> results<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.100> my<00:00:50.850> push

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
some real interesting results on my push

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.110 
some real interesting results on my push
cut<00:00:51.899> tomato<00:00:52.410> test<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.309> my<00:00:53.520> new<00:00:53.730> push

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
cut tomato test this is that my new push

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.869 
cut tomato test this is that my new push
cut<00:00:54.360> tomato<00:00:54.660> test<00:00:54.930> which<00:00:55.140> by<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.620> way<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.010> it's

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
cut tomato test which by the way is it's

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.810 
cut tomato test which by the way is it's
very<00:00:57.000> difficult<00:00:57.960> task<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.190> knife<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.640> do

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
very difficult task for the knife to do

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.520 
very difficult task for the knife to do
clean

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
clean

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.700 
clean
so<00:01:01.010> let's<00:01:01.160> see<00:01:01.280> how<00:01:01.400> we<00:01:01.460> do
