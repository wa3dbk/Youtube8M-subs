coming in and I have construction

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.470 
coming in and I have construction
workers<00:00:26.290> so<00:00:26.560> it's<00:00:26.740> been<00:00:26.920> a<00:00:26.950> real<00:00:27.130> challenge

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
workers so it's been a real challenge

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.460 
workers so it's been a real challenge
probably<00:00:28.480> should<00:00:28.630> have<00:00:28.720> done<00:00:28.900> this<00:00:29.020> inside

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
probably should have done this inside

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.740 
probably should have done this inside
but<00:00:30.130> we're<00:00:30.279> going<00:00:30.489> to<00:00:30.700> forge<00:00:30.939> ahead<00:00:31.119> here's

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
but we're going to forge ahead here's

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
actually in our generation tent the

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.910

original support structure is broke and

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.150 
original support structure is broke and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.819 
so I took some tubing from the hardware
store<00:00:49.219> and<00:00:49.940> it's<00:00:50.780> actually<00:00:51.170> landscaped

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
store and it's actually landscaped

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.660

tubing<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.730> right<00:00:53.650> diameter<00:00:54.650> but<00:00:54.800> not<00:00:55.129> quite

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
tubing the right diameter but not quite

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.439 
tubing the right diameter but not quite
sturdy<00:00:56.000> enough<00:00:56.180> but<00:00:57.110> it<00:00:57.379> works<00:00:57.620> and<00:00:58.000> I<00:00:59.000> did

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.950 
basically that is the project that we
haven't<00:05:53.400> gotten<00:05:53.610> to<00:05:53.730> yet<00:05:53.970> and<00:05:54.150> it's<00:05:54.750> just

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
haven't gotten to yet and it's just

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.530 
haven't gotten to yet and it's just
attached<00:05:55.350> via<00:05:55.680> velcro<00:05:56.160> to<00:05:56.310> the<00:05:56.340> back<00:05:56.610> so<00:05:57.510> that

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
attached via velcro to the back so that

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.810 
attached via velcro to the back so that
it<00:05:57.750> can<00:05:57.900> be<00:05:58.020> removed<00:05:58.440> so<00:05:58.680> the<00:05:58.800> beds<00:05:58.980> beds<00:05:59.580> fit

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
it can be removed so the beds beds fit

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.960 
it can be removed so the beds beds fit
in<00:05:59.970> so<00:06:00.690> the<00:06:00.810> beds<00:06:01.020> fit<00:06:01.230> in<00:06:01.350> on<00:06:01.500> the<00:06:01.590> bottom
