thing that's fun about using this is you
can<00:00:47.430> make<00:00:47.910> colored<00:00:48.300> dimensionals<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.829> since

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
can make colored dimensionals so since

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.270 
can make colored dimensionals so since
this<00:00:50.850> one<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.690> an<00:00:51.930> inch<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> half<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.920> mean<00:00:53.160> I

cut the fun foam
one<00:00:55.320> out<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.469> four<00:00:55.800> inches<00:00:57.109> so<00:00:58.109> I'm<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.379> to

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
one out of four inches so I'm going to

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.910 
one out of four inches so I'm going to
put<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.920> my<00:00:59.160> cutter<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.410> this<00:01:01.410> won't<00:01:01.620> cut

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
put it in my cutter and this won't cut

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.680 
put it in my cutter and this won't cut
all<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.190> way<00:01:02.309> through<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.879> will<00:01:03.000> score<00:01:03.539> it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
all the way through but it will score it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.890 
all the way through but it will score it
and<00:01:03.930> give<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.739> line<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.600> know

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and give you a line so that you know

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:17.649 
and give you a line so that you know
where<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.920> cut<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.850> cut<00:01:09.090> straighter

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.030 

so<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.960> want<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.770> want<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
so what you want to do is you want to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:33.960 
so what you want to do is you want to
run<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.400> through<00:01:20.670> your<00:01:20.700> xyron<00:01:22.490> just<00:01:23.490> start

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.289 

and<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.119> want<00:01:35.329> to<00:01:35.390> press<00:01:35.659> this<00:01:35.930> down<00:01:36.250> and<00:01:37.299> I

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
and you want to press this down and I

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.660 
and you want to press this down and I
remove<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:40.479> cellophane<00:01:41.479> card<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.680> keep<00:01:43.490> the

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
remove the cellophane card and keep the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.929 
remove the cellophane card and keep the
waxy<00:01:44.180> paper<00:01:44.420> part<00:01:44.930> on<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.979> I<00:01:46.549> think<00:01:46.789> it's

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
waxy paper part on and I think it's

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.580 
waxy paper part on and I think it's
easier<00:01:47.420> on<00:01:47.479> this<00:01:47.689> little<00:01:48.049> one

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
easier on this little one

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
easier on this little one
if<00:01:48.649> you<00:01:49.280> cut<00:01:49.580> around<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.500> factory<00:01:51.500> type<00:01:51.860> paper

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.080 

it<00:01:55.610> just<00:01:55.700> seeps<00:01:56.329> through<00:01:56.509> better<00:02:00.850> okay<00:02:01.850> then

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
it just seeps through better okay then

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.359 
it just seeps through better okay then
what<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.390> want<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.690> do<00:02:02.869> is<00:02:03.110> now<00:02:04.009> you're<00:02:04.190> going

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
what you want to do is now you're going

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.730 
what you want to do is now you're going
to<00:02:04.429> run<00:02:04.610> this<00:02:04.759> strip<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.299> opposite<00:02:05.959> way<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:06.380> I

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
to run this strip the opposite way so I

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.789 
to run this strip the opposite way so I
am<00:02:06.920> going<00:02:07.399> to<00:02:07.520> put<00:02:07.819> the<00:02:08.450> foam<00:02:08.750> side<00:02:09.110> down<00:02:09.440> and

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
am going to put the foam side down and

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:24.510 
am going to put the foam side down and
the<00:02:10.310> waxy<00:02:10.789> part<00:02:11.090> up

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.100 

then<00:02:25.520> I'm<00:02:25.700> going<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:25.910> do<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.210> same<00:02:26.450> thing<00:02:26.840> I

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
then I'm going to do the same thing I

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:42.970 
then I'm going to do the same thing I
will<00:02:27.410> cut<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:30.190> even<00:02:31.190> with<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.490> fun<00:02:31.700> foam<00:02:41.980> yes

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
will cut this even with the fun foam yes

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.090 
will cut this even with the fun foam yes
and<00:02:43.520> now<00:02:43.850> you've<00:02:44.090> got<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:45.110> sticky<00:02:45.530> paper<00:02:45.740> on

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
and now you've got the sticky paper on

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.790 
and now you've got the sticky paper on
each<00:02:46.400> side<00:02:46.820> and<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.900> thing<00:02:48.170> that<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:48.440> really

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
each side and the thing that I really

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.210 
each side and the thing that I really
like<00:02:49.010> about<00:02:49.840> making<00:02:50.840> my<00:02:50.960> own<00:02:50.990> dimensionals<00:02:51.920> is

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
like about making my own dimensionals is

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.180 
like about making my own dimensionals is
I<00:02:52.490> if<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.330> have<00:02:53.540> something<00:02:53.810> big<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.260> put<00:02:54.680> on<00:02:54.890> I

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
I if I have something big to put on I

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.360 
I if I have something big to put on I
can<00:02:55.760> cut<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.030> big<00:02:56.300> dimensional<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.350> then<00:02:58.340> I

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
can cut a big dimensional and then I

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.950 
can cut a big dimensional and then I
don't<00:02:58.580> have<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.820> lot<00:02:59.090> of<00:02:59.120> just<00:02:59.450> little<00:02:59.780> tiny

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
don't have a lot of just little tiny

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.610 
don't have a lot of just little tiny
pieces<00:03:00.590> so<00:03:01.460> it<00:03:01.550> works<00:03:01.730> great<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.360> way<00:03:02.620> so

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
pieces so it works great that way so
