my design at all I saw a video for this

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.800 
my design at all I saw a video for this
little<00:00:22.960> contraption<00:00:23.960> here<00:00:24.650> and<00:00:25.540> there<00:00:26.540> was<00:00:26.660> no

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810

little contraption here and there was no
tutorial<00:00:27.380> I<00:00:27.500> was<00:00:27.680> like<00:00:27.860> worse<00:00:28.220> a<00:00:28.400> tutorial<00:00:28.730> how

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
tutorial I was like worse a tutorial how

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.870 
tutorial I was like worse a tutorial how
do<00:00:29.060> I<00:00:29.150> make<00:00:29.300> this<00:00:29.950> and<00:00:30.950> it<00:00:31.279> was<00:00:31.400> just<00:00:31.550> kind<00:00:31.759> of<00:00:31.790> a

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
do I make this and it was just kind of a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.210 
do I make this and it was just kind of a
show-off<00:00:32.119> so<00:00:32.509> I'm<00:00:32.660> like<00:00:32.900> well<00:00:33.530> how<00:00:33.890> about<00:00:33.950> I

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
show-off so I'm like well how about I

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.450 
show-off so I'm like well how about I
make<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.550> tutorial<00:00:35.090> and<00:00:35.210> I<00:00:35.300> try<00:00:35.480> to<00:00:35.540> replicate

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
make the tutorial and I try to replicate

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.580 
make the tutorial and I try to replicate
like<00:00:37.460> how<00:00:37.670> this<00:00:37.850> thing<00:00:38.090> works<00:00:38.170> so<00:00:39.170> I<00:00:39.200> I<00:00:39.560> made<00:00:40.070> a

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
like how this thing works so I I made a

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.920 
like how this thing works so I I made a
replica<00:00:42.590> and<00:00:43.129> it<00:00:43.489> works<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.239> exact<00:00:44.480> same<00:00:44.660> way

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
replica and it works the exact same way

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.410 
replica and it works the exact same way
it's<00:00:45.230> just<00:00:45.500> as<00:00:45.649> easy<00:00:45.800> to<00:00:45.949> make<00:00:46.430> as<00:00:46.969> you<00:00:47.149> can<00:00:47.269> see

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
it's just as easy to make as you can see

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.299 
it's just as easy to make as you can see
it's<00:00:47.570> like<00:00:47.690> really<00:00:47.870> compact<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.649> what<00:00:49.039> it<00:00:49.160> is

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
it's like really compact and what it is

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.380 
it's like really compact and what it is
is<00:00:49.550> it's<00:00:49.579> an<00:00:50.539> arrow<00:00:50.960> like<00:00:51.440> cannon<00:00:52.280> so<00:00:52.609> you<00:00:52.670> it

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
gotta get some arrows and you gotta just

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.120 
gotta get some arrows and you gotta just
fill<00:04:02.760> up<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.150> piston<00:04:03.570> head<00:04:03.900> just<00:04:04.530> with<00:04:04.709> arrows

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
fill up the piston head just with arrows

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.150 
fill up the piston head just with arrows
and<00:04:05.780> as<00:04:06.780> many<00:04:07.170> as<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.410> want<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.680> shoot<00:04:07.890> and

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
then put as many T as you think we'll

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.240 
then put as many T as you think we'll
shoot<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.370> fartist<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:13.230> recommend<00:04:13.830> just

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
shoot the fartist so I recommend just

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.960 
shoot the fartist so I recommend just
too<00:04:14.489> because<00:04:14.820> that<00:04:15.090> goes<00:04:15.269> far<00:04:15.510> enough<00:04:15.570> and

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
too because that goes far enough and

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.909 
too because that goes far enough and
just<00:04:17.970> test<00:04:18.209> it<00:04:18.299> out<00:04:18.419> let's<00:04:18.660> see<00:04:18.780> if<00:04:18.840> works<00:04:19.019> and

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
just test it out let's see if works and

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.800 
just test it out let's see if works and
why<00:04:20.729> not<00:04:20.910> work<00:04:21.090> because<00:04:21.269> I<00:04:21.479> have<00:04:21.570> not

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
why not work because I have not

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.980 
why not work because I have not
memorized<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.470> amount<00:04:22.680> of<00:04:22.740> repeaters<00:04:23.600> oops<00:04:24.600> I

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
memorized the amount of repeaters oops I

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.460 
memorized the amount of repeaters oops I
owe<00:04:25.380> ya<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.860> then<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.460> gotta<00:04:26.640> put<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.990> right

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
owe ya and then you gotta put the right

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.490 
owe ya and then you gotta put the right
amount<00:04:28.500> of<00:04:28.830> redstone<00:04:29.220> at

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
amount of redstone at

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.680 
amount of redstone at
for<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.620> TNT<00:04:32.280> can't<00:04:32.520> tins<00:04:32.910> you<00:04:33.060> can<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.480> work
