 and food professionals know that a 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.670
 good work requires a sun technique 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.470
 so we ask you to help us 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.290
 create videos that illustrate several 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.299
 important techniques to paint know 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.939
 using a roller is a technique 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.640
 important for a professional and this 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.800
 video will help you master the roller it 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.140
 used for large areas but before 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.210
 using the roller it is important to cut the 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.640
 angles of the corners and edges this 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.529
 will greatly facilitate the use of the roller 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.570
 when using the roller in a space 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.940
 always starts at the center of the area 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.949
 what are you going to paint then roll towards 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.629
 up in narrow form the 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.429
 different roller covers 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.590
 They are specially designed to 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.719
 load different amounts of paint 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.969
 for example every soak with a white 2 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.010
 9 x half inch gives you a 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.500
 coverage of 6 to 12 square feet 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.570
 depending on how loaded the 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.100
 Roller cover and type of areas 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.780
 that you are painting in terms of 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.969
 pressure allows the weight of the roller 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.070
 charged do work can be applied 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.960
 some pressure as you go 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.420
 finishing the painting on the cover of the 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.130
 roller but not so much that the pressure 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.680
 crush the web why 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.899
 can produce an irregular layer and is 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.000
 exactly what we are avoiding to 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.399
 avoid the appearance of licks 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.130
 continues completely from the roof to the roda 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.140
 foot the best way to achieve it is with 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.240
 an extension and it always starts and 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.399
 ends at the edge of the wall that is 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.229
 wet paint you do not need a 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.329
 extension when you use the roller in 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.280
 small places like bathrooms kitchens and 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.229
 narrow runners you simply 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.420
 clogging after finishing the day's work 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.880

 cuvette rolled with plastic or use the

 purp bag back of purdy store

 after the preparation and cutting 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.780
 angles when you use the roller is when

 the real painted its headquarters and with a
