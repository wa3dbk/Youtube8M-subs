00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.720 

very<00:00:30.090> simple<00:00:30.769> basically<00:00:31.769> two<00:00:32.070> pieces<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.550> think

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
very simple basically two pieces I think

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.020 
very simple basically two pieces I think
most<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.090> them<00:00:33.410> just<00:00:34.410> really<00:00:35.219> nice<00:00:35.399> way<00:00:35.969> these

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
most of them just really nice way these

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.180 
most of them just really nice way these
guys<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.200> go<00:00:37.320> though<00:00:37.440> much<00:00:37.680> nicer<00:00:38.070> than

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
guys for to go though much nicer than

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.360 
guys for to go though much nicer than
the<00:00:38.340> metal<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.820> think<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.270> little<00:00:39.960> bit

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
the metal and I think a little bit

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.670 
the metal and I think a little bit
two-dimensional<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:42.410> beggars<00:00:43.410> can't<00:00:43.469> be

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
two-dimensional but beggars can't be

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.270 
two-dimensional but beggars can't be
choosers<00:00:44.480> here<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.600> go<00:00:45.750> there<00:00:46.160> enter<00:00:47.160> them

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
choosers here you go there enter them

see<00:02:15.150> your<00:02:15.360> racket<00:02:16.400> greenwash<00:02:17.400> has<00:02:17.730> been<00:02:17.910> added

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
see your racket greenwash has been added

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.280 
see your racket greenwash has been added
there<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:21.510> building<00:02:21.930> up<00:02:21.990> some<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.230> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
there and it's building up some of the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.890 
there and it's building up some of the
highlights<00:02:22.970> this<00:02:23.970> guy<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:26.660> yeah<00:02:27.660> basically

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
highlights this guy and yeah basically

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.110 
highlights this guy and yeah basically
done<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.740> did<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.040> backwards<00:02:29.700> sort<00:02:30.000> of

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
done so I did the backwards sort of

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.780 
done so I did the backwards sort of
flame<00:02:30.810> there<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:31.260> started<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:31.770> white<00:02:32.070> worked

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
flame there so started with white worked

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.360 
flame there so started with white worked
my<00:02:33.000> way<00:02:33.030> up<00:02:33.540> gradually<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.620> dark<00:02:35.070> red<00:02:35.310> and

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
my way up gradually to a dark red and

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.050 
my way up gradually to a dark red and
almost<00:02:35.940> even<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.330> black<00:02:36.660> on<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.230> tips<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:38.670> just

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
almost even a black on the tips I just

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.940 
almost even a black on the tips I just
thought<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.210> would<00:02:39.510> look<00:02:39.630> more<00:02:39.960> realistic

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
thought that would look more realistic

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.970 
thought that would look more realistic
and<00:02:41.790> as<00:02:41.880> realistic<00:02:42.180> as<00:02:42.420> flame<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:42.870> be<00:02:43.020> worked

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
and as realistic as flame can be worked

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.120 
and as realistic as flame can be worked
out<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.280> Grays<00:02:44.520> here<00:02:44.850> after<00:02:45.210> some<00:02:45.390> washes

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
out the Grays here after some washes

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.680 
out the Grays here after some washes
saying<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.490> wood<00:02:47.730> here<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.300> worked<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.540> up

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
saying the wood here just worked it up

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.600 
saying the wood here just worked it up
from<00:02:48.960> be<00:02:49.260> still<00:02:49.530> Browns<00:02:49.830> or<00:02:50.160> sneak<00:02:50.400> white
