00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
do is we have these tremors and you can

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.770 
do is we have these tremors and you can
trim<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.309> at<00:00:56.550> any<00:00:56.730> point<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.300> want<00:00:57.539> and

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
trim it at any point that you want and

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.380 
trim it at any point that you want and
then<00:00:57.890> once<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> hit<00:00:59.100> play<00:00:59.340> it'll<00:00:59.670> start<00:01:00.059> where

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
then once you hit play it'll start where

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.560 
then once you hit play it'll start where
you've<00:01:00.660> hit<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.379> trim<00:01:01.739> point<00:01:05.060> so<00:01:06.060> let's<00:01:06.390> say

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
you've hit the trim point so let's say

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.810 
you've hit the trim point so let's say
we<00:01:06.720> wanted<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.020> cut<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.439> snippet<00:01:07.830> then<00:01:08.580> you

we wanted to cut that snippet then you

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.780 
we wanted to cut that snippet then you
can<00:01:09.000> cut<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.140> end<00:01:10.380> point<00:01:10.710> by<00:01:11.220> dragging<00:01:11.490> this

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
can cut the end point by dragging this

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:21.300 
can cut the end point by dragging this
button<00:01:12.090> over<00:01:12.270> here

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.020 

see<00:01:22.090> how<00:01:22.270> it<00:01:22.390> comes<00:01:22.600> together<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.729> here<00:01:27.909> we<00:01:28.000> go

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
see how it comes together so here we go

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.149 
see how it comes together so here we go
now<00:01:28.390> we<00:01:28.450> we<00:01:28.930> want<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.290> cut<00:01:29.470> this<00:01:29.619> section<00:01:30.070> out

now we we want to cut this section out

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.819 
now we we want to cut this section out
here<00:01:30.430> which<00:01:30.579> is<00:01:30.700> in<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:30.939> yellow<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:32.439> can<00:01:32.590> add
