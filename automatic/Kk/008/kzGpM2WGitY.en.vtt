00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.300 

I<00:00:02.960> bet<00:00:03.960> I'm<00:00:04.140> will<00:00:04.410> from<00:00:04.620> juice<00:00:04.830> leaves<00:00:05.069> and

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
I bet I'm will from juice leaves and

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.410 
I bet I'm will from juice leaves and
today<00:00:05.520> I'm<00:00:05.580> gonna<00:00:05.729> tell<00:00:05.880> you<00:00:05.970> about<00:00:06.060> Fork

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
today I'm gonna tell you about Fork

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.690 
today I'm gonna tell you about Fork
juice<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:07.230> main<00:00:07.410> benefits<00:00:07.859> use<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.250> for<00:00:08.460> juice

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
juice the main benefits use in for juice

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.240 
juice the main benefits use in for juice
is<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.299> reduces<00:00:09.870> why<00:00:10.290> Percy<00:00:10.680> restriction

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
is that it reduces why Percy restriction

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.520 
is that it reduces why Percy restriction
which<00:00:11.519> in<00:00:11.700> turn<00:00:11.910> improves<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.960> small<00:00:13.200> bumps

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
which in turn improves the small bumps

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.860 
which in turn improves the small bumps
sensitivity<00:00:14.160> so<00:00:14.610> what<00:00:14.940> this<00:00:15.090> means<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.509> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
sensitivity so what this means is the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.190 
sensitivity so what this means is the
friction<00:00:16.619> between<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.369> wiper<00:00:17.640> seal<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
friction between the wiper seal and the

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.650 
friction between the wiper seal and the
stanchion<00:00:19.739> is<00:00:19.950> reduced<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.060> get<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.419> much

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
stanchion is reduced so you get a much

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.900 
stanchion is reduced so you get a much
smoother<00:00:22.110> feeling<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.770> less<00:00:23.099> of<00:00:23.399> trail<00:00:23.669> buzz

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
smoother feeling and less of trail buzz

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.450 
smoother feeling and less of trail buzz
and<00:00:24.180> feedback<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> bars<00:00:25.169> which<00:00:25.950> makes<00:00:26.220> for

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
and feedback to the bars which makes for

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.970 
and feedback to the bars which makes for
just<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> general<00:00:27.559> improvement<00:00:28.559> in<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.770> feel

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
just the general improvement in the feel

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.159 
just the general improvement in the feel
of<00:00:29.009> your<00:00:29.279> suspension<00:00:30.000> units<00:00:30.360> second<00:00:31.050> major

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
of your suspension units second major

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.930 
of your suspension units second major
benefit<00:00:31.649> of<00:00:31.739> using<00:00:31.890> fall<00:00:32.219> juice<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.820> it

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
benefit of using fall juice is that it

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.729 
benefit of using fall juice is that it
keeps<00:00:33.090> though<00:00:33.450> your<00:00:33.780> wiper<00:00:34.050> seal<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.559> much

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
keeps though your wiper seal is much

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.250 
keeps though your wiper seal is much
cleaner<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.430> what<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.060> means<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.480> less<00:00:36.750> dirt

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
cleaner and what this means is less dirt

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.680 
cleaner and what this means is less dirt
and<00:00:37.680> trail<00:00:37.920> debris<00:00:38.400> makes<00:00:38.880> its<00:00:39.090> way<00:00:39.120> into<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
and trail debris makes its way into the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.110 
and trail debris makes its way into the
internals<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.500> your<00:00:40.680> suspension<00:00:41.640> unit<00:00:41.970> which

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
internals of your suspension unit which

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.210 
internals of your suspension unit which
means<00:00:42.150> that<00:00:42.600> oil<00:00:42.750> stays<00:00:43.140> cleaner<00:00:43.470> and<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
means that oil stays cleaner and the

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.530 
means that oil stays cleaner and the
performance<00:00:44.700> there<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:44.970> higher<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.210> longer

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
performance there is higher for longer

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.500 
performance there is higher for longer
so<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.410> very<00:00:46.620> good<00:00:47.460> general<00:00:48.300> maintenance

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
so it's a very good general maintenance

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.930 
so it's a very good general maintenance
pray<00:00:49.079> for<00:00:49.500> what<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.890> actually<00:00:50.250> probably<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
pray for what is actually probably the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.970 
pray for what is actually probably the
single<00:00:51.390> most<00:00:51.420> expensive<00:00:52.110> component<00:00:52.290> on<00:00:52.770> those

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
single most expensive component on those

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.830 
single most expensive component on those
bikes<00:00:53.220> so<00:00:53.910> now<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.090> I've<00:00:54.239> told<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.570> how<00:00:54.690> good

with a brand new pair of Forks in it
that<00:00:59.790> have<00:00:59.880> never<00:01:00.000> been<00:01:00.210> ridden<00:01:00.450> we're<00:01:01.050> going

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
that have never been ridden we're going

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.139 
that have never been ridden we're going
to<00:01:01.260> drop<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.680> 30<00:01:01.950> kilo<00:01:02.370> weight<00:01:02.579> from<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> top

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
to drop the 30 kilo weight from the top

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.359 
to drop the 30 kilo weight from the top
of<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.450> bar<00:01:03.810> here<00:01:04.110> down<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.250> we're

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
of that bar here down to here and we're

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.440 
of that bar here down to here and we're
going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> measure<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.000> amount<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.240> travel

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
going to measure the amount of travel

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.030 
going to measure the amount of travel
you<00:01:06.689> get<00:01:06.840> we're<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.740> apply<00:01:07.800> some

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
you get we're then going to apply some

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.100 
you get we're then going to apply some
fog<00:01:08.520> juice<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:09.450> we're<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.690> to<00:01:09.750> drop<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
fog juice then we're going to drop the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.600 
fog juice then we're going to drop the
weights<00:01:10.290> again<00:01:10.470> from<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> same<00:01:11.130> height<00:01:11.370> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
weights again from the same height and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.950 
weights again from the same height and
we're<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.940> show<00:01:12.120> you<00:01:12.180> how<00:01:12.420> much<00:01:12.570> extra

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
we're going to show you how much extra

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.870 
we're going to show you how much extra
travel<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.560> achieve<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:14.250> by<00:01:14.430> applying

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
travel you can achieve just by applying

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.460 
travel you can achieve just by applying
for<00:01:15.210> juice<00:01:15.450> once<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:16.080> test<00:01:16.350> will

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
for juice once this test will

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.260 
for juice once this test will
demonstrate<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.310> reduction<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.970> serious

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
demonstrate the reduction in serious

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.180 
demonstrate the reduction in serious
diction<00:01:18.690> and<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.140> infer<00:01:19.470> from<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
diction and you can infer from this the

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.100 
diction and you can infer from this the
improvement<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:20.940> small<00:01:21.210> bump<00:01:21.420> sensitivity

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
improvement in small bump sensitivity

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.600 
improvement in small bump sensitivity
first<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.799> all<00:01:22.920> we're<00:01:23.040> gonna<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.370> dry<00:01:23.580> run

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
first of all we're gonna do the dry run

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:33.830 
first of all we're gonna do the dry run
so<00:01:24.120> this<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.390> an<00:01:24.479> unfocused<00:01:25.200> pair<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.860> Forks

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.270 

okay<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:35.140> from<00:01:35.260> that<00:01:35.440> test<00:01:35.680> we<00:01:35.890> can<00:01:35.980> see<00:01:36.160> that

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
okay so from that test we can see that

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.100 
okay so from that test we can see that
we've<00:01:36.370> got<00:01:36.400> 72<00:01:36.910> mil<00:01:37.270> will<00:01:37.510> travel<00:01:37.750> out<00:01:37.960> of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
we've got 72 mil will travel out of

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.510 
we've got 72 mil will travel out of
those<00:01:38.200> forks<00:01:38.650> and<00:01:38.920> now<00:01:39.100> we're<00:01:39.250> going<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.400> apply

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
those forks and now we're going to apply

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.250 
those forks and now we're going to apply
with<00:01:39.850> a<00:01:39.880> fork<00:01:40.120> juice<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:40.630> repeat<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.020> test

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
with a fork juice and repeat the test

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.620 
with a fork juice and repeat the test
for<00:01:42.190> juice<00:01:42.400> is<00:01:42.520> pretty<00:01:42.730> easy<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.090> use<00:01:43.120> you<00:01:43.600> just

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
for juice is pretty easy to use you just

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.300 
for juice is pretty easy to use you just
spray<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:44.020> straight<00:01:44.410> onto<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.830> stanchions

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
spray it straight onto the stanchions

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.860 
spray it straight onto the stanchions
and<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.610> shock<00:01:45.820> shaft<00:01:46.120> avoiding<00:01:46.780> any

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
and the shock shaft avoiding any

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:53.850 
and the shock shaft avoiding any
breaking<00:01:47.290> surfaces<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.990> now<00:01:53.110> we've<00:01:53.290> reset<00:01:53.680> the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
breaking surfaces so now we've reset the

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.710 
breaking surfaces so now we've reset the
travel<00:01:54.190> travel<00:01:54.730> marker<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.360> we're<00:01:55.480> going<00:01:55.630> to

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
travel travel marker and we're going to

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.690 
travel travel marker and we're going to
we're<00:01:56.290> going<00:01:56.410> to<00:01:56.470> carry<00:01:56.710> out<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:57.040> drop<00:01:57.490> test

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
we're going to carry out the drop test

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:06.330 
we're going to carry out the drop test
with<00:01:58.210> fork<00:01:58.480> Jews<00:01:58.660> having<00:01:58.990> been<00:01:59.020> applied<00:02:05.340> as

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
with fork Jews having been applied as

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.859 
with fork Jews having been applied as
you<00:02:06.580> can<00:02:06.700> see<00:02:06.850> there<00:02:07.060> we<00:02:07.240> just<00:02:07.360> got<00:02:07.510> an<00:02:07.600> extra

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
you can see there we just got an extra

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.660 
you can see there we just got an extra
eight<00:02:08.140> millimeters<00:02:08.740> of<00:02:08.830> travel<00:02:08.860> which<00:02:09.399> is<00:02:09.550> an

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
eight millimeters of travel which is an

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.490 
eight millimeters of travel which is an
increase<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.179> just<00:02:10.209> over<00:02:10.690> 10%<00:02:10.899> from<00:02:11.350> the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
increase of just over 10% from the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.370 
increase of just over 10% from the
single<00:02:11.980> application<00:02:12.610> for<00:02:12.880> juice<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.450> as<00:02:14.170> time

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
single application for juice and as time

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.290 
single application for juice and as time
goes<00:02:14.410> on<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.100> continue<00:02:15.550> using<00:02:15.730> for<00:02:16.120> juice

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
goes on and you continue using for juice

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.120 
goes on and you continue using for juice
you<00:02:16.600> can<00:02:16.630> expect<00:02:17.080> further<00:02:17.320> improvements<00:02:17.980> as<00:02:18.100> a

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
you can expect further improvements as a

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.680 
you can expect further improvements as a
fork<00:02:18.400> juice<00:02:18.580> works<00:02:18.850> its<00:02:19.030> way<00:02:19.150> down<00:02:19.360> into<00:02:19.390> the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
fork juice works its way down into the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.959 
fork juice works its way down into the
