00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.090 
been rather repetitive and for me I
don't<00:02:23.050> enjoy<00:02:23.290> those<00:02:23.980> kinds<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.490> massages<00:02:25.120> as

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
don't enjoy those kinds of massages as

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.920 
don't enjoy those kinds of massages as
well<00:02:27.100> as<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.940> ones<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.330> are<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.480> little<00:02:28.540> more

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
well as the ones that are a little more

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.470 
well as the ones that are a little more
focused<00:02:29.410> on<00:02:29.880> really<00:02:30.880> getting<00:02:31.120> into<00:02:31.360> the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
focused on really getting into the

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.740 
focused on really getting into the
muscle<00:02:32.340> taking<00:02:33.340> care<00:02:33.550> of<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:34.000> origins<00:02:34.510> and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
muscle taking care of the origins and

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.160 
muscle taking care of the origins and
insertions<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:36.420> moving<00:02:37.420> them<00:02:37.570> around<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:38.020> get

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
insertions and moving them around to get

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.190 
insertions and moving them around to get
underneath<00:02:41.490> and<00:02:42.490> all<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.120> takes<00:02:43.420> time<00:02:43.840> a

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
underneath and all of that takes time a

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.410 
underneath and all of that takes time a
person<00:02:44.980> coming<00:02:45.220> out<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.520> school<00:02:45.790> isn't<00:02:46.180> going

person coming out of school isn't going
to<00:02:46.510> be<00:02:46.690> quite<00:02:47.500> as<00:02:47.680> adapted<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:48.580> until

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
to be quite as adapted to that until

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.759 
to be quite as adapted to that until
they<00:02:49.120> practice<00:02:49.600> awhile<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:56.290> longer<00:02:56.650> the

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
they practice awhile and the longer the

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.199 
they practice awhile and the longer the
practice<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.340> course<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.640> easier<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.180> gets

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
practice of course the easier it gets

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.509 
practice of course the easier it gets
the<00:02:58.720> more<00:02:58.870> second<00:02:59.260> nature<00:02:59.440> the<00:03:00.040> work<00:03:00.250> gets

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
the more second nature the work gets
