00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
bit of a diesel fuel this is an actually

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.430 
bit of a diesel fuel this is an actually
an<00:00:57.420> old<00:00:57.539> oil<00:00:58.760> quart<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.940> here's<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> fuel

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
an old oil quart and here's the fuel

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.599 
an old oil quart and here's the fuel
filter<00:01:01.829> for<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.100> year

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
filter for this year

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.359 
filter for this year
the<00:01:03.199> engine<00:01:04.199> change<00:01:04.500> fuel<00:01:04.830> filters<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.189> think

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the engine change fuel filters I think

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.350 
the engine change fuel filters I think
halfway<00:01:05.640> through<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> year<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.180> mine

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
halfway through the year but mine

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.300 
halfway through the year but mine
requires<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.960> three<00:01:07.439> three<00:01:07.680> eight<00:01:07.860> three<00:01:08.280> two

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
requires the three three eight three two

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.179 
requires the three three eight three two
wicks<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.390> recommended<00:01:09.930> because<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.439> low

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
wicks is recommended because of the low

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.109 
wicks is recommended because of the low
micron<00:01:11.939> filtering<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.860> other<00:01:14.820> things

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
micron filtering and other things

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.620 
micron filtering and other things
required<00:01:15.540> actually<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.700> great<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.479> need

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
required actually this is great you need

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.200 
required actually this is great you need
this<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:20.119> opening<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.860> fuel<00:01:23.460> filter<00:01:23.820> housing

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
this for opening the fuel filter housing

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.050 
this for opening the fuel filter housing
so<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.930> just<00:01:25.049> put<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.320> little<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:26.520> larger

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
so you just put that little the larger

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.359 
so you just put that little the larger
size<00:01:27.270> flathead<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:27.990> there<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.369> rotated

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
size flathead in there just rotated

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.679 
size flathead in there just rotated
clockwise<00:01:29.460> or<00:01:29.880> counter<00:01:30.060> clockwise<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
clockwise or counter clockwise and

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.230 
clockwise or counter clockwise and
you'll<00:01:30.780> separate<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.799> slowly<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.119> almost

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
you'll separate it slowly so it's almost

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.179 
you'll separate it slowly so it's almost
loosen<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> Torx<00:01:34.460> screws<00:01:35.659> diagonally<00:01:36.659> slowly

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
loosen the Torx screws diagonally slowly

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.530 
loosen the Torx screws diagonally slowly
this<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.340> what<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> actual<00:01:38.939> fuel<00:01:39.180> filter

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
this is what the actual fuel filter

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.690 
this is what the actual fuel filter
looks<00:01:39.840> like<00:01:41.060> in<00:01:42.060> my<00:01:42.869> model<00:01:43.290> year<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.740> recommend

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
looks like in my model year I recommend

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.370 
looks like in my model year I recommend
