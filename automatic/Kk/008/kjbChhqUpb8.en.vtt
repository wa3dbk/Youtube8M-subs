rear<00:01:46.530> facing<00:01:46.740> camera<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.759> secondary<00:01:48.240> Mike

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
rear facing camera the secondary Mike

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.410 
rear facing camera the secondary Mike
and<00:01:48.659> flash<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:50.009> main<00:01:50.490> features<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
and flash so the main features of the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.660 
and flash so the main features of the
bandshell<00:01:51.689> are<00:01:52.049> twofold<00:01:52.290> one<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:53.340> has<00:01:53.520> an

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
bandshell are twofold one it has an

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.880 
bandshell are twofold one it has an
integrated<00:01:53.880> kickstand<00:01:54.659> which<00:01:54.899> pops<00:01:55.320> out<00:01:55.590> like

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
integrated kickstand which pops out like

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.069 
integrated kickstand which pops out like
so<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:57.149> that's<00:01:57.299> really<00:01:57.570> only<00:01:57.689> one<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
so but that's really only one of the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.929 
so but that's really only one of the
features<00:01:58.409> what<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.159> cool<00:01:59.460> about<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
features what is cool about the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.149 
features what is cool about the
bandshell<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.810> features<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.350> amplifying

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
bandshell is it features this amplifying

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.609 
bandshell is it features this amplifying
sound<00:02:02.700> channel<00:02:03.360> at<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.930> bottom<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.469> you

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
sound channel at the bottom that you

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.520 
sound channel at the bottom that you
slide<00:02:05.130> out<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.630> let's<00:02:06.840> first<00:02:07.110> put<00:02:07.439> it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
slide out like so so let's first put it

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.400 
slide out like so so let's first put it
away<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.829> get<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.399> some<00:02:08.700> music<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.050> can<00:02:10.229> show

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
away and get to some music so I can show

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.530 
away and get to some music so I can show
you<00:02:10.470> exactly<00:02:10.920> how<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.370> works<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:12.300> I'm<00:02:12.360> going<00:02:12.420> to

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
you exactly how it works so I'm going to

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.770 
you exactly how it works so I'm going to
go<00:02:12.629> into<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.870> music<00:02:13.050> player

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
go into the music player

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.309 
go into the music player
and<00:02:14.110> just<00:02:14.650> play<00:02:14.890> song<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.930> turn<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:17.170> down<00:02:17.260> just

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
and just play song and turn it down just

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.490 
and just play song and turn it down just
a<00:02:17.590> little<00:02:17.709> bit<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.400> that's<00:02:18.520> at<00:02:18.760> normal<00:02:19.240> volume

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
a little bit so that's at normal volume

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.530 
a little bit so that's at normal volume
about<00:02:20.500> twenty-five<00:02:20.980> percent<00:02:21.190> when<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.120> slide

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
about twenty-five percent when I slide

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.199 
about twenty-five percent when I slide
the<00:02:22.780> door<00:02:22.990> out<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.590> angle<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:24.550> towards<00:02:25.120> me

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
the door out and angle this towards me

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.090 
the door out and angle this towards me
it's<00:02:25.810> going<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:25.990> be<00:02:26.110> hard<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.470> kind<00:02:26.740> of<00:02:26.800> pick<00:02:26.980> it

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
it's going to be hard to kind of pick it

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.059 
it's going to be hard to kind of pick it
up<00:02:27.220> on<00:02:27.430> camera<00:02:27.720> but<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.990> can<00:02:29.230> also<00:02:29.380> pop<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:29.980> up

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
up on camera but I can also pop it up

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.130 
up on camera but I can also pop it up
with<00:02:30.220> kickstand<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:31.300> do<00:02:31.480> get<00:02:31.660> some<00:02:31.900> sound

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
with kickstand you do get some sound

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.949 
with kickstand you do get some sound
amplification<00:02:32.910> from<00:02:33.910> this<00:02:34.150> little<00:02:34.390> channel

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
amplification from this little channel

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.540 
amplification from this little channel
which<00:02:35.080> is<00:02:35.110> now<00:02:35.380> redirecting<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.310> sound

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
which is now redirecting the sound

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.770 
which is now redirecting the sound
towards<00:02:37.239> me<00:02:37.569> instead<00:02:38.350> of<00:02:38.410> away<00:02:38.650> from<00:02:38.860> me<00:02:39.190> so

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
towards me instead of away from me so

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.830 
towards me instead of away from me so
again<00:02:40.780> slide<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.650> in<00:02:41.970> lock<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:43.239> place<00:02:43.390> and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
again slide it in lock it in place and

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.890 
again slide it in lock it in place and
there's<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.770> sound<00:02:44.980> level<00:02:47.160> pop<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.340> out<00:02:48.900> lock

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
there's the sound level pop it out lock

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.800 
there's the sound level pop it out lock
it<00:02:50.080> in<00:02:50.200> place<00:02:50.760> go<00:02:51.760> back<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.060> my<00:02:52.180> music<00:02:52.420> player

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
it in place go back to my music player

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.120 
it in place go back to my music player
and<00:02:53.220> then<00:02:54.540> there's<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.810> difference<00:02:56.130> it's

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
and then there's the difference it's

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.430 
and then there's the difference it's
minimal<00:02:57.550> difference<00:02:57.730> but<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.810> there<00:02:59.170> you

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
minimal difference but it is there you

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.170 
minimal difference but it is there you
know<00:02:59.620> if<00:02:59.739> you're<00:02:59.860> someone<00:03:00.130> that<00:03:00.190> just<00:03:00.519> doesn't

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
know if you're someone that just doesn't

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.009 
know if you're someone that just doesn't
