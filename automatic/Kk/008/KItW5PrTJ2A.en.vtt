confident<00:00:21.000> here<00:00:21.240> because<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.510> don't<00:00:21.630> think<00:00:21.869> I

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
confident here because I don't think I

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.810 
confident here because I don't think I
have<00:00:22.199> anything<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.529> 1/8<00:00:22.920> kill<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.310> guy<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.789> I

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
have anything to 1/8 kill this guy and I

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.910 
have anything to 1/8 kill this guy and I
don't<00:00:23.880> want<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.240> take<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> psychic<00:00:24.900> move<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.890> I

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
don't want to take a psychic move so I

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.950 
don't want to take a psychic move so I
decided<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.369> switch<00:00:26.640> I'm<00:00:27.090> thinking<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.779> he

it's<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.819> pretty<00:03:03.030> nice<00:03:03.239> play<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.750> do<00:03:04.109> have<00:03:04.349> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
it's a pretty nice play I do have the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.929 
it's a pretty nice play I do have the
brick<00:03:04.680> break<00:03:04.889> which<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.159> super<00:03:05.400> effective<00:03:05.819> and

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
brick break which is super effective and

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.539 
brick break which is super effective and
aside<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.329> to<00:03:06.510> go<00:03:06.629> for<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.109> see<00:03:07.400> how<00:03:08.400> much

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
aside just to go for it to see how much

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.220 
aside just to go for it to see how much
it<00:03:08.730> would<00:03:08.790> do<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.299> you<00:03:09.540> know<00:03:09.659> I'm<00:03:09.930> kind<00:03:10.169> of

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
it would do and you know I'm kind of

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.170 
it would do and you know I'm kind of
figuring<00:03:10.379> she<00:03:10.650> might<00:03:10.829> try<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.069> kill<00:03:11.310> me<00:03:11.459> but

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
figuring she might try to kill me but

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.520 
figuring she might try to kill me but
instead<00:03:12.329> she<00:03:12.629> set<00:03:12.780> up<00:03:12.870> stealth<00:03:13.109> rocks<00:03:13.379> and

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
instead she set up stealth rocks and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.679 
instead she set up stealth rocks and
that's<00:03:13.650> pretty<00:03:13.919> nice<00:03:14.129> I<00:03:14.879> don't<00:03:15.329> really<00:03:15.480> know

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
that's pretty nice I don't really know

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.719 
that's pretty nice I don't really know
what<00:03:16.019> registeel<00:03:16.409> is<00:03:16.560> going<00:03:16.739> to<00:03:16.859> do<00:03:17.099> now<00:03:17.370> but<00:03:17.669> I

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:17.729 
what registeel is going to do now but I

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.210 
what registeel is going to do now but I
don't<00:03:17.819> I<00:03:18.419> kind<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.840> think<00:03:19.079> she<00:03:19.319> might<00:03:19.560> like<00:03:19.829> not

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
don't I kind of think she might like not

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.039 
don't I kind of think she might like not
attack<00:03:20.639> me<00:03:20.879> and<00:03:21.030> do<00:03:21.180> something<00:03:21.629> else<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:22.019> I

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
attack me and do something else so I

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.619 
attack me and do something else so I
decide<00:03:22.379> to<00:03:22.409> go<00:03:22.620> for<00:03:22.650> Swords<00:03:23.220> Dance<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.699> she<00:03:24.479> is

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
decide to go for Swords Dance and she is

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.539 
decide to go for Swords Dance and she is
gonna<00:03:24.810> go<00:03:25.019> for<00:03:25.199> a<00:03:25.260> curse<00:03:25.590> which<00:03:25.859> is<00:03:25.979> awesome<00:03:26.459> I

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
gonna go for a curse which is awesome I

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.099 
gonna go for a curse which is awesome I
was<00:03:26.639> actually<00:03:26.819> thinking<00:03:27.000> maybe<00:03:27.359> rest<00:03:27.810> was

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
was actually thinking maybe rest was

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.469 
was actually thinking maybe rest was
coming<00:03:28.470> but<00:03:28.819> because<00:03:29.819> I<00:03:29.879> know<00:03:29.939> Reggie<00:03:30.209> doesn't

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.479 
coming but because I know Reggie doesn't

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.300 
coming but because I know Reggie doesn't
have<00:03:30.659> like<00:03:30.870> reliable<00:03:31.530> recovery<00:03:31.949> can<00:03:32.159> only

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
have like reliable recovery can only

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.250 
have like reliable recovery can only
have<00:03:32.549> access<00:03:32.699> to<00:03:32.909> rest<00:03:33.359> I<00:03:33.479> don't<00:03:33.659> I<00:03:33.959> think<00:03:34.199> I

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
have access to rest I don't I think I

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.409 
have access to rest I don't I think I
can<00:03:34.409> learn<00:03:34.530> rest<00:03:34.829> I'm<00:03:35.010> not<00:03:35.159> sure<00:03:35.310> whatever<00:03:36.120> but

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
can learn rest I'm not sure whatever but

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:37.819 
can learn rest I'm not sure whatever but
anyway<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:36.810> now<00:03:37.169> that<00:03:37.229> I<00:03:37.349> have<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.560> storage

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
anyway so now that I have the storage

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.009 
anyway so now that I have the storage
dance<00:03:38.099> and<00:03:38.400> she<00:03:38.879> gets<00:03:39.060> off<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.269> curse<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.720> still

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
dance and she gets off a curse I still

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.170 
dance and she gets off a curse I still
have<00:03:40.199> like<00:03:40.409> I<00:03:40.769> still<00:03:41.370> got<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:41.519> better<00:03:41.849> end<00:03:42.090> of

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
have like I still got a better end of

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.659 
have like I still got a better end of
that<00:03:42.239> deal<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.319> tried<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.739> ko<00:03:44.129> her<00:03:44.310> now<00:03:44.489> with

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
that deal and I tried it ko her now with

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.789 
that deal and I tried it ko her now with
brick<00:03:44.879> break<00:03:45.120> but<00:03:45.359> she<00:03:45.540> survives<00:03:46.139> and<00:03:46.680> that

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
brick break but she survives and that

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.349 
brick break but she survives and that
kind<00:03:47.099> of<00:03:47.159> stinks

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
kind of stinks

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.179 
kind of stinks
but<00:03:48.659> at<00:03:48.750> least<00:03:48.900> her<00:03:49.169> registeel<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.829> low<00:03:50.069> enough

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189 
but at least her registeel is low enough

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.830 
but at least her registeel is low enough
that<00:03:50.549> pretty<00:03:50.729> much<00:03:50.819> anything<00:03:51.120> can<00:03:51.299> come<00:03:51.689> in

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
that pretty much anything can come in

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.780 
that pretty much anything can come in
and<00:03:51.989> revenge<00:03:52.259> kill<00:03:52.560> I'm<00:03:53.040> gonna<00:03:53.310> go<00:03:53.489> out<00:03:53.639> into

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
and revenge kill I'm gonna go out into

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.149 
and revenge kill I'm gonna go out into
my<00:03:53.909> hitmonlee<00:03:54.540> because<00:03:54.989> I<00:03:55.019> can<00:03:55.530> just<00:03:55.769> go<00:03:55.889> close

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
my hitmonlee because I can just go close

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.189 
my hitmonlee because I can just go close

this registeel and close combat will

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.509 
this registeel and close combat will
cripple<00:04:01.229> just<00:04:01.620> about<00:04:01.799> anything<00:04:02.159> that's
