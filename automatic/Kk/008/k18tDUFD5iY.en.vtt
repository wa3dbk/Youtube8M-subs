00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:10.049 
I have two sets of slits here a double

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.369 
I have two sets of slits here a double
slit<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.889> single<00:00:11.219> slit<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:12.420> slits<00:00:12.840> have

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
slit and a single slit the slits have

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.220

the same width and I hope you can see
over<00:00:16.410> here<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:17.810> will<00:00:18.810> shine<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.109> laser<00:00:19.380> beam<00:00:19.859> at

these slits to show you their

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.230

but<00:00:25.020> before<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.500> do<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.710> let's<00:00:26.369> talk<00:00:26.580> about

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
but before we do that let's talk about

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.870 
but before we do that let's talk about
what<00:00:27.060> we<00:00:27.270> would<00:00:27.420> expect<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:28.699> we<00:00:29.699> have

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
what we would expect to see we have

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.609 
what we would expect to see we have
learned<00:00:30.180> that<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.990> double<00:00:31.350> slit

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
learned that for double slit

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.000 
learned that for double slit
interference<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.789> equation<00:00:33.300> we<00:00:33.539> use<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.230> d

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.719 
interference the equation we use is d
sine<00:00:35.430> theta<00:00:35.820> equals<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.809> M<00:00:37.020> lambda<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.920> for

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:38.729 
sine theta equals to M lambda and for

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:42.919 
sine theta equals to M lambda and for
small<00:00:39.210> angles<00:00:40.159> we<00:00:41.159> can<00:00:41.370> say<00:00:41.609> that<00:00:41.940> sine<00:00:42.539> theta

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:42.929 
small angles we can say that sine theta

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.450 
small angles we can say that sine theta
is<00:00:43.399> y<00:00:44.399> over<00:00:44.429> L<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.170> will<00:00:46.229> become<00:00:46.559> T<00:00:47.129> times

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
is y over L so this will become T times

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.939 
is y over L so this will become T times
y<00:00:47.699> over<00:00:47.729> L<00:00:48.239> equals<00:00:48.839> to<00:00:49.079> M<00:00:49.350> lambda<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.600> we<00:00:51.600> get

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
y over L equals to M lambda and we get

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.139 
y over L equals to M lambda and we get
bright<00:00:52.949> fringes<00:00:53.519> if<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:55.440> M<00:00:55.649> equals<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.670> zero

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.230 
in the wavelength of the light is a
constant<00:01:13.020> then<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.250> Y<00:01:14.610> would<00:01:15.030> be

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
constant then the Y would be

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.150 
constant then the Y would be
proportional<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.020> M<00:01:16.490> for<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.550> bright<00:01:17.850> fringes

label<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.050> M<00:02:40.230> values<00:02:40.860> on<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.220> screen<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.940> would

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
label the M values on the screen I would

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.170 
label the M values on the screen I would
get<00:02:42.480> zero<00:02:43.320> for<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.830> bright<00:02:44.040> fringe<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.640> then

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
get zero for the bright fringe and then

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.800 
get zero for the bright fringe and then
one<00:02:45.920> two<00:02:47.540> three<00:02:48.540> for<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.560> dark<00:02:49.800> fringes

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
one two three for the dark fringes

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.450 
one two three for the dark fringes
that's<00:02:51.810> why<00:02:52.050> we<00:02:52.260> have<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.440> central<00:02:52.950> maximum

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
that's why we have a central maximum

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.150 
that's why we have a central maximum
that<00:02:53.730> is<00:02:53.880> twice<00:02:54.210> as<00:02:54.270> wide<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:55.080> these<00:02:55.920> other

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
that is twice as wide and these other

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.960 
that is twice as wide and these other
fringes<00:02:56.670> they<00:02:57.120> have<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.510> same<00:02:57.720> size<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.970> in

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
fringes they have the same size and in

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.150 
fringes they have the same size and in
terms<00:03:00.240> of<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.450> intensity<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.560> fringes

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
terms of the intensity of the fringes

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.330 
terms of the intensity of the fringes
for<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:03.690> double-slit<00:03:04.380> interference<00:03:04.440> it

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
for the double-slit interference it

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.880 
for the double-slit interference it
turned<00:03:05.640> out<00:03:05.820> that<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.840> fringes<00:03:07.380> they<00:03:07.620> have

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
turned out that the fringes they have

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.940 
turned out that the fringes they have
just<00:03:08.250> about<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.700> same<00:03:09.000> intensity<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.620> all

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
just about the same intensity so all

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.160 
just about the same intensity so all
these<00:03:11.460> spots<00:03:11.910> not<00:03:12.270> only<00:03:12.510> they<00:03:12.630> have<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.870> same

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
these spots not only they have the same

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.650 
these spots not only they have the same
size<00:03:13.470> but<00:03:13.920> also<00:03:13.980> they<00:03:14.520> have<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.970> just<00:03:15.420> about

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
size but also they have this just about

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.710 
size but also they have this just about
the<00:03:15.840> same<00:03:16.080> brightness<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:17.270> for<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.360> single

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720

the same brightness and for the single
slit<00:03:18.900> diffraction<00:03:19.010> pattern<00:03:20.010> not<00:03:20.580> only<00:03:20.880> the

central<00:03:21.450> maximum<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.080> twice<00:03:22.410> as<00:03:22.440> wide<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:23.370> is

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
central maximum is twice as wide it is

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.940 
central maximum is twice as wide it is
also<00:03:24.150> much<00:03:24.600> brighter<00:03:25.080> than<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.920> other

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
also much brighter than the other

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.140 
also much brighter than the other
fringes<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.290> this<00:03:28.290> next<00:03:28.560> next<00:03:29.250> fringe<00:03:29.550> is<00:03:29.760> the

lot<00:03:30.360> weaker<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.410> next<00:03:31.709> one<00:03:31.890> is<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.070> lot

weaker in the weaker notice how this

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.210 
weaker in the weaker notice how this
these<00:03:36.420> slits<00:03:36.900> they<00:03:37.230> all<00:03:37.410> have<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.770> same<00:03:37.980> width

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
these slits they all have the same width

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.880 
these slits they all have the same width
but<00:03:39.030> these<00:03:39.360> patterns<00:03:39.989> produced<00:03:40.560> by<00:03:40.830> the

but these patterns produced by the
double<00:03:41.310> slit<00:03:41.610> they<00:03:42.330> are<00:03:42.510> very<00:03:43.470> close<00:03:43.890> together

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
double slit they are very close together

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.449 
double slit they are very close together
but<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.570> for<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.290> pattern<00:03:46.739> for<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.070> single

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
slit diffraction is a lot wider this is

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.320 
slit diffraction is a lot wider this is
because<00:03:52.380> if<00:03:52.620> for<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:52.920> same<00:03:53.250> L<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:54.090> same

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
because if for the same L the same

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.020 
because if for the same L the same

same order number same wavelengths B
times<00:04:00.660> L<00:04:01.019> would<00:04:01.350> have<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.769> be<00:04:01.890> a<00:04:01.920> constant

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
times L would have to be a constant

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.699 
times L would have to be a constant
this<00:04:04.019> means<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:05.340> bigger<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.120> D<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:07.230> smaller

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
this means the bigger the D the smaller

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.550 
this means the bigger the D the smaller
the<00:04:08.100> Y<00:04:08.400> which<00:04:09.030> means<00:04:09.360> that<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.780> bigger<00:04:10.019> your<00:04:10.260> D

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
the Y which means that the bigger your D

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.030 
the Y which means that the bigger your D
the<00:04:11.190> closer<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:12.540> fringes<00:04:13.260> on<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.680> screen

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
the closer the fringes on the screen

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.930 
the closer the fringes on the screen
because<00:04:14.190> Y<00:04:14.610> is<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.090> distance<00:04:15.480> on<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.690> screen

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
because Y is the distance on the screen

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.890 
because Y is the distance on the screen
remember<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.060> interference<00:04:18.690> pattern

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
remember the interference pattern

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.110 
remember the interference pattern
produced<00:04:19.440> by<00:04:19.650> these<00:04:19.709> half-circle<00:04:20.609> wavelets

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.440 
produced by these half-circle wavelets
Y<00:04:21.989> increase<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.860> slit<00:04:23.220> separation<00:04:23.450> the

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
Y increase the slit separation the

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.130 
Y increase the slit separation the
interference<00:04:25.169> fringes<00:04:25.710> get<00:04:26.250> closer<00:04:26.640> together

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
interference fringes get closer together

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.050 
interference fringes get closer together
just<00:04:28.140> as<00:04:28.350> we<00:04:28.560> expect<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.250> have<00:04:29.490> from<00:04:29.880> the

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
just as we expect to have from the

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.970 
just as we expect to have from the
equations<00:04:31.970> if<00:04:32.970> all<00:04:33.390> of<00:04:33.660> these

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
equations if all of these

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.970 
equations if all of these
let's<00:04:34.220> have<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:35.030> same<00:04:35.270> width<00:04:35.540> then<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.620> slit

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
let's have the same width then the slit

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.510 
let's have the same width then the slit
separation<00:04:37.250> D<00:04:38.200> here<00:04:39.200> is<00:04:39.380> bigger<00:04:39.950> than<00:04:40.370> the

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
separation D here is bigger than the

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.170 
separation D here is bigger than the
slit<00:04:40.910> width<00:04:41.330> D<00:04:41.780> over<00:04:42.470> there<00:04:42.740> this<00:04:43.610> is<00:04:43.820> why<00:04:44.120> the

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
slit width D over there this is why the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.200 
slit width D over there this is why the
pattern<00:04:44.780> on<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.020> screen<00:04:45.200> is<00:04:45.680> wider<00:04:46.370> over

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
pattern on the screen is wider over

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.860 
pattern on the screen is wider over
there<00:04:47.720> because<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:48.890> the<00:04:49.130> D<00:04:49.490> is<00:04:49.850> smaller<00:04:50.360> the

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
there because the the D is smaller the

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.440 
there because the the D is smaller the
smaller<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:51.440> D<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:52.010> bigger<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.430> y<00:04:52.610> on<00:04:52.910> this

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
smaller the D the bigger the y on this

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.960 
smaller the D the bigger the y on this
side<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:54.350> D<00:04:54.560> is<00:04:54.740> bigger<00:04:55.070> therefore<00:04:55.820> the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
side the D is bigger therefore the

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.770 
side the D is bigger therefore the
fringes<00:04:56.450> have<00:04:56.750> to<00:04:56.930> be<00:04:57.050> closer<00:04:57.470> together<00:04:57.830> and

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
fringes have to be closer together and

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.140 
fringes have to be closer together and
if<00:04:59.780> we<00:04:59.930> consider<00:05:00.410> this<00:05:00.770> case<00:05:01.100> more<00:05:01.460> carefully

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
if we consider this case more carefully

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.140 
if we consider this case more carefully
we<00:05:02.630> can<00:05:02.660> see<00:05:03.020> that<00:05:03.230> the<00:05:03.410> double<00:05:03.770> slit<00:05:04.150> actually

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
we can see that the double slit actually

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.410 
we can see that the double slit actually
consists<00:05:05.750> of<00:05:05.840> two<00:05:05.900> single<00:05:06.800> slits<00:05:07.130> so<00:05:07.850> not<00:05:08.120> only

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
consists of two single slits so not only

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.540 
consists of two single slits so not only
do<00:05:08.600> we<00:05:08.720> get<00:05:09.020> an<00:05:09.200> interference<00:05:09.950> pattern<00:05:10.190> like

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
do we get an interference pattern like

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.930 
do we get an interference pattern like
this<00:05:10.660> but<00:05:11.660> also<00:05:12.140> we<00:05:12.500> get<00:05:12.650> two<00:05:13.100> diffraction

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
this but also we get two diffraction

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.520 
this but also we get two diffraction
patterns<00:05:14.420> from<00:05:14.990> the<00:05:15.890> two<00:05:16.220> single<00:05:16.880> slit<00:05:17.530> so

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
patterns from the two single slit so

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.700 
patterns from the two single slit so
each<00:05:18.800> slit<00:05:19.220> gives<00:05:19.580> us<00:05:19.760> the<00:05:19.970> one<00:05:20.710> diffraction

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
each slit gives us the one diffraction

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.190 
each slit gives us the one diffraction
pattern<00:05:22.100> the<00:05:22.580> other<00:05:22.760> one<00:05:23.060> gives<00:05:23.510> us<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.780> same

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
pattern the other one gives us the same

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.290 
pattern the other one gives us the same
diffraction<00:05:24.890> pattern<00:05:25.220> but<00:05:25.400> shifted<00:05:26.030> by<00:05:26.270> a

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
diffraction pattern but shifted by a

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.520 
diffraction pattern but shifted by a
distance<00:05:27.110> D<00:05:28.570> but<00:05:29.570> because<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.170> slit

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
distance D but because the slit

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.860 
distance D but because the slit
separation<00:05:30.740> D<00:05:31.550> is<00:05:31.850> going<00:05:32.120> to<00:05:32.180> be<00:05:32.300> much<00:05:32.540> smaller

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
separation D is going to be much smaller

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.950 
separation D is going to be much smaller
usually<00:05:33.830> than<00:05:34.430> the<00:05:34.760> pattern<00:05:35.210> on<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:35.660> screen

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
usually than the pattern on the screen

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.240 
usually than the pattern on the screen
the<00:05:36.740> Y<00:05:37.070> on<00:05:37.460> the<00:05:37.700> screen<00:05:38.060> so<00:05:38.630> if<00:05:38.960> the<00:05:39.230> D<00:05:39.530> is<00:05:39.860> much

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
the Y on the screen so if the D is much

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.050 
the Y on the screen so if the D is much
smaller<00:05:40.640> than<00:05:40.940> the<00:05:41.150> Y<00:05:41.480> that<00:05:41.930> means<00:05:42.580> this<00:05:43.580> the

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
smaller than the Y that means this the

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.660 
smaller than the Y that means this the
two<00:05:44.680> diffraction<00:05:45.680> patterns<00:05:46.070> by<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.370> two

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:46.670 
two diffraction patterns by the two

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.410 
two diffraction patterns by the two
slits<00:05:47.120> are<00:05:47.420> only<00:05:48.160> shifted<00:05:49.160> by<00:05:49.640> a<00:05:49.850> little<00:05:50.270> bit

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
slits are only shifted by a little bit

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.150 
slits are only shifted by a little bit
which<00:05:50.780> means<00:05:51.050> those<00:05:51.230> two<00:05:51.290> patterns<00:05:51.710> are<00:05:52.070> they

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
which means those two patterns are they

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.080 
which means those two patterns are they
almost<00:05:52.850> overlap<00:05:53.540> completely<00:05:54.820> this<00:05:55.820> means

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
almost overlap completely this means

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.880 
almost overlap completely this means
that<00:05:56.420> when<00:05:56.570> we<00:05:56.660> consider<00:05:57.140> what<00:05:57.410> we<00:05:57.530> will<00:05:57.680> see

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
that when we consider what we will see

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.100 
that when we consider what we will see
on<00:05:58.040> the<00:05:58.160> screen<00:05:58.190> form<00:05:58.910> a<00:05:59.180> double<00:05:59.660> slit

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
on the screen form a double slit

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.230 
on the screen form a double slit
interference<00:06:00.440> we<00:06:01.340> just<00:06:01.550> have<00:06:01.730> to<00:06:01.850> consider

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
interference we just have to consider

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.540 
interference we just have to consider
these<00:06:02.810> two<00:06:03.290> overlapping<00:06:04.100> with<00:06:04.850> each<00:06:04.880> other

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
these two overlapping with each other

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.340 
these two overlapping with each other
so<00:06:07.550> for<00:06:07.850> the<00:06:07.940> double<00:06:08.270> slit<00:06:08.510> interference

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
so for the double slit interference

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.830 
so for the double slit interference
this<00:06:10.100> will<00:06:10.400> be<00:06:10.550> what<00:06:10.760> we<00:06:10.910> see<00:06:11.180> on<00:06:11.330> the<00:06:11.450> screen

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
this will be what we see on the screen

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.500 
this will be what we see on the screen
it<00:06:12.320> is<00:06:12.560> a<00:06:12.590> combination<00:06:13.070> of<00:06:13.520> this<00:06:13.850> pattern<00:06:14.330> and

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
it is a combination of this pattern and

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.270 
it is a combination of this pattern and
that<00:06:14.990> one<00:06:15.260> so<00:06:15.950> we<00:06:15.980> get<00:06:16.280> the<00:06:17.260> small<00:06:18.260> almost<00:06:18.680> the

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
that one so we get the small almost the

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.520 
that one so we get the small almost the
same<00:06:19.460> distance<00:06:19.970> the<00:06:20.150> fringes<00:06:20.870> same<00:06:21.260> size

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
same distance the fringes same size

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.280 
same distance the fringes same size
fringes<00:06:22.100> under<00:06:22.910> the<00:06:23.240> envelope<00:06:23.810> of<00:06:24.050> this

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
fringes under the envelope of this

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.160 
fringes under the envelope of this
single<00:06:25.040> slit<00:06:25.370> diffraction<00:06:25.400> pattern<00:06:26.390> so<00:06:27.020> we

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
single slit diffraction pattern so we

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.880 
single slit diffraction pattern so we
will<00:06:27.320> see<00:06:27.560> groups<00:06:27.920> of<00:06:28.250> bright<00:06:28.670> fringes<00:06:29.890> like

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
will see groups of bright fringes like

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.890 
will see groups of bright fringes like
these<00:06:32.440> the<00:06:33.440> large<00:06:33.740> pattern<00:06:34.310> is<00:06:34.630> produced<00:06:35.630> by

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
these the large pattern is produced by

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.890 
these the large pattern is produced by
the<00:06:36.010> single<00:06:37.010> slit<00:06:37.220> diffraction<00:06:37.480> the<00:06:38.480> little

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
the single slit diffraction the little

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.530 
the single slit diffraction the little
pattern<00:06:39.320> over<00:06:39.620> here<00:06:39.700> is<00:06:40.700> produced<00:06:41.270> by<00:06:41.480> the

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
pattern over here is produced by the

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.800 
pattern over here is produced by the
double-slit<00:06:42.290> interference<00:06:43.450> right<00:06:44.450> now

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
double-slit interference right now

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.390 
double-slit interference right now
this<00:06:44.960> is<00:06:45.200> the<00:06:45.440> single<00:06:45.889> slit<00:06:46.190> diffraction

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
this is the single slit diffraction

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.150 
this is the single slit diffraction
pattern<00:06:47.270> so<00:06:47.840> as<00:06:47.930> you<00:06:48.080> can<00:06:48.230> see<00:06:48.290> the<00:06:48.740> central

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 
pattern so as you can see the central

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.090 
pattern so as you can see the central
maximum<00:06:49.730> is<00:06:49.970> twice<00:06:50.360> as<00:06:50.600> wide<00:06:50.870> as<00:06:51.320> the<00:06:51.889> other

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
maximum is twice as wide as the other

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.400 
maximum is twice as wide as the other
bright<00:06:52.490> fringes<00:06:52.940> and<00:06:53.270> you<00:06:53.870> should<00:06:54.110> be<00:06:54.200> able<00:06:54.290> to

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
bright fringes and you should be able to

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.650 
bright fringes and you should be able to
see<00:06:54.680> at<00:06:54.830> least<00:06:54.980> one<00:06:55.190> set<00:06:55.790> of<00:06:55.940> bright<00:06:56.180> fringes

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
see at least one set of bright fringes

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.860 
see at least one set of bright fringes
on<00:06:56.990> each<00:06:57.200> side<00:06:57.590> of<00:06:57.800> the<00:06:58.120> central<00:06:59.120> maximum<00:06:59.630> and

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
on each side of the central maximum and

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.350 
on each side of the central maximum and
you<00:07:00.080> may<00:07:00.230> be<00:07:00.290> able<00:07:00.500> to<00:07:00.620> see<00:07:00.950> also<00:07:01.190> the<00:07:01.639> second

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
you may be able to see also the second

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.670 
you may be able to see also the second
set<00:07:02.600> of<00:07:02.630> bright<00:07:02.960> fringes<00:07:03.410> on<00:07:03.680> the<00:07:03.830> two<00:07:04.820> sides

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 
set of bright fringes on the two sides

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.530 
set of bright fringes on the two sides
now<00:07:06.680> I'm<00:07:06.860> going<00:07:07.130> to<00:07:07.250> change<00:07:07.550> the<00:07:07.880> slits<00:07:08.330> to

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:08.540 
now I'm going to change the slits to

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.810 
now I'm going to change the slits to
double<00:07:09.169> slits<00:07:09.470> but<00:07:09.740> the<00:07:09.830> same<00:07:10.100> with<00:07:10.370> slits

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:10.820 
double slits but the same with slits

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.370 
double slits but the same with slits
right<00:07:12.190> now<00:07:13.190> these<00:07:13.520> are<00:07:13.820> the<00:07:14.110> double<00:07:15.110> slit

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
right now these are the double slit

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.830 
right now these are the double slit
interference<00:07:15.770> pattern<00:07:16.580> because<00:07:17.300> the<00:07:17.330> slit

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 
interference pattern because the slit

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.969 
interference pattern because the slit
width<00:07:18.169> is<00:07:18.560> the<00:07:18.880> same<00:07:19.880> as<00:07:20.389> the<00:07:20.690> single<00:07:21.169> slit<00:07:21.530> the

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:21.979 
width is the same as the single slit the

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.909 
width is the same as the single slit the
previous<00:07:22.400> one<00:07:22.639> so<00:07:22.880> the<00:07:23.479> big<00:07:23.780> pattern<00:07:24.290> is<00:07:24.500> still

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919 
previous one so the big pattern is still

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:27.460 
previous one so the big pattern is still
the<00:07:25.130> same<00:07:25.370> as<00:07:25.610> before<00:07:25.790> but<00:07:26.630> inside<00:07:27.200> the<00:07:27.320> big

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:27.470 
the same as before but inside the big

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.129 
the same as before but inside the big
pattern<00:07:27.919> is<00:07:28.070> you<00:07:28.220> can<00:07:28.400> see<00:07:28.669> there<00:07:29.360> are<00:07:29.600> lots<00:07:29.870> of

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:30.139 
pattern is you can see there are lots of

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:33.159 
pattern is you can see there are lots of
those<00:07:30.350> little<00:07:30.950> equal<00:07:31.669> distance<00:07:32.210> apart<00:07:32.360> equal

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:33.169 
those little equal distance apart equal

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:36.520 
those little equal distance apart equal
with<00:07:33.410> low<00:07:34.220> fringes<00:07:35.060> those<00:07:35.720> little<00:07:36.110> fringes

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:36.530 
with low fringes those little fringes

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.340 
with low fringes those little fringes
are<00:07:36.889> caused<00:07:37.220> by<00:07:37.520> the<00:07:37.580> double<00:07:38.120> slit<00:07:38.450> so<00:07:39.139> the

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:39.350 
are caused by the double slit so the

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.320 
are caused by the double slit so the
double<00:07:39.770> slit<00:07:40.010> interference<00:07:40.340> pattern<00:07:41.150> are

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:41.330 
double slit interference pattern are

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.430 
double slit interference pattern are
those<00:07:41.540> little<00:07:41.930> thoughts<00:07:42.470> inside<00:07:43.310> the<00:07:44.440> single

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 
those little thoughts inside the single

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.700 
those little thoughts inside the single
slit<00:07:45.740> diffraction<00:07:45.770> pattern
