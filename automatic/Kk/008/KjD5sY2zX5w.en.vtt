00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.550 
well for me and it's easy to whisk a few
pictures<00:05:08.770> of<00:05:08.979> material<00:05:09.520> just<00:05:09.820> measure<00:05:10.060> the

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
pictures of material just measure the

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.300

shades of material and that's it and the
only<00:05:15.460> thing<00:05:15.639> I<00:05:15.729> have<00:05:15.940> to<00:05:16.060> watch<00:05:16.270> is<00:05:16.479> the<00:05:16.660> weight

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
only thing I have to watch is the weight

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.020 
only thing I have to watch is the weight
of<00:05:16.900> it<00:05:17.229> so<00:05:17.500> if<00:05:17.620> I<00:05:17.800> burn<00:05:18.550> something's<00:05:18.940> a<00:05:18.970> bit

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
of it so if I burn something's a bit

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.969 
of it so if I burn something's a bit
heavy<00:05:19.360> I<00:05:19.510> put<00:05:19.750> in<00:05:19.870> a<00:05:19.960> group<00:05:20.199> of<00:05:20.320> watts<00:05:20.500> so<00:05:20.710> it

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
heavy I put in a group of watts so it

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.570 
heavy I put in a group of watts so it
can<00:05:21.190> be<00:05:21.280> posted<00:05:21.699> for<00:05:21.760> at<00:05:22.030> rate<00:05:22.300> instead<00:05:23.580> and
