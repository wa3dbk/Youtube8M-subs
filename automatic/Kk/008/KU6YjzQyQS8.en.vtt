00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
can see that there is some silver thread

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.520 
can see that there is some silver thread
woven<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.300> has<00:00:42.420> some<00:00:42.690> sparkle<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.200> it

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
soft stretchy material which I guess is

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.930 
soft stretchy material which I guess is
to<00:00:48.210> make<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.510> look<00:00:48.539> more<00:00:48.870> relaxed<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.940> lastly

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
to make it look more relaxed and lastly

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.270 
to make it look more relaxed and lastly

that Isabel and Julie looks similar in
their<00:03:18.680> opinion<00:03:19.130> but<00:03:19.340> I<00:03:19.400> completely<00:03:20.000> disagree

only<00:03:25.220> similarity<00:03:25.760> is<00:03:26.389> that<00:03:26.420> both<00:03:26.900> of<00:03:26.930> them

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260

have<00:03:27.709> straight<00:03:28.130> blonde<00:03:28.489> hair<00:03:28.790> but<00:03:29.329> her<00:03:29.480> hair

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
have straight blonde hair but her hair

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.870 
have straight blonde hair but her hair
is<00:03:29.720> blonder<00:03:30.290> she<00:03:30.590> has<00:03:30.739> more<00:03:31.099> brown<00:03:31.400> highlights

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
is blonder she has more brown highlights

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.150 
is blonder she has more brown highlights
in<00:03:32.090> her<00:03:32.120> hair<00:03:32.239> and<00:03:32.630> hers<00:03:33.230> is<00:03:33.440> much<00:03:33.650> longer<00:03:33.889> and

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
in her hair and hers is much longer and

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.789 
in her hair and hers is much longer and
much<00:03:34.310> straighter<00:03:35.139> so<00:03:36.139> they<00:03:36.319> are<00:03:36.380> definitely

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
much straighter so they are definitely

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.559 
much straighter so they are definitely
not<00:03:37.069> similar<00:03:37.459> people<00:03:37.910> also<00:03:38.180> think<00:03:38.450> that

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
not similar people also think that

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.449 
not similar people also think that
Isabel<00:03:38.989> could<00:03:39.170> be<00:03:39.260> similar<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.620> my<00:03:39.829> Kenna<00:03:40.130> and

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
and she has dark blue eyes instead of

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.599 
and she has dark blue eyes instead of
dark<00:04:13.750> hazel<00:04:14.230> eyes<00:04:14.409> but<00:04:15.220> other<00:04:15.340> than<00:04:15.549> that

they could have done a little more
something<00:04:55.330> with<00:04:55.690> her<00:04:55.780> physical<00:04:56.229> appearance<00:04:56.320> I

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
something with her physical appearance I

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.279 
something with her physical appearance I
