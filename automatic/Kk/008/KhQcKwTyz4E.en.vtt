00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
already took the ball my whole person

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.880 
already took the ball my whole person
this<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> 16<00:01:12.150> gauge<00:01:12.420> eye<00:01:12.540> hurts<00:01:12.750> my<00:01:12.990> initial

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
this is a 16 gauge eye hurts my initial

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.520 
this is a 16 gauge eye hurts my initial
they<00:01:14.580> told<00:01:14.909> me<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.060> wait<00:01:15.240> six<00:01:15.630> weeks<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:16.200> I

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
going to be a 14 gauge not planning on

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.410 
going to be a 14 gauge not planning on
stretching<00:01:25.290> all<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.619> way<00:01:25.680> until<00:01:25.860> 10<00:01:26.220> gauge<00:01:26.490> if

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
stretching all the way until 10 gauge if
