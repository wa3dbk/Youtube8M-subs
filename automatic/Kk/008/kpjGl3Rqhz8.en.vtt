00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.969
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:14.700
 of trail running review dotcom today 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.700
 we are going to make the abrupt every day 7 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.670
 here you see them if you know the model 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.350
 previous 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.410
 you will quickly see what 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.430
 few changes for these 7 waterfalls so 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.100
 just some improvements and now let's see 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.780
 with respect to his previous model this is 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.000
 one of the classics of trail running 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.760
 used by many people especially that 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.390
 passes asphalt 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.680
 the earth 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.910
 and we are going to discover 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.329
 now those strengths 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.050
 You see they are quite flexible costs 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.530
 a little but 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.920
 flex also bounce fast in fact very 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.800
 fast they carry a sole on the plate 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.390
 we wanted to say a plate to prevent 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.119
 that the stones dig too much 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.710
 on only on this floor of the feet and 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:10.509
 three brands marked to facilitate 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.360
 bending though it 's really where they are 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.450
 flex 'is not behind this material 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.700
 you are these different parts 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:24.220
 Brooks says are the parts where more 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.840
 weight impacts here in the front 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.810
 of the metatarsals and here in the part 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.310
 where the whole leg is supported and what 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.950
 does this is to prevent a little that those 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.179
 stones that may appear in this 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.579
 part dissipate the pressure a bit like 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.149
 You see the sole with pretty heels 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.560
 prominent contours all the sole and 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.409
 changes compared to the previous version 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.440
 because here tacos have been included 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.810
 more multidirectional 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.630
 that favor in theory the grip on 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.240
 any situation is part of here 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.130
 central how do you see tacos I do not know if it 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.860
 comes to see that it favors a 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.869
 moving forward and starting 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.050
 from the back 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:17.070
 and all these these tacos 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.570
 put is a bit here against the grain to 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.020
 favor the grip when we enter 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.450
 heel on the ground 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.140
 and we step on material that you are using 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.260
 the group for 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.080
 for damping is the dna 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.650
 here you can see it is a material that 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.950
 against stronger we impact stronger 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.739
 energy returns us we have 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.220
 seen this material we have seen it in 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.260
 a kind of pool where we have not 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.409
 walked us but you can walk 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.019
 and if you do not do it little by little you sink 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.190
 but if instead you go fast and 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.709
 strong 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.140
 the material bounces and you do not get to 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.099
 to sink is quite curious to see it there 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.040
 several videos on the Internet about what you 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.470
 they show it as you see it will be but here 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.220
 different from the previous version more 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.220
 synthetic skin 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.780
 these strips here 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.380
 that reach the top and above all 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.270
 over all this axis a little crooked 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.730
 asymmetric 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.510
 as you see here, everything is a bit turned 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.540
 towards this part to tie the laces 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.520
 which in theory according to brooks here 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.420
 we have also won in terms of 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.910
 shoe features 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.400
 in front we have again 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.140
 very strong protections will do more 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.980
 marked still of hard plastic already 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.220
 directly and on the heel in the part 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.460
 inside 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.710
 here you see it 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.870
 well, directly 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:03.480
 go through hard plastic 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:06.150
 another of the improvements is this part 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.890
 from here of protection in the lows that 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.910
 in the previous version he did not have all the 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.700
 upper very light 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.890
 very breathable even this part of 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.389
 here is very bored 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:22.319
 to favor lava perspiration 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:24.509
 the cords also different respect 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:27.370
 to the previous version are cords that 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:31.540
 they established very flat 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.580
 and they do not have I do not know if you remember 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.360
 here they had an elastic part in the 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.040
 previous version to favor a little 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.350
 at some point then that will follow a 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.020
 little if the cord in this version so 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.780
 have removed and force the foot always to 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.570
 be under pressure as you see the tongue 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.270
 also incorporates this hole for 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.100
 pass the cord that many times what 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.410
 does it is to fix the tongue a little 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.960
 great detail I would say because there are people 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.850
 that the tongue will be chosen and through 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.590
 this system the tongue is more fixed 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:07.920
 or the tongue that is quite simple and 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.050
 with here 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.110
 a small mesh to prevent entry 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.020
 of Earth 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:19.020
 stones 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.020
 the inside of the of these waterfalls 7 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.930
 is very very comfortable with enough 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:29.020
 padded even the lower part 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.169
 there is also the quilt and as you see 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.050
 then seams but if you look at the 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.969
 quality is tremendous of these postures not 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.879
 it shows at all 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:43.639
 I notice here that there is something but they are postures 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:47.460
 totally irrelevant to our foot 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:50.280
 that will be at home 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.960
 we have here the template template 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.120
 own brooks with a lot of material 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.490
 ahead, we were a little surprised 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.060
 density here in front of a template that 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.430
 rounded by the contours to 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.400
 favor adaptation within the 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.039
 sneaker and holes also for 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.889
 favor ventilation not so much 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.770
 material the back and as you see 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.259
 pretty raised in the part of the bridge 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.860
 although above it is quite progressive 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.860
 this relief 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.490
 let's see the heel as we said 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.910
 you see here the chassis here is already 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.050
 coming heel chassis therefore 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.620
 all this part 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:36.740
 until here it is practically heel that 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:40.689
 is with a chassis with a small shape 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:44.999
 not so much inward 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:48.849
 to catch the foot well so 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:51.039
 cascadia 7 I would use it for 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:53.019
 training especially for competition 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:56.169
 you can also logically 

00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:58.629
 shoe that are means for weights 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:02.930
 also logically means also the 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:06.100
 can bring lighter people 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.340
 even some 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.280
 some others 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.670
 Heavyweight 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.830
 of the ligeritos for that but good more 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:19.990
 nothing especially for especially for 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:23.020
 average pesos people more or less normal 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.920
 neither is a pen made but 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.720
 more or less 

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.790
 that goes out to train is a great 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.000
 sneaker and we can take it 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:34.970
 perfectly to compete will give us 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.840
 good result these classic and brooks 

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:41.450
 Cascadia in its version 7 analyzed by 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:44.350
 trail running dotcom review we are 

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.350
 in the next analysis
