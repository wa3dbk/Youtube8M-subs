using this loadout and raids with two

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.039 
using this loadout and raids with two
controllers<00:00:14.910> because<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.719> pretty

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
controllers because it is pretty

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.019 
controllers because it is pretty
severely<00:00:16.470> power<00:00:16.770> hungry<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.609> with<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.850> being

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
severely power hungry so with that being

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.450 
severely power hungry so with that being
said<00:00:18.150> let's<00:00:18.720> get<00:00:18.900> into<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.199> guys<00:00:19.410> let's<00:00:20.279> take<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
said let's get into it guys let's take a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.029 
said let's get into it guys let's take a
look<00:00:20.730> at<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.779> power<00:00:22.199> trees<00:00:22.560> first<00:00:22.800> let's

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
look at the power trees first let's

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.920 
look at the power trees first let's
going<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.430> emulation<00:00:23.789> tree<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.779> is

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
going to the emulation tree this is

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.240 
going to the emulation tree this is
what's<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.320> look<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.590> I'm<00:00:25.920> not<00:00:26.039> going

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
what's going to look like I'm not going

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.650 
what's going to look like I'm not going
really<00:00:26.490> discussing<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.210> powers<00:00:27.480> at<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
really discussing the powers at the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.849 
really discussing the powers at the
moment<00:00:27.960> we'll<00:00:28.050> get<00:00:28.170> into<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.410> when<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:28.740> take

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
moment we'll get into that when we take

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.679 
moment we'll get into that when we take
a<00:00:28.890> look<00:00:29.039> at<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> load<00:00:29.490> out<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.449> going

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
a look at the load out so this is going

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.999 
a look at the load out so this is going
to<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.840> your<00:00:30.929> first<00:00:31.170> tree<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.590> emulation

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
to be your first tree that emulation

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.799 
to be your first tree that emulation
tree<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.640> then<00:00:33.210> let's<00:00:33.360> get<00:00:33.510> into<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
tree and then let's get into the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:34.970 
tree and then let's get into the
ignition<00:00:33.930> tree<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.590> what's<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:34.890> to

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
ignition tree this is what's going to

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.840 
ignition tree this is what's going to
look<00:00:35.070> like<00:00:35.100> then<00:00:35.399> we're<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.760> these

spontaneous<00:02:03.570> combustion<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:05.159> not<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
spontaneous combustion is just not the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.010 
spontaneous combustion is just not the
animation<00:02:06.180> i'm<00:02:06.299> looking<00:02:06.509> forward<00:02:06.750> they<00:02:06.960> do

animation i'm looking forward they do

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.080 
animation i'm looking forward they do
similar<00:02:07.530> damage<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.310> they<00:02:08.580> have<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.879> same

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
similar damage and they have the same

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.820 
similar damage and they have the same
powder<00:02:09.330> interaction<00:02:09.989> that's<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
powder interaction that's just the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.250 
powder interaction that's just the
animation<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.610> little<00:02:11.849> bit<00:02:11.970> crazy

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
animation is a little bit crazy

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.920 
animation is a little bit crazy
and<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.860> just<00:02:13.920> doesn't<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:15.239> just<00:02:15.269> doesn't<00:02:15.750> go

and it just doesn't it just doesn't go
well<00:02:16.110> with<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.379> sortation<00:02:16.799> it's<00:02:17.159> just<00:02:17.340> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
well with the sortation it's just the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.509 
well with the sortation it's just the
animation<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:19.049> just<00:02:19.349> takes<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.799> long<00:02:20.040> and

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
animation that just takes you long and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
being said let's get into that rotation

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.670 
being said let's get into that rotation

probably wondering why because when you
watch<00:02:42.870> other<00:02:43.079> loadouts<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:44.069> will<00:02:44.189> see<00:02:44.400> that

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
watch other loadouts you will see that

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.369 
watch other loadouts you will see that
they<00:02:44.670> use<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.819> spontaneous<00:02:45.540> combustion<00:02:46.019> said

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379

use it whenever your weapon buff is
active<00:03:37.949> just<00:03:38.220> because<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.579> Clips<00:03:39.060> nicely<00:03:39.480> with

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599

the long past time so if that being said
it's<00:03:44.129> just<00:03:44.310> about<00:03:44.549> up<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.329> let's<00:03:45.569> get<00:03:45.780> into<00:03:45.840> the

it's just about up so let's get into the
actual<00:03:46.769> rotation<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.579> I<00:03:47.669> do<00:03:47.730> not<00:03:48.090> recommend

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
actual rotation and I do not recommend

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.270 
actual rotation and I do not recommend
you<00:03:48.840> first<00:03:49.079> throw<00:03:49.230> out<00:03:49.349> the<00:03:49.470> rotation<00:03:49.590> using

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
you first throw out the rotation using

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.250 
you first throw out the rotation using
your<00:03:50.430> weapon<00:03:50.730> mastery<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.359> recommend<00:03:51.959> just

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
your weapon mastery I recommend just

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.470 
your weapon mastery I recommend just
going<00:03:52.500> into<00:03:52.680> your<00:03:52.919> first<00:03:53.220> power<00:03:53.519> second<00:03:54.329> power

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
going into your first power second power

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.530 
going into your first power second power
third<00:03:55.019> power<00:03:55.290> fourth<00:03:56.159> power<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:56.760> then<00:03:57.239> I<00:03:57.269> once

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
third power fourth power and then I once

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.270 
third power fourth power and then I once
that<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:57.810> all<00:03:57.959> set<00:03:58.230> up<00:03:58.260> then<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:59.010> could<00:03:59.159> go

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
that it's all set up then you could go

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.580 
that it's all set up then you could go
to<00:03:59.310> your<00:03:59.639> weapon<00:03:59.970> mastery<00:04:00.389> and<00:04:00.569> I'm<00:04:01.260> kind<00:04:01.530> of

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
to your weapon mastery and I'm kind of

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.500 
to your weapon mastery and I'm kind of
lagging<00:04:01.859> a<00:04:02.069> little<00:04:02.099> bit<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:02.730> I'm<00:04:02.849> probably<00:04:03.209> not

lagging a little bit so I'm probably not

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.629 
lagging a little bit so I'm probably not
going<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.750> hit<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:03.930> too<00:04:04.139> much<00:04:04.319> this<00:04:05.069> pretty

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.820 

and<00:06:25.730> as<00:06:25.910> you<00:06:26.090> can<00:06:26.240> see<00:06:26.270> I<00:06:26.810> almost<00:06:27.410> did<00:06:27.620> forget

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
and as you can see I almost did forget

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.920 
and as you can see I almost did forget
to<00:06:27.889> add<00:06:28.070> this<00:06:28.280> as<00:06:28.430> well<00:06:28.700> the<00:06:29.420> only<00:06:29.630> major

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
to add this as well the only major

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.870 
to add this as well the only major
difference<00:06:30.080> between<00:06:30.560> the<00:06:30.980> two<00:06:31.160> is<00:06:31.190> that<00:06:31.700> this

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
difference between the two is that this

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.400 
difference between the two is that this
one<00:06:32.090> is<00:06:32.330> an<00:06:32.780> AoE<00:06:33.530> we're<00:06:34.490> dead<00:06:34.790> mate<00:06:35.030> is<00:06:35.240> not<00:06:35.600> but

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
one is an AoE we're dead mate is not but

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.629 
one is an AoE we're dead mate is not but
they<00:06:36.530> do<00:06:36.590> hit<00:06:36.950> for<00:06:37.100> about<00:06:37.280> the<00:06:37.370> same<00:06:37.400> amount

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
they do hit for about the same amount

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.750 
they do hit for about the same amount
regardless<00:06:38.830> so<00:06:39.830> it's<00:06:40.040> just<00:06:40.190> pretty<00:06:40.430> much<00:06:40.580> what

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
regardless so it's just pretty much what

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.879 
regardless so it's just pretty much what
you<00:06:40.880> prefer<00:06:41.060> for<00:06:41.540> the<00:06:41.660> cast<00:06:41.870> common<00:06:42.320> animation

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:42.889

like<00:06:43.370> I<00:06:43.460> said<00:06:43.520> detonate<00:06:44.360> is<00:06:44.600> a<00:06:44.630> little<00:06:45.050> bit

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200 
like I said detonate is a little bit

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.900 
like I said detonate is a little bit
faster<00:06:45.410> with<00:06:45.860> a<00:06:45.889> smoother<00:06:46.340> with<00:06:46.520> this<00:06:46.700> load

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910 
faster with a smoother with this load

out so that's why I do prefer it I can

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.490 
out so that's why I do prefer it I can
seem<00:06:49.430> to<00:06:49.520> go<00:06:49.639> a<00:06:49.669> little<00:06:49.850> bit<00:06:50.060> quicker<00:06:50.500> but
