00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hello dear friends with you pavel 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.690
 the crimsons and this video I record with 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.030
 coast of the Gulf right now I was 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.630
 a few kilometers back and forth it 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.030
 my already daily morning meditation i 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.010
 temporarily moved to live in the suburbs because 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.869
 Well, how in the Leningrad region 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.529
 because it is harmony happiness and 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.710
 joy and what I wanted to say is 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.439
 I've been going to videos for several days in a row 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.260
 on this beach 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.239
 I reflect on business and life I write down 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.860
 some useful videos for sure 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.860
 saw them and I in this video would like 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.649
 talk about trash i go along the shore 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.649
 and under my feet everything comes across more 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.899
 more junk bottles of everything else and 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.570
 here is another time when I came back 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.350
 back after a while I reached 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.960
 to the car 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.649
 standing opposite and for some reason I can't 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.559
 to leave 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.309
 I don't know why this power of me 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.399
 holds 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.430
 and I think for a long time over those words are 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.630
 i heard recently 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.540
 the main thing that your life makes sense 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.810
 this said Einstein I do not remember the first 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.720
 part of the phrase the main thing is not something there a 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.080
 the main thing that your life makes sense 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.439
 I think I think yes my life 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.409
 makes sense i try to give something 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.500
 useful to people I mean my own there 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.229
 youtube channel yes i think i hope i 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.780
 I carry the utility of some people doing 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.790
 some business projects that also 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.860
 don't exactly rob health and don't 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.740
 worse, that is, they are helping people 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.520
 and this is still some kind of internal 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.470
 hunger but because you still think a 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.360
 what else can you do for people for 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.190
 the planets 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.320
 how useful are you now? 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.670
 in this world there are some but some philosophical 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.850
 thoughts visit 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.930
 I just started digging in the trunk 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.950
 found a bag found a bag here it is here 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.780
 worth it I think I 'll go continue my 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.080
 meditation on the beach and just gonna 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.870
 I will collect garbage yes to me 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.170
 now you need to go do your business me 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.980
 waiting for employees need to perform some 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.080
 functions and seems to know all this 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.060
 looks so exalted with me hand 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.430
 waiting for you there 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.400
 business employees i mean your work is there 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.510
 it seems to affect something more 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.360
 global that is the result of your day 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.510
 it is possible to help there many people but 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.110
 this help will be within 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.020
 business processes, that is, it will be 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.970
 business processes that 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:51.070
 so must be i think no i want 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.990
 today do this affairs day differently 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.350
 and I want to practice start completely 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.500
 another is doing some kind of banal 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.380
 things that anybody can do 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.520
 man practice I don't know my help 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.920
 these all people all over the planet i think that 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.680
 Now I would like my planet to be cleaner 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.220
 and I probably think I need to start. 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.370
 myself 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.930
 yes i'm sure that there is on this beach 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.230
 the street sweepers which council 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.000
 should it all clean up they pay for it 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.370
 but here it’s not about being 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.740
 just the cleaner thing here is to have 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.490
 people have a desire desire to live in 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.280
 clean 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.260
 and when people have a desire 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.310
 often motivation when they look at 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.840
 some example 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.430
 I think if I don’t know our management 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.160
 president or some great businessman 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.940
 there is a TV host who is everything 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.040
 respect if he went every day not 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.350
 I know I was picking up trash and saying that 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.660
 cool friends and at the same time it would be very 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.520
 cool showed on television and he would 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.700
 so presented as something unreal 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.130
 cool i think people would go fashion 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.320
 to collect garbage let them do 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.709
 it's not even for the sake of fashion 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.750
 there by their surroundings to people who are near 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:15.010
 live just for the sake of fashion, I think if 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.930
 it was so our planet our our 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.970
 courtyards and our porches would be much 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.609
 cleaner 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.280
 Well, honestly, I do not know if I can 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.650
 once maybe it will be more but 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.870
 I just sincerely wanted to go 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.120
 collect garbage I took a big bag to us 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.150
 very quickly I was filled 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.310
 literally literally 50 meters passed 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.570
 I have no other bear, but I hope 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.810
 what will be back tomorrow 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:46.520
 I will take one more thing how many bottles have collected 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.490
 friends and if you know i read how 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.100
 plastic generally affects our planet 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.770
 how many animals die from this and if 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.680
 plastic bottles are not closed then 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.580
 amount of garbage in total 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.620
 increases 3 or 4 times because 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.100
 KAMAZ tractor that roll out 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.800
 trash but trash is soft so here in these 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.990
 Bottled air remains He is one of them 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.720
 comes out if the bottle is wrapped with lids 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.870
 plastic and trash is obtained but in 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.290
 three to four times the more expensive it is 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.139
 affects the environment on everything else 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.520
 so friends let's save the planet 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.130
 just starting ourselves and doing 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.000
 good deeds i understand that some of you 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.650
 above this perhaps you are driving your own 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.919
 return to some business center 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:40.520
 what is your action there 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:44.570
 affect thousands of people maybe you and 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.510
 right i don't know i started my day so 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.240
 today and maybe someone will want to me 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.979
 join at any moment I thought a 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.620
 why when i don't go in a jacket in 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.479
 a suit in the middle of the city when I don't go out 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.240
 there my cars why can't i take 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.490
 bag something to pick 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.560
 admits and people see let not 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:07.539
 surprised or thinking than a man at all 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.599
 do you know i was always like that 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.410
 slightly quite many thought that 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.930
 probably the guy finally some 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:17.860
 inadequate actions do and this is me 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:21.340
 led to the fact that when I was still 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.229
 I was there 25-27 years old I achieved what 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.050
 many people in their whole lives do not achieve and 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:29.380
 I do not want to brag I do not speak only 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:32.530
 there about success there some career 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:36.599
 finances you can talk about everything and about 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:40.599
 health and food well that is 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:43.509
 Industry Well, that is, I think a lot 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:45.759
 because I sometimes did nause that 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:48.729
 others twist a finger and will and on you 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:50.979
 crazy you sectarian friends one 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:52.710
 vegetarianism than not worth one failure 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:56.259
 from meat 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:07:00.069
 so do not live patterns liven up 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:01.330
 better thinking about the main thing is that your 

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:03.759
 life made sense 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.610
 no matter how you manifest it clean 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:10.659
 planet collect bottles or something else 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:13.449
 you do something, but you made of it 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:15.720
 I understand that my day is more like it 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:18.360
 full i'm sure it's a day 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.120
 even more useful than usual probably 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.730
 than my every day is just like that 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.440
