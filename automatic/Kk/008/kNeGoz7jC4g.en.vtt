 we meet osvaldo martÃ­nez one 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.890
 of the reinforcements that have arrived for 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.769

 happy not happy to get to 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:25.140
 a large institution like the one that is 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:28.619
 america and obviously to contribute 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.920
 mine I know that this team these 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.400
 last tournament was one step away from 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:38.580
 reach the goal but I come to contribute 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.300
 not mine so that's no doubt and 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.190
 for that I will try to work at par 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.050
 of my classmates and thus reach 100 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.420
 for the first game in the fans' 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.039
 america a lot of wonders that 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.170
 it takes a day in the team that 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.789
 for many years despite the fact that 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.670
 the rolfi was and is a companion of 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.350
 work but no no there has not been that 10 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.510
 what the team requires how you feel 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.430
 you before this number this challenge that 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.880
 loads yes clear always always come to 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.060
 a team as well as in america represents 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.610
 much for one there is not in the people 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.070
 Obviously, what 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.140
 that I come to be here not so I'm going to 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.030
 work I will try to do well 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.229
 things 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.950
 and contribute contribute what I do not know 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.940
 that Miguel knows me enough he will know 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.549
 where where is it going to put me 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.820
 obviously in what position and obviously 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.920
 where where I put or what to try 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.380
 not take advantage and secure you going to beat 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.549
 the ball and the tactics africa many goals 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.700
 they remember already in Mexico says that 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:53.030
 I believe that thank God I have it not 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.810
 I have very well done very well not for the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.920
 halfway hopefully hopefully she 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.649
 can give that of those goals that 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.830
 get here in Mexican soccer and that already 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.800
 it's absolutely up to me not that 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:13.970
 train in the week and perfect in 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.940
 the week and already already the when the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.250
 day of the game obviously take advantage 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.750
 When it's my turn, it's my turn to kick and 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.030
 and obviously that's what I think 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.800
 do also come after of course 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.350
 to be champion to want to be change because 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.230
 in the america if i do not know later you know that 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.959
 It is something a step back is clear that 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.590
 the primary objective not even though there 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.290
 here in the in the team no I am I know 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.630
 that I am aware of that I came to a 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.360
 team where he is used to playing 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.260
 playlists to play 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.680
 late and obviously this is not going to 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.050
 be the section so as I say 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.440
 I come to come to help the companions 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.200
 I come to contribute what is mine, the idea is to make 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.710
 a very good pre-season base before 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.920
 to start the tournament and obviously from 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:14.970
 that the final whistle of the 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.030
 tournament this try to grab it with 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.040
 seriousness with a lot of responsibility and 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.000
 leaving everything on the court not even though it's 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.250
 only the primordial we play against 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.020
 Kim we could not be champion but 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.660
 I imagine that from a distance a Paraguayan 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.360
 they will celebrate a lot that is champion 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.640
 in the american it was declared who who did not 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.970
 I want to be champion there is no more with 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.220
 the america so hopefully hopefully for that 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.800
 you have to work there is no need to 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.320
 get ahead of anything but with the 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.580
 jobs always reach the goal and 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.660
 so 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:54.090
 from more now mentalize us that be a 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.820
 winning team and reach the goal 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.320
 working thank you very much osvaldito for 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.320
 time not many thanks to you
