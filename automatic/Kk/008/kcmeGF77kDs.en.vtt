00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello how are we I am perfectly 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.520
 I'm getting ready to go to a 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.960
 clinic where is the limit that are going to 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.910
 give this afternoon to explain the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.530
 importance of the tread on running 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.480
 it's a subject that interests me very much 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.340
 As you all know, I have a 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.450
 problem at the time of running because 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.940
 I have my left side totally 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.189
 Fucked them explain it in the previous 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.470
 video that I made in the snow with valentÃ­ 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.150
 sanjuan and with borja estrada like no 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.949
 could it be otherwise I do not come 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.170
 relaxed after a weekend 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.760
 in Andorra that I can not complain about 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.439
 nothing of how well they take care of me first 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.630
 they made a video to fuck me but 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.910
 then they gave me a lot of gifts 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.910
 thanks in that you just ride bitch 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.379
 mother then what I was going then 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.510
 broke the cruciate ligaments ago 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.030
 five years and it still gives me enough 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.739
 discomfort aside also already some 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.590
 how many more years because you all know already 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.539
 my age a few years ago when 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.329
 Athletics was made 100 meters hurdles 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.829
 and I also broke the ligaments of 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.379
 left ankle so I have the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.180
 left side totally fucked like you 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.250
 can you imagine i 'm going to show you 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.309
 A tattoo 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.440
 here the tattoo is an Indian bracelet 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.150
 that at the time I did to compensate 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.190
 symbolically the weakness of my 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.890
 left side for me good means 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.479
 strength energy vitality and the subject 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.560
 I will explain to you on another day as 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.020
 You always know I 'm also going with the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.840
 braids I have something I think in another 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.160
 life was I went I went I was Indian but good 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.320
 this is not the case that I'm already 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.170
 rolling again as always I think 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.479
 that I'm going to get a lot out of this clinic and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.369
 my intention is to take pictures and 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.570
 insert them in this video so that 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.700
 you can also take out the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.369
 information anyway I will then 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.810
 put the link of what is the video 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.300
 complete because where is the limit is going to 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.259
 record it and so you can have the total of 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.509
 the information and what we are going to do is 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.250
 do a trained ram applying 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.060
 all these things that I am going to learn 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.649
 in the clinic today I'm going to 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.520
 present enable tanai machine is 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.840
 depurative that will give a talk 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.480
 that the truth is that to find is 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.430
 super important 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.430
 has been very attentive because it leaves me 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.600
 after listening I wanted you 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.319
 ask yourself for myself and for all those who 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.569
 they are watching me on my channel 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.780
 summarizing why this song 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.150
 could you say basic tips for 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.650
 we start running as we realize 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.200
 if we're doing it Friday, it's not 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.310
 we are doing well I do not know what I feel 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.810
 more than in that we have to 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:38.310
 also reflect some clue 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.349
 of four things it 's important that you do not 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.569
 begins to eat sorber is observed to itself 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.430
 same and begins to have symptoms before 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.020
 things that are not normal not normal 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.610
 block that begins to have pains that 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.819
 you did not have in one thing is that you layer 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.380
 muscle overload next to pain 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.380
 selective in the area 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.550
 the career technique is your way of 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.989
 think then I think that making a 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.989
 truth analysis 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.950
 but it is very important for all 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.950
 people 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.400
 but everyone should know how and when 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.959
 you start having repeated injuries not 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.849
 they give and many times they write to me today is 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.200
 that no no no way do I recommend in a 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.939
 physio because there is no way that always 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.560
 the same thing is happening to me because maybe 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.510
 before going to the trial it would be good 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.659
 to be made 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.659
 to see what it is 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.879
 a part of a set of 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.500
 professionals that we should be for 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.269
 think clearly to add to event that is 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.310
 the physio the traumatologist the 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.569
 podiatrist in the end we all have the same 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.430
 objective that this is our runner 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.310
 I can run, I think the important thing 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.810
 is what you do a good point to see 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.060
 people that you trust that they treat you well 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.819
 and that of course good results 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.850
 also before many of the things that 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.470
 pass 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.430
 Well, he will come to see you because I believe 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.530
 to have continuity 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.260
 helps to improve the rules because there is no 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:13.490
 way to get ready when the hours 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.740
 and you already know if repeating lessons and 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.780
 it hurts something in excess if you see that something is not 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.739
 is going well it is important to do this 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.720
 study 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:27.030
 come victims thank you good as 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.940
 I am already very much scratched with the 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.889
 career issue for the ironman me 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.840
 I really like to train what happened fatal 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.389
 whenever I train because they hurt me 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.389
 absolutely everything then since 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.870
 we are here convicts with bags to 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:45.150
 see if they can advise me something so that 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.770
 do not scratch me so much mentally and so that 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.180
 we can cut body posture or 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.910
 so that everything is done a little better 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.700
 come to goats now this we go other 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:58.070
 I speak bla bla bla bla yo 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.270
 marathon counseling like this 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:05.090
 how to qualify I may not be the best 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.020
 example to tell how to run since the 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.720
 theory does very well 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.130
 you have to run on tiptoe stagnant 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.130
 great speed 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:19.889
 but for injury and others I think that 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.920
 stagnant little ones 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.310
 you are fine 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.449
 and over I'm working almost always 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.560
 thing that theoretically is not death 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:33.160
 theoretically it does not erase 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.520
 theoretically not 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.690
 you're not going to change where you 're going 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.350
 technique exercises that have to 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.940
 do 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.340
 and to see 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.680
 it's something very personal I'm not a big 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.440
 runner either but good attempt to 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.970
 implant half a foot more than tip 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.440
 because we made it more comfortable to adapt to 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.600
 the society partitions of narco cloth 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.230
 variety as criticism but good all 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.230
 the bad examples 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:05.380
 the marathon after swimming 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.460
 A) Yes 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.460
 for four hours like this 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:16.670
 so psychologically you keep running not 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.780
 chefs' centers 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:22.560
 if you do it non-stop 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:25.560
 but hey I told him I hate running 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.250
 I like to swim and my bike tires me 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.470
 because I do ironman good guys thank you 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.750
 for your advice 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.520
 We will try to grate me so much I will listen to 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.750
 everything you hear in the clinic 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.970
 li ming willis of the importance of 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.139
 the tread maybe I study what 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.480
 because maybe it's not normal for me 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:45.150
 I go to everything so much and I'll see you in the 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.750
 next video you already know to enjoy that 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.750
 it's two days
