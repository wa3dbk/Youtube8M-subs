iPhone<00:00:07.980> it's<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.340> good<00:00:08.490> idea<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.940> size<00:00:09.210> of

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
iPhone it's a good idea of the size of

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.770 
iPhone it's a good idea of the size of
it

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
it

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.830 
it
it<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.650> fairly<00:00:11.519> large<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.059> guess<00:00:12.090> someone's<00:00:12.630> you

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
it is fairly large I guess someone's you

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.039 
it is fairly large I guess someone's you
know<00:00:12.870> it's<00:00:13.290> not<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.530> tiny<00:00:14.250> speaker<00:00:14.730> system<00:00:15.120> it

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
know it's not a tiny speaker system it

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.080 
know it's not a tiny speaker system it
does<00:00:16.289> weigh<00:00:16.500> about<00:00:16.770> 8<00:00:16.949> pounds<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.609> while<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:18.000> is

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
does weigh about 8 pounds so while it is

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.120 
does weigh about 8 pounds so while it is
portable<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:19.230> not<00:00:19.470> something<00:00:19.859> you're<00:00:20.010> going

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
portable it's not something you're going

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.519

to just throw into a backpack probably

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.650 
to just throw into a backpack probably
it<00:00:23.100> does<00:00:23.340> not<00:00:23.550> come<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.029> carrying<00:00:24.359> case

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660

sound<00:01:46.259> sticks<00:01:46.710> which<00:01:46.979> sound<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:48.210> as<00:01:48.390> good<00:01:48.450> if

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
sound sticks which sound just as good if

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.530 
sound sticks which sound just as good if
not<00:01:48.810> better<00:01:48.960> than<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.619> hardwired<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.850> but

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
not better than this hardwired in but

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.179 
not better than this hardwired in but
they<00:01:51.689> are<00:01:51.810> two<00:01:52.020> separate<00:01:52.350> satellites<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.009> a

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
they are two separate satellites and a

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.940 
they are two separate satellites and a
subwoofer<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.229> they're<00:01:55.229> not<00:01:55.380> going<00:01:55.680> anywhere

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950

where<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.880> pick<00:01:57.030> up<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.360> take

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
with me the battery life is about six

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.080 
with me the battery life is about six
hours<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.890> lasts<00:02:02.130> for<00:02:02.340> quite<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> while<00:02:02.759> it

overall<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.360> price<00:02:54.600> is<00:02:54.780> about<00:02:54.960> between<00:02:55.470> five

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
and six hundred dollars I guess

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.910 
and six hundred dollars I guess

depending on where you get it I'm not
sure<00:02:58.980> it's<00:02:59.700> worth<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.420> much<00:03:00.690> money<00:03:01.370> but<00:03:02.370> on

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
sure it's worth that much money but on

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.520

cost<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.810> less<00:03:15.930> money<00:03:16.200> but<00:03:16.920> if<00:03:17.010> you're

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
cost you less money but if you're
