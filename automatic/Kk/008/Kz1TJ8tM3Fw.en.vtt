00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
go ahead and continue first thing they

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.350 
go ahead and continue first thing they
tweaked<00:01:13.979> where<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> clouds<00:01:14.490> they<00:01:14.909> look<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> bit

tweaked where the clouds they look a bit
more<00:01:15.630> darker<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.560> PC<00:01:17.070> minecraft<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.759> it

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
more darker just like PC minecraft so it

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.789

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
gives it a more feel to it but nothing

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.450

point in time because like I said they
did<00:02:51.469> not<00:02:51.500> even<00:02:51.799> say<00:02:52.099> nothing<00:02:52.639> about<00:02:52.909> adding

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
did not even say nothing about adding

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.349 
did not even say nothing about adding
this<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.169> this<00:02:54.469> is<00:02:54.680> actually<00:02:54.889> commands<00:02:55.819> well

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
this and this is actually commands well

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.059 
this and this is actually commands well
there<00:02:56.599> are<00:02:56.629> actually<00:02:57.109> no<00:02:57.349> commands<00:02:57.859> in<00:02:58.010> the

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
there are actually no commands in the

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.670 
there are actually no commands in the
game<00:02:58.400> yet<00:02:58.639> nothing<00:02:59.329> works<00:02:59.629> no<00:03:00.019> command<00:03:00.439> works

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
game yet nothing works no command works

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.270 
game yet nothing works no command works
as<00:03:00.919> them<00:03:01.129> now<00:03:01.250> like<00:03:01.280> help<00:03:01.819> /<00:03:02.480> help<00:03:02.810> /<00:03:03.139> spawn<00:03:03.889> /

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
as them now like help / help / spawn /

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.369 
as them now like help / help / spawn /
game<00:03:04.549> mode<00:03:04.730> whatever<00:03:05.389> nothing<00:03:05.840> works<00:03:06.049> it's

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
game mode whatever nothing works it's

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.129 
game mode whatever nothing works it's
just<00:03:06.739> there<00:03:07.069> I<00:03:07.310> guess<00:03:07.609> it's<00:03:07.909> I'm<00:03:08.449> guessing

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
just there I guess it's I'm guessing

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.250 
just there I guess it's I'm guessing
they're<00:03:09.290> testing<00:03:09.799> something<00:03:10.040> but<00:03:10.430> hopefully

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
they're testing something but hopefully

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.349 
they're testing something but hopefully
this<00:03:12.260> does<00:03:12.530> mean<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:12.799> mod<00:03:13.159> will<00:03:13.669> come<00:03:13.909> out<00:03:14.090> for

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
this does mean a mod will come out for

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:15.699 
this does mean a mod will come out for
like<00:03:14.510> single<00:03:14.840> player<00:03:15.019> commands<00:03:15.409> and<00:03:15.620> stuff

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
like single player commands and stuff

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.530 
like single player commands and stuff
but<00:03:16.219> there<00:03:16.370> currently<00:03:16.609> is<00:03:16.669> a<00:03:16.790> mod<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.090> has

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
but there currently is a mod that has

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.699 
but there currently is a mod that has
single<00:03:17.900> player<00:03:18.049> commands<00:03:18.349> which<00:03:18.560> is

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
single player commands which is

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.199 
single player commands which is
available<00:03:18.859> in<00:03:19.250> two<00:03:19.280> minecraft<00:03:19.489> forms<00:03:19.970> there's

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
available in two minecraft forms there's

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.119 
available in two minecraft forms there's
a<00:03:20.269> mod<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:20.569> let's<00:03:20.900> do<00:03:21.199> that<00:03:21.229> has<00:03:21.709> single

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
a mod that let's do that has single

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.379 
a mod that let's do that has single
player<00:03:22.280> commands<00:03:22.549> and<00:03:22.729> stuff<00:03:22.790> with<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:23.180> for

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
player commands and stuff with that for

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.119 
player commands and stuff with that for
like<00:03:23.479> spawn<00:03:23.840> help<00:03:24.349> and<00:03:24.590> all<00:03:24.680> that<00:03:24.859> good<00:03:25.069> stuff

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
like spawn help and all that good stuff

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.039 
like spawn help and all that good stuff
but<00:03:25.639> you<00:03:25.970> need<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.150> job<00:03:26.359> Rick<00:03:26.509> for<00:03:26.689> that<00:03:26.720> but

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
but you need a job Rick for that but

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.050 
but you need a job Rick for that but
this<00:03:27.199> one<00:03:27.439> this<00:03:27.829> is<00:03:27.889> actually<00:03:28.489> in<00:03:28.669> the<00:03:28.879> game

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
this one this is actually in the game

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.879 
this one this is actually in the game
but<00:03:29.329> there<00:03:29.599> seems<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:29.989> be<00:03:30.109> like<00:03:30.290> no<00:03:30.319> commands

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
but there seems to be like no commands

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.460 
but there seems to be like no commands
yet<00:03:31.069> so<00:03:31.400> I'm<00:03:31.879> guessing<00:03:32.479> they<00:03:32.900> forgot<00:03:33.169> to<00:03:33.319> take

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
yet so I'm guessing they forgot to take

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.929 
yet so I'm guessing they forgot to take
it<00:03:33.500> off<00:03:33.709> because<00:03:34.129> there's<00:03:34.430> nothing<00:03:34.579> it's

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
it off because there's nothing it's

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:36.189 
it off because there's nothing it's
pretty<00:03:35.269> useless<00:03:35.509> right<00:03:35.750> now<00:03:35.810> because<00:03:36.079> there's

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:36.199 
pretty useless right now because there's

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.349 
pretty useless right now because there's
nothing<00:03:36.379> working<00:03:36.829> on<00:03:36.949> it<00:03:37.099> so<00:03:37.340> I<00:03:37.549> think<00:03:38.239> they

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
nothing working on it so I think they

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.789 
nothing working on it so I think they
just<00:03:38.389> forgot<00:03:38.629> to<00:03:38.870> take<00:03:39.019> it<00:03:39.049> off<00:03:39.259> or<00:03:39.560> they<00:03:39.739> were

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
just forgot to take it off or they were

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.589 
just forgot to take it off or they were
probably<00:03:40.040> testing<00:03:40.609> something<00:03:40.939> with<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:41.389> or

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
probably testing something with it or

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.659 
probably testing something with it or
who<00:03:42.109> knows<00:03:42.290> but<00:03:42.590> hopefully<00:03:43.129> will<00:03:43.250> be<00:03:43.280> in<00:03:43.579> the

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
who knows but hopefully will be in the

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.879 
who knows but hopefully will be in the
future<00:03:43.819> updates<00:03:44.479> it's<00:03:45.049> in<00:03:45.290> right<00:03:45.560> now<00:03:45.709> but

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
future updates it's in right now but

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.710 
future updates it's in right now but
it's<00:03:46.009> currently<00:03:46.340> useless<00:03:46.819> so<00:03:47.090> we'll<00:03:47.389> probably

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
it's currently useless so we'll probably

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.360 
it's currently useless so we'll probably
just<00:03:47.870> have<00:03:48.079> to<00:03:48.199> wait<00:03:48.349> and<00:03:48.379> see<00:03:48.590> and<00:03:48.979> this<00:03:49.159> is<00:03:49.340> a

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
just have to wait and see and this is a

hidden<00:03:49.879> feature<00:03:50.060> they<00:03:50.840> did<00:03:50.989> not<00:03:51.019> say<00:03:51.319> nothing

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709
