from one of those miniature sized boxes

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.089 
from one of those miniature sized boxes
of<00:03:17.510> neurons<00:03:17.840> but<00:03:17.930> we<00:03:18.319> didn't<00:03:18.560> have<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.860> so<00:03:19.069> we

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
of neurons but we didn't have that so we

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.680 
of neurons but we didn't have that so we
just<00:03:19.400> separated<00:03:19.730> as<00:03:19.940> much<00:03:20.120> as<00:03:20.269> we<00:03:20.420> thought

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
just separated as much as we thought

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:21.850 
just separated as much as we thought
would<00:03:20.900> be<00:03:21.019> in<00:03:21.110> one<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.319> those<00:03:21.440> it's<00:03:21.680> all<00:03:21.800> a

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
would be in one of those it's all a

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.699 
would be in one of those it's all a
matter<00:03:22.130> of<00:03:22.280> guesswork<00:03:25.630> yeah<00:03:26.630> then<00:03:27.620> you're

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
matter of guesswork yeah then you're
