shaft needs to be able to move in and
out<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.590> compensate<00:02:35.250> for<00:02:35.520> that<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.540> always

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
out to compensate for that so I always

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.570 
out to compensate for that so I always
make<00:02:37.110> sure<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.770> shaft<00:02:38.070> is<00:02:38.310> well
