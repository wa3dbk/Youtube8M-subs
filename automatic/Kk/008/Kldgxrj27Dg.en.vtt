00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.500
 we conducted 2015 that's how I see it 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.820
 smiles and tears that comes from 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.140
 vibrate my voice believe me I know 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.220
 no more too what to think whenever 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.750
 I see the happiness I have to make myself 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.070
 kiffer cougar done so i understand my 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.940
 pain but I can not say that I 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.260
 go six months when I see what's going on 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.670
 goes elsewhere but it's in these 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.020
 moments there that I tell myself that I have the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.340
 best handsome brother but tell me 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.989
 Yet what are we waiting hand 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.700
 preferred reaching a beach that we 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.379
 will show her breasts we are dragged by 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.879
 chetan who puts us know upside down 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.660
 kinetics that we must love for good 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.100
 to finish in hell 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.930
 now brother I wish I could 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.280
 beat against that but I'm alone like 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.960
 a grain of sand running against his 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.790
 choice and without you watching me and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.980
 who does not support me who runs against the 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.360
 system and that does not move so saved 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.130
 the shots stop saying that everything will go 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.600
 better me I'm pessimistic in the future 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.100
 and I'm not going to die done between these 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.780
 wars and his good ones between these brothers who 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.890
 hangs how do you think it gets better 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.869
 in the media pushes us to the bottom 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.100
 fuel polemics for a war 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.270
 of religions month as a thing 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.920
 it is Sabbath to rebuild 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.630
 the illusion but let's say we are 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.890
 loose nothing we see what happens but 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.660
 what is expected to overthrow the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.610
 cup that makes us angry we prefer to ignore 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.810
 or wait for someone to do it I say 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.610
 that one day or another could each 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.350
 will find its place but it's false we live 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.060
 in a world of bullies surrounded by screws 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.649
 a world that sticks to the kid and that 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.179
 prefer to suffer as we want everything 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.649
 I advance when they all prefer to flee 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.179
 I lost the envy to believe in this 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.350
 world who knows how to smile or who knows 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.149
 but they were fighting for 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.440
 values that believed in life and that 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.190
 everyone had a good heart 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.050
 does not matter the pop color 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.520
 origin no matter and beliefs life 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.990
 I want her like dance so she would 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.760
 perfect safe and colors that 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.380
 lights up with joy on the lips of 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.610
 every person that would be neither I have them 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.350
 eyes that sparkle nothing but 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.700
 imagine it I invite you all to me 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.110
 follow in order to realize it 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.430
 so start by smiling too much 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.320
 people who are dear to you but I 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.790
 say smile to operate for a 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.110
 other case it is for them that we advance 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.160
 because we want them to be proud 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.660
 injured that's what you create a hacker 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.010
 yet we remain in the galley the 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.690
 hands in the pockets waiting for that 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.490
 things change between the pia eve 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.869
 piron and that our brain capped years 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.190
 repeat every second that it would take 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.870
 maybe we too how it ranks 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.220
 it's advancing the lawyers she does not we 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.110
 tranchons is assured I can believe in 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.700
 the goodness of the human heart that love 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.440
 can defeat hate city puts a little bit of 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.120
 his or learns to reach out I do not 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.070
 will stop repeating it because the union is doing the 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.540
 force and only way to bring down this 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.130
 who sits on the throne live like 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.200
 barges with all solutions 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.060
 mach the dismissal of serious spitting I 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.710
 go crazy to see what happens 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.520
 I took out my gun before he 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.520
 does not fit into class 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:46.310
