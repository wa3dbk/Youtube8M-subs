00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hi everyone back to the canal 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.750
 youtube of gonella make-up 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.970
 in the last video we talked about 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.820
 today's low-cost priests then deputy 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.380
 present four roses tilo costa that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.630
 I got to test this 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.230
 period 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:23.220
 I would start babysitting a deal with a 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.980
 classic layard of pupa are lipsticks 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.019
 from the formula in jenner that you spend 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.410
 very good year color rendering 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:36.120
 here I am this fuchsia that the number 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.840
 406 very nice here I do you 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.820
 see a slot 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.690
 here he is spending really well 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.270
 very soft and a nice rendering on 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.219
 lips and also a very good durability 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.930
 I had already talked about these on blogs 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.340
 lipsticks and I must say that I am 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.579
 therefore actually excellent step a 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.190
 this by debora deborah milano yes 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.830
 called milanored lipstick and this is the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.840
 number 20 is a deep red 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.710
 here it is also this we say that 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.390
 this is a bit tougher as a draft 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.790
 but look at how beautiful color rendering is 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.270
 a see how red you can see the well 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.189
 duration is not excellent but it is not 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.530
 however of a lipstick Latin names 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.110
 so I would say that that too 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.159
 case not made a good product step 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.799
 hence to lighter ends 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:37.020
 presenting the mass elixir color 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.070
 I was the big 825 pink color that 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.300
 it's practically 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:47.460
 pink here is hot because this 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.460
 system very well here you see that the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.159
 coverage is less intense should be passed more 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.600
 times to get a result a little 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.720
 more strongly I would say that it is shiny and 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.520
 tends to be more transparent cover 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.940
 a little less than the others but 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.650
 however this is its characteristic 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.890
 here is perhaps what I don't like so much 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.110
 is that it smells a little too intense it is 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.910
 a pretty sweet scent let's say a 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.790
 little caramel and is not a villain 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.620
 smell or though the smell too much 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.989
 intense on the lips from a little nuisance 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.480
 but for the rest it is a 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.709
 product instead making a product that 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.620
 He was disappointed here it is and essence 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.980
 so this really costs very few 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.280
 a couple of euros 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.820
 this is called xxxl long lasting is a 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.940
 gloss 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.500
 this is a matte effect no it is not me 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.640
 liked it for nothing I did not like 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.329
 because because it is hard it does not stretch out 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.570
 you see I don't know if you notice but tend not to 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.280
 be uniform and really stick 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.480
 to the lips 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.730
 so for me apart from the color it is 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.049
 very nice and otherwise this is 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.600
 really rejected here were these were the 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.310
 city ​​low cost that I've tried lately 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.310
 thank you 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.849
 stay with us next time 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.849
