00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.730 
this is a horizontal all right so now
what<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.570> want<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.170> go<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.350> edit

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
what we want to do is just go to edit

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.160 
what we want to do is just go to edit
transform<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.939> then<00:01:36.240> I'm<00:01:36.659> gonna<00:01:36.750> go<00:01:36.960> ahead

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
transform and then I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.230 
transform and then I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.530> rotate<00:01:37.890> at<00:01:38.040> 90<00:01:38.310> degrees<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.939> doesn't

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and just rotate at 90 degrees it doesn't

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.810 
and just rotate at 90 degrees it doesn't
matter<00:01:39.360> counterclockwise<00:01:40.189> clockwise<00:01:41.189> it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
matter counterclockwise clockwise it

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.260 
matter counterclockwise clockwise it
doesn't<00:01:42.119> matter<00:01:42.920> moving<00:01:43.920> into<00:01:44.070> position<00:01:44.490> okay

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
doesn't matter moving into position okay

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.670 
doesn't matter moving into position okay
and<00:01:45.509> then<00:01:45.720> all<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:45.990> want<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.500> go<00:01:46.649> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
and then all you want to do is go to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.789 
and then all you want to do is go to
your<00:01:46.979> blending<00:01:47.850> modes<00:01:48.180> or<00:01:48.600> your<00:01:48.869> layer<00:01:49.200> styles

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
your blending modes or your layer styles

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.170 
your blending modes or your layer styles
and<00:01:50.009> go<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.750> soft<00:01:51.750> light<00:01:52.700> instantly<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.939> see

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
and go to soft light instantly you see

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.580 
and go to soft light instantly you see
the<00:01:54.390> effect<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:54.869> created<00:01:55.140> now<00:01:55.320> some

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590

and all I'm gonna do here and I have it

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.220 
and all I'm gonna do here and I have it
at<00:02:14.250> 50%<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.270> opacity<00:02:15.540> I'm<00:02:15.930> just<00:02:16.140> gonna

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
at 50% on the opacity I'm just gonna

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.170 
at 50% on the opacity I'm just gonna
just<00:02:16.800> gonna<00:02:16.980> go<00:02:17.190> over<00:02:17.280> top<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:17.850> just<00:02:18.090> a

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
just gonna go over top of this just a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.370 
just gonna go over top of this just a
little<00:02:18.270> bit<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.660> take<00:02:18.840> some<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.170> yellow

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
little bit to take some of that yellow

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.440 
little bit to take some of that yellow
out<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.950> then<00:02:20.460> watch<00:02:20.700> if<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.060> turn<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.300> off

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
out and then watch if I turn that off

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.750 
out and then watch if I turn that off
look<00:02:21.960> what<00:02:22.110> happens<00:02:22.620> okay

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
look what happens okay

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.130 
look what happens okay
now<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.000> other<00:02:24.180> thing<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.600> I'm<00:02:24.750> noticing<00:02:24.990> that

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
now the other thing is I'm noticing that

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.170 
now the other thing is I'm noticing that
there's<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.590> lot<00:02:25.950> more<00:02:26.100> light<00:02:26.400> over<00:02:26.700> here<00:02:26.730> than

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
there's a lot more light over here than

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.910 
there's a lot more light over here than
over<00:02:27.210> here<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:28.020> maybe<00:02:28.230> with<00:02:28.440> them<00:02:28.560> what<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.710> want

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
over here so maybe with them what I want

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.530 
over here so maybe with them what I want
to<00:02:28.980> do<00:02:29.070> is<00:02:29.190> take<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.640> flip<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.480> I'm

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
to do is take this and flip it so I'm

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.940 
to do is take this and flip it so I'm
gonna<00:02:30.630> go<00:02:30.780> edit<00:02:31.140> transform<00:02:32.040> flip

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
gonna go edit transform flip

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.380 
gonna go edit transform flip
horizontally<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.160> then<00:02:35.760> now<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:35.970> can<00:02:36.210> see

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
horizontally and then now you can see

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.870 
horizontally and then now you can see
the<00:02:36.690> lights<00:02:36.930> come<00:02:37.140> into<00:02:37.320> misdirection<00:02:38.160> okay

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
the lights come into misdirection okay

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.430 
the lights come into misdirection okay
so<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.540> can<00:02:39.660> turn<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.840> off<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.290> can<00:02:40.320> see

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
so you can turn it off and you can see

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.750 
so you can turn it off and you can see
and<00:02:40.770> then<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.980> mean<00:02:41.130> just<00:02:41.250> look<00:02:41.370> what<00:02:41.490> it's<00:02:41.610> done

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
and then I mean just look what it's done

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.030 
and then I mean just look what it's done
how<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.000> blended<00:02:42.630> all<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:43.050> this<00:02:43.170> with<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.770> same

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
how it blended all of this with the same

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.550 
how it blended all of this with the same
tone<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:44.820> going<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.450> image<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.750> also<00:02:46.410> on

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
tone and going on the image and also on

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.650 
tone and going on the image and also on
the<00:02:46.680> edges<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.640> cutout<00:02:48.030> because<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.450> was

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
the edges of the cutout because this was

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.930 
the edges of the cutout because this was
a<00:02:48.690> cutout<00:02:49.020> at<00:02:49.320> one<00:02:49.470> point<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.550> can<00:02:50.700> see

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
a cutout at one point so you can see

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.710 
a cutout at one point so you can see
right<00:02:51.180> there

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
right there

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.720 
right there
just<00:02:52.530> from<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.800> now<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.040> other<00:02:53.310> thing<00:02:53.610> is

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
just from that now the other thing is

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.190 
just from that now the other thing is
let<00:02:53.880> me<00:02:53.940> just<00:02:54.120> mention<00:02:54.210> this<00:02:54.600> that<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.960> can<00:02:55.110> go

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
let me just mention this that you can go

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.080 
let me just mention this that you can go
to<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.380> opacity<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:56.100> then<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.520> lower

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
to the opacity and then you can lower

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.880 
to the opacity and then you can lower
the<00:02:57.240> strength<00:02:57.690> by<00:02:57.960> just<00:02:58.260> dropping<00:02:58.800> the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
the strength by just dropping the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.040 
the strength by just dropping the
opacity<00:02:59.190> down<00:02:59.610> so<00:03:00.210> maybe<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.540> don't<00:03:00.660> want<00:03:00.900> it

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
opacity down so maybe you don't want it

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.570 
opacity down so maybe you don't want it
as<00:03:01.140> strong<00:03:01.440> maybe<00:03:01.620> we<00:03:01.800> only<00:03:01.920> wanted<00:03:02.130> that<00:03:02.280> 80%

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
as strong maybe we only wanted that 80%

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.140 
as strong maybe we only wanted that 80%
and<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.990> can<00:03:04.170> see<00:03:04.410> we've<00:03:04.890> still<00:03:05.160> look<00:03:06.000> what

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150
