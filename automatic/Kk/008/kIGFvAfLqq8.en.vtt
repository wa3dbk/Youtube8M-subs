a lot of time I got this little corsage
top<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.630> it's<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.810> little<00:02:52.110> bit<00:02:52.380> too<00:02:52.590> small

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
top and it's a little bit too small

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.130 
top and it's a little bit too small
though<00:02:53.070> so<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.340> have<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.760> do<00:02:53.880> some<00:02:54.090> suing<00:02:54.450> and

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
though so I have to do some suing and

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.320 
though so I have to do some suing and
what<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.590> thought<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.250> was<00:02:56.459> look<00:02:56.670> really

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
what I thought this was look really

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.020 
what I thought this was look really
really<00:02:57.630> nice<00:02:57.810> with<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.260> maxi<00:02:58.860> skirt<00:02:59.160> in<00:02:59.459> this

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
really nice with this maxi skirt in this

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.150 
really nice with this maxi skirt in this
cream<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.840> nude<00:03:01.200> color<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:01.650> really

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
cream and nude color I just really

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.630 
cream and nude color I just really
pretty<00:03:03.650> but<00:03:04.650> yeah<00:03:04.830> it<00:03:05.040> has<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.190> little<00:03:05.400> bit<00:03:05.520> of

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
pretty but yeah it has a little bit of

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.550 
pretty but yeah it has a little bit of
stretch<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.240> so<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.600> think<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:07.200> will<00:03:07.320> work

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
stretch to it so I think it will work

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.160 
stretch to it so I think it will work
but<00:03:08.430> for<00:03:08.580> 1<00:03:08.940> euro<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.450> couldn't<00:03:09.810> really<00:03:09.959> resist

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
but for 1 euro I couldn't really resist

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.510 
but for 1 euro I couldn't really resist
not<00:03:10.650> taking<00:03:11.490> this<00:03:11.640> chance<00:03:12.030> ok<00:03:12.900> ok<00:03:13.770> this<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.340> way

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
not taking this chance ok ok this is way

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.120 
not taking this chance ok ok this is way
too<00:03:14.580> small<00:03:15.000> for<00:03:15.060> me<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.480> am<00:03:15.930> but<00:03:16.380> again<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:16.950> can

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
too small for me I am but again I can

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.490 
too small for me I am but again I can
sue<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:17.910> little<00:03:18.209> bit<00:03:18.330> so<00:03:18.570> I<00:03:18.780> think<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.170> will<00:03:19.260> work

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
sue a little bit so I think it will work

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.150 
sue a little bit so I think it will work
if<00:03:19.769> this<00:03:20.459> dress<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:21.180> midi<00:03:22.080> dress<00:03:22.320> I<00:03:22.590> believe<00:03:23.010> it

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
if this dress a midi dress I believe it

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.280 
if this dress a midi dress I believe it
is<00:03:23.310> it's<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.730> little<00:03:23.970> bit<00:03:24.090> long<00:03:24.720> but<00:03:24.959> yeah<00:03:25.260> I

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
is it's a little bit long but yeah I

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.440 
is it's a little bit long but yeah I
think<00:03:25.489> below<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.670> knee<00:03:26.790> something<00:03:27.150> like<00:03:27.300> that

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
think below the knee something like that

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.330 
think below the knee something like that
but<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:27.959> just<00:03:28.260> thought<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.620> pattern<00:03:28.980> was<00:03:29.130> so

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
but I just thought the pattern was so

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.259 
but I just thought the pattern was so
great<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.410> and<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.950> cut<00:03:32.220> it's<00:03:32.850> really

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
great and the and the cut it's really

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.220 
great and the and the cut it's really
wide<00:03:33.480> at<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.870> end<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.800> it<00:03:34.890> goes<00:03:35.070> out<00:03:35.780> also<00:03:36.780> one

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
wide at the end so it goes out also one

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.470 
wide at the end so it goes out also one
euro<00:03:37.709> yeah<00:03:38.010> this<00:03:38.250> was<00:03:38.400> also<00:03:38.580> one<00:03:38.850> euro<00:03:39.150> so

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
euro yeah this was also one euro so

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.990 
euro yeah this was also one euro so
again<00:03:40.160> there<00:03:41.160> was<00:03:41.310> really<00:03:41.519> no<00:03:41.700> room<00:03:41.970> for

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
again there was really no room for

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.850 
again there was really no room for
trying<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.720> clothes<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.320> couldn't<00:03:43.650> try

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
trying the clothes and you couldn't try

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.009 
trying the clothes and you couldn't try
the<00:03:43.920> one<00:03:44.430> year<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.820> been<00:03:45.030> close<00:03:45.480> they<00:03:45.720> wouldn't

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
the one year of been close they wouldn't

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.410 
the one year of been close they wouldn't
let<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.290> do<00:03:46.410> that<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.430> really<00:03:48.060> just<00:03:48.239> have

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
let you do that so you really just have

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.810 
let you do that so you really just have
to<00:03:48.660> risk<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:49.110> but<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.709> it's<00:03:50.280> worth<00:03:50.489> it

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
to risk it but it it's worth it

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.020 
to risk it but it it's worth it
so<00:03:51.510> worth<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.890> last<00:03:53.130> thing<00:03:53.459> from<00:03:53.640> freep

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
so worth it the last thing from freep

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.490 
so worth it the last thing from freep
star<00:03:54.390> was<00:03:55.290> this<00:03:56.330> shirt<00:03:57.330> which<00:03:57.959> also<00:03:58.260> turned

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
star was this shirt which also turned

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.890 
star was this shirt which also turned
out<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.830> be<00:03:58.980> one<00:03:59.130> of<00:03:59.160> my<00:03:59.400> favorites<00:03:59.850> I<00:04:00.030> actually

out to be one of my favorites I actually
lifted<00:04:01.470> there<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.920> then<00:04:02.070> I<00:04:02.100> came<00:04:02.220> back<00:04:02.400> and

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
lifted there and then I came back and

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.780 
lifted there and then I came back and
got<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:02.970> because<00:04:03.300> I<00:04:03.600> I<00:04:03.950> couldn't<00:04:04.950> resist<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.550> um

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790

and it turned out to be one of my
favorite<00:04:07.709> -<00:04:07.950> so<00:04:08.160> that's<00:04:08.670> lucky
