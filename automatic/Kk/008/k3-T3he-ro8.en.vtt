on<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.679> super<00:00:14.130> compact<00:00:14.660> tree<00:00:15.660> farm<00:00:15.900> BAM<00:00:16.379> alright

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
on a super compact tree farm BAM alright

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.070 
on a super compact tree farm BAM alright
so<00:00:17.400> what<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.760> like<00:00:17.910> my<00:00:17.970> third<00:00:18.420> tree<00:00:18.779> farm

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
so what is this like my third tree farm

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.200 
so what is this like my third tree farm
fourth<00:00:19.470> tree<00:00:19.800> farm<00:00:20.100> this<00:00:20.640> actually<00:00:21.000> came<00:00:21.150> from

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
fourth tree farm this actually came from

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.840 
fourth tree farm this actually came from
a<00:00:21.510> challenge<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.590> guess<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.949> sorts<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.550> don't

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
a challenge I guess of sorts I don't

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.220 
a challenge I guess of sorts I don't
know<00:00:23.939> if<00:00:24.000> he's<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> subscriber<00:00:24.630> or<00:00:24.779> not<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.170> he

know if he's a subscriber or not but he
commented<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:25.769> my<00:00:25.830> sticky<00:00:26.250> list<00:00:26.550> compact<00:00:27.090> tree

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
commented on my sticky list compact tree

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.509 
commented on my sticky list compact tree
farm<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.900> he<00:00:28.289> said<00:00:28.500> he<00:00:28.590> made<00:00:28.740> one<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.220> he

farm and he said he made one and he
wanted<00:00:29.789> basically<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.269> challenge<00:00:30.750> me<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.019> use

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
wanted basically to challenge me to use

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.500 
wanted basically to challenge me to use
no<00:00:31.470> repeaters<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.520> semi-auto

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
no repeaters on it on a semi-auto

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.540 
no repeaters on it on a semi-auto
where's<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.410> other<00:00:34.500> one<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.920> had<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.340> mean

conversation on this one yeah and so hey
his<00:00:41.940> was<00:00:42.239> as<00:00:42.899> he<00:00:43.110> states<00:00:43.440> two<00:00:43.980> by<00:00:44.129> four<00:00:44.370> by

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
his was as he states two by four by

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.330 
his was as he states two by four by
eight<00:00:44.700> 264<00:00:45.450> blocks<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.899> volume<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.950> challenge

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
eight 264 blocks in volume the challenge

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.220 
eight 264 blocks in volume the challenge
was<00:00:47.489> no<00:00:47.730> sticky<00:00:48.059> pistons<00:00:48.539> we're<00:00:49.110> not

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
was no sticky pistons we're not

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.139 
was no sticky pistons we're not
including<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> wallet<00:00:50.070> piston<00:00:50.430> either<00:00:50.820> just

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
including the wallet piston either just

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.520 
including the wallet piston either just
you<00:00:51.329> know<00:00:51.449> I'm<00:00:51.750> assuming<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> mechanism<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
you know I'm assuming the mechanism and

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.410 
you know I'm assuming the mechanism and
what<00:00:55.530> else<00:00:55.649> n-no<00:00:56.010> repeaters<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.120> basically

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
what else n-no repeaters so basically

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.450 
what else n-no repeaters so basically
this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.719> my<00:00:58.289> response<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:59.010> is<00:01:00.109> 77<00:01:01.109> tall<00:01:01.460> for

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
this is my response it is 77 tall for

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.130 
this is my response it is 77 tall for
because<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> block<00:01:03.300> stopper<00:01:03.719> that's<00:01:03.899> need

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
because of the block stopper that's need

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.020 
because of the block stopper that's need
to<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.500> don't<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.739> any<00:01:04.890> freak<00:01:05.250> trees

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
to see you don't have any freak trees

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.039 
to see you don't have any freak trees
and<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.260> out<00:01:07.830> one<00:01:08.010> wide<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.880> 7<00:01:09.270> by<00:01:09.390> 4<00:01:09.450> 20

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and it is out one wide so 7 by 4 20

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.160 
and it is out one wide so 7 by 4 20
blocks<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.619> volume<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.299> supposed<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> hit<00:01:12.540> 64

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
blocks and volume I supposed to hit 64

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.390 
blocks and volume I supposed to hit 64
so<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.130> that's<00:01:14.340> pretty<00:01:14.850> much<00:01:14.970> all<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.360> is

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
so on that's pretty much all it is

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.840 
so on that's pretty much all it is
rotary<00:01:17.400> crow<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.750> buttons<00:01:19.049> there<00:01:19.610> you<00:01:20.610> place

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
rotary crow the buttons there you place

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.859 
rotary crow the buttons there you place
it<00:01:21.060> down<00:01:21.680> bone<00:01:22.680> meal<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:26.509> it's<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.570> little

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
it down bone meal it it's a little

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.510 
it down bone meal it it's a little
cramped<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.799> there<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.009> guess<00:01:29.340> oh<00:01:29.549> man<00:01:31.520> there

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
cramped in there I guess oh man there

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.149 
cramped in there I guess oh man there
you<00:01:32.549> go<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.840> basically<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.350> know<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.500> it

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
you go and so basically you know I it

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.310 
you go and so basically you know I it
only<00:01:35.520> grows<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:36.000> four<00:01:36.240> tall<00:01:36.479> these<00:01:36.689> pistons

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
only grows to be four tall these pistons

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.300 
only grows to be four tall these pistons
the<00:01:37.439> additional<00:01:37.890> are<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.729> there<00:01:38.909> simply<00:01:39.329> to

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
the additional are just there simply to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.649 
the additional are just there simply to
you<00:01:41.310> know<00:01:41.430> push<00:01:41.640> out<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.000> leaf<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.540> it

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
you know push out the leaf so that it

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.810 
you know push out the leaf so that it
can<00:01:42.780> help<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.170> tree<00:01:43.380> grow<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.579> that's<00:01:44.700> pretty

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
can help the tree grow but that's pretty

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.289 
can help the tree grow but that's pretty
much<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.090> gist<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.909> there<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.000> go<00:01:48.119> I

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
much the gist of this there you go I

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.609 
much the gist of this there you go I
guess<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.899> guys<00:01:49.020> want<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> see<00:01:49.380> how<00:01:49.439> it's

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
guess if you guys want to see how it's

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.289 
guess if you guys want to see how it's
built<00:01:49.770> its<00:01:50.040> 1<00:01:50.340> 2<00:01:50.579> 3<00:01:51.299> 4<00:01:51.780> 5<00:01:52.470> 6<00:01:52.939> put<00:01:53.939> your<00:01:54.090> blog

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
stopper right there put a block there

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.639 
stopper right there put a block there
and<00:01:58.009> then<00:01:59.009> we<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.130> kind<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.520> spiral<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.240> up

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
and then we just kind of spiral this up

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:08.210 
and then we just kind of spiral this up
like<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.360> like<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:04.579> that<00:02:05.579> like<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:07.220> whetstone
