00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.169
 how about friends how are they very good 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.450
 days my name is jose Luis and in this 

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:09.539
 occasion we bring an aquarium arrived from 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.339
 venezuela is sent to us by Alberto 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:14.129
 and he tells us that he has approximately 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:16.769
 a year with the aquarium and which has 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.330
 a capacity of 230 liters that added 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.390
 with the liters of the sun comes to a total 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.490
 of 400 so you practically zoom 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.230
 must be of the same capacity as the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.419
 main aquarium is dedicated 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.099
 mainly to the corals although 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.890
 It also has some fish species 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.410
 how are a blue surgeon two clowns 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.719
 solar a Spanish dog a surgeon 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.699
 bell and ferocious and a yellow surgeon but 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.739
 as we discussed the passion of Alberto 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.719
 are the corals when you have great 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.600
 amount of corals control the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.430
 Calcium and magnesium alkalinity are 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.010
 to return part of the control of your 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.350
 values in the sea the water acquires all 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.660
 these nutrients naturally the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.120
 concentration of metal ions such 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.800
 like calcium magnesium iron and zinc are 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.750
 acquired when the water collides with 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.640
 rocks so in our aquariums 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.950
 we will have to keep balanced 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.700
 these concentrations and there are two 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.770
 main ways 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.930
 values ​​like these the first one is the one 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.060
 use alberto editing the elements 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.299
 natural as are sodium bicarbonate 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.490
 for calcium chloride alkalinity and 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.079
 magnesium chloride in this part alone 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.630
 you have to be very aware of your 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.700
 values and avoid just the exact amount 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.700
 what you need to keep them stable 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.950
 the other way but a lot more expensive is 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.450
 buying the commercial products the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.880
 which many of these are already coming 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.340
 balanced but as I repeat the cost 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.259
 increases considerably and when the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.119
 amount of liters you have to nourish 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.759
 the option that manages is considerable 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.979
 Alberto is very good as you can give 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.380
 account the world of corals is another 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.360
 long and complex theme and is that this 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.920
 world of marine aquariums is only 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.110
 for who we really are 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.759
 passionate about this so the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.159
 research becomes part of our 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.780
 everyday life my name is jose luis 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.470
 thank you very much for following us in networks 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.060

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.729
 Alberto, thank you very much for your video 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.989
 Greetings to my daughter no one who says that 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.670
 someday he would like to talk about 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:08.560
 some kind so soon 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.530
