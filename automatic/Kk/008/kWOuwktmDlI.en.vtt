00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
bringing our joystick technology that

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.930 
bringing our joystick technology that
we've<00:00:39.420> had<00:00:39.570> out<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:40.170> Zeus<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.010> axes<00:00:41.520> now<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
we've had out for Zeus and axes now and

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.810 
we've had out for Zeus and axes now and
bring<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.540> world<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.809> outwards<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.820> you

know<00:00:44.940> really<00:00:45.510> bringing<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.680> joystick

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
know really bringing that that joystick

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.740 
know really bringing that that joystick
capability<00:00:47.940> where<00:00:48.120> you're<00:00:48.210> controlling<00:00:48.539> both

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
capability where you're controlling both

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.709 
capability where you're controlling both

your throttle and your steering all you
know<00:00:51.809> through<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> simple<00:00:52.410> inputs<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.160> that

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
know through the simple inputs of that

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.310 
know through the simple inputs of that
joystick<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.210> bring<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.690> into<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.989> upper

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
joystick and bring it into the upper

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.869 
joystick and bring it into the upper
world<00:00:55.559> really<00:00:55.949> making<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.309> easier<00:00:56.640> for<00:00:56.670> those

good<00:01:37.770> when<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.400> would<00:01:38.549> do<00:01:38.729> when<00:01:39.210> would<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.450> hit

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
good when we would do when would it hit

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.020 
good when we would do when would it hit
the<00:01:40.110> market<00:01:40.530> what<00:01:41.130> we're<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.610> both

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030

great so it's not

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.520 
great so it's not
not<00:01:52.220> that<00:01:52.430> far<00:01:52.700> no<00:01:53.030> not<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.390> borrow<00:01:53.690> do<00:01:54.440> you

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
not that far no not to borrow do you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.790 
not that far no not to borrow do you
know<00:01:54.680> if<00:01:55.010> this<00:01:55.580> is<00:01:55.610> this<00:01:56.150> this<00:01:56.690> is<00:01:56.930> going<00:01:57.409> to<00:01:57.560> be

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
know if this is this this is going to be

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.370 
know if this is this this is going to be
I<00:01:57.830> think<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.310> first<00:01:58.490> joystick<00:01:59.120> system<00:01:59.630> for

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
I think the first joystick system for

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.900 
I think the first joystick system for
from<00:02:01.010> a<00:02:01.130> production<00:02:01.520> standpoint

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
from a production standpoint

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.300 
from a production standpoint
four<00:02:04.910> outputs<00:02:05.300> I<00:02:05.480> believe<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:06.080> it's<00:02:06.470> at<00:02:06.980> this

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
four outputs I believe that it's at this

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.670 
four outputs I believe that it's at this
time<00:02:07.490> it's<00:02:07.700> my<00:02:07.730> understanding<00:02:07.940> so<00:02:08.680> well

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
time it's my understanding so well

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.470 
time it's my understanding so well
