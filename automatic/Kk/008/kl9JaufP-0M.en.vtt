00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.110
 urk 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:14.879
 exactly nine years ago this month they invaded the other chance in Afghanistan 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:17.879
 Taliban regime was overthrown but that did not go without a struggle 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.010
 more than two thousand soldiers died worldwide due to the resistance 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.689
 of the terrorist group 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.240
 so then here you can decide to operate the taliban as a playable faction with hollow 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.449
 bolle to stop they received a lot of criticism from friends and family who perished 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:32.670
 soldiers 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.650
 eventually the publisher went tacking with the Taliban to the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.960
 toppers and fortis 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.550
 valverde is just like the soldiers who have served in afghanistan what had not 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.330
 need 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.530
 But I think if you look now I agree 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.970
 10 that also brings you to war zones that have also ended present 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.070
 who have been on the market for a long time also when the war played 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.220
 that they have already made a larger podcast 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.130
 actually needed 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.680
 pass americans 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.300
 I also understand that is include the 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.510
 it still plays with the Taliban 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.340
 but I think so 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.430
 the effects of tamils ​​are different from that of 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.430
 nations 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.020
 maybe an issue that is not recognizable in the picture 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.759
 gag in the skin of the american indices bathes in my role of making them 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.810
 are particularly impressed with the environment 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.120
 and the environment 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.050
 superrealistically imitated there is a northern part of afghanistan 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.850
 so that is somewhat less known to us 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.640
 but as the k last support point sees salt houses before it was endorsed 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.370
 became too 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.840
 what I did I immediately saw the school back 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.230
 the truss 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.470
 that was just right 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.770
 with most game it's straight 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.490
 Rotterdam is being set a day full in advance and read the whole earlier 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.810
 environment 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.820
 You will also notice the game play follow game time 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.740
 a 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.099
 that fact this is a cross from nacer behind you in houses 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.719
 8 broom 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.509
 that is the enemy as good as invisible 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.509
 everyone could not be safe either 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.560
 penn are nicely concealed every time the terrain is changed 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:24.659
 just by you 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.669
 that really should do your best to spot the enemy 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.989
 then falls recorded 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.980
 what can help stop the enemy is cooperation with climate 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.479
 you have to listen to what is being said in the game 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:43.119
 under easier for homemade wicked comrades in the game I hope so 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:45.809
 already became an enemy 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:48.879
 they are also on TV show coverage or vice versa 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.890
 but good realities but also trying to be for this shop date 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.339
 it remains a game 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.479
 can understand some things in the game 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.709
 more the previous ones are because it is different and 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.049
 become boring games if they didn't put that in 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.060
 but you only see man bring what 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.209
 I'll see what matches or not 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.859
 on the war after such 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.569
 10 cutlery all new and then 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.629
 that you will encounter in the game itself 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.289
 but that made game correct 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:24.309
 match tensen 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.639
 however, must leave afterwards h 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:28.579
 unfortunately
