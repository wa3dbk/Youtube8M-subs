00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
anchor you can use some type of stable

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.299 
anchor you can use some type of stable
hole<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.210> put<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.480> around<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:31.140> free<00:00:31.650> now<00:00:31.949> we

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
hole to put this around for free now we

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.130 
hole to put this around for free now we
usually<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.030> do<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.570> way<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:33.989> can

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
usually like to do it this way so we can

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.970 
usually like to do it this way so we can
come<00:00:34.380> behind<00:00:34.920> them<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.670> see<00:00:35.969> them<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:37.170> loading

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
up on this side Tom's got a wide stable

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.010 
up on this side Tom's got a wide stable
base<00:00:40.530> he's<00:00:41.460> gonna<00:00:41.610> get<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> slightly<00:00:42.120> then<00:00:42.540> he's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
base he's gonna get a slightly then he's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.180 
base he's gonna get a slightly then he's
going<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.260> focus<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.680> driving<00:00:43.920> with<00:00:44.160> that

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
going to focus on driving with that

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.549 
going to focus on driving with that
right<00:00:44.520> hit<00:00:44.789> first<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.420> then<00:00:45.989> buckling<00:00:46.350> that

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
right hit first and then buckling that

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.590 
right hit first and then buckling that
back<00:00:46.770> knee<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.489> let's<00:00:47.670> see<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> couple<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.360> start

more forward into its today back toe I

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.580 
more forward into its today back toe I
want<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> see<00:00:57.510> actually<00:00:57.809> pivot<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.199> little<00:00:58.469> bit

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
want to see actually pivot a little bit

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:23.510 
want to see actually pivot a little bit
more<00:00:58.829> comes<00:00:59.609> off<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.059> toe<00:01:22.280> that's<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.369> lot

better the faster you go obviously it's
a<00:01:26.009> good<00:01:26.580> metabolic<00:01:27.150> movement<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> ballistic

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
a good metabolic movement a ballistic

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.010 
a good metabolic movement a ballistic
movement<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.390> love<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.600> do<00:01:30.780> with<00:01:30.900> our

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
movement that we love to do with our

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.870 
movement that we love to do with our
tennis<00:01:31.290> players<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.400> also<00:01:32.579> do<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
tennis players we can also do the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.420 
tennis players we can also do the
backhand<00:01:33.090> side<00:01:33.600> let's<00:01:33.869> swing<00:01:34.079> around<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.560> sit

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
backhand side let's swing around and sit

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.080 
backhand side let's swing around and sit
down<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.820> other<00:01:35.970> side

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.090 

so<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.540> can<00:01:43.660> also<00:01:43.810> see<00:01:43.960> some<00:01:44.350> instability<00:01:44.680> too

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
so you can also see some instability too

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.490 
so you can also see some instability too
soon<00:01:45.280> where<00:01:45.460> players<00:01:45.700> Tom's<00:01:46.030> got<00:01:46.180> a<00:01:46.500> pretty

level
just<00:02:11.920> pivoting<00:02:12.220> like<00:02:12.430> this<00:02:12.580> where<00:02:12.730> we

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
just pivoting like this where we

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.220 
just pivoting like this where we
actually<00:02:12.940> want<00:02:13.270> them<00:02:13.360> for<00:02:13.480> driving<00:02:13.810> in<00:02:13.990> like

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
actually want them for driving in like

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:35.790 
actually want them for driving in like
you<00:02:14.380> would<00:02:14.709> on<00:02:14.920> any<00:02:15.220> shot<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.650> fast<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:35.020> with

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
you would on any shot so fast so with

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.199 
you would on any shot so fast so with
this<00:02:35.980> there's<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:36.370> many<00:02:36.459> progressions<00:02:37.090> that

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
this there's so many progressions that

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.780 
this there's so many progressions that
we<00:02:37.360> can<00:02:37.570> do<00:02:37.920> where<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:38.950> can<00:02:39.130> add<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.310> weight<00:02:39.610> in

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
we can do where you can add a weight in

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.010 
we can do where you can add a weight in
their<00:02:39.910> hands<00:02:40.330> you<00:02:40.390> can<00:02:40.510> be<00:02:40.600> throwing<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> med
