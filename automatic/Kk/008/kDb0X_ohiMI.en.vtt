a dark green um that it fuses into this

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.130 
a dark green um that it fuses into this
kind<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.399> tan<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.210> that's<00:01:54.420> all<00:01:54.570> good<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:54.899> I'm

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
but they can move better and so it's

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.070 
but they can move better and so it's
pretty<00:04:08.670> much<00:04:08.850> your<00:04:08.910> preference<00:04:09.420> which<00:04:09.870> one's

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080

the<00:04:10.230> better<00:04:10.410> figure<00:04:10.740> the<00:04:11.190> comic<00:04:11.640> version<00:04:11.760> is

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
the better figure the comic version is

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.540 
the better figure the comic version is
better<00:04:12.090> figure<00:04:12.480> but<00:04:13.260> um<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.740> know<00:04:13.860> it's<00:04:14.370> not

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
better figure but um you know it's not

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.099 
better figure but um you know it's not
