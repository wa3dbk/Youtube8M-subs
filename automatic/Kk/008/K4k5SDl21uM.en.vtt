00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
heavy-handed politics that it invites

heavy-handed politics that it invites
criticism<00:04:22.530> certainly<00:04:23.530> will<00:04:23.680> probably<00:04:23.950> invite

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
criticism certainly will probably invite

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.100

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
criticism for even doing this too but at

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.200 
criticism for even doing this too but at
least<00:04:26.200> this<00:04:26.380> was<00:04:26.590> fun<00:04:26.920> I<00:04:27.190> think<00:04:27.850> that<00:04:28.000> that

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
least this was fun I think that that

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.760 
least this was fun I think that that
video<00:04:28.480> is<00:04:28.660> interesting<00:04:29.260> in<00:04:29.380> that<00:04:29.410> it<00:04:29.590> really

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
video is interesting in that it really

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.460 
video is interesting in that it really
points<00:04:30.070> out<00:04:30.340> sort<00:04:30.730> of<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.630> inconsistency

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
points out sort of the the inconsistency

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.620 
points out sort of the the inconsistency
or<00:04:32.770> hypocrisy<00:04:33.130> of<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:33.970> tradition<00:04:34.360> itself

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
or hypocrisy of the tradition itself

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.750 
or hypocrisy of the tradition itself
that<00:04:34.960> she<00:04:35.440> goes<00:04:35.620> inside<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:36.280> pardons<00:04:36.640> one

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
that she goes inside and pardons one

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
for a few minutes and so he did that

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.610 
for a few minutes and so he did that
while<00:04:51.340> choking<00:04:51.550> that<00:04:51.820> turkey<00:04:52.170> but<00:04:53.170> in<00:04:53.380> terms

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
seem to like it they like the idea that

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.790 
seem to like it they like the idea that
the<00:05:02.690> turkeys<00:05:02.960> gonna<00:05:03.110> go<00:05:03.230> and<00:05:03.350> live<00:05:03.470> in<00:05:03.500> a<00:05:03.590> farm

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
for the rest of its life but it is it's

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.960 
for the rest of its life but it is it's
a<00:05:05.780> very<00:05:05.960> odd<00:05:06.170> holiday<00:05:06.770> both<00:05:07.310> because<00:05:07.610> one<00:05:07.820> it

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
a very odd holiday both because one it

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.760 
a very odd holiday both because one it
sort<00:05:08.210> of<00:05:08.270> makes<00:05:08.420> a<00:05:08.510> mockery<00:05:08.720> of<00:05:09.080> turkeys<00:05:09.560> and

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
sort of makes a mockery of turkeys and

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.410 
sort of makes a mockery of turkeys and
other<00:05:10.040> animals<00:05:10.550> that<00:05:10.730> are<00:05:10.820> used<00:05:11.030> for<00:05:11.120> food

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
other animals that are used for food

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.570 
other animals that are used for food
it's<00:05:11.630> not<00:05:11.780> like<00:05:11.960> he<00:05:12.410> pardons<00:05:12.890> the<00:05:13.040> turkey<00:05:13.400> and

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
it's not like he pardons the turkey and

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.920 
it's not like he pardons the turkey and
then<00:05:13.670> they<00:05:13.790> go<00:05:13.910> on<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:14.060> have<00:05:14.210> a<00:05:14.330> very<00:05:14.630> Merry

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
then they go on to have a very Merry

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.230 
then they go on to have a very Merry
vegan<00:05:15.560> dinner<00:05:15.890> for<00:05:16.250> Thanksgiving<00:05:16.400> no<00:05:17.000> they

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
vegan dinner for Thanksgiving no they

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.600 
vegan dinner for Thanksgiving no they
eat<00:05:17.420> other<00:05:17.630> animals<00:05:17.840> and<00:05:18.530> so<00:05:19.010> it<00:05:19.100> seems<00:05:19.340> weird

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
eat other animals and so it seems weird

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.970 
eat other animals and so it seems weird
to<00:05:19.820> like<00:05:20.060> choose<00:05:20.450> one<00:05:20.870> it<00:05:21.170> feels<00:05:21.680> like<00:05:21.860> The

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
to like choose one it feels like The
