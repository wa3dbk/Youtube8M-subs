just mix all that and we're gonna let
that<00:01:07.380> go<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.159> that's<00:01:08.340> gonna<00:01:08.520> be<00:01:08.760> all<00:01:08.970> coconut

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420

syrup<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.439> while<00:01:10.619> we<00:01:10.770> let<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.100> cook<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.640> we

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
syrup so while we let that cook so we

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.219 
syrup so while we let that cook so we
can<00:01:11.909> probably<00:01:12.119> start<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> French<00:01:12.930> toast

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
can probably start on the French toast

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.440 
can probably start on the French toast
batter<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.400> milk<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.150> then<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.330> have

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
batter so we have milk and then we have

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.350 
batter so we have milk and then we have
some<00:01:15.630> eggs<00:01:15.869> whole<00:01:16.590> eggs<00:01:16.650> or<00:01:17.280> horse<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> best

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
some eggs whole eggs or horse the best

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.630 
some eggs whole eggs or horse the best
and<00:01:19.110> then<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.590> some<00:01:20.040> vanilla<00:01:20.400> extract

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
and then we have some vanilla extract

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.539 
and then we have some vanilla extract
and<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:21.420> cinnamon<00:01:21.930> again<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:23.130> more<00:01:23.280> flavor

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
and then cinnamon again for more flavor

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.270 
and then cinnamon again for more flavor
and<00:01:24.030> then<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.299> could<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:24.799> whisk<00:01:25.799> all<00:01:26.070> that

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
and then you could just whisk all that

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
and then you could just whisk all that
together<00:01:26.460> how<00:01:27.270> old<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.869> recipe<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
been around for over 60 years so you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.390 
been around for over 60 years so you
know<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.600> recipe<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.170> use<00:01:34.409> today<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
know the recipe that we use today is the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.340 
know the recipe that we use today is the
exact<00:01:35.729> same<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.240> my<00:01:36.360> grandfather<00:01:36.840> had<00:01:37.110> made

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
exact same that my grandfather had made

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.440 
exact same that my grandfather had made
back<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.979> Hilo<00:01:38.430> many<00:01:38.700> years<00:01:38.909> ago<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
back in Hilo many years ago so the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.719 
back in Hilo many years ago so the
family<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.930> very<00:01:40.200> committed<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.280> keeping<00:01:41.490> that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
family is very committed to keeping that

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.870 
family is very committed to keeping that
same<00:01:42.090> recipe<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.290> same<00:01:43.860> quality<00:01:44.310> ingredients

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
same recipe and same quality ingredients

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.609 
same recipe and same quality ingredients
so<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.180> think<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.659> batter<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.110> about<00:01:46.320> ready<00:01:46.560> for

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
so I think the batter is about ready for

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.670 
so I think the batter is about ready for
us<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.130> start<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.790> all<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.329> need<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.570> do<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:49.049> dip

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
us to start so all we need to do is dip

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.580 
us to start so all we need to do is dip
the<00:01:49.890> bread<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:51.540> dip<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.229> this

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the bread in and just dip it like this

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.069 
the bread in and just dip it like this
and<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:53.790> we'll<00:01:54.000> throw<00:01:54.210> some<00:01:54.450> butter<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
pan and then once it's ready we could

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.120 
pan and then once it's ready we could
just<00:01:57.180> throw<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.380> then<00:01:58.890> we'll<00:01:59.009> just

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
just throw it in and then we'll just

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.920 
just throw it in and then we'll just
cook<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.399> off<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.850> then<00:02:00.090> we'll<00:02:00.420> top<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.659> with
