00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.799
 it's a story of preservation of 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.250
 the species in fact the woman is designed to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.160
 birth 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.449
 and for this purpose the body has planned to 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.939
 put in place mechanisms to 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.529
 storage for power always fed 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.660
 the child even in times of scarcity 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.949
 a woman today she secretes ten 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.390
 times less testosterone than a man 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.859
 is a lot less hormones 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.199
 growth also the two hormones that 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.550
 allow to take muscle and 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.530
 then she secretes progesterone 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.480
 which is a hormone that prevents 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.120
 to take muscle so already chemically 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.370
 she has everything against her to not 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.390
 can lose fat 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.100
 then the second element it is 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.110
 of behavioral origin as they 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.010
 tend to store a lot more 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.420
 women have only one desire is to 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.469
 lose that gr and what do they do 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.000
 when they want to lose that they 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.449
 diets a woman who makes a 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.570
 diet 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.329
 his body will want to store for 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.739
 preserve fat so if a woman 's 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.629
 to lose weight it is important not that she 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.649
 make a diet they have to 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.239
 focus on the quality of these 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.430
 nutritional intake by having a 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.860
 food thought about those whose 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.670
 body needs to be balanced and 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.189
 that she does sport 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.500
 if she plays sports she will increase 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.610
 its secretion of testosterone and 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.990
 of growth hormone these two 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.720
 hormones that make it possible to 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.920
 muscle at the expense of fat so the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.299
 solution for women this is the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.570
 see bottom of tri dimensional thinking 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.580
 correct healthy and associate it with 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.930
 cardio that consume calories and 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.030
 let's do the muscu that goes 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.650
 allow to destock brown and especially 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.300
 the key word of a pro 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.830
 slimming for a woman is patience 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.250
 it's something that fits into 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.140
 the duration 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.940
 you will only get results if you 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.410
 are patient then it is necessary above all 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.600
 not compare yourself to your spouse if he 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.010
 does same program that you nature 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.540
 is unfair he secretes ten times more 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.380
 testosterone you a lot more 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.300
 growth hormone 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.970
 so the results even it is a lot 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.680
 more quickly so no comparison 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.680
 with his man and patience
