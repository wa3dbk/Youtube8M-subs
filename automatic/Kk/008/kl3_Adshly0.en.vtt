00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.920 
will have a knife some powerful burns on
them<00:04:10.410> kind<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:10.980> like<00:04:11.100> if<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.250> were<00:04:11.400> grilling

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
them kind of like if you were grilling

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.400 
them kind of like if you were grilling
I've<00:04:12.930> warmed<00:04:13.320> up<00:04:13.590> about<00:04:13.980> a<00:04:14.040> half<00:04:14.400> a<00:04:14.700> cup<00:04:15.030> of

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
I've warmed up about a half a cup of

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.570 
I've warmed up about a half a cup of
brown<00:04:16.410> rice<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.739> maybe<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.190> little<00:04:17.400> off

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
brown rice and maybe a little off

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.060 
brown rice and maybe a little off

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
because I didn't measure but you can see

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.390

it's<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.370> nice<00:04:20.940> serving<00:04:21.480> but<00:04:21.660> definitely

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
it's a nice serving but definitely

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.850 
it's a nice serving but definitely
proportion<00:04:23.400> it's<00:04:23.550> not<00:04:23.730> over<00:04:24.470> it's<00:04:25.470> not<00:04:25.650> too

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
proportion it's not over it's not too

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.770 
proportion it's not over it's not too
