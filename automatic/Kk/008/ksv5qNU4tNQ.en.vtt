I<00:01:09.540> mean<00:01:09.659> saving<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.110> obviously<00:01:10.530> critical<00:01:11.010> but

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
I mean saving is obviously critical but

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.700 
I mean saving is obviously critical but
they<00:01:11.760> focus<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.420> earning<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.290> they<00:01:13.439> don't<00:01:13.590> have

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
they focus on earning so they don't have

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.350 
they focus on earning so they don't have
to<00:01:13.799> really<00:01:13.979> make<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> big<00:01:14.460> killing<00:01:14.729> when<00:01:15.180> in

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
to really make the big killing when in

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.170 
to really make the big killing when in
their<00:01:15.509> investments<00:01:16.049> luckily<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.530> now<00:01:17.180> they

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
their investments luckily for now they

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.999 
their investments luckily for now they
so<00:01:18.390> they<00:01:18.509> focus<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:18.930> earning<00:01:19.350> money<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.680> then

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
so they focus on earning money and then

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.050 
so they focus on earning money and then
they<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.490> then<00:01:20.580> they<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.790> invest

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
they can and then they can invest

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.859 
they can and then they can invest
conservatively

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
conservatively

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.330 
conservatively
that's<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.320> because<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> next<00:01:23.130> thing<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
that's it because the next thing the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.980 
that's it because the next thing the

fear-based situation there's all these

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.729 
fear-based situation there's all these
new<00:02:14.909> problems<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.360> solve<00:02:15.599> how<00:02:16.170> do<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.409> turn

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
new problems to solve how do you turn

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.229 
new problems to solve how do you turn
things<00:02:17.069> around<00:02:17.220> if<00:02:17.730> you're<00:02:17.879> if<00:02:18.030> you're<00:02:18.209> a

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
things around if you're if you're a

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.240 
things around if you're if you're a

person who wants to be rich you have the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.619 
person who wants to be rich you have the
mindset<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.819> know<00:02:20.940> that's<00:02:21.120> what<00:02:21.269> you<00:02:21.360> want<00:02:21.540> to

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
mindset you know that's what you want to

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.199 
mindset you know that's what you want to
be<00:02:21.750> yet<00:02:22.379> you've<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:22.890> deep<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.430> debt<00:02:23.700> how<00:02:24.000> do<00:02:24.060> you

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
be yet you've so deep in debt how do you

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.850 
be yet you've so deep in debt how do you
turn<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.750> around<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:25.349> think<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.620> start

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
turn that around I think you start

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.259 
turn that around I think you start
thinking<00:02:26.250> like<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.430> wealthy<00:02:26.819> person<00:02:27.180> you've

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
thinking like a wealthy person you've

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.640 
thinking like a wealthy person you've
got<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.480> learn<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.629> differences<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.349> thinking

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
got to learn the differences in thinking

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.050 
got to learn the differences in thinking
they<00:02:28.860> it's<00:02:29.190> like<00:02:29.370> they're<00:02:29.549> living<00:02:29.879> in<00:02:30.000> a

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
they it's like they're living in a

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.640 
they it's like they're living in a
different<00:02:30.269> planet<00:02:30.720> they<00:02:31.230> think<00:02:31.500> so

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
different planet they think so

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.259 
different planet they think so
differently<00:02:32.069> than<00:02:32.280> most<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:32.849> us<00:02:32.940> are<00:02:33.090> taught

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
differently than most of us are taught

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.789 
differently than most of us are taught
so<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.810> think<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.049> got<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.260> learn<00:02:34.409> how<00:02:34.470> they

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
so I think you got to learn how they

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.350 
so I think you got to learn how they
think<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.310> then<00:02:35.489> you've<00:02:35.610> got<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.819> adopt<00:02:36.120> those

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
think and then you've got to adopt those

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.149 
think and then you've got to adopt those
those<00:02:36.690> philosophies<00:02:37.409> and<00:02:37.560> those<00:02:37.680> ideals<00:02:38.040> and

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
those philosophies and those ideals and

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.830 
those philosophies and those ideals and
those<00:02:38.280> habits<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.940> things<00:02:39.390> will<00:02:39.599> start<00:02:39.629> to

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
those habits and things will start to

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.270 
those habits and things will start to
turn<00:02:40.049> around<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.560> talk<00:02:40.739> about<00:02:40.890> learning<00:02:41.040> how

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
turn around you talk about learning how

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.619 
turn around you talk about learning how
they<00:02:41.400> think<00:02:41.610> one<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:41.879> is<00:02:42.030> just<00:02:42.209> as<00:02:42.329> you<00:02:42.420> say

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
they think one this is just as you say

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.110 
they think one this is just as you say
is<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.870> pick<00:02:43.049> the<00:02:43.079> one<00:02:43.379> person<00:02:43.829> or<00:02:43.980> people<00:02:44.700> that

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
is to pick the one person or people that

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.000 
is to pick the one person or people that
you<00:02:45.180> admire<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.019> they<00:02:46.319> probably<00:02:46.530> got<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.769> book

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
you admire and they probably got a book
