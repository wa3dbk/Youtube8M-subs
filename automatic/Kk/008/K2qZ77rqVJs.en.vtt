00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:17.680
 hello good morning 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.680
 today I'm going to make some earrings 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.550
 They are very simple to do 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.740
 and I use Indonesian grains that are 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.710
 some balls that are super nice 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.830
 decorated are very well worked and 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.450
 aluminum wire here in information 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.239
 of the video I'll leave the links where 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.300
 I buy the balls and good wire 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.700
 and all that so you can see more or 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.980
 less the prices and such 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.650
 to do it 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.540
 let's use indonesia grain 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.860
 is 1 centimeter you can also 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.860
 use a normal ball 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.030
 aluminum wire 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.460
 from a millimeter and a half 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.110
 You are also going to use a meter to 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.300
 can guide us in the measures 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.450
 and the usual pliers in the cutting 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.020
 flat and round to shape 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.020
 the spirals 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.619
 you'll see how simple it is to do it 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.090
 we're just going to cut a piece of 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.090
 15 centimeters wire 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.810
 we also need the hook of the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.090
 earring and a ring 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.460
 we cut the wire of 15 centimeters and 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.830
 let's put the grain of indonesia 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.600
 then we are going to take it more or less to 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.400
 half of the wire 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.900
 and we are going to fold from bottom to top 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.900
 and up down 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.509
 so that it wraps what is the grain 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.920
 from indonesia 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.620
 here you have it 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.220
 and now we're going to shape the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.220
 spirals 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.550
 if they are inclined towards the part 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.510
 we are going to screw them to the left 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.799
 Right part 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.799
 we take the extreme 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.200
 and we started to screw 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.709
 there would be one and now we are going to do 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.840
 the bottom one exactly the same if it's 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.310
 leaning to the left we go to 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.310
 roll it to the right 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.760
 it would be like that 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.780
 I'm going to zoom in so you can see it better 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.060
 it stays like this 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.130
 and now we just stretch the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.630
 spiral down the top on the 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.780
 that we are going to put the hook of the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.780
 ring 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.790
 we open it 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.400
 we put 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.400
 the top of the spiral 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.110
 Y 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.110
 the hook of the earring 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.270
 we close it 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.810
 as well as we can so that it does not 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.810
 can leave 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.780
 and we would have another pair of earrings 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.780
 super super simple to do 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.330
 I'm going to make you see them 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.340
 you see how beautiful they are and what has 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.470
 lasted the video are done right away like this 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.830
 How good I hope you liked the 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.700
 idea and see you in another video a kiss 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.700
 Take care much
