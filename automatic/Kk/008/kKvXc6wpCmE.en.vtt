00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello my name is olivier I am 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.000
 technical adviser to the federation 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.190
 French mountain and 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.200
 climbed I'll show you how 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.920
 are we putting seal skins in 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.080
 Nordic skiing 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.779
 then the seal skin we call 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.789
 also anti-recoil is the element 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.580
 characteristics of ski touring 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.430
 in fact it's a layer finally a 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.849
 little break of Christmas or synthetic 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.070
 that we place under the ski touring 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.320
 way to get on the slope 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.570
 without retreating without slipping back 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.489
 so of course we choose his skin from 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.730
 Seal according to its own that 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.579
 there are pots quite small for 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.770
 small skis lightweight and the reverse for 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.890
 the big ones that very wide one uses 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.309
 adapted profile pots is cut out of 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.870
 measure for curbet skis on purchase 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.809
 a seal skin the first step 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.690
 will consist of removing protection in 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.690
 plastic so as to be able to release 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.780
 seal skin and the surface in 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.659
 stick according to the models we start with 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.700
 the spatula or by the heel of the ski for 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.700
 position the seal skin 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:24.979
 so you have to make sure that the edge 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.829
 the skin is as close as possible to the 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.320
 quarter of the ski without exceeding 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.590
 otherwise we could damage the skin of 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.619
 seal so the end of the establishment 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.079
 is done by a system of tensioners in 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.420
 plastic or rubber or 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.179
 elastic so that the skin of 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.490
 seal be as tense as possible on 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.560
 the ski so the principle of the skin of 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.689
 seal cut in the antilles recession it's 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.209
 to have small hair of death or 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.399
 synthetic which are all oriented in 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:58.670
 the same meaning and that go perfectly 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.700
 slide in the direction of the climb and who 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.740
 are going to be blocking when we 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.229
 will back off and so they will prevent to 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.580
 skiers back away now you know 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.909
 put a seal skin under your skis 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.909
 hiking
