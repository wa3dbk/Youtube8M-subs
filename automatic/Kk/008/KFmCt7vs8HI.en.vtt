00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.720 

okay<00:00:01.439> in<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.800> video<00:00:01.949> I<00:00:02.159> want<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.399> do<00:00:02.520> another

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
okay in this video I want to do another

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.700 
okay in this video I want to do another
example<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:03.419> writing<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.899> rational<00:00:04.410> expression

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
example of writing a rational expression

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.990 
example of writing a rational expression
in<00:00:05.040> lowest<00:00:05.400> terms

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
in lowest terms

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.410 
in lowest terms
so<00:00:06.150> in<00:00:06.660> this<00:00:07.020> case<00:00:07.290> we<00:00:07.799> have<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.820> cubic

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
so in this case we have a cubic

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.410 
so in this case we have a cubic
polynomial<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.950> numerator<00:00:11.099> X<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.210> 3rd

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
polynomial in the numerator X to the 3rd

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.060 
polynomial in the numerator X to the 3rd
plus<00:00:12.450> 1<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.130> denominator<00:00:14.160> we<00:00:14.880> have<00:00:14.910> a

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
plus 1 and in the denominator we have a

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.720 
plus 1 and in the denominator we have a
familiar<00:00:17.070> quadratic<00:00:18.020> polynomial<00:00:19.070> so<00:00:20.070> recall

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
familiar quadratic polynomial so recall

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.230 
familiar quadratic polynomial so recall
if<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.150> have<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> sum<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.529> cubes<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.670> always

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
if you have a sum of cubes that always

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.779 
if you have a sum of cubes that always
factors<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.109> can<00:00:25.260> factor<00:00:25.410> X<00:00:25.800> cubed<00:00:26.189> plus<00:00:26.460> 1

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
factors so we can factor X cubed plus 1

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.120 
factors so we can factor X cubed plus 1
and<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.289> formula<00:00:28.619> we're<00:00:28.920> going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.070> use

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
and if the formula we're going to use

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.740 
and if the formula we're going to use
here<00:00:29.429> again<00:00:29.490> maybe<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.240> refresh<00:00:30.510> you

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
here again maybe just to refresh you

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.089 
here again maybe just to refresh you
real<00:00:30.929> quick<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.320> remember<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.740> says<00:00:31.890> if<00:00:32.009> you

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
real quick so remember it says if you

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.459 
real quick so remember it says if you
have<00:00:32.279> something<00:00:32.910> cubed<00:00:33.300> plus<00:00:33.899> something

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
have something cubed plus something

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.270 
have something cubed plus something
cubed<00:00:35.780> we<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.140> plus<00:00:37.620> B<00:00:38.239> we<00:00:39.239> get<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.600> squared

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
cubed we get a plus B we get a squared

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.900 
cubed we get a plus B we get a squared
minus<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.309> quantity<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.239> times<00:00:42.570> B<00:00:42.930> plus<00:00:43.910> B

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
minus the quantity a times B plus B

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.040 
minus the quantity a times B plus B
squared<00:00:46.190> so<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.430> case<00:00:47.700> we've<00:00:48.660> got<00:00:48.719> X

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
squared so in this case we've got X

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.650 
squared so in this case we've got X
cubed<00:00:49.410> plus<00:00:49.620> 1<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.250> can<00:00:50.489> actually<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:51.270> can

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
cubed plus 1 so I can actually I can

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.350 
cubed plus 1 so I can actually I can
easily<00:00:51.840> rewrite<00:00:52.379> 1<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:52.890> 1<00:00:53.460> cubed<00:00:53.850> so

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
easily rewrite 1 it's just 1 cubed so

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.020 
easily rewrite 1 it's just 1 cubed so
certainly<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.260> couldn't<00:00:55.469> do<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.710> with<00:00:56.030> any

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
certainly you couldn't do that with any

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.209 
certainly you couldn't do that with any
other<00:00:57.180> numbers<00:00:57.750> except<00:00:58.140> 1<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.739> you'd<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:58.980> to

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
other numbers except 1 so you'd have to

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.250 
other numbers except 1 so you'd have to
rewrite<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.760> but<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.600> I'm<00:01:00.660> going<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.870> write<00:01:01.020> 1

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
rewrite it but so I'm going to write 1

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
rewrite it but so I'm going to write 1
as<00:01:01.410> 1<00:01:01.649> cubed<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.250> now<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.370> see<00:01:02.670> my<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.359> see

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
as 1 cubed and now I see my a and I see

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.440 
as 1 cubed and now I see my a and I see
my<00:01:03.719> B<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.159> factor<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.670> numerator<00:01:06.119> it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
my B so if you factor the numerator it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.190 
my B so if you factor the numerator it
says<00:01:06.720> we'll<00:01:06.900> simply<00:01:07.229> get<00:01:07.409> X<00:01:08.220> plus<00:01:08.790> 1<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.600> says

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
says we'll simply get X plus 1 it says

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.460 
says we'll simply get X plus 1 it says
take<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.590> X<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.280> square<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.909> minus<00:01:12.869> we<00:01:13.320> would

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
take the X and square it minus we would

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.270 
take the X and square it minus we would
get<00:01:13.590> x<00:01:13.830> times<00:01:14.159> 1<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.790> 1<00:01:15.090> X<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.810> then<00:01:16.380> our<00:01:16.770> number

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
get x times 1 or 1 X and then our number

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.870 
get x times 1 or 1 X and then our number
squared<00:01:17.939> would<00:01:18.240> simply<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.750> 1<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.740> then<00:01:20.729> in

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
squared would simply be 1 and then in

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.820 
squared would simply be 1 and then in
the<00:01:20.970> denominator<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.780> x<00:01:22.110> squared<00:01:22.470> plus

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the denominator we have x squared plus

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.340 
the denominator we have x squared plus
7x<00:01:23.280> plus<00:01:23.460> 6<00:01:23.670> again<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.570> think<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.110> going

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
7x plus 6 again I think if this is going

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.520 
7x plus 6 again I think if this is going
to<00:01:25.409> factor<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.700> cancel<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.960> only<00:01:28.140> thing<00:01:28.350> that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
to factor and cancel the only thing that

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.260 
to factor and cancel the only thing that
can<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:28.680> work<00:01:29.130> would<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.850> there<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.150> an

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
can really work would be if there was an

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.649 
can really work would be if there was an
X<00:01:30.450> plus<00:01:30.630> 1<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> denominator<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.630> then<00:01:33.630> I

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
X plus 1 in the denominator and then I

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.840 
X plus 1 in the denominator and then I
guess<00:01:33.869> we<00:01:34.049> would<00:01:34.200> need<00:01:34.320> an<00:01:34.500> X<00:01:34.710> plus<00:01:35.100> 6<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.759> I

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
guess we would need an X plus 6 and I

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.569 
guess we would need an X plus 6 and I
check<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.360> well<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.320> multiply<00:01:37.500> 1<00:01:38.040> &amp;<00:01:38.189> 6<00:01:38.369> we

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
check it well if you multiply 1 &amp; 6 we

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.370 
check it well if you multiply 1 &amp; 6 we
get<00:01:38.729> 6<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.299> add<00:01:39.479> them<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.750> definitely<00:01:40.290> get

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
get 6 if you add them you definitely get

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.530 
get 6 if you add them you definitely get
7<00:01:41.030> X<00:01:42.030> plus<00:01:42.479> 1<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.140> X<00:01:43.350> plus<00:01:43.500> 1<00:01:43.799> cancels<00:01:44.549> you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
7 X plus 1 and X plus 1 cancels you

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.690 
7 X plus 1 and X plus 1 cancels you
never<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.170> worry<00:01:46.409> about<00:01:46.590> checking<00:01:47.220> you

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
never have to worry about checking you

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.990 
never have to worry about checking you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
know the the rest of this in the cubic

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.260 

okay<00:02:04.720> that'll<00:02:05.050> never<00:02:05.400> never<00:02:06.400> factors<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.240> we

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
okay that'll never never factors so we

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.400 
okay that'll never never factors so we
don't<00:02:07.480> have<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.660> worry<00:02:07.840> about<00:02:07.900> thinking<00:02:08.350> you

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
don't have to worry about thinking you

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.050 
don't have to worry about thinking you
know<00:02:08.560> hey<00:02:08.740> is<00:02:08.890> there<00:02:09.070> some<00:02:09.280> way<00:02:09.430> to<00:02:09.460> break<00:02:09.880> this

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
know hey is there some way to break this

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.270 
know hey is there some way to break this
down<00:02:10.270> a<00:02:10.330> little<00:02:10.479> bit<00:02:10.720> further<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:11.560> just<00:02:12.070> turns

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
down a little bit further it just turns

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.580 
down a little bit further it just turns
out<00:02:12.460> that<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.850> would<00:02:13.090> be<00:02:13.210> it<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:13.690> our<00:02:14.080> final

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
out that that would be it so our final

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.860 
out that that would be it so our final
reduced<00:02:15.340> expression<00:02:16.060> would<00:02:16.180> be<00:02:16.240> x<00:02:16.600> squared

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
reduced expression would be x squared

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.070 
reduced expression would be x squared
minus<00:02:17.230> X<00:02:17.410> plus<00:02:17.620> 1<00:02:17.830> over<00:02:18.280> X<00:02:19.350> plus<00:02:20.350> 6
