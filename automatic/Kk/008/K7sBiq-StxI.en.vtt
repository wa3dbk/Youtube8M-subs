00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.309 
goes on top and it helps me sweat it out
now<00:02:22.129> this<00:02:22.370> thing<00:02:22.609> when<00:02:22.819> you<00:02:22.909> put<00:02:22.939> it<00:02:23.209> on<00:02:23.329> it<00:02:24.049> you

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
now this thing when you put it on it you

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.369 
now this thing when you put it on it you
look<00:02:24.500> like<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.709> big<00:02:25.010> fat<00:02:25.430> balloon<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:27.140> what<00:02:27.349> I

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
look like a big fat balloon so what I

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.050 
look like a big fat balloon so what I
actually<00:02:27.620> do<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.159> I'm<00:02:28.250> not<00:02:28.370> running<00:02:28.760> around

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
actually do so I'm not running around

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.770 
actually do so I'm not running around
with<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:29.930> thing<00:02:31.120> I'll<00:02:32.120> actually<00:02:32.389> put

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
with this thing I'll actually put

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.050 
with this thing I'll actually put
another<00:02:33.139> light<00:02:33.590> layer<00:02:33.920> it's<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.670> little<00:02:34.939> bit

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
another light layer it's a little bit

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.839 
another light layer it's a little bit
thicker<00:02:35.359> than<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.689> skin<00:02:36.459> because<00:02:37.459> if<00:02:37.609> it<00:02:37.730> was

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
thicker than the skin because if it was

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.479 
thicker than the skin because if it was
super<00:02:38.180> tight<00:02:38.420> then<00:02:39.079> it<00:02:39.889> would<00:02:40.069> just<00:02:40.099> look

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
super tight then it would just look

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.369 
super tight then it would just look
really<00:02:40.700> weird<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.239> awkward<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.170> is<00:02:42.349> a

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
really weird and awkward so this is a

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.050 
really weird and awkward so this is a
little<00:02:42.590> bit<00:02:42.769> lighter<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.189> it<00:02:43.400> goes<00:02:43.579> on<00:02:43.819> I

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
little bit lighter and it goes on I

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.020 
little bit lighter and it goes on I
guess<00:02:44.989> I<00:02:45.139> could<00:02:45.290> put<00:02:45.409> it<00:02:45.560> on<00:02:45.709> for<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.189> and<00:02:46.430> then

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
guess I could put it on for you and then

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.539 
guess I could put it on for you and then
I'll<00:02:47.209> stop<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.109> video<00:02:49.480> let's<00:02:50.480> just<00:02:50.629> do<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:54.549> so
