00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
looking genius ethically games like

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.730 
looking genius ethically games like
stunted<00:05:32.720> right<00:05:33.020> and<00:05:33.170> so<00:05:33.230> there's<00:05:33.380> always<00:05:33.530> that

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
stunted right and so there's always that

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.880

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
little bit of like ah to do better than

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.650 
little bit of like ah to do better than
that<00:05:36.920> there's<00:05:37.520> this<00:05:37.700> pursuit<00:05:38.120> for<00:05:38.360> realism

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
that there's this pursuit for realism

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.990 
that there's this pursuit for realism
isn't<00:05:39.260> there<00:05:39.410> which<00:05:39.530> is<00:05:39.680> one<00:05:39.950> direction<00:05:40.670> and

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
isn't there which is one direction and

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.310 
isn't there which is one direction and
that's<00:05:41.120> just<00:05:41.420> one<00:05:41.570> side<00:05:41.870> of<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:42.200> other<00:05:42.290> I

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
that's just one side of the other I

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.410 
that's just one side of the other I
think<00:05:42.500> in<00:05:42.590> video<00:05:42.860> games<00:05:43.130> we<00:05:43.400> there<00:05:43.970> is<00:05:44.090> a<00:05:44.120> level

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
think in video games we there is a level

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.330 
think in video games we there is a level
of<00:05:44.480> responsibility<00:05:45.020> to<00:05:45.410> do<00:05:45.530> something<00:05:45.740> very

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
of responsibility to do something very

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.610 
of responsibility to do something very
creative<00:05:46.730> as<00:05:47.240> well<00:05:47.390> and<00:05:47.750> really<00:05:47.990> branch<00:05:48.350> off

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
creative as well and really branch off

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.070 
creative as well and really branch off
in<00:05:48.800> that<00:05:48.980> direction<00:05:49.220> and<00:05:49.730> we're<00:05:50.510> not<00:05:50.600> bound<00:05:50.930> by

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
in that direction and we're not bound by

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.650 
in that direction and we're not bound by
reality
