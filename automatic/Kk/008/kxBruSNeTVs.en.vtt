00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
this is

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.770 
this is
I<00:01:13.650> mean<00:01:14.250> comparing<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> Xbox<00:01:15.299> 360

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
I mean comparing to the Xbox 360

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.320 
I mean comparing to the Xbox 360
controller<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.530> much<00:01:16.799> lighter<00:01:17.150> it<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.299> a

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
controller it is much lighter it is a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.810 
controller it is much lighter it is a
bluetooth<00:01:18.869> device<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.040> wireless<00:01:20.580> keypad

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
bluetooth device so this wireless keypad

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.840 
bluetooth device so this wireless keypad
will<00:01:21.299> work<00:01:21.630> with<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:22.830> only<00:01:22.860> your<00:01:23.189> PlayStation

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
will work with not only your PlayStation

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.450

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
3 but with any other Bluetooth device

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.700 
3 but with any other Bluetooth device
whether<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.060> cell<00:01:27.360> phone<00:01:27.390> or<00:01:27.930> any<00:01:28.530> other

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
whether it's a cell phone or any other

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.340 
whether it's a cell phone or any other
small<00:01:28.950> gadget<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.479> does<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.900> its<00:01:31.110> own

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
small gadget and it does have its own

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.950 
small gadget and it does have its own
USB<00:01:31.770> power<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.970> lot<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.630> people<00:01:33.869> were

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
USB power so a lot of people were

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.899 
USB power so a lot of people were
complaining<00:01:34.140> why<00:01:34.829> didn't<00:01:35.220> they<00:01:35.280> integrate<00:01:35.759> it

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
complaining why didn't they integrate it

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.999 
complaining why didn't they integrate it
with<00:01:36.090> their<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.570> sixaxis<00:01:37.079> or<00:01:37.530> DualShock<00:01:37.979> 3

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
with their the sixaxis or DualShock 3

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.039 
with their the sixaxis or DualShock 3
controller<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.299> think<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.750> great<00:01:39.960> idea

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
controller but I think it's a great idea

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.569 
controller but I think it's a great idea
to<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.320> its<00:01:40.619> own<00:01:40.710> power<00:01:40.950> because<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.369> could

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
to have its own power because you could

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.240 
to have its own power because you could
charge<00:01:41.820> them<00:01:41.970> separately<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.920> also<00:01:43.920> it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
charge them separately and also it

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.240 
charge them separately and also it
doesn't<00:01:45.210> use<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.960> juice<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.829> controller

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
doesn't use the juice of the controller

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.920 
doesn't use the juice of the controller
itself<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.759> using<00:01:48.060> its<00:01:48.149> own<00:01:48.299> power<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.899> I

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
itself it's using its own power so I

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.020 
itself it's using its own power so I
think<00:01:49.229> that's<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.530> good<00:01:50.159> idea<00:01:50.520> good<00:01:50.759> feature

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
think that's a good idea good feature

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.969 
think that's a good idea good feature
obviously<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.689> main<00:01:51.899> reason<00:01:52.380> why<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.590> bought

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
obviously the main reason why you bought

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.710 
obviously the main reason why you bought
or<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.399> want<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.850> buy<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.060> Wireless

this is what I'm going to get into the

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.370 
this is what I'm going to get into the
location<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> keypad<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.390> lot<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.989> people

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
location of the keypad a lot of people

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.800 
location of the keypad a lot of people
are<00:02:25.470> probably<00:02:25.680> curious<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.640> why<00:02:26.910> they

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
are probably curious and why they

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.110 
are probably curious and why they
decided<00:02:28.110> why<00:02:28.830> Sony<00:02:29.280> decided<00:02:29.489> to<00:02:29.849> put<00:02:30.000> the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120

keypad up here now I think for one of
course<00:02:32.970> obvious<00:02:33.569> reason<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.050> they<00:02:34.230> don't<00:02:34.319> want

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
course obvious reason is they don't want

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.350 
course obvious reason is they don't want
to<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.800> know<00:02:34.920> bite<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.430> Xbox<00:02:35.849> 360

always better to just use this trust me

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.170 
always better to just use this trust me
trying<00:04:50.260> to<00:04:50.350> use<00:04:50.500> this<00:04:50.800> on<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:51.729> web<00:04:51.910> browser

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
trying to use this on the web browser

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.540 
trying to use this on the web browser
it's<00:04:53.050> going<00:04:53.229> to<00:04:53.290> start<00:04:53.530> it's<00:04:53.710> so<00:04:53.950> sensitive

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
it's going to start it's so sensitive

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.950 
it's going to start it's so sensitive
that<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.760> just<00:04:54.940> starts<00:04:55.180> jumping<00:04:55.540> it<00:04:55.630> from<00:04:55.780> time

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
that it just starts jumping it from time

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.420 
that it just starts jumping it from time
to<00:04:56.080> time<00:04:56.110> so<00:04:56.830> I<00:04:56.860> think<00:04:57.100> this<00:04:57.190> is<00:04:57.280> definitely

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
to time so I think this is definitely

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.700 
to time so I think this is definitely
one<00:04:57.790> of<00:04:57.820> the<00:04:57.940> features<00:04:58.360> that<00:04:58.530> wasn't<00:04:59.530> not
