a<00:00:00.089> rather<00:00:00.989> large<00:00:01.580> 28<00:00:02.580> LED<00:00:03.210> USB<00:00:03.929> lamp<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:05.069> goes

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
a rather large 28 LED USB lamp and goes

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.059 
a rather large 28 LED USB lamp and goes
off<00:00:06.150> eBay<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.540> course<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.140> if<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:07.620> plug<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:07.950> in

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
off eBay of course and if I plug it in

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.910 
off eBay of course and if I plug it in
here<00:00:08.480> it<00:00:09.480> lights<00:00:09.690> quite<00:00:09.960> brightly<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.500> it

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
here it lights quite brightly and it

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.060 
here it lights quite brightly and it
draws<00:00:11.250> because<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.790> tested<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.300> earlier<00:00:13.070> 370

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070

minimums<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:14.839> I'm<00:00:15.920> afraid<00:00:16.920> from<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.430> up<00:00:17.609> I'm

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
minimums so I'm afraid from this up I'm

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.410 
minimums so I'm afraid from this up I'm
wondering<00:00:19.430> what<00:00:20.430> value<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.850> resistors<00:00:21.270> it's

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
wondering what value of resistors it's

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.480 
wondering what value of resistors it's
got<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.990> how<00:00:22.380> many<00:00:22.650> resistors<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.340> it

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
got in it and how many resistors is it

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.670 
got in it and how many resistors is it
going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.670> be<00:00:23.730> one<00:00:23.939> resistor<00:00:24.420> for<00:00:24.990> all<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
going to be one resistor for all the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.769 
going to be one resistor for all the
lamps<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.279> parallel<00:00:26.640> are<00:00:27.300> they<00:00:27.599> going<00:00:27.720> to

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
lamps in the parallel are they going to

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.390 
lamps in the parallel are they going to
be<00:00:27.869> divided<00:00:28.109> into<00:00:28.289> two<00:00:28.529> banks<00:00:28.920> are<00:00:29.099> they<00:00:29.279> going

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
be divided into two banks are they going

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.939 
be divided into two banks are they going
to<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.519> divided<00:00:29.910> into<00:00:30.000> four<00:00:30.330> banks<00:00:30.689> or<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.410> it

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
to be divided into four banks or is it

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.560 
to be divided into four banks or is it
going<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.399> resistor<00:00:32.820> per<00:00:33.030> led<00:00:33.420> which

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
going to be one resistor per led which

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.930 
going to be one resistor per led which
is<00:00:33.719> extremely<00:00:34.260> unlikely<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:35.460> anyway<00:00:35.730> let's

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
is extremely unlikely but anyway let's

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.510 
is extremely unlikely but anyway let's
do<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.270> maths<00:00:36.870> before<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.559> pop<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> lid<00:00:38.840> so

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
do the maths before I pop the lid so

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.630 
do the maths before I pop the lid so
it's<00:00:41.520> 5<00:00:41.820> volt<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:43.320> LED<00:00:43.680> voltage<00:00:43.890> will

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
it's 5 volt and the LED voltage will

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.639 
it's 5 volt and the LED voltage will
probably<00:00:45.270> be<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> region<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.930> 3<00:00:46.260> volts

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
probably be in the region of 3 volts

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.700 
probably be in the region of 3 volts

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350

0.3<00:01:20.460> 7<00:01:21.259> equals<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.580> value<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.670> about<00:01:24.200> 5.4<00:01:25.200> ohms

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299

the industry standard values and I I'd

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.719 
the industry standard values and I I'd
want<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.329> read<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.600> one<00:02:00.780> watt<00:02:01.100> but<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.250> probably

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
want to read it one watt but it probably

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.670 
want to read it one watt but it probably
actually<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:03.600> half<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.320> watt

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
actually be half a watt

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.240 
actually be half a watt
if<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.369> two<00:02:05.640> resistors

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.010 

yeah<00:02:11.880> there'll<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.180> double<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.510> value

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
yeah there'll be double that value

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.180 
yeah there'll be double that value
because<00:02:13.410> they're<00:02:13.530> dropping<00:02:13.890> half<00:02:14.040> the

because they're dropping half the
current<00:02:14.370> each<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.890> would<00:02:17.070> either<00:02:17.190> be<00:02:17.430> ten

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
current each so that would either be ten

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.130 
current each so that would either be ten
or<00:02:18.230> twelve<00:02:19.230> one<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.750> again<00:02:23.810> about<00:02:24.810> half

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
or twelve one and again about half

nearest<00:02:32.070> values<00:02:32.550> would<00:02:32.730> be<00:02:32.790> about<00:02:33.300> 18<00:02:33.840> or<00:02:34.110> 22

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
22 22 murmurs one of the very standard

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.710 
22 22 murmurs one of the very standard
value<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:41.880> that's<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.240> a<00:02:42.270> very<00:02:42.480> good<00:02:42.570> or

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
value so that's not a very good or

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.140 
value so that's not a very good or
meager<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.260> that's<00:02:44.070> in<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.550> case<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.030> could

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
meager and that's in that case you could

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.120 
meager and that's in that case you could
actually<00:02:45.330> use<00:02:45.690> quash<00:02:45.990> or<00:02:46.170> what<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.860> what's<00:02:50.040> it

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
actually use quash or what so what's it

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.620 
actually use quash or what so what's it
going<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.280> be<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.880> gonna<00:02:50.970> be<00:02:51.030> one<00:02:51.209> resistor

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
going to be is it gonna be one resistor

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.160 
going to be is it gonna be one resistor
two<00:02:51.990> resistors<00:02:52.410> or<00:02:52.590> four<00:02:52.920> resistors<00:02:54.170> yeah

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
two resistors or four resistors yeah

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.970 
two resistors or four resistors yeah
what<00:02:55.410> do<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.560> reckon<00:02:55.890> let's<00:02:57.440> open<00:02:58.440> this<00:02:58.800> up

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
what do you reckon let's open this up

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.160 
what do you reckon let's open this up
shall<00:02:59.250> we

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.660 

or<00:03:07.170> there<00:03:07.380> could<00:03:07.500> be<00:03:07.650> active<00:03:08.010> circuitry<00:03:08.459> in<00:03:08.550> it

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
or there could be active circuitry in it

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.199 
or there could be active circuitry in it
but<00:03:08.850> you<00:03:09.030> know<00:03:09.150> what<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.660> don't<00:03:10.500> think<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:11.209> not

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
but you know what I don't think so not

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.320 
but you know what I don't think so not
for<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.480> cheap<00:03:12.720> Chinese<00:03:12.750> product<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:17.239> think<00:03:18.239> I've

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
for a cheap Chinese product I think I've

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.750 
for a cheap Chinese product I think I've
got<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.660> while<00:03:18.900> back<00:03:19.160> and<00:03:20.160> it's<00:03:20.489> just<00:03:20.519> been

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
got this a while back and it's just been

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.490 
got this a while back and it's just been
sitting<00:03:21.090> there<00:03:21.420> waiting<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:21.870> get<00:03:22.050> taken<00:03:22.290> to

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
sitting there waiting to get taken to

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.880 
sitting there waiting to get taken to
bits<00:03:22.680> int<00:03:23.720> could<00:03:24.720> be<00:03:24.810> nice<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.230> actually<00:03:25.320> swap

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
bits int could be nice to actually swap

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.199

their<00:03:27.019> LEDs<00:03:28.019> for<00:03:28.380> warm<00:03:28.890> light<00:03:29.100> LEDs<00:03:29.519> if<00:03:30.000> it's

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
their LEDs for warm light LEDs if it's

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.430 
their LEDs for warm light LEDs if it's
on<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:30.480> circuit<00:03:30.780> board<00:03:30.810> which<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.200> should<00:03:31.350> think

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
on a circuit board which I should think

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.170 
on a circuit board which I should think
it<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.739> but<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.370> know<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.580> never<00:03:32.700> know<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:33.030> may

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
it is but you know you never know it may

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.360 
it is but you know you never know it may
just<00:03:33.390> be<00:03:33.530> plastic<00:03:34.530> with<00:03:34.709> holes<00:03:34.920> in<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.190> the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
just be plastic with holes in it and the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.830 
just be plastic with holes in it and the
leads<00:03:35.550> folded<00:03:36.000> through<00:03:38.360> got<00:03:41.390> two<00:03:42.390> resistors

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
leads folded through got two resistors

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.259 
leads folded through got two resistors
well<00:03:43.080> let's<00:03:43.290> take<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.500> look<00:03:43.650> at<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.769> back<00:03:43.920> first

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
well let's take a look at the back first

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.289 
well let's take a look at the back first
yep<00:03:45.269> two<00:03:45.630> resistors<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.860> clear<00:03:47.459> banks<00:03:48.060> of

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
yep two resistors and to clear banks of

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.770 
yep two resistors and to clear banks of
LEDs<00:03:48.810> with<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.769> resistor<00:03:50.280> driving<00:03:50.670> each<00:03:50.820> the

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
LEDs with a resistor driving each the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.539 
LEDs with a resistor driving each the
resistors<00:03:52.170> are<00:03:52.290> common<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.799> positive<00:03:53.250> 5

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
resistors are common to the positive 5

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.430 
resistors are common to the positive 5
volt<00:03:53.760> real<00:03:53.940> em<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.780> then<00:03:54.900> they're<00:03:55.049> dropping

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
volt real em and then they're dropping

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.650 
volt real em and then they're dropping
either<00:03:55.830> side<00:03:56.190> they<00:03:56.850> look<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:57.180> me<00:03:57.299> that<00:03:57.450> caught

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
either side they look to me that caught

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.460 
either side they look to me that caught
watt<00:03:57.840> resistors<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.680> value<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.489> brown

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
watt resistors and the value is brown

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.800 
watt resistors and the value is brown
black<00:04:01.470> black<00:04:02.010> 10<00:04:02.580> ohms<00:04:04.250> so<00:04:05.250> 10<00:04:05.519> ohms<00:04:05.730> but<00:04:06.030> not

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
black black 10 ohms so 10 ohms but not

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.650 
black black 10 ohms so 10 ohms but not
half<00:04:07.140> what<00:04:07.440> their<00:04:07.950> what<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:09.180> voltage<00:04:09.600> has

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
half what their what the voltage has

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.830 
half what their what the voltage has
been<00:04:09.840> dropped<00:04:10.110> across<00:04:10.410> them<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:12.480> let's<00:04:12.630> plug

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
been dropped across them so let's plug

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.470 
been dropped across them so let's plug
them<00:04:12.989> into<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.320> USB<00:04:13.850> power<00:04:14.850> supply<00:04:15.180> in<00:04:15.390> the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
them into the USB power supply in the

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.699 
them into the USB power supply in the
meter<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:17.180> guess<00:04:18.180> I'd<00:04:18.720> be<00:04:18.870> dropping<00:04:19.260> about<00:04:19.349> 2

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
meter I guess I'd be dropping about 2

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.610 
meter I guess I'd be dropping about 2
volts<00:04:19.979> across<00:04:20.099> them<00:04:21.169> guess<00:04:22.169> them<00:04:22.380> make<00:04:22.590> a

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
volts across them guess them make a

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.020 
volts across them guess them make a
slight<00:04:23.250> drop<00:04:23.520> across<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
slight drop across the

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.689 
slight drop across the
cable<00:04:25.870> as<00:04:25.960> well<00:04:26.160> so<00:04:27.160> let's<00:04:27.340> get<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.550> meter

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
cable as well so let's get the meter

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.659 
cable as well so let's get the meter
into<00:04:28.000> shot<00:04:30.449> fight<00:04:31.449> or<00:04:31.600> just<00:04:31.750> good<00:04:31.870> with<00:04:31.900> this

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
into shot fight or just good with this

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.230 
into shot fight or just good with this
over<00:04:33.669> here<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.490> voltage<00:04:36.759> being<00:04:36.940> dropped

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
over here and the voltage being dropped

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.620 
over here and the voltage being dropped
across<00:04:37.389> the<00:04:37.780> resistors<00:04:38.199> is<00:04:41.610> 1.8<00:04:42.610> volts<00:04:42.940> pretty

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
across the resistors is 1.8 volts pretty

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:50.820 
across the resistors is 1.8 volts pretty
close<00:04:43.900> to<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.110> to<00:04:44.289> 1.8<00:04:46.110> so<00:04:47.110> 1.8<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:50.410> current

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
close to the to 1.8 so 1.8 the current

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.140 
close to the to 1.8 so 1.8 the current
was<00:04:51.009> 370<00:04:51.910> mallams<00:04:52.319> 0.37<00:04:53.319> divided<00:04:53.650> by<00:04:53.800> 2<00:04:54.930> so

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
was 370 mallams 0.37 divided by 2 so

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.279 
was 370 mallams 0.37 divided by 2 so
0.185<00:04:58.949> 0.18<00:04:59.949> five<00:05:00.479> times<00:05:01.479> and<00:05:01.930> what<00:05:02.080> was<00:05:02.199> that

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
0.185 0.18 five times and what was that

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:11.879 
0.185 0.18 five times and what was that
em<00:05:02.639> with<00:05:03.639> one<00:05:03.789> point<00:05:10.380> I'm<00:05:11.380> not<00:05:11.530> gonna<00:05:11.680> good

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
em with one point I'm not gonna good

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.240 
em with one point I'm not gonna good
connection<00:05:12.370> there<00:05:13.349> one<00:05:14.349> point<00:05:14.620> eight<00:05:14.860> so

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
connection there one point eight so

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.460 
connection there one point eight so
times<00:05:15.669> one<00:05:16.030> point<00:05:16.300> eight<00:05:18.900> yeah<00:05:19.960> they're

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
times one point eight yeah they're

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.899 
times one point eight yeah they're
dropping<00:05:20.650> about<00:05:21.009> point<00:05:21.340> three<00:05:21.669> three<00:05:21.820> three

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909 
dropping about point three three three

dropping about point three three three
watts<00:05:22.300> a<00:05:22.569> third<00:05:22.780> of<00:05:22.900> our<00:05:22.990> wort<00:05:23.169> each<00:05:23.349> which<00:05:23.979> is

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
watts a third of our wort each which is

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.640 
watts a third of our wort each which is
not<00:05:24.310> too<00:05:24.550> far<00:05:24.819> from<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:25.150> quarter<00:05:25.479> water<00:05:25.690> sure

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
not too far from the quarter water sure

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.560 
not too far from the quarter water sure
the<00:05:26.770> Chinese<00:05:27.009> don't<00:05:27.310> let<00:05:27.610> things<00:05:27.880> that<00:05:28.030> upset

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
the Chinese don't let things that upset

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.670 
the Chinese don't let things that upset
them<00:05:28.690> but<00:05:29.500> is<00:05:29.590> the<00:05:29.680> nice<00:05:29.830> enough<00:05:30.099> light<00:05:30.340> and

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
them but is the nice enough light and

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.290 
them but is the nice enough light and
it's<00:05:32.680> nice<00:05:32.830> that<00:05:32.860> they<00:05:33.159> at<00:05:33.250> least<00:05:33.430> didn't<00:05:34.120> just

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
it's nice that they at least didn't just

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.120 
it's nice that they at least didn't just
use<00:05:34.449> one<00:05:34.690> resistor<00:05:35.320> for<00:05:35.409> the<00:05:35.500> whole<00:05:35.620> lot<00:05:35.830> but

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
use one resistor for the whole lot but

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.409 
use one resistor for the whole lot but
there<00:05:36.310> probably<00:05:36.340> were<00:05:36.820> just<00:05:36.970> wanted<00:05:37.180> to<00:05:37.270> use

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
there probably were just wanted to use

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.810 
there probably were just wanted to use
standard<00:05:37.690> quarter<00:05:38.139> watt<00:05:38.229> resistors<00:05:38.710> and<00:05:38.949> that

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
standard quarter watt resistors and that

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.219 
standard quarter watt resistors and that
was<00:05:40.000> the<00:05:40.120> minimum<00:05:40.360> they<00:05:40.570> could<00:05:40.719> get<00:05:40.840> away<00:05:40.930> with

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
was the minimum they could get away with

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:41.969 
was the minimum they could get away with
yeah

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
yeah

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.830 
yeah
reason<00:05:42.310> enough<00:05:42.370> I'm<00:05:42.820> a<00:05:42.940> tech<00:05:43.180> convert<00:05:43.539> that<00:05:43.659> to

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
reason enough I'm a tech convert that to

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.280 
reason enough I'm a tech convert that to
one<00:05:44.020> way<00:05:44.199> later<00:05:45.039> on
