rope to get to the next one so we gotta
work<00:00:37.770> our<00:00:38.100> way<00:00:38.190> up<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.640> roof<00:00:45.800> jump<00:00:46.800> up<00:00:47.039> here

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
work our way up to the roof jump up here

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.360 
work our way up to the roof jump up here
and<00:00:47.780> then<00:00:48.780> don't<00:00:48.989> go<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> very<00:00:49.710> steep<00:00:50.100> part

and then don't go to the very steep part

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.279 
and then don't go to the very steep part
there<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.210> can't<00:00:51.449> get<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.780> you'll<00:00:51.960> slide

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
there that you can't get to you'll slide

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:01.510 
there that you can't get to you'll slide
off<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:53.070> here<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:54.260> number<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:59.120> egg<00:01:00.120> poacher

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
off but here is number one egg poacher

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:10.500 
off but here is number one egg poacher
okay<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.579> now<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:02.820> want<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.120> get<00:01:03.210> up<00:01:03.449> there

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
got to get to the roof of the building I

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.050 
got to get to the roof of the building I
am<00:01:17.450> actually<00:01:17.660> in<00:01:18.200> right<00:01:18.680> now<00:01:21.910> and<00:01:22.910> we're<00:01:23.030> just

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
there you can see at the top egg poach

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.290 
there you can see at the top egg poach
number<00:01:32.420> two<00:01:32.720> I<00:01:33.640> got<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.760> survive<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.240> know

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
number two I got to survive you know

Laura's got to survive and then we're
going<00:01:38.120> to<00:01:38.150> take<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.510> big<00:01:39.790> rope<00:01:40.790> all<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.150> way

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
going to take the big rope all the way

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:58.280 
going to take the big rope all the way
up

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.530 

and<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.190> a<00:01:59.220> shortcut<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.180> high<00:02:00.330> area

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
and this is a shortcut to the high area

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.010 
and this is a shortcut to the high area
that<00:02:03.540> we<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.840> took<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.230> long<00:02:04.530> road<00:02:05.010> for

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
that we just took the long road for

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.540 
that we just took the long road for
illumination

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
illumination

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.070 
illumination
you<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.729> trees<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.510> can't<00:02:09.660> with<00:02:09.750> pulp<00:02:09.930> so

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
you can trees you can't with pulp so

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:19.100 
you can trees you can't with pulp so
just<00:02:10.260> drop<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.680> lower<00:02:10.979> bit<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.780> then

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
just drop to this lower bit and then

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.390 
just drop to this lower bit and then
over<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.650> rock<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:24.540> then<00:02:25.380> back<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
over to the rock and then back to the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.710 
over to the rock and then back to the
building<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.030> then<00:02:27.150> we<00:02:27.210> got<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.420> get<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.630> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
building and then we got to get to the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.570 
building and then we got to get to the
roof<00:02:27.960> so<00:02:28.170> just<00:02:28.350> use<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.620> little<00:02:28.770> crate<00:02:29.160> here

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
roof so just use this little crate here

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.360 
roof so just use this little crate here
and<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:30.480> little<00:02:30.570> double<00:02:31.020> jump<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.560> there<00:02:32.190> you

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
and a little double jump and there you

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.030 
and a little double jump and there you
go

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
go

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.120 
go
there<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.310> number<00:02:35.610> three<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.770> then<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.950> last

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
there is number three and then the last

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.880 
there is number three and then the last
two<00:02:38.430> are<00:02:38.490> over<00:02:38.880> on<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.150> series<00:02:39.600> of<00:02:40.080> pillar

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
two are over on that series of pillar

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.690 
two are over on that series of pillar
islands<00:02:41.520> nine<00:02:42.000> islands<00:02:42.450> but<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.750> know<00:02:42.870> pillar

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
islands nine islands but you know pillar

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.160 
islands nine islands but you know pillar
rock<00:02:44.700> formations<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.690> we<00:02:45.750> got<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.960> get<00:02:46.050> over

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
rock formations so we got to get over

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:58.500 
rock formations so we got to get over
there

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.080 

inside<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.950> then<00:03:00.190> instead<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.580> taking<00:03:00.670> the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
inside and then instead of taking the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.119 
inside and then instead of taking the
rope<00:03:01.330> here<00:03:01.569> we're<00:03:01.690> gonna<00:03:01.780> drop<00:03:02.170> down<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:03.010> the

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
rope here we're gonna drop down to the

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:13.890 
rope here we're gonna drop down to the
lower<00:03:03.340> area

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.229
