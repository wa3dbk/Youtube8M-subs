00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
bombs there you go to the third of

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:58.370 
bombs there you go to the third of
fourth<00:04:47.419> more

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.190

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.430 

let<00:05:09.330> me<00:05:09.420> see<00:05:09.570> if<00:05:09.690> I<00:05:09.780> can<00:05:09.900> get<00:05:10.020> something<00:05:10.320> good

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
let me see if I can get something good

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.080 
let me see if I can get something good
here<00:05:12.830> no

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.200 

so<00:05:16.810> anyway<00:05:17.169> you<00:05:17.230> got<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.560> get<00:05:17.650> up<00:05:17.770> to<00:05:17.949> the<00:05:18.210> 52

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
so anyway you got to get up to the 52

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.860 
so anyway you got to get up to the 52
our<00:05:19.389> emphasis<00:05:19.990> maybe<00:05:21.150> when<00:05:22.150> there's<00:05:22.480> one<00:05:22.690> more

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
our emphasis maybe when there's one more

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.540 
our emphasis maybe when there's one more
bottom<00:05:23.260> up<00:05:23.350> the<00:05:23.500> plants<00:05:23.919> and<00:05:24.100> then<00:05:24.250> throw<00:05:24.460> up

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
bottom up the plants and then throw up

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:32.129 
bottom up the plants and then throw up
here<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:27.220> it's<00:05:27.580> right<00:05:27.850> here<00:05:30.510> so<00:05:31.510> you<00:05:31.600> plant<00:05:31.930> it

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
here and it's right here so you plant it

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.090 
here and it's right here so you plant it
