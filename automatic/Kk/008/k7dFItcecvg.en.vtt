way<00:01:01.609> the<00:01:01.819> plow<00:01:02.030> works<00:01:02.420> is<00:01:03.190> it<00:01:04.190> sits<00:01:04.580> on<00:01:04.699> these

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
way the plow works is it sits on these

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.840 
way the plow works is it sits on these
two<00:01:05.120> arms<00:01:05.540> okay<00:01:06.380> there's<00:01:07.100> a<00:01:07.220> simple<00:01:07.610> frame

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
two arms okay there's a simple frame

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.030 
two arms okay there's a simple frame
setup<00:01:08.780> this<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:09.200> same<00:01:09.380> fret<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:09.830> frame

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
setup this is the same fret the frame

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.180 
setup this is the same fret the frame
setup<00:01:10.430> that<00:01:10.549> was<00:01:10.670> on<00:01:10.850> my<00:01:11.000> Jeep<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:12.770> company

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
setup that was on my Jeep the company

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.500 
setup that was on my Jeep the company
will<00:01:13.340> give<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.760> framework<00:01:14.000> for<00:01:14.300> whatever

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
will give you the framework for whatever

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.560 
will give you the framework for whatever
your<00:01:14.780> application<00:01:15.500> is<00:01:15.620> for<00:01:15.770> your<00:01:15.920> vehicle<00:01:16.570> so

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
your application is for your vehicle so

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.150 
your application is for your vehicle so
I<00:01:17.600> had<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.080> do<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.200> little<00:01:18.380> adapting<00:01:18.860> for<00:01:19.040> this

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
I had to do a little adapting for this

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.830 
I had to do a little adapting for this
one<00:01:19.340> but<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:20.270> works<00:01:20.480> on<00:01:20.660> this<00:01:20.870> truck<00:01:21.110> too<00:01:21.610> so

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
one but it works on this truck too so

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.400 
one but it works on this truck too so
you<00:01:23.840> basically<00:01:24.080> take<00:01:24.590> these<00:01:24.800> clips<00:01:25.270> okay<00:01:26.410> they

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
you basically take these clips okay they

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.990 
you basically take these clips okay they
sit<00:01:27.680> on<00:01:27.710> here<00:01:28.010> whenever<00:01:28.250> you're<00:01:28.550> not<00:01:28.670> plowing

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
sit on here whenever you're not plowing

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.730 
sit on here whenever you're not plowing
to<00:01:29.300> hold<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.570> plow<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:29.990> it<00:01:30.050> doesn't<00:01:30.320> fall<00:01:30.470> off

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
to hold the plow so it doesn't fall off

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.400 
to hold the plow so it doesn't fall off
but<00:01:31.190> when<00:01:31.340> you<00:01:31.430> are<00:01:31.580> ready<00:01:31.790> to<00:01:31.880> plow<00:01:32.180> you<00:01:32.870> grab

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
but when you are ready to plow you grab

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.400 
but when you are ready to plow you grab
this<00:01:33.620> handle<00:01:34.100> lift<00:01:35.000> up<00:01:35.270> make<00:01:35.810> sure<00:01:35.960> these<00:01:36.140> come

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
this handle lift up make sure these come

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.130 
this handle lift up make sure these come
over<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:36.740> top<00:01:36.770> on<00:01:37.280> both<00:01:37.310> sides<00:01:37.760> and<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.990> plow

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
over the top on both sides and the plow

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.570 
over the top on both sides and the plow
drops<00:01:39.560> down<00:01:39.740> I'll<00:01:39.950> show<00:01:39.980> you<00:01:40.160> that<00:01:40.280> in<00:01:40.340> just<00:01:40.430> a

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
drops down I'll show you that in just a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:55.570 
drops down I'll show you that in just a
second<00:01:40.940> right<00:01:41.060> here<00:01:53.950> now<00:01:54.950> what<00:01:55.100> happens<00:01:55.490> is

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
second right here now what happens is

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.540 
second right here now what happens is
when<00:01:55.700> I'm<00:01:55.850> plowing<00:01:56.650> the<00:01:57.650> plow<00:01:57.920> when<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.430> go

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
when I'm plowing the plow when you go

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.650 
when I'm plowing the plow when you go
forward<00:01:58.910> stands<00:01:59.330> up<00:01:59.710> like<00:02:00.710> this<00:02:01.450> shows<00:02:02.450> the

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
forward stands up like this shows the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.860 
forward stands up like this shows the
snow<00:02:02.720> ahead<00:02:03.230> now<00:02:03.620> when<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:03.860> back<00:02:04.160> up<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:05.630> plow

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
snow ahead now when I back up the plow

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.630 
snow ahead now when I back up the plow
is<00:02:06.110> allowed<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:07.030> -<00:02:08.200> okay<00:02:09.200> like<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:09.769> so<00:02:10.489> it

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
is allowed to - okay like this so it

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.280 
is allowed to - okay like this so it
won't<00:02:10.759> back<00:02:11.060> drag<00:02:11.360> all<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.720> snow<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:11.930> just

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
won't back drag all the snow you just

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.110 
won't back drag all the snow you just
pushed<00:02:12.610> my<00:02:13.610> setup<00:02:13.970> is<00:02:14.150> actually<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.569> little<00:02:14.900> bit

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
pushed my setup is actually a little bit

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.760 
pushed my setup is actually a little bit
too<00:02:17.120> high<00:02:17.450> still<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:17.989> should<00:02:18.170> be<00:02:18.290> down<00:02:18.440> another

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
too high still it should be down another

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.190 
too high still it should be down another
few<00:02:19.010> inches<00:02:19.040> but<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.210> still<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.810> still<00:02:21.020> doesn't

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
few inches but I still it still doesn't

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.630 
few inches but I still it still doesn't
back<00:02:21.410> drag<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.860> snow<00:02:22.069> and<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.310> works

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
back drag the snow and it works

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.450 
back drag the snow and it works
really<00:02:22.819> good<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:24.110> what<00:02:24.260> I'll<00:02:24.350> do<00:02:24.500> now<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.770> get<00:02:25.400> a

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
really good so what I'll do now is get a

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.480 
really good so what I'll do now is get a
demonstration<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:26.120> how<00:02:26.240> it<00:02:26.360> works
