00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.880
 well, this is the 2 in 1 figure 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.730
 we are going to open for you to see it and for 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.580
 inside 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:28.020
 this is the cube of the figures 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.020
 This is the bottom 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:39.990
 this central that turns 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.430
 and this is the flag 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.079
 above 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.859
 Oh 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.870
 here on his handle we remove the part of 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.219
 above and this part above is the one 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.500
 will be useful for us when 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:02.469
 hot the fact here and let's say the 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.469
 top tray without getting burned 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.000
 it perfectly fits the handle and so 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.350
 complicate things with one hand 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.290
 gets hooked on the little tab above 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.650
 this little tab here does not fit anymore 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.650
 above 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:34.640
 and we are no longer at risk of it being good 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.700
 then we close it again I put the 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.760
 camera on the tripod so that I have 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.860
 two hands here next to the plug side 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.610
 we have the button up 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.770
 that feels bad 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.450
 that we only want to use the part 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.480
 below with just the may with 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.480
 the menu we are adjusting what 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.800
 the buttons that we want only 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.570
 they use the top part 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.120
 we directly give the 2 for 1 and 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.830
 we choose meat 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.830
 chicken fish 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.250
 and another type of frying marks us 5 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.680
 minutes 10 minutes 8 minutes 7 minutes 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.510
 These minutes can be raised with him more 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.510
 or go down with the less good 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.650
 If we want to use both things 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.750
 first we are going to program the part 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.879
 below, imagine that below 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.400
 to make some chips as 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.660
 we program in it more then we're going to 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.660
 schedule for example 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.010
 30 minutes now gives you more 2 for 1 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.430
 we choose meat because above plus some 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.650
 steaks and we give ok starts at 30 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.019
 minutes to work 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.019
 the machine has started to work 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.730
 bottom part when 8 minutes are missing 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.739
 because the meat is 8 minutes when 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.340
 lack of these 30 thousand 28 minutes goes to 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.750
 sound a beep we open we put the 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.430
 tray with the steaks because the 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.430
 tray should not be placed now 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.739
 I turn off the band of the day this bet 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.689
 now we would put the tray with the 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.330
 fillets and it would finish doing the 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:17.760
 potatoes below and the steaks above 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.030
 difference with the first or the first 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:26.120
 I see 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.120
 obviously having this tray 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.050
 it is an incredible advance because we 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.910
 allows us to make two meals none 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.520
 allows to make the garnish below and the 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.069
 fish meat chicken sausage 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.870
 because the type of frying up I 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.140
 The first is that I used it a lot without 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.120
 for the central because I found that 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.100
 the food broke a lot like the 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.430
 fried fish like no one like the 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.350
 croquettes now I have this tray 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.160
 the waters that these commented that down 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.750
 it's bigger we can fit a kilo 250 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.970
 grams of food in the previous 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.180
 nothing but I could fit a kilo here is going to 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.239
 get food goes up the other I saw it 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.250
 different I saw it bigger and sometimes 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.230
 the food stayed below the 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.360
 palette was breaking us with this palette not 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.120
 I see it like that I 've done for example 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.700
 potatoes to slices than in the previous one that 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.709
 I was devoured some to not be 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.380
 They have fallen apart slices 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:28.150
 totally whole and perfect potato 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:31.720
 and well here you have the new figures and 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.720
 I will keep putting recipes is a 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.500
 Wonder of products is not only a 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.380
 fryer let's forget about the concept 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.420
 East of the active and the fryer that fry 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.020
 with a single spoonful of oil that 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.550
 true teaches us the spoon I teach 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.310
 it is a kind of robot of 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.030
 kitchen where we can make many types 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.130
 of healthy balanced healthy recipes 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.040
 low in fat many foods are 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.230
 they cook in their own juice you need very 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.180
 little amount of oil as always 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.560
 I say since we are going to use little 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.960
 amount of oil we will use 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.880
 Good oils, virgin olive oil 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.810
 extra 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.610
 do not give us even more health to 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.370
 these dishes and 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.770
 and I just wanted to teach you in 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.909
 video because that way no one escapes 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.039
 detail is always better than doing 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:29.460
 photo again take the camera of the 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.460
 tripod 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.620
 so you have a close up here 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.889
 you have 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.530
 tefal actifry 2 in 1 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:43.930
 the capacity of your bucket is very large 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.689
 of the skirt and he said he walks in this 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:50.349
 sense of here the food goes up by 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:55.180
 here and do not break the tray above 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:57.370
 that perfectly here we place a 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.430
 chicken fish I think it's all that 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.840
 We want to make you not need the palette 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:07.139
 or that we fear that we can 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:12.349
 break I said the handle here 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.349
 that is perfectly removed 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:23.770
 although we do not see the oil dripping this 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:26.670
 when it is hot it burns its screen 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:31.350
 larger more luminous 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:35.289
 with clarity you can barely see it but it's a 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:38.169
 pretty wide digital screen 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:41.259
 as I said I lacked the spoon 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:44.039
 oil spoon has two measures 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:47.190
 here for four or for six people 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:49.569
 here they come 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:54.149
 indicated 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:59.380
 and this little egg down here that looks 

00:06:54.149 --> 00:07:03.220
 it's for salt it's a salt meter 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:05.950
 so as you see is an apparatus is a 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.440
 appliance you think is not much 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:11.650
 in our health does not control all the 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.530
 amount of fat the amount of salt 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:18.160
 food is practically cooked in its 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:19.990
 juice and I can only tell you that 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.130
 I'm very happy with them and that you 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.130
 I totally recommend
