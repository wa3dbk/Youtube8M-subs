00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
timeline for me this timeline will allow

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.099 
timeline for me this timeline will allow
me<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.980> create<00:00:29.189> an<00:00:29.460> animation<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.689> button

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
me to create an animation on the button

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.650 
me to create an animation on the button
I<00:00:31.140> want<00:00:31.980> my<00:00:32.070> triangles<00:00:32.640> color<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.270> change

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
I want my triangles color to change

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.959 
I want my triangles color to change
subtly<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.890> I'm<00:00:34.980> going<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> first<00:00:35.489> create<00:00:35.820> a

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
subtly so I'm going to first create a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.900 
subtly so I'm going to first create a
keyframe<00:00:36.270> at<00:00:36.570> time<00:00:36.989> zero<00:00:37.730> advance<00:00:38.730> my

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
keyframe at time zero advance my

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.090 
keyframe at time zero advance my
playhead<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.360> time<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.290> create<00:00:41.040> a

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
playhead to time to and create a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.580 
playhead to time to and create a
keyframe<00:00:41.430> there<00:00:41.879> what<00:00:42.570> I've<00:00:42.660> done<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.230> I've

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
keyframe there what I've done is I've

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.930 
keyframe there what I've done is I've
explained<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> animation<00:00:44.730> should

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
explained that the animation should

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.290 
explained that the animation should
start<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.600> stop<00:00:46.170> at<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.890> default<00:00:47.250> state<00:00:47.579> now

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
start and stop at the default state now

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.750 
start and stop at the default state now
I<00:00:48.329> move<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.719> playhead<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.140> time<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.100> now

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
I move the playhead to time one and now

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.700 
I move the playhead to time one and now
I'm<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.120> modify<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.510> properties<00:00:52.050> to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
I'm going to modify the properties to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.770 
I'm going to modify the properties to
tell<00:00:52.920> my<00:00:53.039> animation<00:00:53.610> start<00:00:54.210> at<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> default

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
tell my animation start at the default

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.869 
tell my animation start at the default
state<00:00:55.110> change<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.860> properties<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> state

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
state change the properties to the state

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.910 
state change the properties to the state
I'm<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> specify<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.440> return<00:00:58.770> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the default state I want to take the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.740 
the default state I want to take the
fill<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.649> my<00:01:01.859> triangle<00:01:02.340> make<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.149> brighter

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
I see the fill and the color properties

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.100 
I see the fill and the color properties
and<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.820> right<00:01:30.030> click<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> color<00:01:30.840> and
