at<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.609> pattycake<00:02:47.909> free<00:02:48.299> spin<00:02:48.569> we're<00:02:49.139> gonna

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
at the pattycake free spin we're gonna

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.500 
at the pattycake free spin we're gonna
begin<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:49.829> right<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.159> right<00:02:50.310> handle<00:02:50.730> and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
begin in that right to right handle and

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.210 
begin in that right to right handle and
we<00:02:51.659> have<00:02:51.810> our<00:02:51.930> two<00:02:52.139> patty<00:02:52.379> cakes<00:02:52.709> first<00:02:52.919> so<00:02:53.159> I

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
we have our two patty cakes first so I

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.759 
we have our two patty cakes first so I
offer<00:02:53.400> my<00:02:53.669> left<00:02:53.909> hand<00:02:54.150> as<00:02:54.299> we<00:02:54.419> triple<00:02:55.049> I'd

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
offer my left hand as we triple I'd

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.500 
offer my left hand as we triple I'd
offer<00:02:55.950> my<00:02:56.099> right<00:02:56.519> hand<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:56.879> our<00:02:56.970> next<00:02:57.150> triple

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
offer my right hand for our next triple

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.210 
offer my right hand for our next triple
from<00:02:57.900> here<00:02:58.049> I'm<00:02:58.139> going<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.349> compress<00:02:58.680> through

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
from here I'm going to compress through

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.890 
from here I'm going to compress through
this<00:02:59.400> connection<00:02:59.730> causing<00:03:00.299> us<00:03:00.389> to<00:03:00.540> start<00:03:00.780> to

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
this connection causing us to start to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.539 
this connection causing us to start to
rotate<00:03:01.049> now<00:03:01.409> it's<00:03:01.889> important<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.250> we<00:03:02.400> both

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
rotate now it's important that we both

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.069 
rotate now it's important that we both
do<00:03:02.760> our<00:03:02.790> little<00:03:03.239> pivot<00:03:03.510> turns<00:03:03.689> here<00:03:03.900> or<00:03:03.989> that

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
do our little pivot turns here or that

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.259 
do our little pivot turns here or that
each<00:03:04.290> step<00:03:04.680> progresses<00:03:05.489> slightly<00:03:05.819> because

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
each step progresses slightly because

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.000 
each step progresses slightly because
otherwise<00:03:06.720> let's<00:03:07.019> say<00:03:07.139> if<00:03:07.260> she<00:03:07.439> was<00:03:07.590> stepping

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
otherwise let's say if she was stepping

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.149 
otherwise let's say if she was stepping
forward<00:03:08.730> close<00:03:09.180> forward<00:03:09.689> I<00:03:10.049> might<00:03:10.829> be<00:03:10.980> doing

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
forward close forward I might be doing

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.099 
forward close forward I might be doing
close<00:03:11.519> forward<00:03:12.000> close<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.450> our<00:03:12.510> distances

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
close forward close and our distances

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.479 
close forward close and our distances
would<00:03:13.290> get<00:03:13.439> off<00:03:13.650> with<00:03:13.889> each<00:03:14.040> other<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.370> the

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
would get off with each other so the

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.949 
would get off with each other so the
easiest<00:03:14.819> thing<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.120> do<00:03:15.329> here<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.659> to<00:03:15.810> make<00:03:15.930> sure

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
easiest thing to do here is to make sure

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.259 
easiest thing to do here is to make sure
that<00:03:16.079> we're<00:03:16.290> just<00:03:16.439> always<00:03:16.680> traveling

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
that we're just always traveling

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.909 
that we're just always traveling
slightly<00:03:18.269> progressive<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:18.840> each<00:03:18.959> step<00:03:19.229> so<00:03:19.799> we

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
slightly progressive on each step so we

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.680 
slightly progressive on each step so we
compress<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.609> begin<00:03:20.849> turning<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.299> my<00:03:21.389> right

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
compress in I begin turning to my right

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.309 
compress in I begin turning to my right
we<00:03:21.989> turn<00:03:22.290> for<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.650> trip<00:03:23.310> pull<00:03:24.000> step<00:03:24.659> continuing

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
we turn for a trip pull step continuing

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.399 
we turn for a trip pull step continuing
to<00:03:25.409> turn<00:03:25.620> trip<00:03:26.190> pull<00:03:26.879> step<00:03:27.510> off<00:03:27.750> for<00:03:28.049> my<00:03:28.169> left

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
to turn trip pull step off for my left

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.409 
to turn trip pull step off for my left
hand<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.859> prepare<00:03:29.579> us<00:03:29.729> to<00:03:29.879> go<00:03:30.000> into<00:03:30.150> closed

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
hand to prepare us to go into closed

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:31.939 
hand to prepare us to go into closed
position<00:03:30.449> for<00:03:31.109> our<00:03:31.199> next<00:03:31.470> pattern<00:03:31.620> so

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
position for our next pattern so

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.800 
position for our next pattern so
whatever<00:03:32.220> we<00:03:32.370> might<00:03:32.519> do<00:03:32.669> we'd<00:03:33.120> go<00:03:33.269> back<00:03:33.510> into

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
whatever we might do we'd go back into

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.460 
whatever we might do we'd go back into
closed<00:03:34.260> in<00:03:34.769> our<00:03:34.889> next<00:03:35.280> sequence<00:03:36.229> ladies<00:03:37.229> let's

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
closed in our next sequence ladies let's

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.270 
closed in our next sequence ladies let's
take<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.650> look<00:03:37.889> at<00:03:37.949> our<00:03:38.069> part<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:39.919> we<00:03:40.919> start<00:03:41.190> in

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
take a look at our part so we start in

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.770 
take a look at our part so we start in
our<00:03:41.340> single<00:03:41.639> hand<00:03:41.940> hold<00:03:42.180> here<00:03:42.419> and<00:03:42.659> we're

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
our single hand hold here and we're

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.479 
our single hand hold here and we're
going<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.229> switch<00:03:43.500> our<00:03:43.709> sides<00:03:43.979> while<00:03:44.370> we

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
going to switch our sides while we

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.170 
going to switch our sides while we
triple<00:03:44.909> back<00:03:45.900> right<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.709> back<00:03:47.400> left<00:03:47.879> right

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
triple back right and back left right

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.300 
triple back right and back left right
now<00:03:48.599> there's<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.049> compression<00:03:49.620> into<00:03:49.799> this<00:03:50.010> hand

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
now there's a compression into this hand

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.670 
now there's a compression into this hand
leading<00:03:50.879> me<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.239> turn<00:03:51.510> I'm<00:03:51.810> going<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.319> start<00:03:52.530> to

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
leading me to turn I'm going to start to

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.280 
leading me to turn I'm going to start to
pivot<00:03:53.129> turn<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.669> as<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.419> do<00:03:54.479> I<00:03:54.659> check<00:03:55.079> in

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
pivot turn and as I do I check in

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.469 
pivot turn and as I do I check in
visually<00:03:55.889> each<00:03:56.129> time<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.699> see<00:03:56.879> if<00:03:57.000> Toby's

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479 
visually each time to see if Toby's

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.289 
visually each time to see if Toby's
still<00:03:57.659> turning<00:03:58.199> so<00:03:58.949> if<00:03:59.069> he<00:03:59.250> continues<00:03:59.849> to<00:03:59.879> turn

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
still turning so if he continues to turn

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.140 
still turning so if he continues to turn
I<00:04:00.569> turn<00:04:00.659> when<00:04:01.530> he<00:04:01.560> stops<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.340> stop<00:04:02.699> so<00:04:02.970> that's

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
I turn when he stops I stop so that's

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.539 
I turn when he stops I stop so that's
how<00:04:03.359> I<00:04:03.389> know<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.689> continue<00:04:04.139> pivoting<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:05.010> then

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
how I know to continue pivoting and then

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.959 
how I know to continue pivoting and then
we<00:04:05.699> could<00:04:05.849> go<00:04:05.970> on<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.329> another<00:04:06.659> figure
