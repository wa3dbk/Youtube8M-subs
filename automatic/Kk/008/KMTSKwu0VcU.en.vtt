00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:10.620
 Today I will report the hook that can be stuck firmly and can be peeled off 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.620
 Ha 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.720
 I want to attach a hook, but a hole in the wall 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:27.289
 I also hate to leave glue 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:29.170
 The 9th hook is easy to come off, and the magnet hook does not stick except steel 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.920
 Is a drawback 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:37.860
 It is this to solve such trouble 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:44.300
 It is a rejected hook that can be stuck firmly and can be peeled off 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:48.000
 If you replace the adhesive tape, you can replace it as many times as you like 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:53.060
 Then I want to use it immediately 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:59.140
 First of all clean the mounting surface and dry it well 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.140
 Peel off the tab release paper and stick it on the back of the hook 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.900
 Remove and bond the release paper for approximately 30 seconds 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.900
 Press hard 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.870
 This is complete 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.870
 It's easy 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.140
 Stickiness is strong even if you hit it 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.720
 Peeling not 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:26.130
 Easy to remove 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.490
 Pull the hook to the top and pull this tab along the wall to clean it 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.000
 I got it 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:35.710
 Hey, do not be left law 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.670
 For example, storage bags and clothes in the kitchen 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:45.960
 It can be used throughout the house such as calendar 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.960
 In addition , type of bathroom which is strong in water such as bathroom or 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:54.700
 There is not such a hook type but also such adhesive tab type 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.770
 No glue left when peeling off any of them 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.070
 I will not damage the material 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.070
 It is safe if you use this for important photos 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:10.490
 There is also a type that fixes the cord that gets in the way 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.490
 You can enjoy it like Tego 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.700

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.700
 It is an item of interest
