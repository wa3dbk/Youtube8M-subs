00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.420
 all right 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.620
 holistic and peak as they are I hope that 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.080
 have had an excellent weekend 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.990
 and good today I bring you a video in turn 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.330
 Entertaining new and very nice 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.130
 for you and it is a collaboration with 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.770
 other Chilean edwards I think 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.350
 most, not to say all or all 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.630
 they know them I am the aloe les la fran 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.880
 and the vila obviously these channels are going to 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.100
 be labeled here and collection of 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.900
 information so good first that 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.370
 nothing I leave you invite and simón and invites 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.110
 we say to go through their channels 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.570
 with those wonderful girls and chasms 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.340
 very nice invite more and good 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.600
 idea of this collaboration was to create 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.489
 five looks for five occasions 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.100
 different can see each of 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.050
 we had an opportunity and the 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.550
 which we should recreate a look and a 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.129
 of things as paramount or 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.350
 essentials of this kind of video of this 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.059
 video 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.649
 one of the products exceeds going down to 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.930
 five thousand pesos so it was a look 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.290
 quite economical and enforceable for all 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.600
 and for all 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.430
 so it seems to them that he is part and the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.160
 look that I had to represent to me is a 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.870
 departure or an afternoon of friends as well as 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.210
 go to have a coffee that will go 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.590
 of shopping and good I am addicted to 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.210
 get together with my friends to take a 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.040
 coffee and I do kuchar and love in village 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.420
 I do not know about you tell me in the 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.370
 comments they like to do when 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.320
 they meet with their friends and three opinions 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.240
 to the side or as I go to take a 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.580
 coffee and eat something and good then 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.170
 This is what I recreate for you 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.700
 I hope you like that belly 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.570
 of course you can take it away with 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.670
 leave them something and let's start and not 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.460
 forget to pass it and I'll start with the 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.720
 base these from that 10 la a la pau marc and 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.160
 in the information box I will leave you 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.590
 all the detailed products and the 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.390
 approximate prices so that they have a 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.250
 idea and good I will apply it with my 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.320
 hands because I love the texture that 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.680
 has and is more is super easy to blur 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.600
 the with them so good in everything 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.119
 my face and corrector I will use 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.920
 the xli wine that you already know is one of 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.740
 my favorites and I will apply it in the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.960
 dark circles in the shape of a triangle 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.980
 to illuminate the mitrab and that the nose 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.990
 a little bit my forehead in giant mykonos 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.360
 of the lips and below a little 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.890
 also to lift it more and to 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.410
 blur we are going to use again 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.820
 our hands that for me as I already 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.100
 I said is or are my best 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.440
 tools for the subject of makeup 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.270
 Apart from producing heat causes 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.190
 products are diffused a lot 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.310
 much easier and good I will be 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.130
 blurring and when also 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.220
 to tap and drag a little 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.440
 also to seal I'll like to use 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.000
 these colored powders that carries a 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.410
 little time using them but I must say 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.050
 that I liked a lot 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.610
 what little I carry and good the ideal is 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.349
 apply them with a chubby brush and 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.330
 thick so that it diffuses much more 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.950
 fast and that also does not end up like 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.890
 cake or cardboard on the face 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.230
 but eyebrows the same brown the scenes 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.599
 nothing more to fill one or the other 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.599
 little hole serves to give us shapes 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.610
 none of that as you see my eyebrows are not 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.050
 same but this helps me more than anything 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.940
 to fill them not to shape 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.740
 let's start with the shadows and I'm going to 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.340
 Apply a shade of in vanilla tone 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.690
 around the fixed and mobile eyelid and this 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.530
 will help me make the shadows come 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.900
 then 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.450
 then combine a lot more 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.430
 easy 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.410
 this maybelline shadow has me 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.629
 fascinated apart it looks a lot like 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.840
 place to condemn and I'll be 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:34.050
 applying in the first half of my eye 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.819
 good of both eyes to give a little 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.819
 of color and also illuminate because it is 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.650
 a very very bright shade and in the 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.510
 rest of the eyelid I will be using 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.250
 this other maybelline that I also 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.800
 love it is like a champagne color 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.150
 precious that will also help 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.100
 illuminate the eye 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.050
 to pat and mix it a little 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.170
 for the basin I'm going to use a shadow 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.450
 coffee and I'm going to leave an open basin not 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.340
 I'm going to mark how the eye looks 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.320
 this is like the banana technique 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.030
 open that will help me apart 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.700
 open my eyes a lot more and that 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.069
 see bigger 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.129
 this trick for people who have 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.360
 the little ones go super super well now 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.769
 I'm going to blur it with a brush 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.340
 chubby so it does not stay in court 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.080
 nor the folds well marked and now 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.979
 with the vanilla shadow again I'm going to 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.900
 illuminate the fixed eyelid the arch of the 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.520
 eyebrows to also erase a little bit of 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.800
 color that may have run towards 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.159
 this zone 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.259
 I'm going back with the brown shadow appointment and 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:38.879
 I'm going to apply it to my eyelashes 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.920
 lower also to give the effect 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.660
 as of bigger eyes 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.850
 and also to give it more shape 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.260
 ordination to recite to me I love 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.610
 apply dark shadows on the line of 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.920
 the eyelashes because I feel that my look 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.020
 be much more intense 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.360
 tomás is the same with the other eye 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.940
 you can use a brush 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.500
 hair loose but I like these 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.360
 as to delineate 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.260
 vanilla again let's light up the 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.120
 lacrimal I did not want to apply a very shadow 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.030
 bright because already my eye that yes 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.950
 they have a lot of light so I preferred 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.950
 use a matte for this area 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.330
 now the gel liner we are going to make 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.040
 a pretty pretty finite kitten and I 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.259
 always birthing at eyelashes 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.930
 doing a small little finite or 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:32.630
 be a finite line and then I go 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.280
 extending little by little and always 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.660
 Looking in the mirror to see more or 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.300
 minus the thickness in which I want this 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.159
 stay 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.710
 and I'm going to do the same with the other eye 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.330
 starting well well well ordered at 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.970
 tabs 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.090
 and as you see so little by little I'm giving you the 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.919
 shape the eye or the kitten 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.180
 I'm going to take brown shadow again 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.639
 because I feel that it is missing a little 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.610
 more definition and I'll join with 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:00.580
 the beginning of the line or the kitten the 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.650
 delineated better said 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.110
 Now I'm going to apply the mask 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.930
 of tabs and I return the mask that 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.520
 I used is the sixth time of jordan and 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.879
 well that's how you can see and 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.560
 appreciate the look for the cheeks I'll 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:16.389
 be using this dream box and of 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.030
 Maybelline that I love is a tone 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:21.280
 last that is super super sanito or 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.599
 It gives that healthy effect to the skin and what 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.330
 I will also report with my fingers 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:27.669
 apart it is super natural and really 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.430
 it's as if it's yours is made 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:32.439
 super good with the illuminator skin I'm going 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.240
 to use this maybelline shadow that is 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:36.940
 the one that I used previously and has me 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.180
 in love leaves a balloon a shine to the 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.990
 skin but really lovely indeed 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.970
 I love her 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.430
 and I'm going to apply on the cheekbones a 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:50.390
 little on the lip 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:52.440
 and a little nose and ready tip tip 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.860
 tip 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.840
 I am fascinated by this enlightened shadow of 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.720
 you'll be using the mouse 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.470
 essence that is like a nest of love 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:07.100
 tied very very very nice 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:10.560
 and then this shadow of l'oréal 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:14.330
 which is 378 if I remember correctly 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.330
 and it is already 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:21.580

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:23.199

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.479
 liked that entertained them 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:27.339
 remember to leave a monitorio to this 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:29.949

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:31.779
