00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.900
 little kisses 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.740
 entity 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.060
 when my days 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.060
 no gift 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.400

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.980

 and be where it is thanks to your own 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.510
 merits my best definition of 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.950
 perseverance of the study supported you 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.950
 unconditionally all your decisions 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.060
 but it's not that 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.990
 I with my brother because I love him 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.980
 but we do not talk every day and 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.980
 listen to him tell me those words 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.020
 I am the oldest of three brothers and with 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.940
 he always because as we have not been the 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.030
 closest brothers 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.459
 but I love him and nothing 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.490
 and listen to those words of support 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.680
 and of encouragement 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.150
 they help me to want to get ahead and 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.540
 want to do things always well and 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.420
 better that is the engine without a doubt that such 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.550
 in love where Colombians have 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.800
 social networks saying that the 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.800
 crespa again doing 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.970
 they created an account that is called 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.600
 go back to the crust that has more than 7 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.310
 thousand followers on twitter I was very 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.720
 surprised because clearly I know 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.610
 that one is not expert in sweet for 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.960
 to like everyone and that the 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.220
 people can be home with certain 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.520
 characters with certain participants 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.910
 but see the support of the people that was 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.950
 much bigger and the love that is not 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.320
 the all the messages I turned trend in 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.600
 twitter and social networks almost 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.230
 they collapse that day of elimination all 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.690
 the world 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.940
 outraged and that account that they created not 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.800
 I am very grateful because people will 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.710
 he wants very much 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.080
 or the 9 that walks when walking what happened 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.040
 with cats because well our 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.290
 program has a theme that are the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.270
 you had to adopt and walk 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.850
 I wanted wanted pets I just wanted 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.490
 pets the good life I of small 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.500
 arrested pets had puppies and 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.990
 then I did not have a time and as I live 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.150
 alone since I was 15 years old, I do not have 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.920
 animals because they stay only left 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.510
 solid and I think they are like a son and 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.340
 one has to give all the attention and 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.770
 all the care for what 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:14.340
 and that's what it's called 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:15.870
 cerati and the bold is celia was the one 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.060
 started a path for us to adopt 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.380
 because the animal path she 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.060
 animals like what happens is that 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.190
 has not had good experiences with 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.530
 puppies in ancient relationships 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.030
 So, this time, what I wanted was 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.280
 like having kittens that are more 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.650
 independent you have reasons that are 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.000
 cleaner for them clear if it 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.120
 they are left alone as there is not so much 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.120
 problem 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.919
 sand your water your food and have a 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.930
 house of 6 floors so that they play 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.009
 so they are happy that it is the 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.430
 own cam and the one that tells us a 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:49.740
 little bit that relationship will come to open 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:58.530
 more everything will come but I do believe that 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:05:01.320
 walked was very happy because I the 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.850
 I call at least a week of 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.919
 have measured and now I'm in the 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.270
 airport and already like that is a joke and 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.639
 I think that in this evaluation of a joke 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.910
 of snail or some joke because then no 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.650
 he thought it would not come out so soon but 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.150
 even she was very excited because 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.130
 He tells me that he says a lot 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.710
 missing in so little time is that we already 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.720
 we have become very united very very together 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.789
 Antonia is like going to her one day 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.949
 and I want to die I go one day I already 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.449
 It also gets really bad we're talking 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.099
 of walking and that is the couple of the 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.229
 crest over here I can call her please 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.300
 if we did a peek because she 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.800
 is here is very close they are a 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.800
 I greet my health here 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:47.760
 everywhere and these boards 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.080
 inseparable the two beautiful yes yes yes 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.790
 It has been a relationship that has struggled 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.260
 against all odds that we have been 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.700
 together in good times and not so 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.680
 good that we have grown and learned 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.410
 very much the one from the other 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.129
 and nothing I think that carry that message 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.979
 that we want to take that is what 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:06.569
 nothing else matters that love 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.809
 you understand because many times we have 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.819
 so many prejudices and things and limitations 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:14.969
 and there are couples that really are not so 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:17.369
 happy to live in a parameter of the 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:18.929
 society when they come here or if we are 

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:20.909
 two people and we love each other because 

00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:23.849
 repress us and retain that feeling 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:27.050
 that we can take and show from a 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:30.169
 way that this moment is missing 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:34.610
 us and ya juan Ã¡lvarez magician of magicians 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.610
 fantastic as a person
