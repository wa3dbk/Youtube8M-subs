00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.240
 and friends i max format and today we 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.040
 continue the theme of the wounds of this case 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.260
 dedicated to the tank tiger 2 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.700
 mini-guide was already on my channel 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.619
 about this tanchik in which i 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.720
 conducted specific arguments tried 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.910
 prove that tiger 2 is the most remarkable 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.190
 and the most playable car among all 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.020
 runoff tanks on the eighth level and so 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.309
 he said that with stock gun on it 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.960
 much more pleasant to play than with 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.059
 lock cannons on other tt 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.710
 also cited specific examples and 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.690
 tried it all very well 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.489
 argue whether you have found 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.380
 autists who said that you see I 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.690
 showed a fight with a pile of cannon 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.120
 top of the list and see in the top ten I would 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.530
 I could not do anything like this 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.690
 I had to, in general 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.469
 hang extra couple dozens of fights yet 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.180
 not a good fight and has turned today 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.430
 In general, our video is dedicated to my po 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.810
 on tiger 2 with stock gun on the map 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.270
 robin fights in the tenth level, 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:11.300
 opponents are two e100 t57 heavy 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.399
 out of 4 battalion 140 the object is very shorter 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.530
 car wash which is not what I could 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.959
 it would be very easy to make out the power of what 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.420
 they dozens of nines against them 

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:22.039
 they would not seem to be either 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.229
 many complained to find for the second what 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.149
 he's some kind of out on and the machine's pants aren't 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.610
 rides doesn't shoot doesn't pierce and she doesn't 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.770
 so remarkable as i described it but 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.770
 Objectively guys, of course she is not for everyone 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.020
 fit in Krivorukov guys no 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.020
 Talking the tank will not suit them always 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.360
 will try to teach yourself somehow 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.369
 justify and say that the car is not there 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.590
 good that the car is there 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.319
 enough but in fact ti to 20 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.179
 gram they guys fit and do not know either 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.190
 on it from chrome nikek play you 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.679
 let's go to battle got on the map 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.390
 robin as I already said and the card 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.190
 robin night not open but by virtue 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.929
 the fact that and many times reworked on it 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.239
 there are at least some places on which 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:06.080
 you can stand in such a huge huge 

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:08.750
 tanks like a tiger 2 servant saying tiger 2 65 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.250
 ton machine if not more 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.470
 and take on it some other 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.340
 remarkable car position where you can 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.880
 it would exercise all your debut 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.980
 feeling dpm on its effectiveness 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.040
 it manifests as real heavy 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.750
 dts good dynamic gun of course 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.580
 it is very difficult here because the map 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.310
 big and have to borrow some 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.200
 such more advantageous positions in this battle 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.610
 I somehow decided to go to the mountain because 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.460
 that as a rule, only the base cost 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.680
 autists she to 3 go I have no options 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.110
 very slowly will take me apart before 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.180
 I'll go there to go somewhere to stand in 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.280
 bushes on c4 is also not an option review with us 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.300
 not so much though the gun or rather the tower 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.600
 I'm already top 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.310
 she has a review under 400 meters but all 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.160
 Equally guys is not an option so I decided 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.470
 here the cheekbone is a little bit ponastalgic and 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.450
 come like a real ogre schoolboy on 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.400
 slide because there were times guys 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.010
 when everyone went to the slide was 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.170
 wonderful wonderful squares a0 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.630
 was such a form where you could stand and 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.160
 just awesome tank through the tower but 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.430
 as we see sharp 34 apparently too 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.740
 counted that this place is still 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.510
 relevant but see that very much today 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.880
 u filled with his efforts so he 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.250
 leaves and gets two off of me and then 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.400
 and three splash but really guys luck 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.710
 I was not so long comprehended because I 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.230
 notice that to my right is t57 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.790
 Heavy and then the ridge want to pride 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.710
 throw because took the guy not 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.800
 very competent position I want him straight 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:37.440
 straight punish them leaving color and what 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.690
 happens in ours in general for all 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.730
 the rules choosing to shine of course 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.680
 I shine you this for 400 meters 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.690
 Of course the power of the fact that to my left were 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.950
 tanks for me highlighted that is why 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.290
 I have so many pyshechek 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.900
 and got then these look me pierced 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.820
 into the tower into the corps anywhere that is 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.860
 the tenth level is not to tank at all 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.420
 option maybe those who complain about 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.790
 second tiger armor too often 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.250
 get into level 10 they just them 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.090
 just not looking to compare but do not know 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.070
 maybe I'm a happy person but I 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.770
 for example in 50 battles I am at the very top 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.709
 list then 1 tuleev there why in the first 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.570
 The top five of course there are fights when 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.200
 ten you get on the prayer card to how 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.850
 in this fight 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.590
 but no less say the power of the fact that 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.709
 there is some ability to play there like 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.030
 raised 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.440
 yes i am a very very modest person yes and 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.060
 very power of all this very much like that 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.280
 It turns out like how to play noticing 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.349
 again t57 heavy but this time I already see 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.960
 what kind of like a simple team more 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.410
 less than class 3 egorovich as harry is not here 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.449
 especially 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.490
 let's say expects this time I already 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.840
 I leave and drive away because you accept 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.090
 the sea will stand in my place again 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.669
 light and enemy e100 me just 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.139
 Shaw, no, but I still look at him 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.300
 In general, then back and forth rides are unlikely 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.710
 I vytselivat I leave him he 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.349
 looking at me and somehow 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.900
 I beat him to the joint between the tower and 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:57.820
 Corps did not expect such a steep 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.580
 breaking through there is very difficult to break through 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.710
 apparently my 200 millimeters than a projectile 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.050
 somehow got there the most 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.620
 weak spot also replacing my left 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.270
 t-34 I keep thinking about what else 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.909
 present there I stand at any moment 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.130
 can take me to the side of the tower but since 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:17.320
 most likely he has already transferred to our 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.020
 4 forests that slid down the mountain 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.060
 I once again disassemble uncover and 34 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.250
 kotofey about something for some reason tank 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.229
 body in his place I would of course 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.330
 sign up now down the hill through the tower 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.550
 chanted and just walked in because 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.320
 that hop and I have literally one 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.870
 shot or chance and I have been here 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.969
 very little really against the t-34 but 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.509
 he's exchanging all his food dripping on 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:42.520
 mage 284 unit is not clear why well 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:44.909
 apparently guys Yoruba mana I'm grass like 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.680
 says well and in general then on this after 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:49.509
 of all these battles it would be very much going 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.280
 board for 5 for some reason left for something 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.210
 substituted but again mad nemo 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.550
 build houses 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.440
 then look with bb bump leaving 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.150
 now on the enemy entry about it now 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.830
 moment for those who say that breaking through 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.349
 not enough happiness shoot punch in 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.099
 corps why not shoot the side of the tower in 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:04.389
 hull board 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:06.370
 I rather in the back 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.419
 bulwark there is the smallest 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.639
 number of armor bars 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.500
 now switching to gold and 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:13.690
 there you end up wanting to notice something that 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.520
 Initially in battle I was over 12 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.190
 Gold shells, I only opened here 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.840
 one shot of subcalera everything else 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.620
 these would be bakes let's move on to 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.230
 I would take 8900 games experience 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.510
 55,000 silver 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.150
 on publicity first degree detailed 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:33.360
 report plus 35 thousand team silver 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:36.840
 the result I caused 3600 damage let's 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.240
 I will find here I have 3600 damage dealt 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.160
 guys and for the tank with stock gun 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.410
 tenth level 1 the biggest and most 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.090
 an open map I ask 4 quite good 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.430
 again don't brag about what's super 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.290
 cool fight guys fight is very weak 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.320
 but is a good example of that with 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.360
 stupa can be quite playable and 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.890
 Generally right now would probably right okay 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.360
 friends are worth it to finish anyone 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.880

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.870
