00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 cream body ready your secret yourself 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.919
 this victory 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.360
 there you go I mean I am whole now 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.490
 well started this competition and then 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.090
 we found out that was such a blow 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.280
 to buy 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.379
 hi jean i think and it was our game 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.240
 went back a bit but i'm had 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.470
 own are not really benefit from 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.970
 and so on when we got out of the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.279
 changing room you have got there you know 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.869
 kind of peptalk had in the rest and 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.640
 everyone focused and just again 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.720
 told him so go to village problems and 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.760
 not 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.500
 and not the sky that are that one here 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.989
 have found out for stamping nerve and 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.070
 I think I think that we have the right to 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.989
 stepped down second 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.730
 I agree with almost everything you say 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.230
 agree except that you are well off the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.690
 dressing room came I thought you only 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.670
 went to play well after that yes that bizarre 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.399
 same warehouse manager yes no I agree 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.629
 that's right but I have to do it 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.360
 have in the rest he got on sharp 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.510
 set and just pep talk is now yes 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.890
 We didn't and we didn't order the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.140
 impression they were disappointed 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.449
 we were the only ones and just 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.850
 game had to keep playing and and dorm 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.729
 they keep going and I think we 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.270
 have done a counter goal encounter 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.700
 equalizer india to an extreme extent gh 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.150
 definitely again so I eat I do mix both 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.409
 dangerous players have before him 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.030
 all of which are very very fast so it 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.530
 is always dangerous for lies or for 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.180
 to make an opponent 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.009
 which a cheat and then got 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.240
 beaten cancer yes that was it 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.979
 breakpoint in the competition 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.229
 you went there was ajax believe 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.400
 what somewhat doubtful there and consequence 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.869
 you are in the three points and one 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.020
 the beautiful 3 a victory 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.619
 pma equal as announces this victory 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.210
 win the arena yes it is a while 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.799
 ago at psv just has outlast 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.659
 four five years ago 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.210
 The times that don't matter as a champion 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.009
 it happened that can also crept through 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.990
 think it is not happening again now 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.490
 arrived who had time to head there 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.659
 speculation might be a bit 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.820
 nice for me but this is a 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.530
 metal sign a huge boost 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.500
 you certainly too early to trees 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.140
 say played by that match and 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.790
 but yes it is certainly my language good good 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.600
 for good for the players from and for 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.270
 us so 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.620
 I agree with him not to use that psv 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.730
 rent for once about this victory 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.350
 must be because there are also very many things 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.850
 went wrong and then that ajax long 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.470
 periods of the competition also just the 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.970
 better team 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.230
 no, it is also true that we are also right 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.960
 but I think you can be happy 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.180
 nose and the arena wins something not very 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.370
 often lately and if that 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.320
 happens that you can be happy and then 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.460
 and a tea cake warsaw says too 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.350
 mentally 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.870
 positive good because again it happens 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.470
 only Indians or PC became champions 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.470
 pussy will see
