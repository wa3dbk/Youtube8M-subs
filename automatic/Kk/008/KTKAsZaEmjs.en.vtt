move the joystick right you go right not

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.780 
move the joystick right you go right not
only<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.649> moving<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.190> direction<00:00:41.250> but

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
only is it moving in that direction but

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.340 
only is it moving in that direction but
you<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:41.969> also<00:00:42.120> control<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> speed<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:43.260> the

movement if you move the joystick only a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.760 
movement if you move the joystick only a
little<00:00:45.360> bit<00:00:45.629> you'll<00:00:45.809> get<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> slow<00:00:46.289> move<00:00:46.530> you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
little bit you'll get a slow move you

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.799 
little bit you'll get a slow move you
want<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.039> move<00:00:47.160> faster<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.480> get<00:00:48.629> that

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
want to move faster you can get that

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.049 
want to move faster you can get that
analog<00:00:49.289> effect<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.980> amplifying<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.730> speed

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
analog effect of amplifying the speed

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.299 
analog effect of amplifying the speed
just<00:00:51.270> by<00:00:51.420> moving<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> joystick<00:00:51.960> farther<00:00:52.620> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
just by moving the joystick farther to

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.000 
just by moving the joystick farther to
move<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.789> down<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.629> screw<00:00:55.140> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
move up and down just like a screw to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.569 
move up and down just like a screw to
screw<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.180> turn<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.600> clockwise<00:00:57.719> to

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
screw it in I turn it clockwise to

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.150 
screw it in I turn it clockwise to
unscrew<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.820> turn<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.239> counterclockwise

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
unscrew it I turn it counterclockwise

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.709 
unscrew it I turn it counterclockwise
very<00:01:02.160> similar<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> Bluetooth<00:01:03.690> headset

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
very similar to like a Bluetooth headset

at<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> robot<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.540> what<00:01:09.689> you're<00:01:09.900> doing

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
at the robot and what you're doing

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.590 
at the robot and what you're doing
instead<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.979> looking<00:01:11.220> down<00:01:11.430> which<00:01:11.939> trying<00:01:12.540> to
