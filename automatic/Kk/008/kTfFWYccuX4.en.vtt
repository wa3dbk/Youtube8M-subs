00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:33.000
 A long, thin road that I have walked on 

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:44.900
 Looking back, you can see the hometown far away 

00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:56.900
 Uneven road and winding road 

00:00:56.901 --> 00:01:10.000
 Not even a map that too life 

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:20.900
 Oh like the flow of the river 

00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:32.900
 Slowly, times have passed 

00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:43.300
 Oh like the flow of the river 

00:01:43.301 --> 00:02:01.000
 Only endlessly sky is dyed in the twilight (twilight) 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 To live is this endless road to travel 

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:45.000
 While I'm dreaming with my loved one 

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:57.000
 It's raining and it's a wet road 

00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:10.000
 Someday it will be sunny again 

00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:21.000
 Oh like the flow of the river 

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:32.800
 I want to leave this body calm 

00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:43.000
 Oh like the flow of the river 

00:03:43.001 --> 00:04:00.000
 Waiting for the changing season 

00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:11.000
 Oh like the flow of the river 

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:22.500
 I want to leave this body calm 

00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:32.900
 Oh like the flow of the river 

00:04:32.901 --> 00:04:51.500
 While listening to the blue serpents forever
