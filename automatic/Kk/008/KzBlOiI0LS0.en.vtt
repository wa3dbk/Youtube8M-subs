right<00:05:06.740> I<00:05:07.930> think<00:05:08.930> it<00:05:09.020> needs<00:05:09.080> to<00:05:09.289> be<00:05:09.380> warmed<00:05:09.680> up<00:05:09.830> a

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
right I think it needs to be warmed up a

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.950 
right I think it needs to be warmed up a
little<00:05:10.010> more<00:05:11.860> maybe<00:05:12.860> a<00:05:13.010> little<00:05:13.190> more<00:05:13.460> sauce

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960
