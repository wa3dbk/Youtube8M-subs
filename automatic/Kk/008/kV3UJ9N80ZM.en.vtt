the battery it's 40 500 milliamps MSRP
7495<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.880> about<00:00:18.090> double<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.480> size<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
7495 it's about double the size of the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.450 
7495 it's about double the size of the
standard<00:00:20.270> battery<00:00:21.980> it's<00:00:22.980> like<00:00:23.100> kind<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.400> like

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
standard battery it's like kind of like

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.880 
standard battery it's like kind of like
stacking<00:00:24.029> one<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.449> top<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.810> other<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.230> got

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
stacking one on top of the other I got

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.320 
stacking one on top of the other I got
another<00:00:26.130> one<00:00:26.310> here<00:00:27.439> but<00:00:28.439> yeah<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:28.859> about

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
another one here but yeah it's about

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.970 
another one here but yeah it's about
double<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.359> size<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.929> two<00:00:31.380> OEM<00:00:32.070> batteries

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
double the size of two OEM batteries

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.380 
double the size of two OEM batteries
always<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> battery<00:00:35.489> bag<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.090> got<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
always have the battery bag I got the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.900 
always have the battery bag I got the
gray<00:00:36.770> but<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.340> little<00:00:38.550> different<00:00:38.700> from

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
gray but it's a little different from

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.490 
gray but it's a little different from
the<00:00:39.059> pebble<00:00:39.450> finish<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:40.140> more<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.410> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the pebble finish it's more of a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.110 
the pebble finish it's more of a
metallic<00:00:43.730> here<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:47.250> battery<00:00:47.579> bags<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:47.940> got

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
metallic here the battery bags just got

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.650 
metallic here the battery bags just got
to<00:00:48.210> push<00:00:48.360> down<00:00:48.390> all<00:00:48.840> around<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:50.360> sits<00:00:51.360> really

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
to push down all around and sits really

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.450 
to push down all around and sits really
flush<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.800> make<00:00:52.890> sure<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.100> little

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
flush just have to make sure a little

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.590 
flush just have to make sure a little
clip<00:00:54.449> snap<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:55.520> if<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:57.059> don't<00:00:57.270> there's<00:00:57.539> a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
clip snap in if you don't there's a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.209 
clip snap in if you don't there's a
little<00:00:57.719> gap<00:00:57.989> but<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.800> throw<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.100> your

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
little gap but if you just throw in your

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.850 
little gap but if you just throw in your
pocket<00:00:59.670> it'll<00:01:00.059> close<00:01:00.570> itself<00:01:00.960> down<00:01:06.740> there<00:01:07.740> it

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
pocket it'll close itself down there it

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.830 
pocket it'll close itself down there it
is<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:09.860> mean<00:01:10.860> there's<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> little<00:01:11.840> little

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
is I mean there's like a little little

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.920 
is I mean there's like a little little
opening<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.830> i<00:01:14.130> think<00:01:15.090> i<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.210> didn't<00:01:15.630> push

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
opening but i think i just didn't push

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.320 
opening but i think i just didn't push
down<00:01:16.229> all<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> way<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.740> active

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
down all the way and then the active

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.310 
down all the way and then the active
case<00:01:23.540> then<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:24.689> thing<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.900> forgot<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.200> mention

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
case then one thing I forgot to mention

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.830 
case then one thing I forgot to mention
is<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.159> battery<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.210> extended<00:01:27.570> battery<00:01:27.600> is

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
is the battery the extended battery is

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.980 
is the battery the extended battery is
not<00:01:28.020> NFC<00:01:29.009> capable<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:32.390> downside<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.810> I

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
not NFC capable this one downside but I

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.539 
not NFC capable this one downside but I
found<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.409> don't<00:01:34.590> use<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.950> much<00:01:34.979> anyway

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
found that I don't use it much anyway

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.910 
found that I don't use it much anyway
and<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:37.590> case<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:38.070> goes<00:01:38.280> right<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:39.920> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and the case just goes right on the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.520 
and the case just goes right on the
kickstands<00:01:41.579> nice<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:44.960> yeah<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> rubber<00:01:46.290> it's

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
kickstands nice and yeah the rubber it's

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.100 
kickstands nice and yeah the rubber it's
not<00:01:46.770> grippy<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:48.030> has<00:01:48.149> enough<00:01:48.479> where<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.930> won't

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
not grippy but has enough where it won't

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.590 
not grippy but has enough where it won't
slide<00:01:49.439> out<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.710> your<00:01:49.829> hand<00:01:49.970> won't<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.180> pull

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
slide out of your hand won't like pull

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.889 
slide out of your hand won't like pull
the<00:01:51.750> inside<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.229> your<00:01:52.439> pocket<00:01:52.890> out<00:01:53.009> either<00:01:53.220> and

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
the inside of your pocket out either and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.179 
the inside of your pocket out either and
the<00:01:54.899> finish<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.380> always<00:01:55.680> nice<00:01:55.829> because<00:01:56.070> it's

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
the finish is always nice because it's

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:03.679 
the finish is always nice because it's
like<00:01:56.280> rubberized<00:01:57.560> and<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:02.549> kickstand<00:02:03.149> itself

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
like rubberized and the kickstand itself

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.770 
like rubberized and the kickstand itself
it's<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.380> pretty<00:02:05.189> stable<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:06.240> wobbles<00:02:06.689> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
it's really pretty stable it wobbles a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.270 
it's really pretty stable it wobbles a
little<00:02:07.079> just<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.590> size<00:02:07.829> or<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
little just because the size or the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.969 
little just because the size or the
shape<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.239> case<00:02:09.479> but<00:02:10.229> it's<00:02:10.379> not<00:02:10.560> bad<00:02:10.800> at

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
shape of the case but it's not bad at

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.070 
shape of the case but it's not bad at
all

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
all

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.480 
all
I<00:02:13.930> think<00:02:14.930> that's<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.350> this<00:02:15.530> little<00:02:15.830> magnet<00:02:16.280> and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
I think that's it this little magnet and

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.910 
I think that's it this little magnet and
the<00:02:16.580> kickstand<00:02:17.180> keeps<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.140> bound<00:02:18.380> just<00:02:18.710> kind

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
the kickstand keeps it bound just kind

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.100 
the kickstand keeps it bound just kind
of<00:02:18.980> push<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.370> pops<00:02:19.640> right<00:02:19.760> up<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.360> there's

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
of push it pops right up and there's

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.420 
of push it pops right up and there's
more<00:02:21.200> than<00:02:21.530> enough<00:02:21.560> rooms<00:02:21.950> get<00:02:22.190> your<00:02:22.310> S<00:02:22.400> Pen

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
more than enough rooms get your S Pen

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.960 
more than enough rooms get your S Pen
out<00:02:22.910> for<00:02:23.540> those<00:02:23.630> that<00:02:23.870> do<00:02:24.080> like<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.440> use<00:02:24.620> it

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
out for those that do like to use it

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.430 
out for those that do like to use it
should<00:02:25.970> focus<00:02:26.240> here<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.950> that's<00:02:28.160> it
