00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.539
 I propose a diagram of lax gonna do 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.240
 bartering at the man so on this part 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:19.199
 there of my painting I represented by 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.689
 three colors especially blue green and pink 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.539
 the three bodies involved in 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.580
 this axis gonna do trope everything starts at 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.160
 level of the hypothalamus with 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.699
 neurons that will secrete a neuro 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.660
 hormones the gnrh so this area there at the 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.430
 base of your brain 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.399
 we are in the case of a nervous system 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.329
 so under control among others 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.219
 environmental neurons 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.280
 hypothalamic secretaries there you have a 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.489
 neuron he will secrete a neuro 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.010
 hormones that will be conveyed by the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.139
 singing here we talk about door systems 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.909
 pituitary hypothalamus you see a 

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:56.039
 network of blood capillaries at the level 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.379
 of the hypothalamus a network of 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.149
 blood capillaries here at a level 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.949
 gland at the base of the brain there this is 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.989
 more of the nervous system we talk about 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.180
 the pituitary and the part before that 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.250
 adenoids to anterior pituitary fist 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.050
 so at this part level you have 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.090
 also a capillary a network of 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.400
 blood capillaries and in between 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.950
 there is a new door that makes the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.430
 link between my two organs 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.510
 the hypothalamus in blue and the die 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.300
 hypocrisies towards the gnrh to for 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.730
 target cells adenoma cells 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.740
 pituitary gonad cells other 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.300
 other pituitary adenomas these 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.310
 cells carry on their surface 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.370
 small receivers complementary to the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.710
 gnrh when they set the gnrh in 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.180
 answer they will produce two 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.690
 hormones the fsh and lhf shc for h 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.110
 follicle stimulating hormone is there and 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.420
 loose luteinizing hormone these two 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.450
 hormones are conveyed by meaning and 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.820
 are going to target especially there and 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.140
 loose the fsh is not in the program in 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.700
 the framework of 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.010
 reproductive function in 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.960
 the man there the target purchase 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.240
 basically the cells of the ouch 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.490
 said you had seen that is 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.650
 between the tubes 6 min do at the 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.450
 testicle the cells of the dike 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.730
 in response once they have fixed 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.630
 age via their receivers produce 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.850
 testosterone 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.459
 this testosterone will then have 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.380
 several roles allow the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.830
 spermatogenesis at the level of these tubes 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.060
 mini do and induce the maintenance and the 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.340
 development of sexual characteristics 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.530
 secondary 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.900
 this is the diagram that represents where I 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.269
 know of trope at the man of 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.120
 the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland until the 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.190
 testosterone throw mini-cities little more 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.459
 which symbolizes stimulates control 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.320
 favorably so the hypothalamus 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.940
 stimulates the so-called office that stimulates 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.720
 the cells of the dic that in response 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.300
 produce testosterone there 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.530
 the originality of this of this axis of 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.090
 nador other offers is that this 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.489
 testosterone back control 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.030
 negatively retro control control in 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.709
 back retro control the complex 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.290
 pituitary hypothalamus so that 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.640
 the plasma testosterone level in 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.930
 the sound and maintained globally 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.870
 constant on a day I propose you 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.480
 here more simply the same thing as 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.959
 my right but a little bit more 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.410
 vulgarized you see here that 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.170
 hypothalamus 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.790
 it's in quotation marks the organ meters 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.440
 of this axis gonna do barter his 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.120
 hypothalamus and well he has no 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.190
 gnrh secretions there will not be 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.150
 secretion by the pituitary dlh and there 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.670
 will have no secretion of testosterone 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.459
 by the cells of the dike so 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.459
 the hypothalamus secretes the gnrh that 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.100
 stimulates the secretion of l &amp; h by 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.590
 pituitary cells that then acts 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.100
 on the cells of the dike 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.410
 positively that stimulates the cells 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.570
 eddy that produce testosterone that 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.010
 allows spermatogenesis and 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.460
 secondary sex characteristics 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.980
 in return this theron pestos exerts a 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.300
 negative feedback show the hypothalamus 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.190
 it is possible so that if 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.710
 hypothalamus produces too much gnrh the 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.870
 Highly concentrated testosterone goes 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.670
 inhibit in return the hypothalamus which 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.080
 pass that will produce their minus two 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.300
 generations by two loops of 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.550
 regulation you have a video about it 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.490
 so the comco does not have another hop it's 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.770
 hypothalamus acts on the pituitary acts 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.480
 on the testicles that produce the 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.250
 testosterone that allows the 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.580
 spermatogenesis and sexual characteristics 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.580
 secondary
