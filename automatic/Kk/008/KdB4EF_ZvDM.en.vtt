00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
into the little bits of the model

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.980 
into the little bits of the model
because<00:02:55.960> usually<00:02:56.800> I<00:02:57.570> do<00:02:58.570> them<00:02:59.020> last<00:02:59.530> I<00:03:00.010> do<00:03:00.490> the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
good bits first and they're basically

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.470 
good bits first and they're basically
rubbish<00:03:04.960> bits<00:03:05.200> last<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.890> had<00:03:06.280> don't<00:03:06.580> worry<00:03:06.730> mind

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
rubbish bits last I had don't worry mind
