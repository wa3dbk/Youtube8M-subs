00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
SanDisk Ultra jewel 3.0 16gb version I

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.580 
SanDisk Ultra jewel 3.0 16gb version I
got<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:10.320> from<00:00:11.000> Flipkart<00:00:12.000> today<00:00:14.929> it's<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.049> 3.0

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
got it from Flipkart today it's a 3.0

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.120 
got it from Flipkart today it's a 3.0
that's<00:00:16.859> why<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.640> speeds<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.650> 150

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
that's why it speeds of 150

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.029 
that's why it speeds of 150
I<00:00:20.160> mean<00:00:20.699> 130<00:00:21.090> Mbps<00:00:21.720> per<00:00:21.869> second<00:00:24.920> already<00:00:25.920> got

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
I mean 130 Mbps per second already got

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.240 
I mean 130 Mbps per second already got
opened<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:27.539> comes<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.050> cover<00:00:28.500> like

going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.540> connect<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.759> my<00:01:21.409> pen<00:01:22.409> drive

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
going to connect it with my pen drive

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:31.040 
going to connect it with my pen drive
and<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> speech

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050
