00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.380
 frankfurt is growing on the 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.929
 1014 and the press conference yes what me 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.849
 holding hands here is not one 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.380
 htc one that you might see if 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.269
 one to a normal htc 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.610
 next to it but just keeps fresh 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:39.159
 featured 8 inch called mediapad 18.0 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.860
 and yes this is a middle class tablet 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:44.470
 that is so primarily on multimedia 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.430
 specialize tasks come first 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.920
 to the display that is a hd-display 280 x 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.839
 800 in the resolution as well 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.600
 said 8 inches in the diagonal in it 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:01:00.640
 stuck quad cores ossi hisense 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.110
 kirin 910 with 1 6 gigahertz yes what 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.519
 it is striking that the device is the first 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.570
 So I'm pretty well made 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.300
 go here a bit 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.940
 that's all brushed aluminum 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.750
 here is the the power button is the 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.120
 volume button above the output for 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.800
 headsets 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.369
 here is nothing below is the micro usb 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.810
 jack and yes the other thing that stands out 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.040
 is that it finally happens 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.210
 again a tablet with a front 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.380
 There are no speakers for a long time 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.880
 more since the nexus 10 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.040
 and he is supposed to deliver very good sound and 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.750
 Also improved by software in Hans 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.430
 munich on the wall 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.410
 otherwise we have middle class 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.690
 I already have specific christi specifications 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:46.160
 said a gigabyte ram is in it 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.440
 The memory is almost includes 8 gb 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.149
 also a 16 gigabyte version can give 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.259
 but anyway be extended by 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.240
 micro sd slot 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.100
 I 'm going to be happy a bit 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.130
 Of course he was here again 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:05.679
 motion july planted shortly thereafter as 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.679
 android version comes after a short time 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.560
 android 4.2.2011 will hopefully be added 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.200
 release of the device still updated and 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.019
 because it looks pretty good is also very good 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.209
 slim 7 9 millimeters should also only 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.370
 So maybe 299 euros cost one 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.290
 option for people who take an 8 inch 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.940
 looking for a tablet that is not too expensive 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.110
 So of course lte cat 4 will be synonymous 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.840
 supports that means one can also 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.430
 on the way well with the device in the net 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.310
 I'm frank from android next 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.579
 that was the mediapad m1 from war to the 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.579
 next
