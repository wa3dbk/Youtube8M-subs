00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.519
 I wanted to show how I'm doing this 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.690
 golden make-up day at the option 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.740
 the help of the palette from the railway. 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:22.500
 she is called luis palletochka lace 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.050
 This is such an interesting palette . 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.779
 I will turn over so that the mirror was not for you 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.250
 I can see such a palette here they are me 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.189

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.570
 blog, I will leave a reference at the bottom 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.090
 look at all the swatches everything will be 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.300
 The palette is not bad in principle for this 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.610
 Makeup will use two shades of 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.440
 top row for you now 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.940
 the bottom is matte shades for creases i 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.090
 I will use this matt 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.039
 brown tint and moving eyelid 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.320
 golden hue with a chimera 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.270
 very beautiful shining color if you 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.010
 I wonder how I did this makeup 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.659
 then stay with me and continue 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:11.250
 look so let's start our makeup and i already 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.170

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.210

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.200
 number 53 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.810
 I also already designed eyebrows or now I 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.659
 I make out eyebrows with the help of shadows for 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.509
 eyebrows I found a city of shadow from us and from 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.950
 hordes of code searched and this is in my 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:50.560
 shade 5 am eyebrow one eye i 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.610
 already made up and now we will paint 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.610
 and grade 2 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.149
 That kind of makeup we should get 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.329
 and in the second pose and for the beginning I will put 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:07.200
 sinus shadow today this vase from lumene 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:10.860
 and I want to finish and buy as soon as possible 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.830
 new base because it is not for me 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.340
 I like to watch the church 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.340
 finger on our base 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 we are all moving eyelid off 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:40.790
 handles vobo 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:46.849
 so the next thing i do under 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:49.879
 eyebrow and put a shade of shade this one 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:54.970
 the lightest matt shade I 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:03:00.250
 I will put his queen our brow under the brow and 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.250
 on the inner corner of the eye 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:09.140
 I do it to him a little bit 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:13.599
 brighten up because let's go together 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:16.730
 I misfire shoes can handle and 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.870
 I am completely flowing with a shaft 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.870
 eyelid and children 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.320
 so the next stage 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:33.680
 I take just such a brush for green 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:36.800
 convenient until I write and brush and choose 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.800
 second shade 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.830
 this one is a little over shadow and matt 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:50.340
 I will apply it 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:53.490
 the fold there is this first such headlight 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.569
 methyl layer of our folds a little bit 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.170
 elevating the century 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.909
 and a formal place where they will later 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.909
 go to a darker shade 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.200
 designed a little bit of our crease 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.490
 now i take 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.320
 plain flat paint brush 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:19.950
 of shadows and take from this palette this one 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.490
 golden shade very beautiful color 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.390
 beautiful multiples of color i will put it on 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.390
 movable eyelid 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:38.460
 looking to the inside corner and you don't 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:44.039
 Prick higher color I will not pour 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:46.139
 on all the little fold and bring 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.780
 the lower lash line I will start with 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:52.560
 bottom lash line I will take such 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:05:01.190
 same brush but which I let down 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:01.190
 century and from this palette I will choose this one 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.540
 when I didn't think that makeup was hard 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.540
 take off 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.780
 a little mascara of it that we didn't look 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.780
 too dark 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.110
 closer to the inner corner try 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.110
 reduce color to almost no 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:40.319
 and introduce a little outer corner 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:43.400
 only on the fold area of â€‹â€‹the eyelids and slightly 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.400
 add 100 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.200
 now I take the brush that I jumped 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.900
 tab 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.160
 gain dark brown little bodies 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:06:00.810
 shake off the excess began to crumble 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:05.330
 completely you forever then not very 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.330
 neatly so as not to overdo it 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.880
 I will connect the cilia and reward them 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:30.509

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:35.880
 long time ago 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:39.050
 This is now the most favorite mascara probably 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.050
