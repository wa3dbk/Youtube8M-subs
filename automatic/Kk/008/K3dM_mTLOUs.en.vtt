00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.400
 nice guys here was sher talking to you 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.799
 and today I came back with this new one 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.600
 video is just as you have already understood 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.340
 today I bring you a double nuclear discar 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.140
 then I apologize if this gameplay is a 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.650
 other double nuclear made on red pero 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.750
 that is, he came to me and so I preferred 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.810
 load it which is also a double light 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.340
 quite fast as the first one 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.070
 nuclear was done roughly in 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.710
 three minutes and 10 seconds while the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.070
 second, it seems to me in two minutes 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.309
 so I think it can be enjoyable from 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.690
 see here everything here then there 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.550
 introduce the gameplay for a moment 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.980
 just as you have understood a double 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.930
 nuclear to be the class that was 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.149
 using it was precisely the oscar with 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.420
 e. adjustable quick kick e 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.789
 quick charger it should be 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.410
 now as you will already have understood I use su 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.940
 all assault rifles extraction 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.010
 quick and adjustable kick this is one 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.740
 which I said in the video where 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.540
 I showed you my classes though 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.700
 I would like to re-recommend this to you 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.860
 ie used rapid extraction and calcium is 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.140
 adjustable just about all on all 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.909
 assault rifles because they are two 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.240
 really useful accessories just you 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.850
 speed up the gameplay they improve 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.189
 the way to play ie try them e 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.470
 see that something will definitely come out 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.110
 of good however another thing that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.689
 I wanted to tell you that is not to all but to 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.299
 some people these are gameplay 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.040
 played in veteran is not domain 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.140
 recruit because some people 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.540
 basically I came to say below 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.079
 gameplay on veteran rusher 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.409
 ie masciotti joined toe connection 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:52.110
 that is to say uphold veteran , that is, one kills yes 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.280
 kill enemies with 12 hits and their own 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.780
 the mode that so then that is then 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.670
 if I have to tell the truth I have one 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.340
 fairly good average connection 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.700
 because I have a 10 megan although less 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.350
 arrive about 8 or so 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.629
 play pretty good because exactly 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.950
 also internet play only what kind for 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.440
 uploading videos is a bit shy because 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.450
 just a 5 minute video takes me a 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.250
 oretta approximately to load it then 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.410
 precisely to upload videos probably 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.360
 a connection de crap and therefore nothing 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.709
 so okay i hope this is you 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.180
 may like it because even enough 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.970
 fast and this I have already said nothing 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.450
 however something else like Thursday 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.459
 last so Thursday 8 I made the open 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.530
 lobby and I have to say what really went 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.200
 well because practically the lobby was 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.380
 full ie 18 people 18 seats all 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.940
 occupied is another thing I apologize to 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.940
 people that I didn't invite 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.470
 because practically after it's over 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.870
 the open lobby I found myself with others 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.880
 40 messages from people I should have 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.519
 invite me to apologize to these people 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.709
 because precisely that is maybe them 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.420
 they kept coming to this lobby though 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.810
 I didn't invite her and I apologize because 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.599
 unfortunately there are only 18 places it is not 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.610
 a thing that I decide that is if it were 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.329
 it was for me I would have invited 100 as well 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.440
 so people go well I tell you maybe 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:21.730
 in the future blacks will do others of the hobby 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.310
 however here already the first nuclear is 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.790
 arrived I will do some other gun street 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.489
 I think like 34 35 kills in a row then 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.200
 I will die like a peracotaro but does nothing 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.769
 the important thing I did twice 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.590
 core this match and old type of 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.109
 a month ago I was playing in 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.959
 group of three or four I do not remember that is 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.280
 or my own short memory I don't remember 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.799
 matches made a month ago 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.750
 okay it's normal apart from that since 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.120
 I don't have many things to tell you today, Fr. 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.609
 I remind you it is already so to pass on 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.970
 facebook page because we say that a 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:02.170
 fastest way to stay in touch 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.810
 however the series just started here 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.910
 of the second nucleus I cut the part 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.470
 in which the part of the medium precisely so 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.730
 you will not see the middle part here 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.500
 another thing I was playing against a 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.139
 I think it is a group of just six people 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.299
 that is the worst group ever on call 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.350
 of duty you are made to do a double 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.720
 nuclear against oh well 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.700
 however, this is really something I don't know today 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.190
 just what to tell you the things that precisely 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.450
 I had to tell you another veil 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.760
 another thing we say that in 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.130
 this last period ie we say these 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.370
 days here is not that much a desire to 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.930
 making videos that is not making videos 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.170
 the fact is that I don't want too much 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.060
 to put myself here is to comment on them video 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.860
 so if you see that in this period 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.560
 will be a little active the reason is this 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.760
 however, I know it is a period 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.560
 passenger in fact already in the past are 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.520
 been active in certain periods because 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.050
 just 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.390
 let's say that sometimes it happens to me 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.710
 to lose a bit of desire, however, I repeat is a 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.050
 therefore, passenger period 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.710
 do not worry if you see that I will be active 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.510
 and always a passing time here but 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.850
 I think video I think I said it all 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.160
 what I had to say then though 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:18.030
 the gameplay is not finished or I greet you 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:21.960
 meanwhile, precisely because it is nothing else 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.330
 to say sorry for the seeds in paul ii e 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.130
 oh well as usual, I invite you to 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.580
 let me like if this video if 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.070
 you liked this gameplay 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.290
 comment with what you want to pass 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.870

 you did leverage tv i like it 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.560
 put it back okay I'm kidding 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.060
 anyway here all the things I have to do 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.010
