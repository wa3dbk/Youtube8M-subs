sure<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.560> it's<00:02:14.040> definitely<00:02:14.550> definitely<00:02:16.790> very

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
sure and it's definitely definitely very

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.559 
sure and it's definitely definitely very
comparable<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:19.459> african-american<00:02:20.569> relaxed

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
comparable to african-american relaxed

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.380 
comparable to african-american relaxed
hair<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.530> I'm<00:02:22.980> definitely<00:02:23.519> thinking<00:02:24.209> about

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
hair so I'm definitely thinking about

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.830 
hair so I'm definitely thinking about
gwanghae<00:02:24.950> investing<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.970> texture<00:02:27.629> this

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
gwanghae investing in this texture this

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.990 
gwanghae investing in this texture this
is<00:02:27.989> really<00:02:28.290> thick<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.099> be<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.879> know

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
is really thick for this to be you know

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.770 
is really thick for this to be you know
just<00:02:30.299> this<00:02:30.569> much<00:02:30.870> probably<00:02:31.799> let's<00:02:32.459> see<00:02:32.780> two

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
just this much probably let's see two

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.000 
just this much probably let's see two
inches<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:35.220> bundle<00:02:36.230> no<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:37.530> more<00:02:37.709> than<00:02:37.769> two

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
inches of a bundle no it's more than two

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.330 
inches of a bundle no it's more than two
inches<00:02:38.250> say<00:02:38.940> about<00:02:39.090> four<00:02:39.390> or<00:02:39.660> five<00:02:39.930> inches<00:02:40.650> of

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
inches say about four or five inches of

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.610 
inches say about four or five inches of
a<00:02:41.430> bundle<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.870> how<00:02:43.019> thick<00:02:43.349> it<00:02:43.590> is

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
a bundle and this is how thick it is

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.920 
a bundle and this is how thick it is
here<00:02:44.129> so<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.400> can<00:02:44.519> only<00:02:44.790> imagine<00:02:45.090> how<00:02:45.569> thick<00:02:45.780> it

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
here so I can only imagine how thick it

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.839 
here so I can only imagine how thick it
would<00:02:46.019> be<00:02:46.170> if<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.560> was<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.099> receive<00:02:47.430> two<00:02:47.700> or

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
would be if I was to receive two or

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.180 
would be if I was to receive two or
three<00:02:48.000> bundles<00:02:48.269> so<00:02:49.019> this<00:02:49.410> looks<00:02:49.590> like<00:02:49.829> this<00:02:50.069> is

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
three bundles so this looks like this is

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.500 
three bundles so this looks like this is
probably<00:02:50.989> 16<00:02:51.989> or<00:02:52.140> 18<00:02:52.319> limp<00:02:52.910> here<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.150> what<00:02:54.390> the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
probably 16 or 18 limp here is what the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.680 
probably 16 or 18 limp here is what the
ends<00:02:54.840> are<00:02:54.930> looking<00:02:55.230> like<00:02:55.410> nice<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.250> trimmed

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
ends are looking like nice and trimmed

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.690 
ends are looking like nice and trimmed
really<00:02:57.690> pretty<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.319> yes<00:02:58.620> I'm<00:02:59.310> definitely
