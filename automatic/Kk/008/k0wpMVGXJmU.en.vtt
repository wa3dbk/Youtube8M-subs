that's<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:03.470> synapse<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:05.060> junction<00:00:06.060> between

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
that's a synapse is a junction between

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:18.050 
that's a synapse is a junction between
two<00:00:07.170> neurons<00:00:16.310> let's<00:00:17.310> take<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> look<00:00:17.789> at<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
two neurons let's take a look at the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.790 
two neurons let's take a look at the
anatomy<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.690> synapse<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.230> did<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
anatomy of a synapse you did this in a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.790 
anatomy of a synapse you did this in a
manner<00:00:19.980> but<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.430> good<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.670> review<00:00:21.500> if<00:00:22.500> we

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
manner but it's good to review if we

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.580 
manner but it's good to review if we
look<00:00:23.160> at<00:00:23.340> those<00:00:23.490> synaptic<00:00:24.330> knobs<00:00:24.600> or<00:00:25.320> at<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
look at those synaptic knobs or at the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.849 
look at those synaptic knobs or at the
ends<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> telemetry<00:00:27.199> we<00:00:28.199> find<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
ends of the telemetry we find that the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.540 
ends of the telemetry we find that the
synaptic<00:00:29.429> knobs<00:00:29.699> don't<00:00:30.240> actually<00:00:30.510> touch<00:00:31.550> post

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
synaptic knobs don't actually touch post

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.660 
synaptic knobs don't actually touch post
synaptic<00:00:33.510> membrane<00:00:34.309> they<00:00:35.309> don't<00:00:35.489> actually

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
synaptic membrane they don't actually

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.930 
synaptic membrane they don't actually
touch<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.360> next<00:00:36.809> cell<00:00:37.290> there<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> space

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
touch that next cell there is a space

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.130 
touch that next cell there is a space
between<00:00:39.300> them

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
between them

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.060 
between them
call<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.010> synaptic<00:00:41.520> cleft<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
call the synaptic cleft and this is the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.990 
call the synaptic cleft and this is the
synaptic<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:45.289> inside<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.559> synaptic<00:00:47.129> knob<00:00:47.370> we

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
synaptic but inside the synaptic knob we

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.930 
synaptic but inside the synaptic knob we
find<00:00:48.329> lots<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.050> lots<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.440> synaptic<00:00:49.950> vesicles

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
find lots and lots of synaptic vesicles

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.850 
find lots and lots of synaptic vesicles
and<00:00:51.870> those<00:00:52.800> vesicles<00:00:53.370> contain<00:00:53.850> neuro

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
and those vesicles contain neuro

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.220 
and those vesicles contain neuro
transmitters<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> synaptic<00:00:58.050> knob

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
transmitters and so in the synaptic knob

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.110 
transmitters and so in the synaptic knob
lots<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.399> vesicles<00:00:59.969> with<00:01:00.210> neurotransmitters

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
lots of vesicles with neurotransmitters

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.939 
lots of vesicles with neurotransmitters
because<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.449> process<00:01:03.989> requires<00:01:04.140> lots<00:01:04.739> of

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
because this process requires lots of

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.850 
because this process requires lots of
energy<00:01:05.070> not<00:01:05.970> surprisingly<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.990> find<00:01:07.260> lots<00:01:07.560> of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
energy not surprisingly we find lots of

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.820 
energy not surprisingly we find lots of
mitochondria<00:01:08.869> makes<00:01:09.869> sense<00:01:10.080> right<00:01:10.409> lots<00:01:10.710> and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
mitochondria makes sense right lots and

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.380 
mitochondria makes sense right lots and
lots<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.159> mitochondria<00:01:13.580> on<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.820> postsynaptic

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
lots of mitochondria on the postsynaptic

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.070 
lots of mitochondria on the postsynaptic
membrane<00:01:16.700> there<00:01:17.700> are<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.180> receptors

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
membrane there are going to be receptors

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.530 
membrane there are going to be receptors
for<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.180> neurotransmitters<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.210> are

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
for the neurotransmitters that are

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.980 
for the neurotransmitters that are
released<00:01:21.960> from<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> synaptic<00:01:23.159> knob<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:24.869> we're

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
released from the synaptic knob so we're

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.120 
released from the synaptic knob so we're
going<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.290> receptors<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.979> that

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
going to have receptors on that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.290 
going to have receptors on that
postsynaptic<00:01:27.030> membrane

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.810 

if<00:01:33.300> we<00:01:33.570> look<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.080> how<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.710> synapse<00:01:35.220> functions

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
if we look in how a synapse functions

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.460 
if we look in how a synapse functions
how<00:01:36.120> this<00:01:36.420> works<00:01:37.610> we<00:01:38.610> find<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.470> an

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
how this works we find that an

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.180 
how this works we find that an
electrical<00:01:41.010> impulse<00:01:41.160> comes<00:01:41.880> down<00:01:42.500> that<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
electrical impulse comes down that the

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.230 
electrical impulse comes down that the
presynaptic<00:01:45.030> tunnel<00:01:46.250> but<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.400> impulse<00:01:47.700> can't

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
presynaptic tunnel but the impulse can't

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.080 
presynaptic tunnel but the impulse can't
cross<00:01:48.690> to<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.260> next<00:01:49.650> neuron<00:01:50.070> because<00:01:50.760> of<00:01:50.940> that

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
cross to the next neuron because of that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.880 
cross to the next neuron because of that
collect<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:52.770> space<00:01:53.100> means<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.640> can't<00:01:53.880> cross

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
collect the space means it can't cross

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.010 
collect the space means it can't cross
so<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.700> impulse<00:01:57.180> comes<00:01:57.510> into<00:01:57.840> that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
so as that impulse comes into that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.609 
so as that impulse comes into that
presynaptic<00:01:58.979> membrane<00:01:59.910> area<00:02:00.690> that<00:02:01.050> synaptic

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
presynaptic membrane area that synaptic

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.550 
presynaptic membrane area that synaptic
knob<00:02:01.830> it<00:02:02.670> turns<00:02:03.030> out<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.660> action

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
knob it turns out that that action

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.249 
knob it turns out that that action
potential<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.910> willing<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.450> open<00:02:06.840> up<00:02:06.990> some

gates<00:02:07.590> for<00:02:08.070> calcium<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.259> some<00:02:10.560> channels

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
gates for calcium and so some channels

at<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.239> point<00:03:15.480> it's<00:03:15.690> called<00:03:15.900> how<00:03:16.170> modular

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
at this point it's called how modular

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.280 
at this point it's called how modular
we'll<00:03:17.519> get<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.820> that<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:18.239> little<00:03:18.450> bit<00:03:18.690> later<00:03:18.959> we

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
we'll get to that a little bit later we

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.490 
we'll get to that a little bit later we
get<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.709> endocrine<00:03:20.010> system

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
get to the endocrine system

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.140 
get to the endocrine system
so<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.890> counselors<00:03:21.310> can<00:03:21.430> activate<00:03:21.940> this

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
so the counselors can activate this

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.770 
so the counselors can activate this
calmodulin<00:03:23.140> which<00:03:23.740> actually<00:03:24.190> does<00:03:24.400> the

calmodulin which actually does the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.090 
calmodulin which actually does the
activation<00:03:25.780> of<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.930> protein<00:03:26.350> kinase<00:03:26.710> for<00:03:26.980> now

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
receptors in this case the receptor is

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.730 
receptors in this case the receptor is
also<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:29.890> sodium<00:04:30.669> channel<00:04:31.200> it's<00:04:32.200> also<00:04:32.410> the

also the sodium channel it's also the
sodium<00:04:33.130> channel<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.760> it's<00:04:34.270> going<00:04:34.450> to<00:04:34.600> allow

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
sodium channel and it's going to allow

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.010 
sodium channel and it's going to allow
sodium<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:36.100> move<00:04:36.970> to<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.270> inside<00:04:37.390> so<00:04:37.870> the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
sodium to move to the inside so the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.290 
sodium to move to the inside so the
binding<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:39.310> transmitter<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:40.000> the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
chain to the receptor opens the channel

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.170

there's<00:04:46.210> another<00:04:46.810> way<00:04:47.169> that<00:04:48.030> receptors<00:04:49.030> in

there's another way that receptors in
that<00:04:49.300> most<00:04:49.510> synaptic<00:04:49.990> membrane<00:04:50.140> can<00:04:50.620> work<00:04:51.660> it

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
that most synaptic membrane can work it

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.000 
that most synaptic membrane can work it
turns<00:04:52.990> out<00:04:53.220> that<00:04:54.220> sometimes<00:04:55.169> the<00:04:56.169> receptor<00:04:56.770> is

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
turns out that sometimes the receptor is

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.750 
turns out that sometimes the receptor is
not<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.880> channel<00:04:58.740> so<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.919> neurotransmitter

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
not the channel so the neurotransmitter

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.780 
not the channel so the neurotransmitter
binds<00:05:01.419> to<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:01.930> receptor<00:05:02.560> there<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.520> showing

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
binds to the receptor there the showing

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.150 
binds to the receptor there the showing
that<00:05:03.820> binds<00:05:04.330> to<00:05:04.390> the<00:05:04.479> receptor<00:05:04.960> when<00:05:05.770> it<00:05:05.890> binds

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
that binds to the receptor when it binds

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.159 
that binds to the receptor when it binds
to<00:05:06.370> that<00:05:06.520> receptor<00:05:06.700> and<00:05:07.360> causes<00:05:07.390> the<00:05:08.020> release

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
to that receptor and causes the release

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.560 
to that receptor and causes the release
of<00:05:08.590> some<00:05:08.830> special<00:05:09.250> proteins<00:05:10.000> that<00:05:10.210> we<00:05:10.330> call

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
of some special proteins that we call

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.340 
of some special proteins that we call
the<00:05:11.169> G<00:05:11.530> proteins<00:05:12.100> and<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:13.300> G<00:05:13.570> proteins<00:05:14.140> will

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
the G proteins and the G proteins will

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.290 
the G proteins and the G proteins will
move<00:05:14.560> through<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:14.950> membrane<00:05:15.370> and<00:05:15.669> Moblin

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
move through the membrane and Moblin

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.750 
move through the membrane and Moblin
a<00:05:16.510> channel<00:05:17.080> okay<00:05:17.890> so<00:05:17.950> this<00:05:18.190> is<00:05:18.340> kind<00:05:18.580> of<00:05:18.640> an

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
a channel okay so this is kind of an

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
a channel okay so this is kind of an
indirect<00:05:19.800> way<00:05:20.800> that<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.190> neuro

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
indirect way that the neuro

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.920 
indirect way that the neuro
can<00:05:22.780> work<00:05:22.990> so<00:05:23.949> two<00:05:24.490> different<00:05:24.639> weights

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
can work so two different weights

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.969 
can work so two different weights
sometimes<00:05:25.930> a<00:05:26.050> neurotransmitter<00:05:26.379> binds

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
sometimes a neurotransmitter binds

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.640 
sometimes a neurotransmitter binds
directly<00:05:27.550> to<00:05:27.759> the<00:05:27.969> receptor<00:05:28.719> which<00:05:28.900> is<00:05:29.139> on<00:05:29.469> the

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
directly to the receptor which is on the

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.950 
directly to the receptor which is on the
channel<00:05:30.039> and<00:05:30.219> opens<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.639> channel<00:05:30.960> sometimes

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
channel and opens the channel sometimes

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.860 
channel and opens the channel sometimes
the<00:05:32.379> neurotransmitter<00:05:33.069> binds<00:05:33.430> to<00:05:33.699> receptor

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
the neurotransmitter binds to receptor

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.379 
the neurotransmitter binds to receptor
that<00:05:34.870> has<00:05:35.110> to<00:05:35.349> release<00:05:35.560> G<00:05:35.949> proteins<00:05:36.520> which

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
that has to release G proteins which

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.659 
that has to release G proteins which
will<00:05:37.599> move<00:05:37.810> to<00:05:38.319> other<00:05:38.349> areas<00:05:38.860> in<00:05:39.039> the<00:05:39.219> membrane

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
will move to other areas in the membrane

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.810 
will move to other areas in the membrane
and<00:05:39.909> open<00:05:40.360> the<00:05:40.449> channel
