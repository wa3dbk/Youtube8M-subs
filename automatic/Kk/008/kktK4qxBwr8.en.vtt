00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.320
 now the ACM wants a vocally I'm unlearned Marcel from the Canaries and 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.639
 A video of me on the channel did not spread any politics 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.690
 yes, I have just noticed in Russia that will deliver 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.590
 The Ipex Transformer bought that was just scared in a lament and 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.449
 Apparent Gassers Drag Attack too 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.749
 Unfortunately, I have to be able to do it shortly after that, not just her 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:25.909
 time on Boxing Day 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:29.109
 Of course you can already see I have to do that once before 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.739
 make sure it works 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:31.820
 APA, well 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.970
 Nevertheless, Kurt Cobain gets the spot on the spot 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.120
 but in front 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.860
 the pad transformers 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.440
 if the food is Hanni Chancellor for the this key thus all three 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.590
 Points with are oblivious to three points 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.629
 From this Lugowski Phone 7 goes to the Transformer 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.800
 the on the coach of Michael Koch the outline characters out 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.140
 that the airfield is located 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.120
 The tattoo did not agree with that 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.680
 So no envelope has 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.820
 that means effortlessly @ effort 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.380
 and for that I got away with everything if Germany 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.440
 later perhaps he will be even if you also points before 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.980
 yes, here around the Transformers have to turn on the lights around a lit Euro 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.550
 in the hand 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.540
 Describe dapd in the city 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.040
 I am because what I mean it shines since it benefits so well here 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.920
 and that helped after it was already highlighted to buy 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.990
 the Dutch continue 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.240
 the rest of Tom Hooper Vidic or 2 an assist 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.150
 it must be the streets al-Qaida 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.100
 and whether gaza city 13 millimeters 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.100
 still popular in August 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.820
 Here also new EA can be excellently exciting 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.430
 again 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.570
 Third comes here 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.660
 Model name MoMA here again point what in Russian what you 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.659
 personal can no longer afford 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.119
 the chamber 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.490
 Unister online project jubilo the Alpina also brought that perfectly 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.190
 not binding 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.780
 and to the actual while in the device 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.300
 What say Volkmann al-Qaeda said 1 gold with 1 March 2000 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.630
 I did not do it because somehow there was Android for me 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.360
 France even have on the iPhone but maybe I'm getting there as well 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.029
 times 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:15.359
 before and on and around 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.980
 As I said before, that's why that's not really the case 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:19.959
 17 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.949
 Well me the Transformer 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:25.129
 Koblenz right at the front is about every time show what the cinema has 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.330
 had been first with Yum century 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.130
 I think the Masurians have drifted 78 degrees sideways 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.680
 and the driving crimes 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.119
 almost not at all 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.459
 Battery life up to the ninth hours 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.259
 that was amazing 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.659
 Hero multitabs with ten fingers 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.869
 Here you can listen to Hoffmann's appearance and it is 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:50.569
 supposedly lighter 680 grams I'm not that easy now but it's quite 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:51.279
 Well 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:53.229
 so consciously delays itself 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:55.419
 and here we are Annika and 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.839
 the russian side what is still in it 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:00.089
 core idea 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:02.589
 here it is cold 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:04.060
 then I see it here so well 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.010
 open this specifically because I believe not yet seen unfortunately everything 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.329
 rosy so perfect makeup not serious 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.909
 I promise you that I will be my mother and 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.389
 so from 8 5 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.369
 the habitat 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.259
 that fall over and over again 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.259
 before it was even more ridiculous five cameras show 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.709
 to take the angle to Transformer 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.779
 by the way also Norma both girls percent like we follow on the 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:29.949
 Canadian 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:33.309
 Although yes, you can look forward then interested 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:36.879
 here the cable seems to be very big i think maybe 75 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.549
 Centimeter the right outside and here then have on the adapter 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.229
 to charge I am very glad that it is such an adapter and here with 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.229
 Plug that means I have to cook on it now 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.369
 the stamp on 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:53.609
 Flotow is nothing I can say that 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.609
 okay the Transformer was nice from the previous years 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:59.519
 but for that 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.519
 I use the packaging as he benefits 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.599
 and basically only difficult 

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:11.499
 unfortunately already expired but that does not matter 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:15.709
 up here with the camera have something great feeling mega pixels do not believe 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.590
 maybe one point three maybe 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.009
 but not more 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.099
 but here may be so 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.169
 Exactly but of course a million 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.349
 and some love 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.960
 here are the two connections 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.160
 for the dock and here then Dr. Vice President who for me is like the 30's 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.169
 Connector pleased 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.279
 Marc Heinrich Peters Heuchera time allowed runs quietly strength and here 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:37.599
 make a monkey 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.069
 on the other pages, yes, yes 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:43.219
 he rose ball cards verdeelt usual the 16-gigabyte variant 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.690
 because I think the 32-gb variant is not worth it 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.590
 FCK Toronto can cost up to 32 gigabytes of a 16 gigabyte 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.219
 maybe 20 euros 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.909
 instead of wondering about 20 euros, the second striker was more 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.580
 so to speak 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.120
 because here Meniar pandemic and held Reckmann 5 millimeters Kinkel and here 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.190
 one more page 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.290
 according to the spokesman he does not never Nico of exactly 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:12.339
 in the back we have plastic but very well processed I have to say and it will 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:14.520
 even warned ext4 I say 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.889
 and our carbon 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.620
 Jakob Loth returns 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.500
 very nice and can not believe 3 mega pixels can or five megapixel Dominik 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.960
 I'm sure 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.650
 very susceptible to the earth satellite and 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.330
 Let's have a good look 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.189
 on the Android 3 points clock 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:34.460
 is still three points 1 3 point 1 the application I have the thing of 

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.020
 use Bilan of the same name 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.509
 yes that the 40th 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.520
 as I said a video will follow in the next few days I guess 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.110
 instead of today it was deepening that on Monday I think I came today 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.029
 is Monday 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:49.839
 All this the video will do all the time 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:53.249
 Thursday or Friday can record directly 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:57.179
 yes send here so uploaded okay we'll see you then with the 

00:05:57.179 --> 00:05:58.319
 next million and FÃ¼rth
