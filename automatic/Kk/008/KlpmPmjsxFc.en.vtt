00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
this Phoenix so basically people had

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.110 
this Phoenix so basically people had
some<00:00:33.899> questions<00:00:34.579> I'm<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:35.760> going<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.910> start

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
some questions I'm just going to start

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.930 
some questions I'm just going to start
with<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> size<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> cage<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.940> 60

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
with the size of the cage this is a 60

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.920 
with the size of the cage this is a 60
gallon<00:00:39.329> terrarium<00:00:40.219> not<00:00:41.219> an<00:00:41.340> aquarium<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.750> it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
gallon terrarium not an aquarium so it

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.450 
gallon terrarium not an aquarium so it
has<00:00:43.050> more<00:00:43.260> floor<00:00:43.530> space<00:00:43.559> than<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.309> does

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
has more floor space than it does

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.110 
has more floor space than it does
vertical<00:00:45.920> it's<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> fairly<00:00:47.250> large<00:00:47.460> tank<00:00:47.910> I

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
vertical it's a fairly large tank I

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.950 
vertical it's a fairly large tank I
believe<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.600> five<00:00:49.440> feet<00:00:50.070> long<00:00:50.129> by<00:00:50.879> two<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.899> a

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
believe it's five feet long by two and a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.790 
believe it's five feet long by two and a
half<00:00:52.079> feet<00:00:52.230> deep<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.920> remember<00:00:53.160> correctly

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
half feet deep if I remember correctly

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.990 
half feet deep if I remember correctly
for<00:00:55.800> substrate<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.520> personally<00:00:57.390> use<00:00:57.629> sand

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
for substrate I personally use sand

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.790 
for substrate I personally use sand
you'll<00:01:00.000> see<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> lot<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.629> places<00:01:00.899> not<00:01:01.289> recommend

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
you'll see a lot of places not recommend

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.770 
you'll see a lot of places not recommend
it<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.100> personally<00:01:02.850> don't<00:01:03.059> recommend<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.600> it's

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
it I personally don't recommend it it's

a<00:01:03.930> pain<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> butt<00:01:04.920> but<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.119> look

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
a pain in the butt but I like the look

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.850 
a pain in the butt but I like the look
of<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.600> because<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.080> liked<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.439> bit<00:01:07.619> more

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
of it because I liked a little bit more

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.820 
of it because I liked a little bit more
natural<00:01:08.010> looking<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:10.080> take<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> time<00:01:10.650> and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
natural looking and I take the time and

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.740 
natural looking and I take the time and
I<00:01:10.920> try<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.580> spot<00:01:11.850> clean<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.210> every<00:01:12.420> day<00:01:12.570> and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
I try to spot clean it every day and

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.390 
I try to spot clean it every day and
then<00:01:12.900> once<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.470> month<00:01:13.650> I'll<00:01:13.860> actually<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.369> a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
then once a month I'll actually do a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.030 
then once a month I'll actually do a
take<00:01:15.299> out<00:01:15.450> most<00:01:15.630> majority<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.380> basically<00:01:16.830> all

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
take out most majority of basically all

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:27.649 
take out most majority of basically all
the<00:01:17.189> sand<00:01:25.220> as<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.670> mixture<00:01:27.000> just<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.360> add<00:01:27.479> some

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the sand as a mixture just to add some

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.789 
the sand as a mixture just to add some
more<00:01:27.780> color<00:01:28.020> into<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.380> otherwise<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.770> just

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
more color into it otherwise you just

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.280 
more color into it otherwise you just
get<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.220> brown<00:01:29.970> boring<00:01:30.509> sand<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.049> add<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
get like a brown boring sand I add a

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.080 
get like a brown boring sand I add a
little<00:01:31.619> bit<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> pink<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.520> purple<00:01:32.939> rep

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
little bit of the pink of the purple rep

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.440 
little bit of the pink of the purple rep
to<00:01:33.240> Center<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> purple<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> red<00:01:34.350> rep<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.189> San

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
to Center and a purple to red rep to San

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.090 
to Center and a purple to red rep to San
notices<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.570> Vitus<00:01:36.960> sand<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:37.619> Vitus<00:01:37.920> and

notices on Vitus sand because Vitus and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.980 
notices on Vitus sand because Vitus and
has<00:01:38.280> calcium<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.000> they'll<00:01:39.119> they'll<00:01:39.659> lick<00:01:39.869> it

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
has calcium and they'll they'll lick it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.530 
has calcium and they'll they'll lick it
up<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.530> cause<00:01:40.740> impact<00:01:41.100> ation<00:01:41.540> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
up and that can cause impact ation a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.010 
up and that can cause impact ation a
couple<00:01:43.350> theories<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.860> sand<00:01:44.369> looking<00:01:44.759> up

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
couple theories on sand looking up

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.149 
couple theories on sand looking up
sometimes<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.229> dragon<00:01:46.560> misses<00:01:46.860> yes<00:01:47.009> it

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
sometimes when the dragon misses yes it

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.200 
sometimes when the dragon misses yes it
will<00:01:47.250> get<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> little<00:01:47.520> bit<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.790> sand<00:01:48.030> but

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
will get a little bit of sand but

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.749 
will get a little bit of sand but
actually<00:01:48.860> little<00:01:49.860> quantities<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.610> sand

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
actually little quantities of sand

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.580 
actually little quantities of sand
little<00:01:51.240> quantities<00:01:51.689> can<00:01:51.840> say<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.079> aid<00:01:52.409> in

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
little quantities can say I can aid in

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.800 
little quantities can say I can aid in
digestion<00:01:53.009> which<00:01:53.909> help<00:01:54.090> grind<00:01:54.360> up<00:01:54.509> stuff<00:01:54.689> in

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
digestion which help grind up stuff in

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.130 
digestion which help grind up stuff in
the<00:01:54.869> intestines<00:01:56.479> basically<00:01:57.479> over<00:01:57.689> here<00:01:57.899> on

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
the intestines basically over here on

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.190 
the intestines basically over here on
this<00:01:58.290> side<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:58.979> cool<00:01:59.460> side<00:01:59.930> only<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.170> I

put a rocket lettuce in rocket lettuce

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.990 
put a rocket lettuce in rocket lettuce
is<00:02:17.780> something<00:02:17.990> that<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.200> can<00:02:18.350> get<00:02:18.530> at<00:02:19.000> fresh

and easy if you have it in your local
area

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
area

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.930 
area
it<00:02:22.460> is<00:02:23.180> very<00:02:23.570> nutritious<00:02:23.990> a<00:02:24.440> little<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.340> lot

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
it is very nutritious a little a lot

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.580 
it is very nutritious a little a lot
better<00:02:26.180> than<00:02:26.450> spring<00:02:26.900> mix<00:02:27.080> because<00:02:27.350> spring

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
better than spring mix because spring

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.530 
better than spring mix because spring
mix<00:02:27.770> actually<00:02:28.010> yes<00:02:28.850> it's<00:02:29.060> good

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
mix actually yes it's good

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.180 
mix actually yes it's good
but<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.900> has<00:02:30.020> baby<00:02:30.290> spinach<00:02:30.800> in<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.070> which

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
but it has baby spinach in it which

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.380 
but it has baby spinach in it which
gives<00:02:31.370> them<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.580> little<00:02:31.760> bit<00:02:31.850> too<00:02:31.970> much<00:02:32.090> protein

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
gives them a little bit too much protein

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.699 
gives them a little bit too much protein
so<00:02:33.230> which<00:02:33.860> isn't<00:02:34.280> bad<00:02:34.520> for<00:02:35.440> for<00:02:36.440> bearded

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
so which isn't bad for for bearded

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:37.810 
so which isn't bad for for bearded
dragons<00:02:37.010> because<00:02:37.100> they<00:02:37.280> do<00:02:37.340> need<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.700> when

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
dragons because they do need it when

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.820 
dragons because they do need it when
they're<00:02:37.940> younger<00:02:38.209> but<00:02:38.510> as<00:02:38.690> they<00:02:39.290> get<00:02:39.440> older

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
they're younger but as they get older

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.960 
they're younger but as they get older
that<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:40.040> kinda<00:02:40.459> need<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.640> get<00:02:40.730> away<00:02:40.820> from

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
that you kinda need to get away from

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.760 
that you kinda need to get away from
that<00:02:41.209> giving<00:02:41.600> more<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.870> darker<00:02:42.230> greens<00:02:42.500> a

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
that giving more of the darker greens a

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.800 
that giving more of the darker greens a
rocket<00:02:43.490> lettuce<00:02:43.670> has<00:02:43.820> all<00:02:44.090> dark<00:02:44.540> greens

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
rocket lettuce has all dark greens

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.000 
rocket lettuce has all dark greens
doesn't<00:02:45.110> have<00:02:45.200> anything<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.739> doesn't<00:02:45.860> have

any romaine or anything like that

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.880 
any romaine or anything like that
over<00:02:49.730> here<00:02:50.180> I<00:02:50.330> have<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.930> very<00:02:51.350> large<00:02:51.560> piece<00:02:51.860> of

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
over here I have a very large piece of

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.680 
over here I have a very large piece of
grape<00:02:52.250> vine<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:52.730> what<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:53.060> does<00:02:53.300> is<00:02:53.540> it

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
grape vine and what this does is it

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.540 
grape vine and what this does is it
allows<00:02:53.720> them<00:02:54.140> something<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.470> climb<00:02:54.739> on<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.190> it

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
allows them something to climb on and it

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.220 
allows them something to climb on and it
also<00:02:55.700> gives<00:02:56.030> them<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.239> chance<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.630> elevate<00:02:57.080> as

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
also gives them a chance to elevate as

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.810 
also gives them a chance to elevate as
he<00:02:57.530> needs<00:02:57.739> to<00:02:57.860> go<00:02:57.980> on<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.370> get<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.670> heat

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
he needs to go on to get to the heat

he needs to go on to get to the heat
lamps<00:02:59.180> over<00:02:59.330> here<00:02:59.870> we<00:02:59.959> have<00:03:00.050> 150<00:03:00.680> watt<00:03:00.920> just<00:03:01.250> a

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
lamps over here we have 150 watt just a

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.310 
lamps over here we have 150 watt just a
normal<00:03:01.670> spot<00:03:02.000> heat<00:03:02.270> lamp<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.720> then<00:03:03.110> we<00:03:03.200> have<00:03:03.290> a

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
normal spot heat lamp and then we have a

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.440 
normal spot heat lamp and then we have a
UVB<00:03:03.800> light<00:03:04.040> too<00:03:04.370> which<00:03:05.000> gives<00:03:05.239> them<00:03:05.300> as

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
UVB light too which gives them as

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.490 
UVB light too which gives them as
natural<00:03:05.600> UVB<00:03:07.840> he'll<00:03:08.840> start<00:03:09.140> off<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.410> the

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
natural UVB he'll start off in the

natural UVB he'll start off in the
morning<00:03:09.830> on<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.010> very<00:03:10.190> top<00:03:10.430> of<00:03:10.610> that<00:03:10.700> branch

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
morning on the very top of that branch

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.570 
morning on the very top of that branch
and<00:03:11.180> work<00:03:11.390> his<00:03:11.540> way<00:03:11.690> down<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:13.010> he<00:03:13.190> also<00:03:13.340> has<00:03:13.550> a

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
basking rock which is just flagstone

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.410 
basking rock which is just flagstone
flagstone<00:03:16.250> doesn't<00:03:16.580> get<00:03:16.700> as<00:03:16.790> hot<00:03:16.820> as<00:03:17.180> some<00:03:17.330> of

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
flagstone doesn't get as hot as some of

flagstone doesn't get as hot as some of
your<00:03:17.480> typical<00:03:17.720> rocks<00:03:18.170> but<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:18.739> works<00:03:19.190> a<00:03:19.370> little

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
your typical rocks but it works a little

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.630 
your typical rocks but it works a little
bit<00:03:19.640> better<00:03:19.700> it's<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.510> like<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.709> just<00:03:22.370> it's

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
bit better it's a I like it it just it's

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.699 
bit better it's a I like it it just it's
bigger<00:03:23.030> it's<00:03:23.390> nicer<00:03:23.840> it's<00:03:23.989> easier<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.410> clean

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
bigger it's nicer it's easier to clean

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
big he actually was bigger because he

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.220 
big he actually was bigger because he
wasn't<00:04:05.770> a<00:04:05.800> group<00:04:06.100> of<00:04:06.340> dragons<00:04:07.180> together<00:04:07.900> and

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
wasn't a group of dragons together and

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.230 
wasn't a group of dragons together and
he<00:04:08.770> was<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.130> dominant<00:04:09.580> one<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:09.970> he<00:04:10.090> actually

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
he was the dominant one so he actually

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.090 
he was the dominant one so he actually
grew<00:04:10.630> up<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.990> faster<00:04:11.410> that<00:04:11.530> actually<00:04:11.860> will

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
grew up the faster that actually will

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.920 
grew up the faster that actually will
help<00:04:12.340> them<00:04:12.610> grow<00:04:12.790> faster<00:04:13.360> and<00:04:13.390> then<00:04:13.660> we<00:04:13.750> took

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
help them grow faster and then we took

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.800 
help them grow faster and then we took
him<00:04:14.140> out<00:04:14.350> and<00:04:14.710> now<00:04:15.700> he's<00:04:16.030> a<00:04:16.150> slow<00:04:16.600> down<00:04:16.750> a

die<00:05:11.500> and<00:05:11.890> that's<00:05:12.070> my<00:05:12.250> memory<00:05:12.670> one<00:05:13.000> number<00:05:13.120> one

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
die and that's my memory one number one

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.940 
die and that's my memory one number one
problem<00:05:13.690> is<00:05:13.780> just<00:05:14.020> because<00:05:14.230> I<00:05:14.350> have<00:05:14.560> crickets

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
problem is just because I have crickets

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.730 
problem is just because I have crickets
dying<00:05:15.250> all<00:05:15.640> the<00:05:15.670> time<00:05:16.000> so<00:05:16.480> I<00:05:16.690> fit<00:05:17.410> there

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
dying all the time so I fit there

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.320 
dying all the time so I fit there
they're<00:05:17.980> a<00:05:18.010> lot<00:05:18.160> more<00:05:18.190> nutritious<00:05:18.880> and<00:05:19.060> you

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
they're a lot more nutritious and you

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.400 
they're a lot more nutritious and you
can<00:05:19.510> get<00:05:19.750> load<00:05:19.930> them<00:05:20.110> a<00:05:20.140> lot<00:05:20.290> easier<00:05:20.650> so<00:05:22.410> yeah

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
can get load them a lot easier so yeah

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.800 
can get load them a lot easier so yeah
that's<00:05:23.710> basically<00:05:24.090> basically<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.420> basic

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
that's basically basically the basic

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.610 
that's basically basically the basic
care<00:05:26.290> requirements<00:05:26.950> the<00:05:27.850> number<00:05:28.150> one<00:05:28.620> tool

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
care requirements the number one tool

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.620 
care requirements the number one tool
that<00:05:29.650> people<00:05:30.280> ask<00:05:30.430> me<00:05:30.640> that<00:05:30.760> I<00:05:30.820> use<00:05:31.060> I<00:05:31.270> actually
