00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.199
 in addition also a brown shadow 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.580
 one in a bronze tone

 let's start the makeup I hope you like it 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.740
 let's start by taking the golden zone and apply it all over the eyelid from 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.560
 we are going to do it with great care so that the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.950
 golden does not stay too strong especially in the part near the people 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.490
 what we do have more quantity 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.490
 on the mobile eyelid 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.470
 a very very light layer on the fixed eyelid 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.580
 of course you can take another color is basic 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.080
 ap removed 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.230
 2 Saturday or any other for what you eat 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.230
 japan which happens after 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.400
 Besides, we're going to take the bronze tone shade and then they say 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.710
 to finish or slightly pointed 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.140
 to mark the shape of the havana eye socket 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.140
 let's wet a little bit we are a little product 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.350
 and we are going to mark 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.350
 the area of ​​the eye socket 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.310
 it is important that we see blurring as we go up 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.909
 the initial inward 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.299
 moving away from the greater intensity of products of the area agencies 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.679
 BBC Science like this one needs to do it 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:24.299
 to the shape of the area by its joint form and also on Thursday 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.299
 blurring the works as disaster goes 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:31.659
 the next step is to apply the chocolate brown shadow with a type brush 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.379
 dual union contingent allows access 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.299
 easily to the fame of the outer wwe the outermost part of our 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.060
 let's catch some product we beat them in the hand 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.959
 we were going to make up just this part 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.139
 We will go up knowing what we have applied before with that bronze tone 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.029
 but always keeping the brown in this area have moved to that day 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.129
 will be deeper and lopo min 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.319
 and also lengthen the visual 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.769
 you can use a force that has the end of the year 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.219
 to finish defining what to say 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.099
 we just picked a pencil in a blue tone and choose blue but as they say 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.359
 can stop any other for what you want 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.689
 and we are going to mark the area of ​​the lower tabs to not apply 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.569
 over a little shadow with this we're going to get that color we want a lot 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.229
 more elegant 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.229
 let's mark the end 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:29.070
 It is a very clear area but we consider that the waves 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.070
 also the city 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.029
 Once we have applied zp, we will choose astonishing to see with what 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:50.539
 we want in the electrical blue room quite strong 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:55.369
 and as the saying goes, in order to make fame better, lashes 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:58.369
 we will take a little out and we will bet you appeal 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.799
 it seems to us that the color has been too strong you can always 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.679
 mix it with another 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:08.749
 until I get it is that the intensity of the color that you fall 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.129
 so much is to blur the contingency have extinction 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:18.400
 is a bit of respite because of citing it as 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.400
 infobae com font 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.650
 or with any other that has experience we will also give you a 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.870
 uneasy touch 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.370
 on the outside 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.009
 of the mobile eyelid 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.860
 if we consider that the strong fall in the postseason with the other powers 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:42.059
 recent step is to apply mascara on the lower lashes and 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:45.059
 higher 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.469
 and so we have our eyes blindfolded let's show a profiler environment 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:58.330
 natural 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.909
 and we are going to delineate the neighborhoods very lightly just to give them a 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:03.139
 little more definition 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.740
 we will apply a nuclear power station and everything with one point per year 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:12.109
 Carlos Macaya the week before the emergency 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.210
 these materials focuses on life 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.210
 the corners 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.599
 the plot and we can start 1200 this morning 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.050
 the sexy among much easier than the case is exercised 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.129
 let's see narco 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:31.009
 Fast movements 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.789
 very light on the way to create a base 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:34.809
 for the month 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:37.089
 let's apply the roscón helped 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:40.089
 In Paraguay 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.259
 we will apply a practical light layer that notaries too marked 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.810
 the last step will be to apply a bit of rouge in a peach tone to the area 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.720
 of the ribs 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.720
 stop with equal affection with the bars 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:03.740
 so be very careful with dare patience too marked 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:07.979
 and in the case of castilla-the spot 240 download it 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.639
 who are clamoring for how he is doing as he was without makeup 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:14.240
 with a gap that had star 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.099
 efe salgado also the spokesman 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.099
 to blur tagline that even more natural 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.039
 we need to educate looked as you see is a very simple group but that is going to 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.439
 have a foot 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:30.429
 and it's going to do that is all the looks center in August is expected to be 

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:32.909
