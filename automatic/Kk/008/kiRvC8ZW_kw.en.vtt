00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:12.000
 not at all curious curious cabinet 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.690
 here 8.11 is out now how about the 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.760
 art count on the bt first grenade there 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.789
 maybe we'll definitely see you 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.980
 that sometimes I reload very much 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.860
 hang the garnet scroll or something like that or 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.119
 the troupe is not a problem 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.529
 This is a house on the way where you say 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.590
 a ruin will hang on the roof or 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.660
 say similar and I stand here now 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:49.110
 in no unusual positions 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:50.340
 quite the wind that she has revealed so 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.160
 a bit of rhine metal action here 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.219
 Let's meet a bit what we see 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.710
 at the bottom right 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:03.000
 I found the grenade 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:07.140
 So this landed there I am before 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.810
 the gwe 100 drove there was one 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.830
 problem not i do not know why that 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.799
 Located at the distance to leaks at the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.710
 I myself and the opponent by chance 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.270
 also in the 53rd 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.920
 Say you have to speed to the 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.470
 I did not realize that now 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.119
 because what was bad but maybe 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.250
 I also did not pay attention or for myself 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.590
 not noticeable in any case still nimble 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.869
 enough so how can I mine now 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.479
 team help if the grenades here in 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:41.890
 Nirvana fly try number three 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:46.000
 Meanwhile , the enemy role is the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.000
 party are still left of us 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:02:00.710
 we also count either does not matter 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:03.729
 Attention has already gotten more though 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.729
 also back down into the corner 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.830
 and the replay indicates 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.129
 I'm really completely in it 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:17.019
 the circle so no falsification because where 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.019
 I also look at the grenade 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.390
 and writes exactly what I am now 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.970
 just experience three steps the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.260
 somewhere flew there are just the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.849
 ask if it really only this place is 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.489
 or by chance at any 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:36.440
 server settings is on server 1 where 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:38.569
 I over and I believe in the end 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.910
 because the grenades have otherwise commended 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.319
 met where I wanted 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.319
 partially the circular-jumps on 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:52.370
 although I do not drive at all or mystery 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.510
 or moments where I say that could 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.739
 jump up because that's me 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.030
 first grenade really landed there 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:04.819
 is where I wanted it as you know it 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:09.319
 the varieties that reaches the daily target 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.299
 has just the impressions only of the 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.420
 opponent that the team might be one 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.280
 bit'm better when I lose 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.690
 seeing Jason follow is very strange though 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.519
 also the distance maybe it plays 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.599
 also a roll somehow c32 came in 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.849
 little closer and I could I 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:33.579
 meet and then the last attempt goes 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.579
 here in the melee on the s 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.020
 and that ends up with me too 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.790
 dying or pinging it and pings as 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.960
 not even outward that 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.210
 maybe it could be 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.250
 So yes , gaming was what clarifies me 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.330
 they are beautiful new things in it 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.180
 may have conjured one 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.710
 indirect way annoying or is only 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.260
 the map is to blame because there 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:02.090
 there are many factors possible 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.090
 then to the next water at
