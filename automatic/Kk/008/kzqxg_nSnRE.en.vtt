things<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.090> great<00:01:48.890> oversize<00:01:49.890> draping

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

top and it was 26 9 which I don't think

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.660

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
actually when I look back at the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.130 
actually when I look back at the
collection<00:02:24.209> there<00:02:24.510> was<00:02:24.599> one<00:02:24.780> piece<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.110> I

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
collection there was one piece that I

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.780 
collection there was one piece that I
really<00:02:25.380> wanted<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.010> couldn't<00:02:26.370> find<00:02:26.610> this

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
really wanted that I couldn't find this

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.670 
really wanted that I couldn't find this
Target<00:02:27.150> store<00:02:27.330> but<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.540> did<00:02:27.690> find<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.080> one<00:02:28.319> and

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
Target store but I did find this one and

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.199 
Target store but I did find this one and
I<00:02:28.980> think<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.340> actually<00:02:29.519> might<00:02:29.670> like<00:02:30.000> this<00:02:30.150> one

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
I think I actually might like this one

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.990 
I think I actually might like this one
the<00:02:30.599> most<00:02:30.900> now<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:32.340> then<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.550> next<00:02:32.819> thing<00:02:32.910> I

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
the most now and then the next thing I

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.790 
the most now and then the next thing I
picked<00:02:33.239> out<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.840> actually<00:02:34.500> something<00:02:34.680> that

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
picked out is actually something that

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.320 
picked out is actually something that
Ian<00:02:35.130> picked<00:02:35.310> out<00:02:35.459> for<00:02:35.610> me<00:02:35.640> if<00:02:35.849> you<00:02:35.910> wanted<00:02:36.180> me

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
to pick up this shirt and it's a very

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.449 
to pick up this shirt and it's a very
nice<00:02:39.120> draped<00:02:40.080> racer<00:02:40.830> back<00:02:42.260> tank<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.650> don't<00:02:44.400> know

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
nice draped racer back tank I don't know

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.860 
nice draped racer back tank I don't know
if<00:02:44.549> it's<00:02:44.670> showing<00:02:44.880> up<00:02:45.120> correctly<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.690> the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
if it's showing up correctly in the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.600 
if it's showing up correctly in the
camera<00:02:46.230> but<00:02:46.260> it's<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> nice<00:02:46.680> coral<00:02:47.069> color<00:02:47.400> which

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
camera but it's a nice coral color which

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.080 
camera but it's a nice coral color which
is<00:02:47.700> always<00:02:47.850> fun<00:02:48.299> for<00:02:49.010> spring<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.489> summer<00:02:50.730> it

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
is always fun for spring and summer it

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.930 
is always fun for spring and summer it
was<00:02:51.510> 1999<00:02:52.350> which<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.799> little<00:02:53.100> bit<00:02:53.250> pricey

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
was 1999 which is a little bit pricey

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.809 
was 1999 which is a little bit pricey
for<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.510> tank<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:54.989> my<00:02:55.110> opinion<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.670> is

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
for a tank in my opinion but it is

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.420 
for a tank in my opinion but it is
probably<00:02:57.239> wrong<00:02:57.510> for<00:02:57.989> Target<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.590> has<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> nice

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
probably wrong for Target and has a nice

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.430 
probably wrong for Target and has a nice
little<00:02:59.760> pocket<00:03:00.000> here<00:03:00.239> in<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.900> front<00:03:01.200> so

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
little pocket here in the front so

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.710 
little pocket here in the front so
that's<00:03:02.430> another<00:03:02.760> one<00:03:02.910> I'm<00:03:03.000> excited<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.510> wear

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
that's another one I'm excited to wear

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.559 
that's another one I'm excited to wear
so<00:03:04.560> then<00:03:04.769> now<00:03:05.040> at<00:03:05.250> this<00:03:05.430> point<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.970> thought<00:03:06.209> that

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
so then now at this point I thought that

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.000 
so then now at this point I thought that
I<00:03:06.599> okay<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.049> didn't<00:03:07.319> find<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.620> dress<00:03:07.799> that<00:03:07.980> I

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
I okay I didn't find the dress that I

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.740 
I okay I didn't find the dress that I
wanted<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.519> I'm<00:03:08.640> like<00:03:08.819> oh<00:03:08.970> my<00:03:09.120> god<00:03:09.360> all<00:03:09.720> the

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
wanted and I'm like oh my god all the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.259 
wanted and I'm like oh my god all the
accessories<00:03:10.319> all<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.680> shoes<00:03:10.920> are<00:03:11.069> gone<00:03:11.220> but<00:03:11.970> I

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
accessories all the shoes are gone but I

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.750 
accessories all the shoes are gone but I
guess<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.349> guess<00:03:13.709> they<00:03:13.980> actually<00:03:14.400> put<00:03:14.640> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
guess I guess they actually put the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.810 
guess I guess they actually put the
shoes<00:03:15.209> in<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.599> shoe<00:03:15.630> section<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.820> the

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
shoes in the shoe section and the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.449 
shoes in the shoe section and the
accessories<00:03:18.600> in<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.750> accessories<00:03:19.230> section

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
accessories in the accessories section

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.770 
accessories in the accessories section
so<00:03:20.459> I<00:03:20.700> don't<00:03:21.030> know<00:03:21.120> why<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.299> wasn't<00:03:21.630> all

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
so I don't know why it wasn't all

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.180 
so I don't know why it wasn't all
together<00:03:22.320> kind<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:22.709> like<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.920> Neiman<00:03:23.160> Marcus

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
together kind of like the Neiman Marcus

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.870 
together kind of like the Neiman Marcus
one<00:03:23.640> or<00:03:24.060> when<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.049> went<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:26.370> Versace

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
one or when I went to the Versace

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.640 
one or when I went to the Versace
release<00:03:27.359> for<00:03:27.660> H&amp;M<00:03:27.959> it<00:03:28.109> wasn't<00:03:28.380> all<00:03:28.440> together

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
release for H&amp;M it wasn't all together

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.759 
release for H&amp;M it wasn't all together
so<00:03:29.609> on<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.090> way<00:03:30.180> out<00:03:30.299> I<00:03:30.329> ran<00:03:30.750> into<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.560> shoe

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
so on the way out I ran into the shoe

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.710

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
very last purchase from Sperber al quran

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.120 
very last purchase from Sperber al quran
collection<00:05:47.320> so<00:05:48.320> I<00:05:48.380> only<00:05:48.500> bought<00:05:48.710> four<00:05:48.920> pieces

collection so I only bought four pieces
and<00:05:49.550> I<00:05:49.850> think<00:05:50.060> it<00:05:50.150> totaled<00:05:50.480> to<00:05:50.600> about<00:05:50.810> a

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
and I think it totaled to about a

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.240 
and I think it totaled to about a
hundred<00:05:51.320> and<00:05:51.380> forty<00:05:51.590> dollars<00:05:51.770> which<00:05:52.100> I<00:05:52.190> don't

hundred and forty dollars which I don't

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.820 
hundred and forty dollars which I don't
think<00:05:52.430> it's<00:05:52.670> very<00:05:52.760> priced<00:05:53.060> at<00:05:53.300> all

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
think it's very priced at all

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.890 
think it's very priced at all
considering<00:05:54.830> like<00:05:55.160> the<00:05:55.910> for<00:05:56.120> sake<00:05:56.330> stuff<00:05:56.720> was

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
considering like the for sake stuff was

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.289 
considering like the for sake stuff was
just<00:05:56.930> always<00:05:57.290> something

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:58.299 
just always something

00:05:58.299 --> 00:06:01.329 
just always something
