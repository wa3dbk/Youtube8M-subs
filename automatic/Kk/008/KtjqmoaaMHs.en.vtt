00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730 

I<00:00:00.089> just<00:00:00.539> sit<00:00:00.750> rather<00:00:00.930> listen<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.290> it<00:00:01.469> without

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
I just sit rather listen to it without

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.960 
I just sit rather listen to it without
do<00:00:01.920> of<00:00:01.979> course<00:00:02.129> do<00:00:02.340> that<00:00:02.520> but<00:00:02.669> they<00:00:02.790> are

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
do of course do that but they are

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.749 
do of course do that but they are
they're<00:00:03.240> really<00:00:03.600> big<00:00:03.810> on<00:00:04.759> measuring

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
they're really big on measuring

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.340 
they're really big on measuring
techniques<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.390> just<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:06.899> computer

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
techniques and just and computer

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.480 
techniques and just and computer
modeling<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:07.859> things<00:00:07.980> like<00:00:08.099> that<00:00:08.160> but

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
modeling and things like that but

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.520 
modeling and things like that but
they're<00:00:08.730> probably<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.090> most

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
they're probably the most

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.419 
they're probably the most
technologically<00:00:10.530> advanced<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.160> speaker

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
technologically advanced to speaker

manufacturer<00:00:11.969> in<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.120> world<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.509> think<00:00:12.660> I

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
manufacturer in the world I think I

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.030 
manufacturer in the world I think I
think<00:00:12.870> it'd<00:00:12.960> be<00:00:13.019> pretty<00:00:13.170> safe<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.620> saying<00:00:13.830> that

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
think it'd be pretty safe in saying that

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.330 
think it'd be pretty safe in saying that
alright<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:14.910> now<00:00:15.680> I'm<00:00:16.680> still<00:00:17.039> just<00:00:17.160> getting

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
alright so now I'm still just getting

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.359 
alright so now I'm still just getting
have<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> diamond<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.650> plasma<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.100> just

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
have a diamond and plasma and it's just

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.189 
have a diamond and plasma and it's just
a<00:00:20.490> sound<00:00:20.670> like<00:00:20.880> science<00:00:21.029> fiction<00:00:21.210> stuff<00:00:21.630> yeah

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
a sound like science fiction stuff yeah

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.570 
a sound like science fiction stuff yeah
well<00:00:22.500> as<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.769> course<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.010> speakers<00:00:23.340> look<00:00:23.490> a

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
well as of course the speakers look a

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.340 
well as of course the speakers look a
little<00:00:23.730> bit<00:00:23.880> like<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.240> too<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:25.050> know<00:00:25.140> that

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
little bit like that too you know that

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.140 
little bit like that too you know that
they<00:00:25.560> look<00:00:25.830> at<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.220> part<00:00:27.289> we<00:00:28.289> have<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.410> diamond

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
they look at the part we have a diamond

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.669 
they look at the part we have a diamond
dome<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.929> little<00:00:31.140> tweeter<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.590> will

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
dome as the little tweeter that will

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.500 
dome as the little tweeter that will
speak<00:00:31.980> at<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> top<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.399> your<00:00:32.610> be<00:00:32.880> commenced<00:00:33.329> at

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
speak at the top of your be commenced at

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.990 
speak at the top of your be commenced at
the<00:00:33.809> next<00:00:34.079> one<00:00:34.230> down<00:00:34.440> they<00:00:34.649> use<00:00:34.829> Kevlar<00:00:35.460> Kevlar

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the next one down they use Kevlar Kevlar

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.760 
the next one down they use Kevlar Kevlar
for<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.270> mid-range<00:00:36.570> drive<00:00:36.960> Wi-Fi<00:00:37.320> viable

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
for the mid-range drive Wi-Fi viable

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.979 
for the mid-range drive Wi-Fi viable
into<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> little<00:00:38.370> repeal<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.000> would<00:00:39.149> be

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
into it a little repeal it would be

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.750 
into it a little repeal it would be
precisely<00:00:40.649> yeah<00:00:40.920> well<00:00:41.070> they<00:00:41.129> actually<00:00:41.520> if

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
precisely yeah well they actually if

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.350 
precisely yeah well they actually if
they<00:00:41.969> shape<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.780> into<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.050> cone<00:00:43.950> shape<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
they shape it into a cone shape and the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.670 
they shape it into a cone shape and the
mid-range<00:00:45.629> drive<00:00:45.930> has<00:00:46.110> got<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.410> something

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
mid-range drive has got to be something

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.990 
mid-range drive has got to be something
very<00:00:46.829> different<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.370> tweeter<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.730> it

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
very different to the tweeter and it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.490 
very different to the tweeter and it
still<00:00:48.239> got<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.510> act<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.840> piston<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.410> at

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
still got to act like a piston but at

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.049 
still got to act like a piston but at
very<00:00:49.530> different<00:00:49.770> frequencies<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:50.910> got

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
very different frequencies so it's got

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.819 
very different frequencies so it's got
to<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.239> larger<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.870> go<00:00:52.350> through<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.620> much

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
to be larger and go through a much

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.000 
to be larger and go through a much
longer<00:00:53.190> excursion<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.600> need<00:00:54.899> a

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
longer excursion and so you need a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.389 
longer excursion and so you need a
material<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.340> different<00:00:57.000> nature<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.989> do<00:00:58.140> that

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
material of different nature to do that

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.040 
material of different nature to do that
then<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.489> end<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> woofers<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.870> case

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
then you end the woofers in this case

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.810 
then you end the woofers in this case
are<00:01:01.230> also<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.530> new<00:01:01.739> material<00:01:02.160> i<00:01:02.250> call<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.579> roller

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
are also a new material i call it roller

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.000 
are also a new material i call it roller
selves<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.350> i<00:01:04.409> pretty<00:01:04.680> sure<00:01:04.769> it's

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
selves and it's a so i pretty sure it's

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.030 
selves and it's a so i pretty sure it's
a<00:01:05.040> carbon<00:01:05.400> fiber<00:01:05.610> composite<00:01:06.020> material<00:01:07.040> yeah

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
a carbon fiber composite material yeah

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.609 
a carbon fiber composite material yeah
all<00:01:08.610> very<00:01:08.790> good<00:01:08.820> all<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.540> whiz-bang<00:01:10.170> cabinets
