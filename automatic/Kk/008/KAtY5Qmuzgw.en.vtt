Riseborough see but I got excited cuz

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
Riseborough see but I got excited cuz
it's<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> 99<00:02:16.140> card<00:02:16.440> but<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.630> mean<00:02:18.630> in<00:02:18.900> actuality

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
it's a 99 card but I mean in actuality

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.130 
it's a 99 card but I mean in actuality
he's<00:02:19.830> probably<00:02:20.010> worth<00:02:20.250> like<00:02:20.280> 20,000<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.510> I

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
he's probably worth like 20,000 and I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.200 
he's probably worth like 20,000 and I
know<00:02:22.200> last<00:02:22.500> time<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.340> actually<00:02:23.490> played<00:02:23.820> mud

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
know last time and I actually played mud

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.080 
know last time and I actually played mud
he<00:02:24.690> was<00:02:24.810> actually<00:02:24.960> going<00:02:25.320> for<00:02:25.410> like<00:02:25.620> 15<00:02:26.070> K<00:02:26.310> 20<00:02:26.880> K

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
he was actually going for like 15 K 20 K

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.270 
he was actually going for like 15 K 20 K
so<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:27.720> kind<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.380> shame<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.830> think<00:02:29.040> such<00:02:29.250> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
so it's kind of a shame to think such a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.340 
so it's kind of a shame to think such a
good<00:02:29.520> card<00:02:29.790> but<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.960> what<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.230> and

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
good card but it is what it is and

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.460 
good card but it is what it is and
Randall<00:02:32.190> Randy<00:02:32.640> McMichael<00:02:32.820> tie<00:02:33.720> down<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.170> I'm

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
Randall Randy McMichael tie down so I'm

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.950 
Randall Randy McMichael tie down so I'm
guessing<00:02:34.850> he<00:02:35.850> should<00:02:36.420> be<00:02:36.540> worth<00:02:36.690> some<00:02:36.930> money

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
guessing he should be worth some money

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.560 
guessing he should be worth some money
since<00:02:37.380> he's<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.830> silver<00:02:38.820> card<00:02:39.120> on<00:02:39.240> a<00:02:39.270> legendary

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
since he's a silver card on a legendary

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.040 
since he's a silver card on a legendary
pack<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.380> it's<00:02:40.470> kind<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.770> ridiculous<00:02:42.050> now

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050
