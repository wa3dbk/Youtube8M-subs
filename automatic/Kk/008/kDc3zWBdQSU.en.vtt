don't<00:01:19.650> usually<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.280> way<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.090> know<00:01:21.710> so

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
don't usually do this way but I know so

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.590 
don't usually do this way but I know so
first<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.370> have<00:01:23.580> B

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:37.310

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:56.090 

and<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.820> have

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:11.220
