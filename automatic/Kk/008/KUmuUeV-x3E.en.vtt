why<00:00:30.960> I'm<00:00:31.199> making<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.949> figured<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.610> know

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
why I'm making this I I figured you know

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.639 
why I'm making this I I figured you know
it's<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> good<00:00:33.030> um<00:00:33.920> good<00:00:34.920> time<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.120> test<00:00:36.329> how<00:00:36.660> sky

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
it's a good um good time to test how sky

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.700 
it's a good um good time to test how sky
room<00:00:37.860> works<00:00:38.070> with<00:00:38.309> reps<00:00:38.640> um<00:00:39.050> I'm<00:00:40.050> not<00:00:40.410> sure<00:00:40.500> if

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
room works with reps um I'm not sure if

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.560 
room works with reps um I'm not sure if
it's<00:00:40.770> Skyrim<00:00:41.280> being<00:00:41.520> gay<00:00:41.670> with<00:00:41.850> wraps<00:00:42.180> or

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
it's Skyrim being gay with wraps or

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.619 
it's Skyrim being gay with wraps or
perhaps<00:00:42.780> being<00:00:43.230> perhaps<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:44.129> uh<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:44.760> it's

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
perhaps being perhaps but uh it's it's

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.490 
perhaps being perhaps but uh it's it's
lagging<00:00:46.289> pretty<00:00:46.739> bad<00:00:47.010> um<00:00:47.660> but<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.350> know<00:00:49.379> I

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
lagging pretty bad um but you know I

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.920 
lagging pretty bad um but you know I
have<00:00:50.010> made<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.250> video<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.489> long<00:00:50.640> time<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.329> reason

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
have made a video a long time the reason

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.049 
have made a video a long time the reason
being<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.399> don't<00:00:53.760> know<00:00:53.850> what<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
being is that I I don't know what to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.310 
know before my problem you know I had a
pretty<00:01:05.729> bad<00:01:05.909> processor<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.869> messed<00:01:07.110> with

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
pretty bad processor that messed with

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.289 
pretty bad processor that messed with
perhaps<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.369> know<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.549> couldn't<00:01:08.970> record

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
realistic clock I can get is like 4.5 a

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.330 
realistic clock I can get is like 4.5 a
gigahertz<00:01:42.509> what<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.500> still<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.189> it's

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
gigahertz what you still you know it's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.170 
gigahertz what you still you know it's
nothing<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.820> laugh<00:01:44.850> at<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:46.579> you<00:01:47.579> know<00:01:47.700> it's

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
not what I was expecting um but it can

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.310 
not what I was expecting um but it can
run<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.060> grand<00:01:51.299> starter<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.750> pretty<00:01:52.020> good<00:01:52.200> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
run a grand starter for pretty good and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.050 
run a grand starter for pretty good and
I<00:01:52.380> don't<00:01:52.619> tell<00:01:52.799> those<00:01:52.950> faggots<00:01:53.369> doing<00:01:53.700> or<00:01:53.880> how

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.469 
he just healed himself he doesn't look
like<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.820> mage<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.509> guess<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.119> wars<00:02:00.119> and

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
like a mage I guess this is the wars and

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.660 
like a mage I guess this is the wars and
skyrim<00:02:00.930> i<00:02:01.049> think<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:01.350> called<00:02:01.380> mod<00:02:01.740> i<00:02:02.040> just

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
skyrim i think it's called mod i just

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.789 
skyrim i think it's called mod i just
downloaded<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.479> isn't<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.840> mod<00:02:04.020> showcase<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
downloaded this isn't a mod showcase and

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.310 
downloaded this isn't a mod showcase and
sizzle<00:02:05.270> maybe<00:02:06.270> it'll<00:02:06.479> turn<00:02:06.509> into<00:02:06.719> one<00:02:07.079> and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
sizzle maybe it'll turn into one and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.710 
sizzle maybe it'll turn into one and
this<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.710> friggin<00:02:08.129> um<00:02:08.280> Skye<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.090> think<00:02:09.629> it's

bandwagon you know making videos so that
there's<00:04:20.109> two<00:04:20.410> reasons<00:04:20.620> there<00:04:20.979> why<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.330> don't

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
there's two reasons there why I don't

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.530 
there's two reasons there why I don't
think<00:04:22.479> it's<00:04:22.600> a<00:04:22.630> good<00:04:22.660> idea<00:04:22.870> one<00:04:23.680> because

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
think it's a good idea one because

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.120 
think it's a good idea one because
like<00:04:25.720> I'm<00:04:25.870> jumping<00:04:26.260> on<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.380> bandwagon<00:04:26.560> which

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
like I'm jumping on the bandwagon which

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.770 
like I'm jumping on the bandwagon which
I'm<00:04:27.760> not<00:04:28.000> um<00:04:28.530> um<00:04:29.530> no<00:04:30.430> uh<00:04:30.460> that's<00:04:31.360> one<00:04:31.600> of<00:04:31.690> the

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
I'm not um um no uh that's one of the

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.630 
I'm not um um no uh that's one of the
reasons<00:04:32.140> the<00:04:32.260> other<00:04:32.380> one<00:04:32.590> which<00:04:33.310> I<00:04:33.460> guess<00:04:33.610> is

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
reasons the other one which I guess is

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.060 
reasons the other one which I guess is
the<00:04:34.030> primary<00:04:34.390> reason<00:04:34.690> is<00:04:35.110> that<00:04:35.170> my<00:04:35.500> editing

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
the primary reason is that my editing

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.760 
the primary reason is that my editing
skills<00:04:36.400> are<00:04:36.760> pretty<00:04:37.390> bad<00:04:37.690> um<00:04:38.160> I<00:04:40.050> mean<00:04:41.050> it's<00:04:41.620> a
