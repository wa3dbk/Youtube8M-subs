don't<00:00:34.469> have<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.680> big<00:00:34.950> connection<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.640> I'm<00:00:35.730> going

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
don't have a big connection so I'm going

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.040 
don't have a big connection so I'm going
to<00:00:35.880> manually<00:00:36.420> connect<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.460> disconnect

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
to manually connect it and disconnect

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.080 
to manually connect it and disconnect
and<00:00:40.050> then<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.500> just<00:00:40.649> goes<00:00:40.829> out<00:00:41.570> from<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.780> jar

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.040 
into the Toyota Senecas intake manifold
which<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.840> like<00:00:52.050> right<00:00:52.350> there<00:00:52.860> 31<00:00:53.789> t<00:00:55.010> connector

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
which is like right there 31 t connector

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.569 
which is like right there 31 t connector
and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.469> that's<00:00:58.680> what<00:00:58.890> goes<00:00:59.129> into<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and then that's what goes into the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.980 
and then that's what goes into the
engine<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.680> we'll<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.010> happens<00:01:02.160> like

not<00:01:33.970> a<00:01:34.000> ton<00:01:34.270> of<00:01:34.329> production<00:01:34.960> but<00:01:35.140> it's<00:01:35.259> okay

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
