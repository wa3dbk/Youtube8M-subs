00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
construction what what makes velocity so

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.870 
construction what what makes velocity so
special<00:01:57.469> you<00:01:57.590> guys<00:01:57.709> rose<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.189> fastest<00:01:58.669> boats

special you guys rose the fastest boats

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.550 
special you guys rose the fastest boats
out<00:01:59.090> there

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
out there

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.500 
out there
well<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:00.369> boat<00:02:00.520> here<00:02:00.729> okay<00:02:01.000> we<00:02:01.150> built<00:02:01.390> real

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
well this boat here okay we built real

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.240 
well this boat here okay we built real
light<00:02:01.750> okay<00:02:02.110> it's<00:02:02.229> all<00:02:02.380> kept<00:02:02.619> logged<00:02:02.890> off<00:02:03.100> in

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
light okay it's all kept logged off in

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.730 
light okay it's all kept logged off in
the<00:02:03.310> fibre<00:02:03.520> construction<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:05.619> you're

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
the fibre construction so you're

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.020 
the fibre construction so you're
actually<00:02:05.979> using<00:02:06.100> carbon<00:02:06.520> fiber<00:02:06.549> into

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
actually using carbon fiber into

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.190 
actually using carbon fiber into
construction<00:02:07.360> your<00:02:07.600> votes<00:02:07.750> now<00:02:07.840> it's<00:02:08.140> a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
construction your votes now it's a

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.320 
construction your votes now it's a
kevlar<00:02:08.619> carbon<00:02:08.950> fiber<00:02:09.190> mix<00:02:09.520> on<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.819> mat<00:02:09.970> okay

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
kevlar carbon fiber mix on the mat okay

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.510 
kevlar carbon fiber mix on the mat okay
so<00:02:10.720> it's<00:02:10.869> like<00:02:10.959> a<00:02:10.990> hybrid<00:02:11.170> fabric<00:02:11.980> correct

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
so it's like a hybrid fabric correct

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.270 
so it's like a hybrid fabric correct
okay<00:02:12.880> cool<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.660> then<00:02:13.930> we<00:02:14.260> used<00:02:14.440> goose<00:02:14.950> aboard

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
okay cool and then we used goose aboard

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.979 
okay cool and then we used goose aboard
and<00:02:15.610> came<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.940> lighten<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.239> up<00:02:16.390> it's<00:02:16.600> all<00:02:16.720> foam

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
and came to lighten it up it's all foam

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.510 
and came to lighten it up it's all foam
construction<00:02:17.260> there's<00:02:17.770> no<00:02:17.950> witness<00:02:18.340> boat

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
construction there's no witness boat

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.430 
construction there's no witness boat

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
boats along the way no we do yes okay

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.050 
boats along the way no we do yes okay
and<00:02:23.370> approximately<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.430> know<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:24.880> boats

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
and approximately I know this boats

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.520 
and approximately I know this boats
brand-new<00:02:25.480> you're<00:02:25.660> still<00:02:25.870> down<00:02:26.020> on<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.440> it

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
brand-new you're still down on it and it

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.080 
brand-new you're still down on it and it
just<00:02:26.560> just<00:02:27.040> doesn't<00:02:27.160> happen<00:02:27.489> right<00:02:27.670> off<00:02:27.940> the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
just just doesn't happen right off the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.660 
just just doesn't happen right off the
bat<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.420> understand<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:29.100> what<00:02:30.100> top<00:02:30.430> speed

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
bat and I understand that what top speed

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.160 
bat and I understand that what top speed
