play but what you want to do is you want

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.799 
play but what you want to do is you want
to<00:00:51.440> put<00:00:51.649> your<00:00:51.829> receiver<00:00:52.309> on<00:00:52.609> a<00:00:52.640> fade<00:00:53.000> once<00:00:53.359> you

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
to put your receiver on a fade once you

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.500 
to put your receiver on a fade once you
are<00:00:54.640> coming<00:00:55.640> out<00:00:55.760> of<00:00:55.789> the<00:00:55.940> huddle<00:00:56.120> it<00:00:56.269> doesn't

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
are coming out of the huddle it doesn't

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.139 
are coming out of the huddle it doesn't
you<00:00:56.600> don't<00:00:56.750> have<00:00:56.839> to<00:00:56.929> be<00:00:57.019> at<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.410> line<00:00:57.589> but<00:00:58.149> in

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
you don't have to be at the line but in

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.430 
you don't have to be at the line but in
practice<00:00:59.539> mode<00:00:59.719> it's<00:00:59.809> gonna<00:00:59.929> seem<00:01:00.140> like<00:01:00.289> it

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
practice mode it's gonna seem like it

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.470 
practice mode it's gonna seem like it
takes<00:01:00.649> longer<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.399> do<00:01:01.550> this<00:01:01.730> but<00:01:02.030> in<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.239> game

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
takes longer to do this but in the game

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.119 
takes longer to do this but in the game
you'll<00:01:02.690> see<00:01:02.899> that<00:01:03.079> it's<00:01:03.260> really<00:01:03.440> easy<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.859> set

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
you'll see that it's really easy to set

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.300 
you'll see that it's really easy to set
and<00:01:04.509> once<00:01:05.509> you<00:01:05.630> do<00:01:05.810> put<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.619> receiver<00:01:07.070> on<00:01:07.280> a

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
and once you do put the receiver on a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.980 
and once you do put the receiver on a
fade<00:01:07.729> go<00:01:08.360> ahead<00:01:08.509> and<00:01:08.600> just<00:01:08.720> flip<00:01:08.900> the

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
fade go ahead and just flip the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.990 
fade go ahead and just flip the
formation<00:01:09.439> and<00:01:09.650> you<00:01:09.710> will<00:01:09.979> notice<00:01:10.250> that<00:01:10.400> the

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
formation and you will notice that the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.830 
formation and you will notice that the
fade<00:01:11.920> stays<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.340> same<00:01:13.390> what<00:01:14.390> I<00:01:14.420> mean<00:01:14.630> is<00:01:14.720> it

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
fade stays the same what I mean is it

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.780 
fade stays the same what I mean is it
doesn't<00:01:15.020> flip<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:15.680> it<00:01:15.950> turns<00:01:16.220> into<00:01:16.369> a<00:01:16.460> fade<00:01:16.670> to

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
doesn't flip so it turns into a fade to

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.090 
doesn't flip so it turns into a fade to
the<00:01:16.909> other<00:01:17.119> side<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:17.689> what<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:18.500> have<00:01:18.649> here<00:01:18.920> is

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
the other side and what you have here is

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.940 
the other side and what you have here is
now<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.310> slow<00:01:19.670> go<00:01:19.850> route<00:01:20.030> so<00:01:20.869> when<00:01:21.560> you're

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
now a slow go route so when you're

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.069 
now a slow go route so when you're
running<00:01:22.189> the<00:01:22.460> ball<00:01:22.640> out<00:01:22.820> of<00:01:22.850> a<00:01:23.090> formation<00:01:23.780> such

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
running the ball out of a formation such

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.510 
running the ball out of a formation such
that<00:01:24.290> I<00:01:24.320> tight<00:01:24.740> you're<00:01:24.979> gonna<00:01:25.070> get<00:01:25.280> somebody

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
that I tight you're gonna get somebody

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.580 
that I tight you're gonna get somebody
in<00:01:25.820> man<00:01:26.060> coverage<00:01:26.509> and<00:01:26.720> what's<00:01:26.899> really<00:01:27.380> nice

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
in man coverage and what's really nice

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.090 
in man coverage and what's really nice
about<00:01:27.649> this<00:01:27.950> is<00:01:28.189> that<00:01:28.369> this<00:01:29.119> Sluggo<00:01:29.659> is

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
about this is that this Sluggo is

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.010 
about this is that this Sluggo is
unbuckle<00:01:31.100> because<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.610> is<00:01:31.729> a<00:01:31.759> feint<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:32.540> when

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
unbuckle because it is a feint so when

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.870 
unbuckle because it is a feint so when
somebody<00:01:33.290> runs<00:01:33.500> that<00:01:33.740> overpowered<00:01:34.430> two<00:01:34.670> men

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
somebody runs that overpowered two men

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.819 
somebody runs that overpowered two men
under<00:01:35.240> on<00:01:35.390> you<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.770> outside<00:01:37.159> DB<00:01:37.549> cannot<00:01:38.000> get<00:01:38.509> a

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
under on you the outside DB cannot get a

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.800 
under on you the outside DB cannot get a
jam<00:01:39.829> on<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.100> wide<00:01:40.219> receiver<00:01:40.579> this<00:01:41.270> allows<00:01:41.570> us

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
jam on the wide receiver this allows us

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.469 
jam on the wide receiver this allows us
to<00:01:42.159> throw<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.280> ball<00:01:43.430> up<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.969> seam<00:01:44.180> as<00:01:44.390> the

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
to throw the ball up the seam as the

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.929 
to throw the ball up the seam as the
receiver<00:01:44.780> breaks<00:01:45.049> it<00:01:45.140> off<00:01:45.289> and<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:46.460> brow<00:01:46.640> most

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
receiver breaks it off and the brow most

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.319 
receiver breaks it off and the brow most
resembles<00:01:47.420> a<00:01:47.630> slow<00:01:48.320> go<00:01:48.500> which<00:01:48.920> means<00:01:49.670> slant

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
resembles a slow go which means slant

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.160 
resembles a slow go which means slant
and<00:01:50.689> go<00:01:51.640> so<00:01:52.640> as<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:53.299> see<00:01:53.450> here<00:01:53.479> he<00:01:53.750> gets<00:01:53.869> enough

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
and go so as you see here he gets enough

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.749 
and go so as you see here he gets enough
separation<00:01:54.380> for<00:01:54.979> us<00:01:55.070> just<00:01:55.250> throw<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.549> simple

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
separation for us just throw a simple

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.730 
separation for us just throw a simple
inside<00:01:56.240> pass<00:01:56.600> lead<00:01:56.930> against<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.289> two<00:01:57.560> man

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
inside pass lead against the two man

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.120 
inside pass lead against the two man
under<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.250> there<00:01:58.759> is<00:01:58.850> no<00:01:59.000> press<00:01:59.829> what<00:02:00.829> I<00:02:00.859> like

so<00:04:31.300> doesn't<00:04:32.300> really<00:04:32.449> require<00:04:32.780> too<00:04:33.500> much<00:04:33.680> skill

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
so doesn't really require too much skill

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.370 
so doesn't really require too much skill
from<00:04:34.910> your<00:04:35.120> wide<00:04:35.270> receiver<00:04:35.630> to<00:04:35.870> run<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.169> slow

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380
