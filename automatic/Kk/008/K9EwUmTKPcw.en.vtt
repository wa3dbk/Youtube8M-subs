00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.830 
forward facing camera so what I'm going
to<00:00:11.660> do<00:00:12.070> is<00:00:13.070> take<00:00:13.400> this<00:00:13.820> reasonably<00:00:14.599> high

quality first surface mirror which I

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:19.870 
quality first surface mirror which I
just<00:00:18.050> happen<00:00:18.289> to<00:00:18.650> have<00:00:18.710> laying<00:00:19.039> around<00:00:19.249> for<00:00:19.820> a

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
just happen to have laying around for a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.479 
just happen to have laying around for a
number<00:00:20.029> of<00:00:20.179> years<00:00:20.739> cut<00:00:21.739> a<00:00:21.769> section<00:00:22.039> of<00:00:22.339> the

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:22.489 
number of years cut a section of the

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.759 
number of years cut a section of the
mirror<00:00:23.269> off<00:00:23.449> just<00:00:23.749> to<00:00:23.839> make<00:00:23.989> it<00:00:24.019> more<00:00:24.140> compact

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
mirror off just to make it more compact

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.159 
mirror off just to make it more compact
and<00:00:25.579> then<00:00:25.730> I'm<00:00:25.880> going<00:00:26.060> to<00:00:26.150> angle<00:00:26.630> it<00:00:26.720> off<00:00:26.989> the

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
and then I'm going to angle it off the

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.429 
and then I'm going to angle it off the
top<00:00:27.380> of<00:00:27.439> my<00:00:27.939> Nexus<00:00:28.939> 7<00:00:29.300> tablet<00:00:29.509> and<00:00:30.169> use<00:00:30.289> it

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
top of my Nexus 7 tablet and use it

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.119 
top of my Nexus 7 tablet and use it
somewhat<00:00:31.130> like<00:00:31.310> a<00:00:31.339> periscope<00:00:31.849> mirror<00:00:32.920> so<00:00:33.920> go

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
somewhat like a periscope mirror so go

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.990 
somewhat like a periscope mirror so go
ahead<00:00:34.250> and<00:00:34.370> fire<00:00:34.789> up<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:35.180> towel<00:00:35.840> saw<00:00:36.199> iron<00:00:37.000> get

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
ahead and fire up the towel saw iron get

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.950 
ahead and fire up the towel saw iron get
this<00:00:38.180> mirror<00:00:38.510> cut

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:01:34.460 

do<00:00:50.960> not<00:00:51.260> analyze<00:00:51.590> by<00:00:52.100> an<00:00:52.160> occasion

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.280 

my<00:01:35.490> second<00:01:36.490> here<00:01:36.730> i'm<00:01:36.880> going<00:01:37.120> to<00:01:37.270> hear

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.100 

I<00:01:40.410> find<00:01:40.980> that<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.190> scissors<00:01:41.670> crushes<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.720> balm

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
I find that a scissors crushes this balm

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.370 
I find that a scissors crushes this balm
as<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.470> cuts<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.820> end<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.480> with<00:01:45.630> less<00:01:46.200> than

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
as it cuts and you end up with less than

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.590 
as it cuts and you end up with less than
precision<00:01:46.830> on<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.190> cut<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:50.330> kind<00:01:51.330> of<00:01:51.390> messed

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
precision on the cut so kind of messed

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.950 
precision on the cut so kind of messed
up<00:01:51.840> I'm<00:01:52.080> going<00:01:52.260> to<00:01:52.350> use<00:01:52.440> this<00:01:52.590> scroll<00:01:53.280> saw<00:01:53.550> to

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
up I'm going to use this scroll saw to

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.000 
up I'm going to use this scroll saw to
cut<00:01:54.960> my<00:01:55.460> template<00:01:56.460> out<00:01:56.670> not<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.540> my<00:01:57.660> camera

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
cut my template out not on my camera

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.360 
cut my template out not on my camera
I'll<00:01:59.010> get<00:01:59.130> sharper<00:01:59.700> cleaner<00:02:01.010> edges<00:02:02.010> to<00:02:02.250> work

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
I'll get sharper cleaner edges to work

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:20.820 
I'll get sharper cleaner edges to work
with

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.160 

so<00:02:21.830> this<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:23.030> result<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.600> my<00:02:23.720> efforts<00:02:24.080> to

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
so this is the result of my efforts to

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.190 
so this is the result of my efforts to
turn<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:25.090> rare<00:02:26.090> looking<00:02:26.480> camera<00:02:26.720> into<00:02:27.170> a

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
turn the rare looking camera into a

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.910 
turn the rare looking camera into a
forward<00:02:27.770> looking<00:02:27.920> camera<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.760> my<00:02:28.880> nexus7

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
forward looking camera to my nexus7

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.140 
forward looking camera to my nexus7
basically<00:02:30.920> just<00:02:31.100> cut<00:02:31.280> slots<00:02:31.580> in<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:31.910> foam

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
basically just cut slots in the foam

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.710 
basically just cut slots in the foam
here<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:32.630> I<00:02:32.660> could<00:02:32.720> flip<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.350> mirror<00:02:33.590> in<00:02:34.720> and

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
here so I could flip the mirror in and

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.320 
here so I could flip the mirror in and
then<00:02:37.240> slats<00:02:38.240> there<00:02:38.570> to<00:02:38.780> slip<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.470> onto<00:02:39.620> the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
then slats there to slip it onto the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:03:01.210 
then slats there to slip it onto the
Nexus<00:02:41.330> 7<00:02:42.820> meriton<00:02:43.820> there<00:02:44.000> we<00:02:44.120> have<00:02:44.330> it

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.280 

you
