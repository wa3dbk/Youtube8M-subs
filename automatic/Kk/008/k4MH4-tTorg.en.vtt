have<00:00:47.190> developed<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.270> program<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:49.140> my<00:00:49.289> own

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
have developed a program for my own

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.690 
have developed a program for my own
birds<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.950> teach<00:00:50.129> them<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:50.579> along

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
basically we all have a spa day and I

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.380 
basically we all have a spa day and I
wet<00:00:53.070> all<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.219> birds<00:00:53.489> down<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.000> because<00:00:54.270> they

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
wet all the birds down and because they

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.670 
wet all the birds down and because they
feel<00:00:54.600> vulnerable<00:00:54.809> during<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.469> period

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
feel vulnerable during that period

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.170 
feel vulnerable during that period
everybody<00:00:56.160> pretty<00:00:56.309> much<00:00:56.430> Minds<00:00:56.789> their<00:00:56.969> P's

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
everybody pretty much Minds their P's

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.689 
everybody pretty much Minds their P's
and<00:00:57.210> Q's<00:00:57.620> but<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.070> watch<00:00:59.250> such

and Q's but you have to watch such
things<00:01:00.000> as<00:01:00.239> range<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.690> motion<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.949> actual

things as range of motion the actual
physicality<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> bird<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.890> timidity<00:01:05.519> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
physicality of the bird the timidity of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.020 
physicality of the bird the timidity of
the<00:01:05.820> bird<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.860> know<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.220> whether<00:01:08.850> they

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the bird and you know just whether they

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.719 
the bird and you know just whether they
can<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:09.540> hold<00:01:09.780> up<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.290> being<00:01:11.280> threatened

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
can really hold up to being threatened

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.190 
can really hold up to being threatened
by<00:01:11.760> another<00:01:12.030> bird<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.780> birds<00:01:12.990> are

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
by another bird if your birds are

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.890 
by another bird if your birds are
flighted<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:13.979> much<00:01:14.189> easier<00:01:14.700> because<00:01:14.909> birds

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
flighted it's much easier because birds

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.800 
flighted it's much easier because birds
go<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.680> an<00:01:16.860> operative<00:01:17.610> basis<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.240> fight<00:01:18.570> or

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
go on an operative basis of fight or

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.450 
go on an operative basis of fight or
flight<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:19.799> they<00:01:19.920> see<00:01:19.979> something

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
flight and if they see something

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.700 
flight and if they see something
unpleasant<00:01:20.729> they<00:01:21.180> will<00:01:21.450> leave<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:22.049> your<00:01:22.500> bird

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
unpleasant they will leave if your bird

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.440 
unpleasant they will leave if your bird
is<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:22.950> flighted<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.850> won't<00:01:24.060> be<00:01:24.210> able<00:01:24.360> to

escape as readily and you have to be
extra<00:01:26.580> watchful<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.299> sort<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.630> situation

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.069 
birds a budgies foot could be snapped
off<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.399> an<00:01:44.490> instant<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.149> would<00:01:45.420> probably

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
off in an instant and you would probably

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.630 
off in an instant and you would probably
not<00:01:46.229> even<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> time<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.340> do<00:01:47.430> anything

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
not even have the time to do anything

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.389 
not even have the time to do anything
about<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.240> same<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.630> cockatiel

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
about it the same of the cockatiel

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.399 
about it the same of the cockatiel
however<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:51.030> also<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.659> watch<00:01:51.810> range<00:01:52.200> of

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
however you also have to watch range of

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.889 
however you also have to watch range of
motion<00:01:52.860> if<00:01:52.979> you've<00:01:53.640> got<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.180> budgie<00:01:54.659> that's

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
motion if you've got a budgie that's

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.410 
motion if you've got a budgie that's
flighted<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.590> he<00:01:55.829> flies<00:01:56.070> over<00:01:56.310> Moluccan<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
flighted and he flies over Moluccan the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.969 
flighted and he flies over Moluccan the
Malakand<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.899> probably<00:01:58.350> going<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.619> wig<00:01:58.799> out

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
Malakand is probably going to wig out

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.830 
Malakand is probably going to wig out
and<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.820> not<00:02:00.030> good<00:02:00.240> for<00:02:00.270> either<00:02:00.479> bird

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
and that's not good for either bird

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.600 
and that's not good for either bird
because<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.320> Moluccan<00:02:01.890> could<00:02:02.070> do<00:02:02.189> something

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
because the Moluccan could do something

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.999 
because the Moluccan could do something
that<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.149> budgie<00:02:04.020> would<00:02:04.170> regret<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
that the budgie would regret and the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.980 
that the budgie would regret and the
budget<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.520> definitely<00:02:06.060> already<00:02:06.630> doing

budget is definitely already doing

budget is definitely already doing
something<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.530> motion<00:02:07.890> regrets<00:02:08.250> so

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
something that the motion regrets so

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.999 
something that the motion regrets so
