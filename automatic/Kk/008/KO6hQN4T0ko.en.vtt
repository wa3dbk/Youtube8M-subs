00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:04.669
 Y 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.250
 do not 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.250
 Y 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:21.670
 because nothing happens but if you 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.590
 does a little bit of withdrawal inside the eye 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.580
 I was a week almost without seeing a 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.580
 Cornea aggression like this 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.360
 in the tree of this one's life 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.330
 that is, if you knew the mills 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.330
 olive was yours 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:12.049
 It is called if I gave a grant called yuck 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.049
 poses life with a little milk 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.860
 from that plant 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.420
 is in Peru is authorized for cancer 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.130
 lupus aids 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.130
 it makes a single and roasted tomato 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.110
 and that milk that comes out of here once 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.760
 it is picking 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.130
 three drops of this milk has to do 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.369
 in the wound in the oldest part of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.960
 but it hurts because then more 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.369
 I knew 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.369
 wait to see her 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.290
 You already know that this action has been 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.290
 denial at night and how is 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.840
 d 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.840
 how 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.780
 It's not based watching latex 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.910
 little and you must three drops in a liter of 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.980
 water is the treatment of a day you 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:29.560
 and how powerful 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.560
 those pedro in the handling 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.620
 you know mini for restaurants that 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.470
 we live from the restaurants in 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.270
 so much that they do not have their taste 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.270
 They are very nice for military cargo 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.070
 I agree 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.380
 they have already cut us all in a plant 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.010
 also tropical that makes a melon that 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.800
 It looks like a cucumber with a small size 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.300
 there under iron weasel group of the lord 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.250
 also a radish has flower but the most 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.770
 important is the flower, so we 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.080
 we take it for salad by cutting it 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.950
 always tender short and vote back 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.950
 and return it caresses 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.210
 the marine fennel fountains 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.070
 they will be computer scientists to do that 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.070
 interest in contracts 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.520
 good 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.230
 lemon cheese 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.230
 testimony 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.350
 here is a plant 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.470
 also lazy 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.240
 they hit omar bad 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.920
 and it seems that according to scientific studies 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.330
 that can be very powerful for cancer 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.550
 lung 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.340
 you can adapt here we are not cutting and 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.620
 drying happens that we can not 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.850
 risk ourselves 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.870
 to recommend it 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.000
 only our scientists will pass 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.700
 because knowing that the lime width and the 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.220
 gallons and everything would be working here in 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.710
 do a test of this test 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.480
 is for each cell can play 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.660
 but good we see that it adapts or cultivates 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.350
 it's digital 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.350
 all digital 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.960
 this is the digital 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.500
 but the heart 13 toxic but you have to 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.500
 go small doses 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.440
 If the digital tractor is for 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.920
 heart disease and it is a very plant 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.340
 poisonous that we do not have defined for 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.260
 sulfatar fruits with insecticide 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:50.870
 we do not have defined by technically 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.870
 beautiful form donates a lot of care too 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.850
 but be very careful that I am toxic 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.420
 these seeds be very careful with the 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.270
 Belladonna 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.700
 those are the most toxic plants there are 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.710
 who lived media what leads 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.390
 this in the bag says that if we touch it 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.760
 arrive we die and you take it in the 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.150
 seed bag of life she carries 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:17.110
 homeopathy for the throat and for 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.060
 when there is a condition and so on but 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.690
 very toxic plants and if it was not 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.690
 teasing 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.159
 down 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.060
 a plant that is from our country this 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.430
 yes it is 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:41.050
 and investigations that speak of very 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.050
 potent for regenerating osteoporosis 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.660
 well we are starting to try with 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.320
 women 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.270
 It is very serious to see if we have better 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:56.940
 apart from the other differences but 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:59.300
 it has to be the university is that it does not 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.300
 goes to the mountain 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:10.130
 and geraniums also climatic products 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:18.160
 and they are different smells 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.160
 thanks to different essential oils 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.689
 for me today 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:27.389
 all this so that people can go 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:29.639
 envisioning to cultivate nothing describes 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:32.580
 what will have started, I'll go there 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.620
 the banks of the rivers and we left the 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.180
 monroe school for the gal and I took a 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.759
 navajilla that maybe had some 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.219
 friend who earns a treasure has a 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:43.830
 Navarre and there we go, and what 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:45.960
 you will cut it and we would make cigars and go 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.889
 like we're taking that is 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.889
 changing the licorice 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:07:01.289
 I would not say the monkey thistle each 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:03.900
 to see how it will ELBA flowers in 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:07.169
 first year we have it in which it happens that 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:09.710
 It adapts well the cultivation of cold 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:09.710
 from the quadra salcedo 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:17.910
 he always carried in his pocket some 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.650
 how many cardamom seeds do you imagine? 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.650
 what he will not know is what man does not 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:27.420
 you will have seen shamans tribes I do not know who 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:29.100
 he is the one who protects I do not know what he knows them 

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.920
 domestic level as are doses 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.570
 infinitesimals that worked them 

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.640
 he played and he left them again in the 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.380
 pocket shocked me is just a 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.090
 Comment on a very powerful plant 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.090
 but we do not dominate this for what 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.690
 Y 

00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:51.240
 Y 

00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:58.479
 Y 

00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:05.479
 Y
