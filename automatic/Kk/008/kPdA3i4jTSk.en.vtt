probability<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.620> well<00:02:54.270> turn<00:02:55.270> it<00:02:55.390> out<00:02:55.510> turn

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
probability that well turn it out turn

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:07.250 
probability that well turn it out turn
this<00:02:56.200> thing<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.800> other<00:02:56.980> side

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.510 

really<00:03:08.260> hard<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.590> do<00:03:08.740> are<00:03:09.160> harder<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.580> do

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
piggy here's another tip I just made up

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.660 
piggy here's another tip I just made up

take the wrench off the screwed on and
the<00:03:27.790> screwdriver<00:03:29.460> and<00:03:30.460> then<00:03:30.760> when<00:03:30.910> it's<00:03:31.030> tight

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
the screwdriver and then when it's tight

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:43.570 
the screwdriver and then when it's tight
enough<00:03:31.270> so<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:32.110> can<00:03:32.230> paint<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.560> completely

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:52.930 

and<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.150> can<00:03:44.420> use<00:03:44.570> paint<00:03:44.930> it<00:03:45.080> more

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.470
