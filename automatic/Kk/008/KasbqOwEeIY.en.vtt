00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 aero and there shorter part 2 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.889
 cut it on the gash more precisely gash on 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.290
 Cut means that we have been bought 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.900
 by the way we are all honest we are people 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.090
 not rich in general honestly this car here 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.340
 look there it will be as you think 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.300
 how much can it cost with documents 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.420
 Now she does it all goes Starts 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.920
 great by themselves and itâ€™s not putrid here 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.019
 so imagine just imagine 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.630
 who who guesses that well done I sort of 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.309
 I'll tell you now anyway 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.210
 interesting guess guess not guess 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:43.620
 how much it can cost 8 drum 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.940
 fraction of 44 thousand rubles, I am not honest 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.280
 I say forty four thousand rubles here 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.579
 please car subaru impreza 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.160
 so was bought for what for 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.020
 to open the hood throw it away 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.640
 one and a half liter shit from here but not 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.930
 shit engine is generally normal then 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.359
 looking for what purposes for our purposes 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.359
 he doesn't seem to throw out very much 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.240
 put here here so here here 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.010
 hence the engine of decoction x but because 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.640
 then the engine is worth doing i was sergey 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.640
 does not burn at all 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.640
 Well, do not pay tax by the way if you 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.560
 such a card let's review now 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.720
 do on her but still since she 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.450
 give us our hands let me show you all 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.580
 as soon as possible so little 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.920
 perished on this one 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.080
 and the difference from the usual vrx is by the way 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.240
 first-generation impreza see such 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.060
 funds here are more aggressive trellis 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.930
 another well naturally bumper another 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.390
 here on the diagram everything is different 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.060
 by the way pay attention to labor I 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.980
 papal crankcase protection for terraces see 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.580
 protect the crater along with this sensor 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.470
 impreza 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:50.370
 well fun done so let's go inside but 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.250
 we have the steering wheel right mechanic but glasses 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.170
 of course without frames everything is elite 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.960
 we have almost a beggar equipment 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.330
 the conditioner is electroglasses that is 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.700
 Well, show here inside with glass 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.350
 for some reason, but usually now here here 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.420
 all these buttons are but here here 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.940
 so here are done and since the right 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.830
 for example, I immediately thought that the wheel 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.360
 here is this driver but it turns out 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.250
 Driver authors of this because all the same 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.280
 mirror turn signals here with us 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.260
 on the right it turns out the wipers here on the left and 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.850
 wipers see this way 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.620
 Voytyuk street what I said there she is not 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.320
 start up that is well spoken start up 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.209
 here we will prove 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.209
 please 44 thousand rubles 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.690
 here but how can she go so come 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.210
 the cabin review well there is of course such 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.300
 asceticism minimalism there is no pillows 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.810
 Bibikova so sad a little bit 44000 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.490
 bibikat let's go on the buttons go have 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.750
 such a huge button I do not know why 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.050
 so big probably often 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.120
 used rear window heating 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.330
 left emergency gang steering and us adjustment 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.400
 steering adjustment years eat forward backward 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:04.020
 but no removal means we have size 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.660
 there must be some other buttons here 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.860
 buttons but they donâ€™t hope for not only 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.170
 more expensive trim levels 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.700
 there is an adjustment of mirrors but by the way not 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.870
 we are on the edge of the mirror 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.430
 evolved so there is no climate 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.350
 here is the usual conditioner with them 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.110
 center console well, so of course 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.160
 it looks sadly switch and 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.930
 felt it is not electric 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.680
 I feel the effort and I feel something 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.570
 thrust 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.660
 switches guides here 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.300
 air flow is directed then downwards upwards 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.780
 rook air conditioning eat warm cold 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.730
 interior recycling 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.160
 the volume of the stove mafon is mafon 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.020
 Chinese is certainly not a native ashtray 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.580
 PU rollers with eccentric and elite barrels 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.220
 I do not know cigarettes now such cigarettes 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.570
 whale is well shorter mechanics first 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.580
 transfer look at instructions 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.160
 the activity of the action is written 1 1 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.010
 it would seem to yourself but no it is 5 that is 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.220
 on my own as well as on the left hand 1 2 3 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.450
 so the trickle of the armrest there is nothing 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.640
 but here probably should be a button 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.420
 for the machine if there is a winter mode 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:11.760
 economy mode so let's open 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.710
 trunk well that's putrid he decided 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.540
 sit down from the gate capture lasted 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.460
 run into what looked there 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.590
 rottenness is the only minus that's over forty 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.390
 four thousand that is that's rotten 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.510
 Apparently someone sees a pen fleet 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.700
 digested and not for that sucks 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.050
 processed only painted in the rain but u 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.150
 we plan can be from here 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.370
 rearrange wait on the light c 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.380
 Well, at least too a little putty but 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.620
 right side everything is awesome then left 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.990
 and to the right is such a rot la give trunk 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.920
 open this trunk also rotted 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.080
 Maritsa here is water and rotten 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.510
 there is a well we have a normal cap 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.230
 trunk can put put it 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:54.070
 night tank for rear window fluid 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.210
 here did you eat it here 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.980
 Antenna electrical on fucking not 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.360
 it works but you can hear it 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.270
 tyk tyk tyk tyck ignition included 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.810
 a motor that will create training and 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.550
 I do not know the training grid some 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.980
 put mosquito mirror 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:14.330
 toning show mirror tonirovochka 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.500
 I will reach see what camera 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.090
 mass he said that we shoot 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.380
 on mobile we see gd written and d 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.420
 so something else fart well let's show 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.770
 engine and wrestling wrestling decided 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.660
 show wrestling there is wrestling so 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.300
 Chapter 2 now I'll show you the hood 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.680
 Well, honestly we bought the engine here 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.220
 problematic because what we have motor 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:42.410
 there to the car rides the vehicle starts up but 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:45.040
 and and overheated considering knocking became nina 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.870
 no one understood began to knock a 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.640
 overheated why 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.070
 see they have a weak point 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:56.090
 weak without a crack cracked radiator 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:58.730
 all liquid has evaporated and into the motor 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.280
 overheated but the wedge did not catch it 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.640
 he starts up a little taps 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.800
 boxer motor 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.570
 one and a half liter but who said that 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.420
 it is difficult to change the candles look here 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.190
 she is a candle that is elementary 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.900
 stealing up and changing but new market 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.940
 Of course not to change and a lot of Rex 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.670
 here it is longer and here is the candle and 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.500
 distance somewhere in the finger that is well and 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.120
 at the cottage engine and raise the candles 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.370
 change here everything is easy and simple 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.730
 watch how cool done on top 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.450
 access generator is a compressor 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.180
 air conditioner 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.440
 it's power steering all very comfortable 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.480
 change there is something very broken 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.250
 engine repairable 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.590
 one and a half liter how many this car 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.600
 200 mileage too probably there but in general 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.750
 200,000 but if not overheated I think 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:45.110
 on chase would chase and chase big 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:49.820
 hole under the windshield washer yes 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:52.760
 exactly test is convenient so in general 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.400
 for the people for the hip make the fifth year 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.750
 my name is called to pronounce 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:03.410
 old woman so close the hood 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.820
 this old part broke nothing though u 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.830
 we are here the hood will not know 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:10.970
 we will not immediately move that one 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:14.180
 dude and this one knows about this dude only 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:16.040
 people who are between 20 and 20 to 30 years old 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.720
 there is and over thirty you do not know what 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.970
 is it if before the 20th you also 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.640
 only know the work of dudes knows what it is 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.890
 it means but to all the guys here is so small 

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.350
 The review turned out to be something that is not a male review 

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:30.770
 Part 2 of this review review 

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:33.620
 cut that is, we will now be in the third 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.510
 engine parts understand and here classen 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.810
 most likely the rear arches also sawed and 

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:42.430
 put but also a box so all 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.430
 subscribe put like buy
