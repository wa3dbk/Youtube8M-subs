00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello everyone here I am my second 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.240
 little video to show you my 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.759
 team on call manager you can 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.440
 better at the same thanks to his 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:17.430
 technique that I showed you when 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.480
 my previous video then see my 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.109
 team that could be said to be a work 90 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.800
 of collectives their ranks of attackers 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:31.679
 left in b 6 with van persie 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.969
 at first I wanted but suarez but he 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.969
 has a red card so that is 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.980
 sanctioned for until now 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.460
 still a long time 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:46.500
 but if it is futile to break after 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.710
 work for wayne shirt the tan chew 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.629
 what is this post I prefer here when 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.109
 when vua promised place and on styger 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:01.489
 with iniesta on the right 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:05.040
 gr and rebel and left jornal do 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.210
 defender then for s is composed mis 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.159
 that three defenders 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.650
 I prefer that way I can put more 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.049
 Forward I put tia go silva 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.930
 sergio ramos the soul is not necessarily 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.610
 a defender but I prefer to put it 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:25.820
 like that I commit two players 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:30.270
 after g courte I pique modric 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.549
 Ribéry neymar and assumes what is 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.000
 really good this is my best 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.030
 scorer the loaf king ten or twelve goals 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.200
 is really super strong near josi 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.720
 alas these players I never use 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.890
 otherwise it would be a player of Barça it 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.530
 savarin players are they are strong but 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.860
 good I prefer to take the strongest to 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:01.040
 every post that you can see I have 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:08.610
 a good team then 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:09.470
 gold see the safar chart and this loan for 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.200
 a match 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.040
 gg boost the game and suddenly fights 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.870
 it's going to be a draw when I had 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.400
 a far better team on the 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.100
 paper 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.580
 I should have won but not so we can 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.630
 see I'm at this first equality that the 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:36.210
 real madrid hugo lavera I have more than 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:38.760
 points but that's it 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.940
 so here I hope you would have liked the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.510
 little video showing you my big 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.060
 team 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.300
 oh yes to the goalkeeper jean elsewhere the ticket 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.850
 tell you very very good role I pass I 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.420
 take no goal with him so 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.880
 thank you very much veiled and subscribe there 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.040
 put a little green thumb especially 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.840
 watched my previous video power 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.140
 do this team that is really 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.440
 heavy and with which I lose 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.890
 practically never fragile beat and 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.890
 ciao
