00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.070
 Hi, I'm Pamela, I want cupcakes in 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.469
 collaboration with maria luna rings 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.210
 dotcom today I'm going to show you how to do 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.140
 these glamorous chocolate macarons 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.730
 with lemon filling course 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.320
 to make the shell of the macarons 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.539
 we will make a marzipan and a meringue 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.449
 Italian for marzipan we need 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.849
 aysÃ©n sugar light almond flour 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.250
 of egg and cocoa powder and for 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.180
 Italian meringue sugar egg whites 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.700
 and water 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.280
 we started with the marzipan for it 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.960
 sift the almond flour come on 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.270
 tapping the colander so that the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.070
 flour is well finite 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.720
 we can also help one another 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.960
 spoon to undo the lumps of the 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.960
 flour 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.000
 if at the end of the screening we see that only 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.090
 remains of flour that do not pass through 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.980
 the strainer we discard them 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.290
 we will repeat this process once again 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.390
 sieving is super important about 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.010
 all at the time of making macarons since 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.180
 this step will allow us to shell 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.180
 be totally smooth 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.219
 if necessary we will discard again 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.509
 the flour that does not pass through the colander 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.100
 after this double sieving and 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.520
 we will have almond flour well 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.890
 finite 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.850
 sifted flour on the racing 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.850
 sugar and cocoa 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.290
 mix with a spoon all 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.930
 ingredients and we finish them again 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.120
 this time all together 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.800
 As you can see, I put a lot of effort into this 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.100
 process so that the macarons are the 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.259
 most perfect possible 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.960
 add the egg white and stir 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.000
 all right 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.220
 the humidity of the clear will help us 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.080
 form the marzipan for this we must 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.540
 Mix everything very well so you do not 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.760
 there are dry parts 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.650
 once we have the marzipan what 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.650
 We reserve and we put with the meringue 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.630
 Italian 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.750
 we started beating the egg whites until 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.880
 have them firm at first what 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.620
 we do at low speed and when 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.090
 let's see that they start to fade 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.890
 at medium speed 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.080
 how do we know when they are first 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.840
 clear then we put the bowl upside down and 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.239
 if they do not fall they are ready 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.550
 On the other hand we put in a saucepan the 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.440
 sugar and water 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.910
 it is not necessary to remove the syrup 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.090
 you just have to let it boil 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.200
 always checking it with a thermometer 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.120
 It is important that you use a 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.800
 thermometer suitable for sugar of the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.290
 otherwise it can be damaged with this 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.180
 such a high temperature when the 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.480
 syrup temperature reach around 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.700
 of 118 degrees we'll have it ready 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.560
 now while we beat again the 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.740
 clear pour the syrup in the form of 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.020
 thread 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.790
 and we will do it very little by little to 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.340
 drop a very thin trickle but 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.230
 constant 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.690
 make sure that the syrup falls 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.910
 only on the clear ones never in the 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.530
 bolo rods otherwise 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.040
 sugar will crystallize with the contrast 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.110
 Of temperature 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.969
 once we have poured all the syrup 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.430
 we will continue beating until we temper the 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.500
 Meringue 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.000
 when we have the meringue ready 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.150
 we mix with the marzipan we made 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.250
 before 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.180
 and with a pastry language we integrate it 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.180
 with enveloping movements 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.969
 we must mix until our dough 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.969
 reach the point of tape 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.459
 ah 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.080
 We will know that you are at your point when 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.650
 drop the dough let's see what falls in 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.650
 tape shape 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.900
 to dose the dough we will use 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.180
 a very comfortable device called deco max 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.159
 the deco max comes a kit from the brand you 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.709
 It was special for macarons along with the 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.360
 silicone baking mat 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.459
 we put all the mass inside and close 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.049
 well we just have to press 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.659
 gently to leave a small 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.209
 portion of dough in each position as 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.280
 You see each circle has another circle 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.170
 tiny inside it so we have 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.599
 that try to put the mass of the marked 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.040
 in this circle tiniest this we 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.689
 will serve as a guide so that when 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.060
 expand the macarons do not touch of 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:16.970
 each other we continue like this until filling 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.010
 all the circles on the mat when 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.440
 are ready we drop the tray in 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.419
 the work table 3 or 4 times like this 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.639
 we will remove all possible bubbles 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.320
 air mass and step will help 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.750
 that all the little pits of 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.090
 the surface 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.490
 now we will let them dry between 30 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.590
 minutes and 4 hours I live at the level of 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.600
 sea so my city has a lot 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.980
 humidity so in my case they have taken 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.960
 four hours to dry 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.700
 when we can touch them without getting dirty 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.970
 they will be ready to take them to 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.970
 oven 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.690
 fresh out of the oven we leave them 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.840
 rest on the mat until they are 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.060
 completely cold 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.669
 once cold and we can take them off 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.530
 without breaking in the attempt here 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.560
 we can see how the top has 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.320
 it is well lawful the foot has been formed 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.490
 characteristic of the marked and the part 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.490
 lower has remained flat 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.220
 we take off all the macarons and 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.220
 we leave ready to fill them 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.740
 for the filling we will make a German kurt 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:31.870
 for this we need sugar lemons 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.940
 butter lemon zest and eggs 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.010
 we started by squeezing the juice of 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.010
 lemons to get 80 milliliters 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.890
 we prepare the case for bain marie 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.320
 we add the eggs and the sugar with 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.990
 We stir rods very well to avoid 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.750
 that the eggs set 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.500
 Then we add the lemon juice and 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.500
 we mix again 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.729
 when everything is well integrated 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.729
 we add the lemon zest 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.700
 little by little we will see that the 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:11.130
 cream is taking more and more body 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.980
 in 5 or 6 minutes we will have it with the 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.660
 adequate consistency we remove the case 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.820
 fire and spent the cream by 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.990
 strainer to leave it very thin and without 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.990
 pieces of lemon zest 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.440
 with the cream still hot we add the 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.280
 butter and stir until it 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.280
 melt completely 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.550
 once melted we cover the skin with 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.350
 kitchen clint this means that the 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.539
 film will be in contact with all the 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.310
 surface of the cream in this way 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:45.680
 we will avoid that the surface of the cream 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.600
 it dries 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.550
 When it is ready, we take it to the 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.650
 refrigerator and let it rest a minimum of 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.660
 2 hours 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.199
 once cold it will have the consistency 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.199
 perfect 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.830
 we put it in a pastry bag 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:05.780
 and with the help of a round mouthpiece 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.780
 let's fill our macarons 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.100
 be careful not to crush too much 

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.580
 the upper shell so that the filling 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.800
 do not overflow 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.780
 to finish with a flourish and never 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.729
 rather we will decorate the macarons with 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.289
 a food gold this will give you a 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:24.169
 unique shine that will surprise everyone 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:25.610
 your guests the combination of 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:27.349
 lemon and chocolate will surprise you 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.629
 pleasantly it is a mixture of flavors 

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:31.639
 bitter with acid and sweet touches to the 

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:33.199
 time a whole explosion of flavors that 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:35.599
 activate our senses to edit 

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:37.189
