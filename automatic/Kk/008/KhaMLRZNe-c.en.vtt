some<00:02:18.520> other<00:02:18.670> different<00:02:19.510> type<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.840> leaf<00:02:20.050> I'll

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
some other different type of leaf I'll

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.010 
some other different type of leaf I'll
show<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.530> how<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.680> do<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.070> as<00:02:21.280> well<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:22.510> let

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
like I said wipe the rim down just to

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.050 
like I said wipe the rim down just to
round<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.620> off<00:02:32.769> I<00:02:33.100> don't<00:02:33.459> want<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.760> be<00:02:33.880> even

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
round it off I don't want it to be even

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.320 
round it off I don't want it to be even
first<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.950> has<00:02:36.130> been<00:02:36.250> oval<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:37.090> showed

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
show you how to do is to make a leaf

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.039 
show you how to do is to make a leaf
like<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:49.690> what<00:02:50.320> I<00:02:50.350> do<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:50.920> take<00:02:52.049> and

like that and what I do is I take and

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.789 
like that and what I do is I take and
roll<00:02:53.290> out<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.680> clay<00:02:53.830> of<00:02:54.280> porcelain<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:56.470> kind

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
roll out the clay of porcelain in kind

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.590 
roll out the clay of porcelain in kind
of<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:56.950> football<00:02:57.370> shape<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.880> little<00:02:58.000> bit<00:02:58.180> more

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
of a football shape a little bit more

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.539 
of a football shape a little bit more
tapered<00:02:58.930> at<00:02:59.410> one<00:02:59.620> end<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.130> other<00:03:00.160> end

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
tapered at one end and the other end

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.900 
tapered at one end and the other end
like<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:04.170> right<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.410> then<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.920> start

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
like that right and then I start

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.789 
like that right and then I start
squeezing<00:03:07.269> it<00:03:07.600> with<00:03:07.810> my<00:03:07.989> thumb's<00:03:08.290> together

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
squeezing it with my thumb's together

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.070 
squeezing it with my thumb's together
like<00:03:09.130> this<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.730> can<00:03:10.269> see<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.709> go<00:03:11.709> down<00:03:11.950> and

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
like this you can see that go down and

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.020 
like this you can see that go down and
the<00:03:14.080> thumbs<00:03:14.530> being<00:03:14.860> right<00:03:15.340> next<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:15.910> each

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
the thumbs being right next to each

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.330 
the thumbs being right next to each
other<00:03:16.209> like<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.780> forms<00:03:17.380> is<00:03:17.620> lying<00:03:17.950> going

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
other like that forms is lying going

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.630 
other like that forms is lying going
down<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.640> center<00:03:18.850> that's<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:20.100> inner<00:03:21.100> part<00:03:21.519> of

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
down the center that's the inner part of

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.610 
down the center that's the inner part of
the<00:03:21.790> leaf

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.650 

the<00:03:25.010> vein<00:03:25.220> going<00:03:25.550> down<00:03:25.880> there<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.300> saw<00:03:26.569> I'm

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
the vein going down there and I saw I'm

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.960 
the vein going down there and I saw I'm
doing<00:03:27.140> that<00:03:27.260> over<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.530> over<00:03:27.650> again<00:03:27.970> thinning

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
doing that over and over again thinning

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.020 
doing that over and over again thinning
the<00:03:29.090> leaf<00:03:29.270> out<00:03:29.450> as<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:29.780> go<00:03:30.640> keep<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.670> top

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
the leaf out as I go keep the top

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.300 
the leaf out as I go keep the top
pointed<00:03:32.540> do<00:03:33.349> different<00:03:33.709> shapes<00:03:33.920> of<00:03:34.099> leaves

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
pointed do different shapes of leaves

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.140 
pointed do different shapes of leaves
obviously<00:03:36.069> okay<00:03:37.069> and<00:03:37.220> then<00:03:37.340> when<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.550> get<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:37.849> as

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
obviously okay and then when I get it as

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.970 
obviously okay and then when I get it as
thin<00:03:38.420> as<00:03:38.569> I<00:03:38.690> think<00:03:38.750> I<00:03:39.020> want<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.410> more<00:03:39.800> or<00:03:39.920> less

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
thin as I think I want it more or less

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.360 
thin as I think I want it more or less
I'll<00:03:40.849> do<00:03:41.030> one<00:03:41.269> last<00:03:41.569> push<00:03:42.200> with<00:03:42.739> my<00:03:42.890> fingers

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
I'll do one last push with my fingers

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.070 
I'll do one last push with my fingers
this<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.060> a<00:03:44.269> real<00:03:45.099> definite<00:03:46.099> push<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:46.730> now<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:47.080> do

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
this is a real definite push so now I do

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.390 
this is a real definite push so now I do
both<00:03:48.290> of<00:03:48.319> them<00:03:48.590> at<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.739> same<00:03:48.830> time<00:03:48.980> both

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
both of them at the same time both

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.210 
both of them at the same time both
thumbs<00:03:49.670> at<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.300> same<00:03:50.480> time<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:50.900> push<00:03:51.140> in<00:03:51.410> move

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
thumbs at the same time and push in move

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.640 
thumbs at the same time and push in move
down<00:03:52.489> again

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
down again

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.120 
down again
actually<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:54.680> usually<00:03:54.860> step<00:03:55.400> down<00:03:55.610> like<00:03:55.819> that

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
actually I usually step down like that

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.920 
actually I usually step down like that
make<00:03:58.130> sure<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:58.430> don't<00:03:58.580> go<00:03:59.120> over<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.510> line

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
make sure you don't go over that line

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.780 
make sure you don't go over that line
but<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.500> hope<00:04:00.769> that<00:04:01.010> shows<00:04:01.190> up<00:04:01.430> on<00:04:01.519> the<00:04:01.640> video

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
but I hope that shows up on the video

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.729 
but I hope that shows up on the video
but<00:04:02.180> then<00:04:02.720> that<00:04:02.900> gives<00:04:03.110> you<00:04:03.230> kind<00:04:03.410> of<00:04:03.470> veins

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
but then that gives you kind of veins

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.770 
but then that gives you kind of veins
going<00:04:04.190> out<00:04:04.400> plus<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:04.940> central<00:04:05.360> vein<00:04:05.569> going

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
going out plus the central vein going

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.289 
going out plus the central vein going
down<00:04:06.049> like<00:04:06.230> that<00:04:06.400> it's<00:04:07.400> pretty<00:04:07.580> simple<00:04:07.970> the

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
down like that it's pretty simple the

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:09.520 
down like that it's pretty simple the
main<00:04:08.510> thing<00:04:08.780> if<00:04:08.900> you<00:04:08.989> wanted<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.290> look<00:04:09.470> good

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
main thing if you wanted to look good

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.789 
main thing if you wanted to look good
the<00:04:10.010> leaf<00:04:10.340> has<00:04:10.610> to<00:04:10.790> end<00:04:10.970> up<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.330> be<00:04:11.450> thin<00:04:11.810> it's

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
the leaf has to end up to be thin it's

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.820 
the leaf has to end up to be thin it's
thick<00:04:13.099> it<00:04:13.310> just<00:04:14.030> looks<00:04:14.239> clunky<00:04:14.720> so<00:04:15.530> there<00:04:15.709> I've

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
thick it just looks clunky so there I've

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.690 
thick it just looks clunky so there I've
got<00:04:15.860> four<00:04:16.310> of<00:04:16.430> those<00:04:16.609> kind<00:04:16.940> of<00:04:17.000> leaves<00:04:18.700> I'll

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
got four of those kind of leaves I'll

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.840 
got four of those kind of leaves I'll
show<00:04:19.940> you<00:04:20.000> how<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.299> do<00:04:20.510> now<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:22.130> other<00:04:22.400> type<00:04:22.669> of

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
show you how to do now the other type of

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.180 
show you how to do now the other type of
leaf<00:04:23.030> this<00:04:23.240> this<00:04:23.660> long<00:04:23.960> one<00:04:24.290> here<00:04:24.560> I<00:04:24.830> don't

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
leaf this this long one here I don't

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.620 
leaf this this long one here I don't
know<00:04:25.490> if<00:04:25.580> you<00:04:25.700> can<00:04:25.850> see<00:04:26.060> but<00:04:26.240> it's<00:04:26.419> got<00:04:26.600> a

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
know if you can see but it's got a

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.110 
know if you can see but it's got a
design<00:04:27.050> going<00:04:27.320> up<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:27.710> down<00:04:27.830> things<00:04:28.280> to<00:04:29.000> do

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
design going up and down things to do

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.760 
design going up and down things to do
that<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:31.660> take<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.690> little<00:04:32.900> bit<00:04:33.020> of<00:04:33.080> clay<00:04:33.289> here<00:04:33.590> I

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
that I take a little bit of clay here I

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.650 
that I take a little bit of clay here I
assume<00:04:34.640> you<00:04:34.760> can<00:04:34.880> do<00:04:34.970> this<00:04:35.120> with<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.360> stems

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
assume you can do this with the stems

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.090 
assume you can do this with the stems
that's<00:04:36.020> just<00:04:36.229> rolled<00:04:36.500> out<00:04:36.680> it's<00:04:36.890> just<00:04:37.010> a

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
that's just rolled out it's just a

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.029 
that's just rolled out it's just a
little<00:04:37.220> thin<00:04:37.610> coil<00:04:38.000> I<00:04:38.330> want<00:04:39.110> to<00:04:39.169> slightly<00:04:39.560> damp

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
little thin coil I want to slightly damp

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.090 
little thin coil I want to slightly damp
surface<00:04:40.550> but<00:04:40.669> not<00:04:40.729> not<00:04:41.419> wet<00:04:41.690> but<00:04:41.960> has<00:04:42.919> to<00:04:43.039> be

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
surface but not not wet but has to be

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:53.450 
surface but not not wet but has to be
nice<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.580> smooth

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.030 

so<00:04:54.030> I<00:04:54.060> roll<00:04:54.330> this<00:04:54.510> out<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:55.020> long<00:04:55.260> tapered

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
so I roll this out to a long tapered

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.290 
so I roll this out to a long tapered
coil<00:04:56.810> like<00:04:57.810> that<00:04:58.110> you<00:04:59.070> can<00:04:59.250> see<00:04:59.460> it's<00:04:59.580> thin<00:04:59.970> at

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
coil like that you can see it's thin at

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.720 
coil like that you can see it's thin at
this<00:05:00.510> end<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:01.050> at<00:05:01.140> this<00:05:01.290> end<00:05:01.530> and<00:05:01.650> a<00:05:01.740> little

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
this end and at this end and a little

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.790 
this end and at this end and a little
thicker<00:05:02.910> in<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.180> middle<00:05:03.290> it<00:05:04.290> has<00:05:04.440> to<00:05:04.560> be<00:05:04.620> nice

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
thicker in the middle it has to be nice

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
thicker in the middle it has to be nice
and<00:05:05.100> relatively<00:05:05.970> smooth<00:05:07.460> actually<00:05:08.460> if<00:05:08.730> it

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
and relatively smooth actually if it

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.800 
and relatively smooth actually if it
weren't<00:05:09.000> it<00:05:09.210> would<00:05:09.300> just<00:05:09.510> give<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:09.780> a

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
weren't it would just give you a

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.900 
weren't it would just give you a
different<00:05:09.930> shape<00:05:10.290> as<00:05:10.470> off<00:05:10.620> then<00:05:11.280> I<00:05:11.400> take<00:05:11.610> a

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
different shape as off then I take a

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.420 
different shape as off then I take a
stick<00:05:12.630> like<00:05:12.660> this<00:05:13.110> and<00:05:13.170> it's<00:05:13.680> got<00:05:13.800> real<00:05:14.100> sharp

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
stick like this and it's got real sharp

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.730 
stick like this and it's got real sharp
edges<00:05:14.700> on<00:05:15.000> it<00:05:15.060> it's<00:05:15.420> nice<00:05:15.570> and<00:05:15.870> flat<00:05:16.080> and<00:05:16.410> sharp

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
edges on it it's nice and flat and sharp

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.090 
edges on it it's nice and flat and sharp
and<00:05:17.280> smooth<00:05:17.670> smooth<00:05:18.300> here<00:05:18.740> then<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:19.830> take<00:05:20.070> that

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
and smooth smooth here then I take that

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.520 
and smooth smooth here then I take that
and<00:05:20.550> just<00:05:20.880> place<00:05:21.180> it<00:05:21.210> on<00:05:21.510> top<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:23.520> coil<00:05:24.390> I<00:05:24.750> roll

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
and just place it on top the coil I roll

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.590 
and just place it on top the coil I roll
rolled<00:05:26.010> out<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:26.490> push<00:05:26.730> on<00:05:26.940> it<00:05:27.060> kind<00:05:27.330> of<00:05:27.360> roll

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
rolled out and push on it kind of roll

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.740 
rolled out and push on it kind of roll
it<00:05:27.780> a<00:05:27.900> little<00:05:27.930> bit<00:05:29.540> pull<00:05:30.540> it<00:05:30.660> up<00:05:31.160> and<00:05:32.630> then<00:05:33.630> I

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
it a little bit pull it up and then I

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.910 
it a little bit pull it up and then I
take<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.170> sharp<00:05:34.500> edge<00:05:34.710> of<00:05:35.070> this<00:05:36.860> some<00:05:37.860> of

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
take the sharp edge of this some of

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.610 
take the sharp edge of this some of
these<00:05:38.010> edges<00:05:38.400> are<00:05:38.520> better<00:05:38.730> than<00:05:38.940> others<00:05:39.090> but

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
these edges are better than others but

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.420 
these edges are better than others but
and<00:05:40.620> just<00:05:41.660> continually<00:05:42.740> push<00:05:43.740> down<00:05:44.040> on<00:05:44.070> the

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
and just continually push down on the

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.850 
and just continually push down on the
thing<00:05:44.640> and<00:05:44.970> put<00:05:45.030> an<00:05:45.750> impression<00:05:46.350> the<00:05:46.590> length

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
thing and put an impression the length

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.930 
thing and put an impression the length
of<00:05:47.160> that<00:05:48.380> what<00:05:49.380> once<00:05:49.620> was<00:05:49.860> a<00:05:49.920> coil<00:05:50.220> of<00:05:50.250> clay<00:05:50.610> but

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
of that what once was a coil of clay but

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.120 
of that what once was a coil of clay but
now<00:05:51.090> is<00:05:51.390> a<00:05:51.660> leaf<00:05:52.110> shape<00:05:52.140> so<00:05:52.470> it's<00:05:52.620> that<00:05:52.800> that

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
now is a leaf shape so it's that that

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.660 
now is a leaf shape so it's that that
simple<00:05:53.580> and<00:05:54.500> usually<00:05:55.500> one<00:05:55.740> end<00:05:56.160> is<00:05:56.520> a<00:05:56.550> little

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
simple and usually one end is a little

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.940 
simple and usually one end is a little
more<00:05:57.480> pointy<00:05:57.810> than<00:05:58.260> the<00:05:58.380> other<00:05:58.560> and<00:05:58.860> that's

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
more pointy than the other and that's

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.950 
more pointy than the other and that's
the<00:05:59.100> one<00:05:59.280> that<00:05:59.430> I<00:05:59.490> usually<00:05:59.640> use<00:05:59.820> is<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.390> top<00:06:00.630> I

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
the one that I usually use is the top I

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.210 
the one that I usually use is the top I
might<00:06:01.500> take<00:06:01.710> the<00:06:02.460> bottom<00:06:03.270> part<00:06:03.480> here<00:06:03.810> and<00:06:04.220> roll

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
might take the bottom part here and roll

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.450 
might take the bottom part here and roll
it<00:06:05.430> a<00:06:05.520> little<00:06:05.550> bit<00:06:05.910> like<00:06:06.090> that<00:06:06.330> to<00:06:06.660> form<00:06:06.900> a<00:06:06.990> stem

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
it a little bit like that to form a stem

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.750 
it a little bit like that to form a stem
oops<00:06:08.460> and<00:06:09.420> then<00:06:09.480> I<00:06:10.320> can<00:06:10.800> continue<00:06:11.100> I<00:06:11.400> can<00:06:11.580> add<00:06:11.730> a

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
oops and then I can continue I can add a

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.390 
oops and then I can continue I can add a
little<00:06:11.940> bit<00:06:12.030> more<00:06:12.120> stem<00:06:12.540> -<00:06:13.070> you'll<00:06:14.070> want<00:06:14.190> to<00:06:14.280> do

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
little bit more stem - you'll want to do

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.280 
little bit more stem - you'll want to do
these<00:06:14.580> things<00:06:14.850> in<00:06:15.030> sequence<00:06:15.360> the<00:06:15.660> stems<00:06:15.900> first

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
these things in sequence the stems first

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.830 
these things in sequence the stems first
and<00:06:16.650> then<00:06:16.830> the<00:06:16.890> long<00:06:17.070> leaves<00:06:17.340> second<00:06:17.850> and<00:06:18.000> then

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
and then the long leaves second and then

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.600 
and then the long leaves second and then
the<00:06:18.960> shorter<00:06:19.320> leaves<00:06:19.530> third<00:06:20.190> and<00:06:20.460> then

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
the shorter leaves third and then

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.100 
the shorter leaves third and then
finally<00:06:21.000> the<00:06:21.150> flowers<00:06:21.570> and<00:06:21.810> I'll<00:06:21.870> show<00:06:22.020> you

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
finally the flowers and I'll show you

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:32.140 
finally the flowers and I'll show you
how<00:06:22.170> to<00:06:22.200> make<00:06:22.500> the<00:06:22.590> flowers<00:06:22.920> in<00:06:23.100> part<00:06:23.340> two

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.210 

you
