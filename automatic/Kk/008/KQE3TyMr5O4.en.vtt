00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
it's all one business model well that

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.910 
it's all one business model well that
makes<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.070> lot<00:00:26.189> easier<00:00:26.250> for<00:00:26.609> us<00:00:27.230> but<00:00:28.230> i<00:00:28.260> don't

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
makes it a lot easier for us but i don't

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.929 
makes it a lot easier for us but i don't
know<00:00:29.099> i<00:00:29.130> don't<00:00:29.250> think<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.820> happen

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
know i don't think it's going to happen

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.790 
know i don't think it's going to happen
any<00:00:30.510> time<00:00:30.599> soon<00:00:30.779> i<00:00:31.199> think<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.470> there<00:00:31.619> will<00:00:31.769> be

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
any time soon i think that there will be

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.580 
any time soon i think that there will be
differences<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.520> then<00:00:32.969> we'll<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.590> be

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
differences and then we'll have to be

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.930 
differences and then we'll have to be
mindful<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.370> blue<00:00:35.640> meant<00:00:35.820> those

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
mindful of and blue meant those

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.760 
mindful of and blue meant those
differences<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.840> each<00:00:37.020> market<00:00:37.410> feels<00:00:37.620> as

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
differences so that each market feels as

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.650 
differences so that each market feels as
if<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.070> product<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.610> experience<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
if the product and the experience and

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.110 
if the product and the experience and
the<00:00:39.750> service<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.350> pricing<00:00:40.770> etc<00:00:41.120> were

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the service and the pricing etc were

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.840 
the service and the pricing etc were
made<00:00:42.300> for<00:00:42.480> them<00:00:43.010> all<00:00:44.010> right<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.760> ask

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850

things<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.680> talked<00:01:37.920> about<00:01:38.009> earlier<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.380> is

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
things I talked about earlier is that is

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.859

feature set is before we start talking

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.709 
feature set is before we start talking
about<00:01:56.219> what<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.759> business<00:01:57.060> model<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.659> know

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
about what the business model is I know

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.120 
about what the business model is I know
that<00:01:57.899> there's<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.170> lot<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.350> speculation<00:01:59.040> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that there's a lot of speculation and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.010 
that there's a lot of speculation and
candidly<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.880> don't<00:02:00.060> know<00:02:00.240> yet<00:02:00.270> how

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
candidly we just don't know yet how

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
candidly we just don't know yet how
we're<00:02:01.200> going<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.380> approach<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.890> we're

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
we're going to approach it we're

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.039 
we're going to approach it we're
focusing<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.640> all<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.909> important<00:02:03.420> stuff<00:02:03.630> and

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
focusing on all the important stuff and

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.480 
focusing on all the important stuff and
I<00:02:04.259> think<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.560> lot<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.740> business<00:02:05.100> people<00:02:05.130> would

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
I think a lot of business people would

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.789 
I think a lot of business people would
say<00:02:05.670> oh<00:02:05.880> well<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.930> important<00:02:07.259> stuff<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.619> how

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
say oh well the important stuff is how

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.499 
say oh well the important stuff is how
we<00:02:07.860> generate<00:02:08.220> profit<00:02:08.879> and

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
we generate profit and

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.880 
we generate profit and
revenue<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.019> this<00:02:10.110> down<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.409> other<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.830> our

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
revenue and this down the other and our

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.070 
revenue and this down the other and our
feeling<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.580> that's<00:02:12.120> secondary<00:02:12.659> we<00:02:12.959> need

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
feeling is that that's secondary we need

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.960 
feeling is that that's secondary we need
to<00:02:13.170> focus<00:02:13.319> on<00:02:13.560> what<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.769> experience<00:02:14.069> is<00:02:14.370> make

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
to focus on what the experience is make

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.330 
to focus on what the experience is make
sure<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:15.750> gameplay<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.290> right<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.739> then

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
sure that the gameplay is right and then

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.759 
sure that the gameplay is right and then
we<00:02:18.030> wrap<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.269> business<00:02:18.689> model<00:02:19.019> around<00:02:19.079> that<00:02:19.530> and

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
we wrap a business model around that and

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.770 
we wrap a business model around that and
so<00:02:20.129> we're<00:02:20.310> just<00:02:20.340> not<00:02:20.579> at<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.760> stage<00:02:20.849> yet<00:02:21.269> but

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
so we're just not at that stage yet but

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.309 
so we're just not at that stage yet but
when<00:02:21.930> we<00:02:22.079> are<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.560> promise<00:02:23.250> we'll<00:02:23.430> let<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.879> know
