00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:08.510
 hello good afternoon today we are going to present 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.970
 the request of many what will be the 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.150
 operation of this tool the 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.250
 guard is the chrome electric pick 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.900
 that we are doing very well has the head of 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.940
 percussion and another one of rotation that goes to 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.660
 include in the game I'll show you what 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.660
 what would be the case 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.090
 and included in this case according to 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.789
 which includes what are the spare parts 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.789
 of the blades I'm going to show you 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.720
 look for so much cylinder 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.270
 security as you want to challenge for example 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.310
 we have a security 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.810
 to the serreta look also with a key 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.500
 allen and several spare screws 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.500
 I was complicating 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.460
 It also includes what would be 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.590
 the rotation head 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.420
 the percussion head that is the one 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.670
 let's perfectly use forgiveness is 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.980
 the one of percussion the one of rotation 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.720
 what is the gun and the coal 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.150
 for life 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.750
 the operation of orientar is very 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.700
 simple 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.490
 there are people who others would like a 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.810
 little with the theme of the tensor and all this 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.810
 but you are going to see what 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:30.320
 here for example this would be one 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.270
 relatively difficult to open with this 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.470
 tool not by the fact of the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.020
 operation of the electric pick 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.720
 but because the cylinders lynx I do not know if 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.330
 it will be appreciated to see if it focuses 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.910
 there it goes 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.950
 The key slot is very narrow 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.180
 then the tensor that brings us 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.490
 we would have to manufacture 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.090
 ourselves a simpler and more 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.820
 fine where I could not get in here from 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.310
 agreement yet as we can see it 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.750
 can do but it's not as comfortable as I 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.480
 so you can see in the video what I'm going 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.190
 to do is to push the cam 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.140
 a voltage mode is exactly what 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.690
 same I'm going to push the cam and we're going to 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.560
 put the pick in them inside to see if 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.560
 we got to open it 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.970
 we give tension here so that for 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:21.190
 when these turns 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.110
 that is, turn the hair that is the teeth 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.570
 inside the cylinder when applying 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.570
 of pressure unlock the lock 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.420
 there we have it 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.510
 good 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.049
 so the bowler 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.910
 when this happens working with the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.160
 electric ganzÃºa that of half turn and 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.960
 it gets stuck down I do not know if the 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.570
 camera will capture it but inside there 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.040
 a cons bolts if you go there in that 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.489
 row below 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.760
 inside you see some cons bolts if 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.549
 Focus well inside 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.540
 by the row below against but that is 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.489
 solve simply 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.629
 pressing with something may already be the pick 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.739
 or whatever that is against bolts 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.739
 pressing it again 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.890
 with a lock key simply 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.230
 against bolts that are protective for 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.600
 that because at some point it is power or 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.300
 just the cylinder and there we have it 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.600
 now for example I'm going to do it with a 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.210
 Lyceum this cylinder if it's more normal if 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.580
 it fits for example the tensioner like here 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.860
 you agree so the way 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.230
 to use it would be to introduce the tensioner in 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.390
 the opposite side to where the 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.920
 lock teeth in this case the 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.140
 They are tooth below which are 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.090
 those that we are going to hit because we put the 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.680
 tensor on the opposite side in this case 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.340
 The top 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.340
 we give tension 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.849
 we take what is the pick and the 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.970
 introduce we are going to hit what they are 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:03.820
 the teeth agree if there is something like that 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.990
 the first one is a very tool 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.820
 simple very fast 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.170
 here we have it again on the subject of 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.090
 counterweights that was commented that it is a 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.380
 type of blockage you have but you 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.240
 solution to 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.980
 pressing with something either the key or with 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.139
 anything by pressing those 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.099
 contract us 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.840
 on the other side exactly the same 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.340
 we put what is the tensor in the part 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.340
 from above we apply tension 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.210
 yes 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:42.139
 very fast very fast and for the price 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.999
 he has great 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.349
 if there is not any inquiry any 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:48.080
 doubt already known to be able to contact 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.159
 both on the web and an ad as a 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.710
 through our phone that what 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:54.849
 we will put in the youtube channel and here 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.849
 you have us for any question
