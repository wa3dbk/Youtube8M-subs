00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.920
 hey and welcome to a new video 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.470
 bastian of me probably the prince I am 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.599
 on invitation from ewt on the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.210
 international furniture fair in cologne 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.610
 and it's about the topic of electric 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.080
 stay fire the whole thing was so cool me 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.060
 have the online in a video ever 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.740
 so seen that she thought so 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.090
 I have to look at it because it is so 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.980
 Realistic that you are only on the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.480
 second look and a little bit with 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.619
 more information understands like the whole 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.390
 works and how it works 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.390
 let's have a look together 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.420
 hey 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.510
 Here we are in the booth of bwt 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.660
 which incidentally electro more with lx and me 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.430
 It's one of three holidays I've got 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.550
 said okay, I knew what it's all about 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.200
 and thought of me as a cat fan and as a 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.410
 someone as a man of cats at home 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.810
 open fire is an absolute no 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.160
 but go with this technique is and 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.900
 I thought so okay until I want 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.120
 know how that works and the 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.040
 first variant here the optimist 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.290
 that's a very cool story for me 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.229
 Here, water vapor becomes from water and 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.990
 heat in combination with light in this 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.720
 Flame generates that water vapor which becomes 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.270
 illuminated from below and through a 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.070
 light fan and the heat just after 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.110
 transported above and we have here 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.430
 LED technology in these times that is 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.110
 when I touch that 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.660
 then it gets a bit dark and 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.590
 bright so it's responsive to that 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.180
 the touch is absolutely harmless 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.869
 So there you can also cat 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.520
 have home 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.899
 the grasps with the photo reinspielt 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.140
 probably still with and it happens 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:00.140
 nothing for me the perfect fire 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.400
 It is also safer that way 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.510
 at that time already had in one 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.190
 small table fireplace with bioethanol neither 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.530
 it is with children still with pets 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.170
 sure that we have not here as 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.220
 optimist is the first variant and gives 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.510
 it also on the other 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.070
 on the other side of the stand 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.540
 again and there go the still 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.820
 Stand is in two subject areas once 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.460
 Modern , the gentleman's room is such a 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.610
 a little English 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.380
 and you can regulate it all 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.720
 that means depending on how much too long 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.050
 you want to have the thing full too 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.640
 So who's my thing or just 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:39.910
 very very low and easy times 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.340
 So it's all up here at the top 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.670
 and then we have a little bit 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.560
 adjusted that it is less and less 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.700
 Here we have the regulator and there you can 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.010
 we turn off and then the flame 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.010
 either very small 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.940
 like now or 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.350
 turn it on then you see the flame 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.520
 comes up really nice and if you 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.310
 then in the evening on the sofa and you 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.600
 is too lazy to get up and the whole 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.460
 then exit there is also one 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.360
 remote control but that comes then completely 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.360
 at the end for use 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.580
 so now we are at the next one 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.190
 electric fire namely otto flake 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.260
 flames pretty tricky about this 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.030
 understand and there is one in there 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.000
 mirror or a share with 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.640
 different set play 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.380
 almost constantly turning and lighting 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.730
 Become that mirror 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.220
 are different and different 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.170
 arranged the flames image all over 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.060
 different even a bit 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.400
 smaller flames a bit bigger 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.420
 flames and the clou on these ob 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.890
 surfaces the fireplace is that he by gesture 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.200
 can be earned so if I mean 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.040
 hand like for example here seven 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.040
 seconds ahead 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.700
 but now 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.140
 goes a demo mode and plays like that 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.930
 little bit that means here we can 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.959
 even the colors have pink flame 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.820
 then we turn pink a bit green 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.070
 would like to have then just green and me 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.480
 just notice everything shines right too 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.669
 heat out you can so too 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.690
 really use the space to a 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.889
 warm up a bit 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.320
 the real real many but there are 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.040
 another third and that active 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.540
 v 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.840
 and whether the wii actually works 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.700
 pretty old technology from the theater 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.480
 and how exactly does that work 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.830
 look at us now 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.320
 I stand now he became the same 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.780
 Variant of the v stands here in the case 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.550
 for virtual so virtual fire and 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.850
 How does that work? I explain 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.110
 you now and that is one thing 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.420
 own very old technology 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.700
 theater has been used here 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.620
 Mirror foil is used correctly is one 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.150
 he hopes a mirror image 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.570
 is projected in the case so the 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.070
 flame and live up there because they are the 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.450
 Holzscheite you just have it right now 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.220
 Seen or you can almost hear it 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.410
 then with your hand in there you can 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.840
 Seeing that right one 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.180
 illusionist and that is so perfect that 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.430
 one that one can not distinguish it 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.350
 of real or real estate fire so 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.770
 as here in the case so no real 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.680
 Fire 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.330
 he was filmed fire and this one 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.430
 recordings that will then just this 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.220
 special foil then projects 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.140
 this optical illusion allows that 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.720
 that looks like real fire and that 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.430
 whole is here in co-operation with 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.530
 spectral has that a furniture manufacturer 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:48.610
 the best known will be its clear forms 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:52.200
 and modern furniture has almost completely so 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.200
 Here's another sound system in there 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.600
 a finger print open so beautiful 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.520
 just through the speakers 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.520
 by the way, here in the pictures 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.550
 Fire inspires and accompanies us 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.000
 People have been around since the beginning 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.040
 on 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.530
 And the fire at home is just like that 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.450
 as that probably for the boatfit factor 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.260
 So it does not matter if it's chimney or not 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.420
 candles 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.040
 most of them are not possible in 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.390
 incorporate their apartment in the fireplace because 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.200
 It already very very large expenditure 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.210
 is connected 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.980
 Here it is not the case you can 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.370
 to have the home afterwards 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.370
 immediately 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.410
 that was my visit here at the booth of 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:56.969
 ibm at the imm cologne 2015 for me 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.739
 definitely a variant of 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:01.139
 Fire what I like at home 

00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:02.279
 put up and I know my cats 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:04.139
 nothing happens to the apartment 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:06.260
 nothing i have really cool effect 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:07.760
 home and can 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.010
 in the field in the enjoyment of fire 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.660
 What's the cool fire in the case ? 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.020
 So I'm convinced she's me 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.680
 curious where I will use at home 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.090
 as already mentioned 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.090
 you can do it all too 

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:23.899
 Remote control makes me have it 

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:25.580
 I 'm convinced, I 'll just go now 

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:28.009
 a little bit around, look at the mm 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.899
 and you give the video a thumbs up 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:31.580
 if you think that's just as cool as me 

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:32.539
 and write a comment where you got that 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.039
 would use at home 

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:35.149
 Thank you for turning it on and we 

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:38.709
 See you again at the next video 

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:38.709
 fire and prince bastian
