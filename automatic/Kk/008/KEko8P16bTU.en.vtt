a<00:00:17.279> capacitor<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.060> know<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.869> capacitors<00:00:19.470> and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
a capacitor I know I have capacitors and

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.710 
a capacitor I know I have capacitors and
I'm<00:00:19.800> such<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> bad<00:00:20.369> example<00:00:20.720> because

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
an upgraded alternator and it's not

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.450 
an upgraded alternator and it's not
really<00:00:27.720> doing<00:00:28.080> me<00:00:28.650> any<00:00:28.680> harm<00:00:28.920> because<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.279> run

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
really doing me any harm because I run

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.220 
really doing me any harm because I run
fifteen-point<00:00:30.179> oh<00:00:30.240> that's<00:00:30.779> besides<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
fifteen-point oh that's besides the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.590 
fifteen-point oh that's besides the
point<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.949> don't<00:00:32.130> get<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.279> cap<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.270> big<00:00:33.450> tree

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
point so don't get a cap the big tree

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.729 
point so don't get a cap the big tree
will<00:00:33.750> definitely<00:00:34.020> help<00:00:34.140> getting<00:00:34.530> bigger

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
will definitely help getting bigger

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.319 
will definitely help getting bigger
while<00:00:34.920> they're<00:00:35.160> definitely<00:00:35.280> out<00:00:35.460> but<00:00:36.120> that's

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
while they're definitely out but that's

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
video we're talking about MLAs and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.110 
video we're talking about MLAs and
regulators<00:00:40.370> well<00:00:41.370> that's<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.910> whole<00:00:42.059> different
