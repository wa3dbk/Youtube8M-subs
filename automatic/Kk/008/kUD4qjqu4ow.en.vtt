bidding and it ends up in 517 k so i did

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.150

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
than sliding tackles are absolutely

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.539 
than sliding tackles are absolutely
incredible<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.840> also<00:01:28.290> his<00:01:28.530> penalties<00:01:29.009> really

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
incredible and also his penalties really

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.550 
incredible and also his penalties really
good<00:01:29.670> with<00:01:29.790> an<00:01:29.909> 87<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.600> games<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.049> I'd<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
good with an 87 in games that I'd to

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.499 
good with an 87 in games that I'd to
take<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> few<00:01:31.979> with<00:01:32.159> him<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.460> he<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:33.030> very<00:01:33.119> good

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
take a few with him and he was very good

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.240 
take a few with him and he was very good
but<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:34.049> thing<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.500> like<00:01:34.829> about<00:01:34.860> him

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
but one thing that I do like about him

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.429 
but one thing that I do like about him
is<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.270> way<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.600> he<00:01:36.689> plays<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.079> ball<00:01:37.200> now<00:01:37.409> a

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
is the way that he plays the ball now a

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.469 
is the way that he plays the ball now a
lot<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> time<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.310> did<00:01:38.759> get<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.150> ball<00:01:39.329> with

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
lot of the time I did get the ball with

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.819 
lot of the time I did get the ball with
him<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.720> know<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:39.990> center<00:01:40.290> back<00:01:40.439> position

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
him you know in the center back position

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.380 
him you know in the center back position
obviously<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.400> i<00:01:41.640> would<00:01:41.880> run<00:01:42.090> down<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
obviously and i would run down the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.880 
obviously and i would run down the
middle<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.780> play<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.229> off<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.500> winger's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
middle and play it off to the winger's

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.620 
middle and play it off to the winger's
and<00:01:44.070> strikers<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.610> that's<00:01:44.759> one<00:01:44.970> thing<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.420> i

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
and strikers and that's one thing that i

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.060 
and strikers and that's one thing that i
did<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:46.020> probably<00:01:46.259> most<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> time<00:01:46.920> we

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
did do probably most of the time we

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.580 
did do probably most of the time we
think<00:01:47.280> because<00:01:47.579> he<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.060> quite<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:49.470> quite

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
think because he is quite it's quite

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.319 
think because he is quite it's quite
surprising<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.490> once<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.939> do<00:01:51.060> look<00:01:51.210> at

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
surprising you know once you do look at

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.270 
surprising you know once you do look at
his<00:01:51.450> pace<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:51.840> quite<00:01:52.110> low<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:52.320> once<00:01:53.100> you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
his pace it's quite low but once you

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.520 
his pace it's quite low but once you
actually<00:01:53.520> play<00:01:54.060> with<00:01:54.270> him<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.600> game<00:01:54.840> his<00:01:55.259> pace

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
actually play with him in game his pace

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.889 
actually play with him in game his pace
does<00:01:55.770> feel<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> bit<00:01:56.159> faster<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.119> he<00:01:57.450> does<00:01:57.659> feel

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
does feel a bit faster and he does feel

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.270 
does feel a bit faster and he does feel
a<00:01:57.930> bit<00:01:58.020> stronger<00:01:58.469> than<00:01:58.680> what<00:01:58.829> his<00:01:59.009> card

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
a bit stronger than what his card

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.980 
a bit stronger than what his card
actually<00:01:59.490> says<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.969> know<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.210> says<00:02:00.659> he's<00:02:00.840> like

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
actually says you know it says he's like

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.870 
actually says you know it says he's like
five<00:02:01.259> foot<00:02:01.469> ten<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.130> 60<00:02:02.579> something

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
five foot ten and like 60 something

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.370 
five foot ten and like 60 something
strength<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.840> know<00:02:03.899> once<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.200> actually

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
strength but you know once you actually

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.780 
strength but you know once you actually
get<00:02:04.619> into<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.920> game<00:02:05.070> with<00:02:05.219> him<00:02:05.399> he<00:02:05.670> actually

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
get into the game with him he actually

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.700 
get into the game with him he actually
feels<00:02:06.090> quite<00:02:06.329> strong<00:02:06.750> quite<00:02:07.049> fast<00:02:07.350> which<00:02:07.560> was

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
feels quite strong quite fast which was

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.499 
feels quite strong quite fast which was
I<00:02:07.829> was<00:02:07.950> really<00:02:08.220> surprised<00:02:08.580> by<00:02:08.759> but<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.300> was

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509
