00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
gotta say I just tried the oculus

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.780 
gotta say I just tried the oculus
prototype<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:57.619> it<00:01:57.770> was<00:01:57.920> such<00:01:58.189> an<00:01:58.460> immersive

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
prototype and it was such an immersive

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.359 
prototype and it was such an immersive
amazing<00:01:59.509> experience<00:01:59.960> that<00:02:00.710> we<00:02:00.950> pretty

quickly like it in an hour decided to

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.850 
quickly like it in an hour decided to
get<00:02:03.259> behind

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
get behind

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.920 
get behind
oh<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.430> got<00:02:04.820> to<00:02:04.940> meet<00:02:05.030> Palmer<00:02:05.330> Luckey<00:02:05.600> and

oh I got to meet Palmer Luckey and
try<00:02:06.200> out<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.500> oculus<00:02:06.920> rift<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.730> after<00:02:08.060> say<00:02:08.240> is

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
try out the oculus rift and after say is

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.999 
try out the oculus rift and after say is
a<00:02:08.450> very<00:02:08.660> exciting<00:02:09.110> moment<00:02:09.140> could<00:02:09.740> be<00:02:09.890> the

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
a very exciting moment could be the

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.680 
a very exciting moment could be the
beginning<00:02:10.100> of<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.490> whole<00:02:10.640> new<00:02:10.700> industry<00:02:11.360> that

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
beginning of a whole new industry that

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.600 
beginning of a whole new industry that
leads<00:02:12.140> us<00:02:12.320> eventually<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:13.070> having<00:02:13.400> true

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
leads us eventually to having true

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.090 
leads us eventually to having true
augmentation<00:02:14.270> all<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.230> time<00:02:15.440> every<00:02:15.740> place

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
augmentation all the time every place

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.310 
augmentation all the time every place
and<00:02:16.610> I'm<00:02:17.300> really<00:02:17.540> looking<00:02:17.720> forward<00:02:17.930> to

and I'm really looking forward to
getting<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.620> chance<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:19.100> program<00:02:19.580> with<00:02:19.820> it<00:02:19.970> and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
getting a chance to program with it and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.750 
getting a chance to program with it and
see<00:02:20.810> what<00:02:20.930> we<00:02:21.050> can<00:02:21.200> do<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.710> looks<00:02:21.860> incredibly

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
see what we can do it looks incredibly

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.850 
see what we can do it looks incredibly
exciting<00:02:23.420> if<00:02:23.690> anybody's<00:02:24.170> going<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.440> tackle

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
exciting if anybody's going to tackle

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.310 
exciting if anybody's going to tackle
the<00:02:25.070> set<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.490> hard<00:02:25.730> problems<00:02:26.270> we<00:02:27.020> think<00:02:27.230> the

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
the set of hard problems we think the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.320 
the set of hard problems we think the
Palmer<00:02:27.590> is<00:02:27.770> going<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.010> do<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:28.880> we<00:02:28.970> strongly

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
Kickstarter in the past I've looked at

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.840 
Kickstarter in the past I've looked at
these<00:02:33.470> VR<00:02:33.980> headsets<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:34.700> head-mounted

these VR headsets and head-mounted

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.570 
these VR headsets and head-mounted
displays<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:36.020> this<00:02:36.709> is<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.010> first<00:02:37.040> one<00:02:37.430> that

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
displays and this is the first one that

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.949 
displays and this is the first one that
I've<00:02:37.700> seen<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.209> was<00:02:38.450> truly<00:02:38.720> impressed

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
whole ballgame one of the biggest

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.770 
whole ballgame one of the biggest
problems<00:03:19.489> with<00:03:19.640> virtual<00:03:20.000> reality<00:03:20.420> up<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.630> this

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
problems with virtual reality up to this

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.800 
problems with virtual reality up to this
point<00:03:21.049> is<00:03:21.320> latency<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:23.060> benefit<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.570> rift

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
point is latency the benefit of the rift

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.420 
point is latency the benefit of the rift
is<00:03:24.019> that<00:03:24.170> it's<00:03:24.290> designed<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.769> be<00:03:24.920> really

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
is that it's designed to be really

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.729 
is that it's designed to be really
really<00:03:25.700> low<00:03:26.060> latency<00:03:26.630> so<00:03:27.080> rather<00:03:27.440> than

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
really low latency so rather than

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.490 
really low latency so rather than
looking<00:03:28.670> like<00:03:28.910> this<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:29.780> turn<00:03:30.049> your<00:03:30.290> head

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
looking like this and you turn your head

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.949 
looking like this and you turn your head
and<00:03:30.709> then<00:03:30.830> it<00:03:30.950> follows<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:32.060> actually<00:03:32.510> follows

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
and then it follows it actually follows

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.050 
and then it follows it actually follows
with<00:03:33.260> your<00:03:33.500> view<00:03:33.769> no<00:03:34.280> matter<00:03:34.489> what<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.790> do

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
with your view no matter what you do

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.330 
with your view no matter what you do
there<00:03:35.810> are<00:03:35.900> two<00:03:36.049> reasons<00:03:36.080> why<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:37.130> is

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
there are two reasons why this is

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.640 
there are two reasons why this is
possible<00:03:37.880> now<00:03:38.030> with<00:03:38.299> oculus<00:03:38.660> is<00:03:39.170> that<00:03:39.500> the

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
possible now with oculus is that the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.620 
possible now with oculus is that the
displays<00:03:40.070> are<00:03:40.280> very<00:03:40.459> high<00:03:40.640> density<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.330> very

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
displays are very high density and very

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.560 
displays are very high density and very
lightweight<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.500> are<00:03:43.010> very<00:03:43.220> small<00:03:43.549> and<00:03:43.790> the

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
lightweight and are very small and the

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.780 
lightweight and are very small and the
sensors<00:03:45.019> that<00:03:45.470> sense<00:03:45.860> your<00:03:46.160> head<00:03:46.310> position

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
sensors that sense your head position

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.100 
sensors that sense your head position
and<00:03:46.970> you're<00:03:47.090> turning<00:03:47.299> in<00:03:47.570> your<00:03:47.600> virtual

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
and you're turning in your virtual

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.259 
and you're turning in your virtual
environment<00:03:48.620> also<00:03:48.799> very<00:03:49.160> low<00:03:49.310> cost<00:03:49.489> the

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
environment also very low cost the

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.640 
environment also very low cost the
reason<00:03:50.480> we're<00:03:50.570> using<00:03:50.600> Kickstarter<00:03:51.350> is<00:03:51.500> so

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
reason we're using Kickstarter is so

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.530 
reason we're using Kickstarter is so
that<00:03:51.769> we<00:03:51.799> can<00:03:51.980> get<00:03:52.190> these<00:03:52.370> dev<00:03:52.670> kits<00:03:53.000> into<00:03:53.450> the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
that we can get these dev kits into the

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.270 
that we can get these dev kits into the
hands<00:03:53.810> of<00:03:53.900> developers<00:03:54.049> as<00:03:54.560> fast<00:03:54.860> as<00:03:55.040> possible

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
hands of developers as fast as possible

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.400 
hands of developers as fast as possible
that<00:03:56.030> way<00:03:56.120> they<00:03:56.239> can<00:03:56.390> try<00:03:56.600> for<00:03:56.660> themselves<00:03:57.170> and

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
that way they can try for themselves and

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.229 
that way they can try for themselves and
start<00:03:58.100> integrating<00:03:58.280> support<00:03:58.910> into<00:03:59.120> their

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
start integrating support into their

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.180 
start integrating support into their
games<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.660> engines<00:04:00.019> we<00:04:00.890> really<00:04:01.100> need

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
games and engines we really need

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.190 
games and engines we really need
developer<00:04:01.820> feedback<00:04:02.030> so<00:04:02.600> that<00:04:02.630> we<00:04:02.810> can<00:04:03.019> make

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
developer feedback so that we can make

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.289 
developer feedback so that we can make
the<00:04:03.350> consumer<00:04:03.829> version<00:04:03.980> of<00:04:04.280> this<00:04:04.430> even<00:04:05.030> more

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
the consumer version of this even more

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.750 
the consumer version of this even more
incredible<00:04:05.510> than<00:04:05.959> it<00:04:06.200> already<00:04:06.320> is<00:04:06.530> I<00:04:06.980> mean<00:04:07.640> the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
incredible than it already is I mean the

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.800 
incredible than it already is I mean the
greatest<00:04:08.209> decay<00:04:08.540> is<00:04:08.780> simply<00:04:09.500> about<00:04:09.769> a<00:04:10.130> great

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
greatest decay is simply about a great

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.750 
greatest decay is simply about a great
developer<00:04:11.810> experience<00:04:12.140> where<00:04:12.920> they<00:04:13.550> get<00:04:13.730> a

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
developer experience where they get a

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.220 
developer experience where they get a
really<00:04:14.090> functional<00:04:14.360> piece<00:04:14.660> of<00:04:14.810> software

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
really functional piece of software

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.650 
really functional piece of software
which<00:04:15.560> is<00:04:15.830> efficient<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.459> skills<00:04:16.849> they<00:04:17.150> need

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
which is efficient and skills they need

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.840 
which is efficient and skills they need
so<00:04:18.170> for<00:04:18.380> any<00:04:18.500> developers<00:04:19.190> doing<00:04:19.730> this
