00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.680
 Today is March 20 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.680
 It has been four months for the movie to be released 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.989
 As we listed the last production situation that we themed, and it was formed for approximately one month 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:16.509
 Yeah right now 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:17.749
 latest 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.749
 I would like to present figures on the status of film production 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.150
 I will do something like this 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.270
 There are 997 cuts ahead of the bus 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.430
 Layout is complete 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.720
 9804 cut 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.720
 This is 1.7% done in ja 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.370
 Rivera 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.670
 There were 8304 things that were many 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.670
 It is 83 years old 7% of the whole 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.560
 Did you have a second football 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.640
 I have a little but 660 4 cuts 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.770
 66.6% 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.340
 That the same building is up 625 cut 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.750
 After all 101.7% 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.420
 Then the color came about in the game but there were about 25 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.590
 cut 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.080
 52.7% 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.670
 Then the background is 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.160
 What is fruiting 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.500
 6608 cut 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.100
 67% of the whole 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.080
 Then the shooting has advanced 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.110
 490 cuts to the whole 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.490
 This will be 49.2% 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.000
 When it comes to time 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.950
 4: 15: 5 and 9 pieces 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.720
 Only this work is hit 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.340
 Just 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.340
 It was 4 months ago and I was able to finish half 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.200
 I think it is still half, but leap compared to the last time 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.660
 I think the numbers are rising 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.090
 Well it's cherries I actually have two more months 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.430
 I have to give up the cherry blossoms 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.860
 Ema in this space 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.410
 It is when you have you do your best 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.040
 I think it's probably not money to release a movie 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.040
 There is still a situation where it can not be ruled out 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.389
 I see 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.839
 It is as of today 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:16.869
 Today we have reported the figures about the production status
