I<00:02:04.310> was<00:02:04.640> good<00:02:04.790> to<00:02:04.910> get<00:02:05.000> far<00:02:05.240> as<00:02:05.300> you<00:02:05.390> can<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:05.930> does

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
I was good to get far as you can it does

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.050 
I was good to get far as you can it does
get<00:02:06.320> faster<00:02:06.860> you<00:02:07.040> also<00:02:07.280> want<00:02:07.460> to<00:02:07.520> collect

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
get faster you also want to collect

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.690 
get faster you also want to collect
coins<00:02:08.860> if<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.130> can<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:12.590> takes<00:02:12.890> some<00:02:13.040> little

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
coins if you can so it takes some little

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.590 
coins if you can so it takes some little
strategy<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:16.220> click<00:02:16.670> these<00:02:16.820> corn<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.480> you

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
strategy to to click these corn so you

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.990 
strategy to to click these corn so you
want<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.810> do<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:18.980> does<00:02:19.190> get<00:02:19.430> faster

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
want to do that and it does get faster

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000 
want to do that and it does get faster
and<00:02:20.150> faster<00:02:20.210> so<00:02:20.960> don't<00:02:21.350> think<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:21.950> is

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
and faster so don't think that this is

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.120 
and faster so don't think that this is
it<00:02:22.600> that's<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.780> whole<00:02:23.810> object<00:02:24.140> level<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.830> to

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
it that's the whole object level is to

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.810 
it that's the whole object level is to
pretty<00:02:25.910> much<00:02:26.170> stay<00:02:27.170> alive<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.640> would

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
pretty much stay alive and I would

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.060 
pretty much stay alive and I would
happen<00:02:29.090> when<00:02:29.210> you<00:02:29.300> don't<00:02:29.620> we<00:02:30.620> do<00:02:30.770> it<00:02:30.800> again

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
happen when you don't we do it again

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.960 
happen when you don't we do it again
