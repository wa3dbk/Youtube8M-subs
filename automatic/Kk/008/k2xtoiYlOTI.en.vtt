all just because I'm used to this gaming
a<00:01:56.200> lot<00:01:56.380> more<00:01:56.650> difficult<00:01:57.220> than<00:01:57.370> it<00:01:57.430> has<00:01:57.520> been<00:01:57.670> in

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910

a lot more difficult than it has been in
this<00:01:58.120> place

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:15.230

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.820 

by<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.840> way<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.080> don't<00:02:16.260> actually<00:02:16.380> have<00:02:16.560> to

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
by the way you don't actually have to

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
by the way you don't actually have to
pull<00:02:17.220> down<00:02:17.820> there<00:02:19.580> sometimes<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.670> seen

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
pull down there sometimes I seen

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.540 
pull down there sometimes I seen
sometimes<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.390> do<00:02:21.540> sometimes<00:02:21.570> you<00:02:22.140> don't<00:02:22.550> but

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
sometimes you do sometimes you don't but

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.520 
sometimes you do sometimes you don't but
it's<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.940> really<00:02:24.240> big<00:02:24.510> deal<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.930> mean<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.230> end<00:02:25.350> up

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
it's a really big deal I mean you end up

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.560 
it's a really big deal I mean you end up
in<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.710> same<00:02:25.890> place<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.790> can't<00:02:27.030> get<00:02:27.210> up<00:02:27.330> top

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
in the same place you can't get up top

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.970 
in the same place you can't get up top
again<00:02:28.880> he<00:02:29.880> won't<00:02:30.090> be<00:02:30.180> nice<00:02:30.360> good<00:02:30.840> veggie<00:02:31.680> can't

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
again he won't be nice good veggie can't

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:40.280

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
I think they save some of the prettiest

00:02:50.490 --> 00:03:08.010 
I think they save some of the prettiest
scenery<00:02:50.820> for<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.270> last
