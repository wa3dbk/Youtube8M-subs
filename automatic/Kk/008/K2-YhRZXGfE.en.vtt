00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.070
 between 8 billion dollars spent in the region 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.020
 the state legislative power 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.020
 especially so that the socialist councilor 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.149
 the man have worried 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:13.359
 against the activity 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:14.999
 and we have its population 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.140
 at the summit of unasur in bariloche president alan garcÃ­a 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.739
 colombia the source country ap these cases hello 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.400
 when everyone has their things 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.680
 what's important the musique this we have an information ti city as place 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.830
 he has participated in the works 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.440
 homologate reforms to know how much each street and each thing is being spent and 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.900
 not a point at this time they seem budgets 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.390
 where is the limit 2 the most important of people in that case is 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.660
 expensive 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.350
 a greeting 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.550
 i the appearance of other expenses and yes 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.160
 of well-being I think so 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.690
 it is a process that has to be done by countries 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.690
 starting 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.300
 I think all Johnson 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.720
 Victor infective capacity she what has made 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.530
 to be able to find them 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.840
 and could achieve 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.229
 and we can established 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.170
 a mood and peace a peaceful environment 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.130
 developing 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.910
 I think all the users 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.770
 the measures of trust in who in turn prayed to the month 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.840
 that go from less to more 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.130
 p in regards to what is information about military purchases 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.590
 there are instruments that I have expressed my interviews that are the records of 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.500
 conventional weapons 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.750
 who basically united nations and the oea is a procedure 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.520
 p this is generally worked bilaterally working in the network 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.020
 daily more ambitious series work it multilateral 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.240
 I would have to leave from each country but 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.250
 in a concerted way with the political will the states to do it from 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.580
 In a concerted manner, the results that we are going to see in the Quito meeting are that 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.620
 there is not that political will 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.310
 in Peru at least the political class putting together thematic 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:17.019
 mostly approved the government's action in promoting - weapons and more 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.579
 developing 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.529
 Peru began to adopt this formula with Ecuador in the recent meeting 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.319
 bilateral and piura 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.760
 seek consensus among those who think the same seems to be the best solution 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.999
 before envisioning that everyone in the South American neighborhood is 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:33.659
 agreement 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:39.619
 I asked Marco to agree to take the proposal already developed 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:42.090
 as a covenant as a people as 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.229
 letter 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:47.919
 percent and by the common people and legal follow-up to decide 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.089
 single word 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:53.349
 a single concept as a legal instrument is obviously not a 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.479
 public instrument 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.569
 -sector countries 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.659
 and it has to be negotiated by the countries 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.999
 and probably between what Peru originally proposed what ends 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.899
 being popular despite having no difference 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:11.189
 once list is passed to the defense committee of unasur 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.510
 Because of the nature of the forum that the Sevillian committee has, 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.709
 contrasted with the adjustments proposed by other countries 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.739
 The criterion that must prevail is that of trust to know how much you spend 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.749
 everyone in a 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:30.739
 It will take some years to achieve consensus in government offices in 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:31.619
 the region 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:35.949
 What does seem to be clear is that it has been Peru as it had not happened in 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:36.869
 last 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:38.740
 the country that has given the alert 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.740
 a growing smell of gunpowder in this part of the world 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.680
 As is happening with purchases in recent months we should not 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.829
 expect the worst to just say that the race 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.059
 it will not go only
