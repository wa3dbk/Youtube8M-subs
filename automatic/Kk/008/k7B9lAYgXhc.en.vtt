and right now I'm checking out some

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.759 
and right now I'm checking out some
surfers<00:00:30.300> down<00:00:30.480> by<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.630> cliffs<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:31.560> just

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
surfers down by the cliffs and it's just

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.180 
surfers down by the cliffs and it's just
awesome<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.340> watch<00:00:32.610> them<00:00:32.910> totally<00:00:33.660> mesmerised

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
awesome to watch them totally mesmerised

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.709 
awesome to watch them totally mesmerised
and<00:00:35.190> one<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.640> things<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.059> notice<00:00:36.510> is

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
and one of the things that I notice is

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.690 
and one of the things that I notice is
that<00:00:36.780> they<00:00:37.170> don't<00:00:37.440> ride<00:00:37.800> every<00:00:38.280> wave<00:00:38.460> that

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
that they don't ride every wave that

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.060 
that they don't ride every wave that
comes<00:00:38.850> along<00:00:39.059> they're<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.690> picking<00:00:40.170> some

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
comes along they're really picking some

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.470 
comes along they're really picking some
of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.219> waves<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:41.640> lift<00:00:41.969> them<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.390> their

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
of the waves just lift them up on their

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.170 
of the waves just lift them up on their
boards<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.200> then<00:00:43.290> drop<00:00:43.559> them<00:00:43.739> down<00:00:43.920> again

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
boards and then drop them down again

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.700 
boards and then drop them down again
other<00:00:45.180> times<00:00:45.539> they<00:00:45.690> start<00:00:46.020> paddling<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
other times they start paddling for a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.380 
other times they start paddling for a
wave<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:47.399> they<00:00:47.520> realize<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> right

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
wave but they realize it's not the right

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.930 
wave but they realize it's not the right
kind<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.660> wave<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.110> they<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:49.230> back<00:00:49.590> off

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
kind of wave so they just back off

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.130 
kind of wave so they just back off
sometimes<00:00:50.940> they<00:00:51.090> actually<00:00:51.360> get<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
sometimes they actually get up on the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.479 
sometimes they actually get up on the
board<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.590> top<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.039> wave<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.399> they

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
board on top of the wave and they

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.799 
board on top of the wave and they
realize<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.210> lame<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.690> they

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
realize it's going to be lame so they

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.799 
realize it's going to be lame so they
bail<00:00:55.280> it's<00:00:56.280> quite<00:00:56.640> rare<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.570> actually

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
bail it's quite rare that you actually

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.680 
bail it's quite rare that you actually
see<00:00:58.320> them<00:00:58.559> take<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> wave<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.969> ride<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
see them take a wave and ride it to the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.810 
see them take a wave and ride it to the
end<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.590> makes<00:01:01.890> me<00:01:02.070> think<00:01:02.100> about<00:01:02.399> human

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
end this makes me think about human

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.390 
end this makes me think about human
emotions<00:01:03.270> which<00:01:04.260> are<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> lot<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.070> ocean

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
emotions which are a lot like that ocean

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.179 
emotions which are a lot like that ocean
their<00:01:05.729> waves<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.479> move<00:01:06.540> through<00:01:07.020> us<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:08.070> get

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
their waves that move through us we get

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.100 
their waves that move through us we get
triggered<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:08.790> get<00:01:08.939> emotionally<00:01:09.450> engaged<00:01:09.780> and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
triggered we get emotionally engaged and

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.380 
triggered we get emotionally engaged and
suddenly<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:10.619> comes<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.979> wave<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.490> most<00:01:12.180> of

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
suddenly here comes a wave and most of

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.870 
suddenly here comes a wave and most of
the<00:01:12.450> time<00:01:12.659> most<00:01:12.990> people<00:01:13.500> will<00:01:14.250> paddle<00:01:14.520> for

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the time most people will paddle for

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.640 
the time most people will paddle for
that<00:01:15.000> wave<00:01:15.210> even<00:01:15.780> though<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:15.990> doesn't<00:01:16.110> sort<00:01:16.530> of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that wave even though it doesn't sort of

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.399 
that wave even though it doesn't sort of
thing<00:01:17.119> maybe<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> wave<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.780> anger<00:01:18.990> maybe

or happiness or lust or love but we
didn't<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.090> think<00:01:27.330> about<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.869> wave

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
didn't really think about the wave

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.800 
didn't really think about the wave
before<00:01:28.350> we<00:01:29.189> started<00:01:29.610> paddling<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.659> went

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
before we started paddling we just went

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.340 
before we started paddling we just went
for<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.460> just<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> surfers<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:34.079> don't

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
for and just like the surfers you don't

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.859 
for and just like the surfers you don't
have<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.770> ride<00:01:35.009> every<00:01:35.790> wave<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.329> emotion<00:01:36.780> that

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
have to ride every wave of emotion that

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.679 
have to ride every wave of emotion that
comes<00:01:36.930> through<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> choice<00:01:38.689> and

comes through you you have a choice and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.420 
comes through you you have a choice and
it's<00:01:39.960> not<00:01:40.110> about<00:01:40.259> suppressing<00:01:40.590> your<00:01:40.920> emotions

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
it's not about suppressing your emotions

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.639

through that's great that's natural
you've<00:01:50.850> been<00:01:51.090> triggered<00:01:51.570> let<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.530> lift<00:01:52.710> up

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
you've been triggered let it lift up
