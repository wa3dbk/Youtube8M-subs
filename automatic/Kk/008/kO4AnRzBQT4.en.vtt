00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
back I suppose they already had these

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.020 
back I suppose they already had these
backpacks<00:03:32.820> in<00:03:33.060> mind<00:03:33.590> when<00:03:34.590> they<00:03:34.620> designed<00:03:35.160> the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
backpacks in mind when they designed the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.270 
backpacks in mind when they designed the
original<00:03:36.240> figure<00:03:36.720> mold<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.440> have<00:03:37.590> holes<00:03:37.920> and

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
original figure mold to have holes and

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.630 
original figure mold to have holes and
like<00:03:38.700> them<00:03:39.270> and<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.990> know<00:03:40.310> most<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.460> the

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
like them and and you know most of the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.060 
like them and and you know most of the
hospital<00:03:42.240> figures<00:03:42.630> really<00:03:43.020> have<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:43.560> staple

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
hospital figures really have a staple

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.660 
hospital figures really have a staple
back<00:03:44.520> peg<00:03:45.180> hole<00:03:45.860> really<00:03:46.860> for<00:03:47.070> for<00:03:47.310> such

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
back peg hole really for for such

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.340 
back peg hole really for for such
repaint<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.570> read<00:03:48.720> echoes<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.320> think<00:03:49.670> anyway

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
repaint and read echoes I think anyway

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.930 
repaint and read echoes I think anyway
so<00:03:52.350> that's<00:03:52.560> that<00:03:52.830> let<00:03:53.430> me<00:03:53.550> just<00:03:53.730> straighten

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
so that's that let me just straighten

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.270 
so that's that let me just straighten

nice<00:05:06.290> on<00:05:06.620> paper<00:05:06.650> and<00:05:07.340> in<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.000> PowerPoint<00:05:08.540> and

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
nice on paper and in the PowerPoint and

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.659 
nice on paper and in the PowerPoint and
in<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:09.050> Photoshop<00:05:09.620> designs<00:05:10.340> that<00:05:10.520> the

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
in the Photoshop designs that the

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.840 
in the Photoshop designs that the
hospitals<00:05:11.120> he<00:05:11.240> made<00:05:11.480> but<00:05:12.200> again<00:05:12.530> when<00:05:13.430> it<00:05:13.580> came

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
hospitals he made but again when it came

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.800 
hospitals he made but again when it came
to<00:05:14.090> execution<00:05:15.640> the<00:05:16.640> manufacturing<00:05:17.510> side<00:05:17.780> of

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
to execution the manufacturing side of

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.470 
to execution the manufacturing side of
this<00:05:18.110> figure<00:05:18.500> I<00:05:18.530> think<00:05:19.130> just<00:05:19.580> fell<00:05:19.820> short<00:05:19.850> on

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
this figure I think just fell short on

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.530 
this figure I think just fell short on
this<00:05:20.720> one<00:05:21.520> this<00:05:22.520> was<00:05:22.730> the<00:05:22.880> best<00:05:23.120> one<00:05:23.360> I<00:05:23.390> could

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
this one this was the best one I could

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.800 
this one this was the best one I could
find<00:05:23.690> but<00:05:24.370> every<00:05:25.370> time<00:05:25.550> I<00:05:25.610> checked<00:05:26.030> shelves<00:05:26.630> on

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
find but every time I checked shelves on

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.900 
find but every time I checked shelves on
whether<00:05:27.080> this<00:05:27.650> figure<00:05:28.010> was<00:05:28.160> on<00:05:28.280> shelves<00:05:28.790> or

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
whether this figure was on shelves or

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.000 
whether this figure was on shelves or
not<00:05:29.060> I've<00:05:29.180> seen<00:05:29.419> a<00:05:29.450> couple<00:05:29.540> and<00:05:30.169> I've<00:05:30.770> seen<00:05:30.950> a

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
not I've seen a couple and I've seen a

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.840 
not I've seen a couple and I've seen a
lot<00:05:31.280> actually<00:05:31.580> and<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:33.440> white<00:05:33.770> paint<00:05:34.520> is

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
lot actually and the white paint is

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.550 
lot actually and the white paint is
what's<00:05:35.120> really<00:05:35.480> causing<00:05:35.660> the<00:05:36.020> problems

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
what's really causing the problems

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.560 
what's really causing the problems
they've<00:05:36.860> got<00:05:37.070> overlapping<00:05:37.730> portions<00:05:38.419> here

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
they've got overlapping portions here

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.840 
they've got overlapping portions here
and<00:05:38.690> there<00:05:38.780> splatters<00:05:39.380> there<00:05:39.740> some<00:05:40.430> even<00:05:40.730> have

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
and there splatters there some even have

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.350 
and there splatters there some even have
red<00:05:41.120> paint<00:05:41.510> on<00:05:41.750> the<00:05:42.620> white<00:05:42.830> paint<00:05:43.220> and<00:05:43.430> or<00:05:44.030> some

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
red paint on the white paint and or some

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.390 
red paint on the white paint and or some
have<00:05:44.720> some<00:05:45.169> figures<00:05:45.440> have<00:05:45.650> the<00:05:45.950> white<00:05:46.130> paint

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
have some figures have the white paint

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.420 
have some figures have the white paint
covering<00:05:46.910> the<00:05:47.030> red<00:05:47.180> paint<00:05:47.950> some<00:05:48.950> overlapping

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
covering the red paint some overlapping

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.030 
covering the red paint some overlapping
here<00:05:49.850> and<00:05:50.000> there<00:05:50.450> and<00:05:51.110> then<00:05:51.350> the<00:05:51.500> worst<00:05:51.710> of<00:05:51.890> it

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
here and there and then the worst of it

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.370 
here and there and then the worst of it
is<00:05:52.070> really<00:05:52.460> the<00:05:52.610> head<00:05:52.820> you<00:05:53.720> get<00:05:53.930> the

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
is really the head you get the

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.420 
is really the head you get the
misaligned<00:05:55.220> white<00:05:55.700> paint<00:05:56.030> apps<00:05:57.340> having<00:05:58.340> the

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
misaligned white paint apps having the

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.310 
misaligned white paint apps having the
face<00:05:58.640> painted<00:05:59.090> a<00:05:59.330> little<00:05:59.630> bit<00:05:59.720> the<00:05:59.810> left<00:06:00.080> or<00:06:00.290> to

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
face painted a little bit the left or to

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.140 
face painted a little bit the left or to
the<00:06:00.410> right<00:06:00.530> this<00:06:01.370> one<00:06:01.580> I<00:06:01.610> found<00:06:01.880> very<00:06:01.940> little

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
the right this one I found very little

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.450 
the right this one I found very little
paint<00:06:03.020> problems<00:06:03.650> the<00:06:03.800> only<00:06:04.010> problem<00:06:04.280> I<00:06:04.340> have

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
paint problems the only problem I have

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.940 
paint problems the only problem I have
is<00:06:04.610> really<00:06:04.760> the<00:06:04.970> eyes<00:06:05.150> I<00:06:05.780> think<00:06:06.410> it<00:06:06.500> lacks<00:06:06.740> a

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
is really the eyes I think it lacks a

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.010 
is really the eyes I think it lacks a
little<00:06:07.070> bit<00:06:07.310> more<00:06:07.520> white<00:06:07.850> I'm<00:06:08.419> not<00:06:08.630> sure<00:06:08.870> if

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
little bit more white I'm not sure if

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.260 
little bit more white I'm not sure if
you<00:06:09.200> can<00:06:09.560> actually<00:06:10.250> see<00:06:10.850> it<00:06:12.310> my<00:06:13.310> light<00:06:13.580> is<00:06:13.850> just

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
you can actually see it my light is just

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:23.080 
you can actually see it my light is just
way<00:06:14.570> too<00:06:14.630> bright<00:06:20.680> it's<00:06:21.680> it's<00:06:22.550> it's<00:06:22.820> just

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
way too bright it's it's it's just

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.330 
way too bright it's it's it's just
something<00:06:23.479> that<00:06:23.510> you<00:06:23.630> could<00:06:24.010> it's<00:06:25.010> tempting

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
something that you could it's tempting

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.950 
something that you could it's tempting
to<00:06:25.460> retouch<00:06:25.970> but<00:06:26.300> I'm<00:06:26.419> sure<00:06:26.539> I'm<00:06:26.660> gonna<00:06:26.750> do<00:06:26.930> a

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
to retouch but I'm sure I'm gonna do a

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.779 
to retouch but I'm sure I'm gonna do a
bad<00:06:27.289> job<00:06:27.320> with<00:06:27.650> it<00:06:28.100> so<00:06:28.250> I'm<00:06:28.310> not<00:06:28.460> gonna<00:06:28.580> even

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
bad job with it so I'm not gonna even

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:29.320 
bad job with it so I'm not gonna even
touch<00:06:29.060> it

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
touch it

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.779

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
but overall you know I like the design I

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:34.300 
but overall you know I like the design I
like<00:06:32.120> the<00:06:32.240> color<00:06:32.479> combination<00:06:32.800> it<00:06:33.800> looks<00:06:34.070> like

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
like the color combination it looks like

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.580 
like the color combination it looks like
more<00:06:35.090> of<00:06:35.120> an<00:06:35.270> inferno<00:06:35.690> armor<00:06:36.050> than<00:06:36.289> a<00:06:36.380> hot<00:06:36.560> zone

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
more of an inferno armor than a hot zone

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.219 
more of an inferno armor than a hot zone
armor<00:06:37.160> but<00:06:37.580> hot<00:06:38.300> zone<00:06:38.539> inferno<00:06:38.930> doesn't

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
armor but hot zone inferno doesn't

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:44.350 
armor but hot zone inferno doesn't
really<00:06:39.380> make<00:06:39.530> a<00:06:39.560> difference<00:06:39.979> so<00:06:41.919> yeah<00:06:43.360> he

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360
