00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello girls how are you today 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.550
 I'm going to show you how you can make up 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.340
 the eyebrows and this process is super easy 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.759
 and many people leave it aside but 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.529
 I promise you it makes a big difference 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.120
 so I hope you like the video and 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.160
 let us begin 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.480
 the product that I'm going to use first is going to 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.630
 be this product of nix is ​​a powder 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.300
 especially to be able to fill 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.760
 eyebrows and comes with two colors one more 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.739
 clear one darker also comes with 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.870
 a match that there was not to me I did not 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:42.610
 I like it so much that I almost use it 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.559
 Also this product is going to come with a 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.660
 comb cited for the eyelashes if not 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.940
 they have this they can simply use a 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.260
 old brush that they no longer use and this 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.750
 all he's going to do is untangle 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.589
 the little hairs on the eyebrows and that's how 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.720
 I'm going to start 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.300
 I'm going to untangle the little hairs from 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.360
 eyebrows simply following the address 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.250
 where they naturally grow sometimes 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.050
 mine like they fight and are between 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.890
 crossed so I always like to comb 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:13.570
 then I'm going to take this brush in 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.490
 angle of sigma is the 65 s and I'm going to take 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.430
 a little bit of the product I'm going to mix the 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.390
 two colors I like to do that 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.460
 you can choose the color that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.810
 you prefer let's remove the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.020
 excess 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.000
 in the back the subject of my hand 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.329
 and I'm going to start applying this 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.170
 product starting from below making a 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:39.610
 line I will go practically delineating 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.860
 the eyelash eyelash tab and 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.439
 then up in the same way I'm going to 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.630
 start making a line outlining and 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.409
 giving it shape and the thickness that I want 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:55.000
 for me for my eyebrows I will add more 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.610
 product and will start somehow 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.020
 blur that color to scatter the color 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.340
 I'm not going to add more products 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.439
 we just started spreading 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.830
 scattered we do not want it to be so 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:09.340
 dark this is something that I also like 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.410
 do for every day in reality unless 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.700
 I want to go to a good party more 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.230
 I'll explain later what is it 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.490
 what can we do to make it a little 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.410
 darker or more defined 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.480
 Now let's do the same with the other 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.030
 now you can see the difference 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.740
 between that one that is here so this 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.390
 part of once advancing a little 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.070
 hello I'm very good a little bit more 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.260
 fast since it is the same process as the 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.870
 first let's delineate the eyebrows of 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.220
 this way and add powder 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.320
 especially in the tail of the eyebrow 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.660
 which is where it's at least me 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.610
 missing more more pelito so that's where it is 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.040
 where I'm going to concentrate and I'm going to 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.760
 start to blur the color of this 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.210
 way this brush is super super good 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.000
 to make this type of application 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.050
 make sure the two eyebrows are visible 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.840
 appeared they do not have to be 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.510
 super equal because if they try to do 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.070
 the equals are going to spend a lot of time in 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.160
 tell that it would be very similar art 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.950
 Let's give them enough a little more 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.960
 and I'm going to show you an alternative for 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.930
 if you want to suddenly use this in the 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.360
 night or something a little more intense I'll 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.880
 to take this gel and that is a eyeliner 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.990
 of eyes but I will use it for 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.350
 eyebrows is a eyeliner 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.210
 web in wilde and it is water proof as well 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.310
 that I promise you that is where you 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.050
 apply that will last all day 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.060
 or overnight depending on when 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.950
 they use me I like to use it more 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.360
 for the night and let's start doing 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.340
 the same procedure that we did with 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.620
 the powder we're just going to make a 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.110
 outlined and I'm going to start blurring 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.300
 that color also on that which is not 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.420
 case in the delineated they blur it from 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.370
 immediate because as it is a delineator to 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.470
 Water test dries very fast 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.720
 so if you make a line and wait 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.880
 a long time before blurring those will 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.840
 to be left and the line to know very ugly 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.610
 so blur diffuse quickie and 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.490
 then taking a little more product if 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.000
 it's necessary I'm going to start adding a 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.080
 little bit more in the little eyebrow that 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.870
 is where I and as I told you 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.060
 previously I need more pieces of paper like this 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.330
 that I'm going to concentrate a little there 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.630
 blurring the color this way and then 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.820
 let's go to the other eyebrow the same 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.700
 procedure let's delineate what we were going 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.780
 to start spreading that color by bringing 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.750
 the color inside 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.390
 in this way 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.820
 and well you can choose with wrecks 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.770
 or they want the eyebrows to look or they can 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.110
 make it thicker thinner than 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.900
 adjust of each 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.990
 now if you think it was very dark to me 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.390
 I like to grab a hyssop and start 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.770
 clean especially in the part of 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.430
 in the middle where the two are 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.710
 eyebrows because naturally the eyebrows 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.030
 in this part he has less hair 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.740
 so if you want it to be a little bit 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.470
 more natural simply that they remove the 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.990
 excess to make them look even more 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.900
 defined I'm going to take this concealer 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.419
 he and I will start applying this 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.490
 around the eyebrow in this way 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.600
 just a little bit and taking 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.680
 any brush that have shade 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.230
 so be it, I plan to start 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.660
 spread that color around by cleaning 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.180
 any imperfection that we have done 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.120
 when we add the powder or when 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:29.270
 we had passed that eyeliner this 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.840
 way we will do the same in the other 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.139
 eyebrow 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.240
 that really makes a lot of difference in 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.880
 actually you do not think you could do 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.520
 so much difference but believe me yes 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.510
 if it looks is totally different and I 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.160
 love how I tell them to do is 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.900
 especially if I'm going to go out in 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.360
 the night so that they look more defined 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.600
 the eyebrows but simply the dust and 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.720
 with that it's enough we're going to clean 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.560
 also in the middle 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.560
 in this way 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:03.420
 and well this is all 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:07.140
 this is the final look as you see it is very 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.810
 different than when I started the video it 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.150
 they see more defined more beautiful can the 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.070
 make thinner thicker ones make them 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.010
 darker less dark and it depends on 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:21.690
 you so I want to show you the 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:23.400
 before he does not me and the after 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.130
 How good I hope you liked the 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.380
 video thank you very much for watching me and the 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:31.850
