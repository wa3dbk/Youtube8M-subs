another 6.39 million vehicles was that

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.180 
another 6.39 million vehicles was that
because<00:05:17.310> of<00:05:17.580> what<00:05:17.940> you<00:05:18.090> saw<00:05:18.539> happen<00:05:18.960> GM<00:05:19.470> or<00:05:19.740> was

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
because of what you saw happen GM or was

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.770 
because of what you saw happen GM or was
it<00:05:20.310> just<00:05:20.340> coincidental<00:05:21.000> those<00:05:21.300> two<00:05:21.449> things<00:05:21.570> at

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
it just coincidental those two things at

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.839 
it just coincidental those two things at
the<00:05:21.900> same<00:05:21.990> time<00:05:22.229> yeah<00:05:22.860> then<00:05:23.099> the<00:05:23.280> number<00:05:23.610> you

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
the same time yeah then the number you

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.620 
the same time yeah then the number you
you<00:05:24.300> quoted<00:05:24.719> 6.39<00:05:25.440> was<00:05:26.099> a<00:05:26.340> a<00:05:26.580> global<00:05:27.270> number

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
you quoted 6.39 was a a global number

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.839 
you quoted 6.39 was a a global number
and<00:05:27.840> these<00:05:28.440> are<00:05:28.500> large<00:05:28.860> numbers<00:05:29.370> and<00:05:29.400> I<00:05:29.610> think

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
and these are large numbers and I think

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.010 
and these are large numbers and I think
that<00:05:30.000> you'll<00:05:30.240> see<00:05:30.479> that<00:05:30.630> in<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.870> future

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
that you'll see that in the future

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.760 
that you'll see that in the future
because<00:05:31.349> as<00:05:31.909> cars<00:05:32.909> and<00:05:33.389> car<00:05:33.750> platforms<00:05:34.380> become

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
because as cars and car platforms become

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.999 
because as cars and car platforms become
more<00:05:35.009> globalized<00:05:36.500> there's<00:05:37.500> going<00:05:37.710> to<00:05:37.770> be<00:05:37.800> more

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
more globalized there's going to be more

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.159 
more globalized there's going to be more
shared<00:05:38.310> parts<00:05:38.759> so<00:05:39.000> these<00:05:39.150> are<00:05:39.630> numbers<00:05:39.750> but<00:05:40.080> I

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
shared parts so these are numbers but I

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.290 
shared parts so these are numbers but I
think<00:05:40.469> Matt<00:05:41.070> what<00:05:41.250> you're<00:05:41.430> starting<00:05:41.940> to<00:05:42.060> see

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
think Matt what you're starting to see

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.670 
think Matt what you're starting to see
is<00:05:42.539> a<00:05:43.050> shift<00:05:43.560> in<00:05:43.740> the<00:05:43.770> industry<00:05:45.020> recalls<00:05:46.020> used

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
is a shift in the industry recalls used

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
them as a preventive major so I'll give

them as a preventive major so I'll give
you<00:06:10.140> an<00:06:10.260> example<00:06:10.320> those<00:06:10.920> two<00:06:11.190> that<00:06:11.400> you<00:06:11.490> cited

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
you an example those two that you cited

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.990 
you an example those two that you cited
from<00:06:12.030> last<00:06:12.270> week<00:06:12.540> one<00:06:13.440> was<00:06:13.710> a<00:06:13.890> spiral<00:06:14.730> cable

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
from last week one was a spiral cable

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.210 
from last week one was a spiral cable
that<00:06:15.330> comes<00:06:15.450> up<00:06:15.690> the<00:06:15.840> steering<00:06:16.260> column<00:06:16.470> that

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
that comes up the steering column that

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.880 
that comes up the steering column that
attaches<00:06:17.610> to<00:06:17.820> the<00:06:18.030> airbag<00:06:18.390> and<00:06:18.630> we<00:06:19.380> found<00:06:19.620> that

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
attaches to the airbag and we found that

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.250 
attaches to the airbag and we found that
through<00:06:20.130> time<00:06:20.400> just<00:06:20.850> repeatedly<00:06:21.420> steering

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
through time just repeatedly steering

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.440 
through time just repeatedly steering
it's<00:06:22.470> possible<00:06:22.950> that<00:06:23.100> that<00:06:23.280> that<00:06:23.850> spiral

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
it's possible that that that spiral

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.050 
it's possible that that that spiral
cable<00:06:24.660> would<00:06:24.960> chafe<00:06:25.290> well<00:06:26.280> in<00:06:26.520> worst<00:06:26.760> case<00:06:27.030> of

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
cable would chafe well in worst case of

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.590 
cable would chafe well in worst case of
it<00:06:27.480> chafed<00:06:27.810> shorted<00:06:28.500> out<00:06:28.820> the<00:06:29.820> airbag<00:06:30.270> warning

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
it chafed shorted out the airbag warning

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.240 
it chafed shorted out the airbag warning
light<00:06:31.020> would<00:06:31.260> come<00:06:31.290> on<00:06:31.560> and<00:06:31.920> then<00:06:32.070> you'd<00:06:32.220> have

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
light would come on and then you'd have

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.760 
light would come on and then you'd have
to<00:06:32.490> take<00:06:32.670> it<00:06:32.820> to<00:06:32.910> me<00:06:33.060> the<00:06:33.390> consumer<00:06:33.780> but

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
to take it to me the consumer but

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.100 
to take it to me the consumer but
because<00:06:35.130> that<00:06:35.400> potential<00:06:35.940> was<00:06:35.970> there<00:06:36.330> we

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
because that potential was there we

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.400 
because that potential was there we
chose<00:06:37.350> to<00:06:37.590> recall<00:06:38.520> and<00:06:38.820> replace<00:06:39.660> those<00:06:39.930> cable

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
chose to recall and replace those cable

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.920 
chose to recall and replace those cable
it's<00:06:40.680> just<00:06:40.950> a<00:06:41.100> inordinate<00:06:42.060> amount<00:06:42.420> of<00:06:42.510> safety

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
it's just a inordinate amount of safety

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.870 
it's just a inordinate amount of safety
precaution<00:06:43.500> Breanna<00:06:43.950> debris<00:06:44.280> called<00:06:44.490> yeah

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
precaution Breanna debris called yeah

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.780 
precaution Breanna debris called yeah
now<00:06:45.480> well<00:06:46.380> I'm<00:06:46.470> really<00:06:46.710> proud<00:06:47.400> of<00:06:47.460> that<00:06:47.640> and

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790 
now well I'm really proud of that and

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
now well I'm really proud of that and
just<00:06:48.060> show<00:06:48.210> you<00:06:48.270> a<00:06:48.330> little<00:06:48.420> bit<00:06:48.600> of<00:06:48.690> direction

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
just show you a little bit of direction

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.230 
just show you a little bit of direction
the<00:06:49.170> industry<00:06:49.590> is<00:06:49.650> taking<00:06:50.070> there's<00:06:50.970> been<00:06:51.180> no

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
sort but but we identified that

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.290

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
potential same way with the second

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.450

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.630 
could potentially break on our
entry-level<00:07:05.130> yard<00:07:05.700> sedan<00:07:06.440> so<00:07:07.440> we<00:07:07.620> called<00:07:08.460> them

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:08.640 
entry-level yard sedan so we called them

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.450 
entry-level yard sedan so we called them
bring<00:07:08.940> them<00:07:09.090> back<00:07:09.270> to<00:07:09.510> make<00:07:09.660> sure<00:07:09.870> that<00:07:10.200> the
