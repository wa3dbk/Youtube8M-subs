00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.370
 it is an opportunity to open up and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.730
 come true to every person 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.979
 which does not set itself barriers 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:10.779
 questioning this opportunity 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:14.179
 allow yourself to learn to dream 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.109
 the third begins with one 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.509
 But says that this life 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.079
 but the next step is not coloring us 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:21.820
 had enough 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.720
 passing this training this 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.340
 support is people who don't lose 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.939
 meteoritic 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.069
 practice people who have come this way with 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.720
 great pleasure 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.720
 accompanied by 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.360
 this formation is phased order 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.230
 more difficult 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.770
 food then friends this 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.810
 travel well and so every day every 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.100
 wake up a second and you ask yourself 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.120
 question 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.320
 that is very large 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.930
 and with someone today the sky 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.570
 opportunities 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.150
 actions let him get the information because 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.670
 I have 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.070
 in a programme 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.950
 through which our business develops 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.290
 business develops in 57 countries 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.970
 own actions 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.970
 for successful 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.640
 in short 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.220
 for me, marrying successful people 5 ha 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.570
 some soccer players it also means 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.570
 these are the people who do it 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.940
 as he noted 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.160
 on the album 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.020
 more points project 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.590
 some 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.590
 I am not an argument 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.450
 However, the main communication does not care 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.160
 it was she 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
 it is 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.500
 now they make up from viruses 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.750
 in a press release 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.360
 I can already develop 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.360
 actually help them 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.690
 the purpose of which is fire 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.690
 services 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.850
 the Chinese have become 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.850
 and me so first of all the prices 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.310
 all this does not diminish the reflections 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.310
 Habitats are business learning processes 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.359
 and I understand that now the site of the fund 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:15.539
 several companies are represented 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.539
 this summer 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.089
 Now I understand that this is more than just 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:26.549
 because she 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.349
 it all starts small 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.349
 observers will 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.420
 it contributes to our development 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.220
 that is, is the body 17 22 with a height greater than 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.020
 just physically familiar with friends from 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.479
 development project recognition 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.379
 in practically 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.959
 so the dogs are June 17th, 1940 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:54.849
 we even have with us 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.439
 yes now the question 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.439
 been here 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.039
 from the first hours 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.090
 opportunity for me as my partners 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:15.049
 work this reaction level 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:15.829
 trained
