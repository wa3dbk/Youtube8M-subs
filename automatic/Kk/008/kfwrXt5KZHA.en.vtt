00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.190 
as you think the most important factor
when<00:02:00.060> you're<00:02:00.180> dealing<00:02:00.329> with<00:02:00.450> aquarium<00:02:01.049> like

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
when you're dealing with aquarium like

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.319 
when you're dealing with aquarium like
this<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.649> actually<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.729> fact<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.180> has<00:02:03.299> a

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
this is actually the fact that it has a

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.810 
this is actually the fact that it has a
lid<00:02:03.600> now<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.560> lid<00:02:04.829> means<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.610> hold

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
lid now the lid means that it can hold

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.760 
lid now the lid means that it can hold
in<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.149> lot<00:02:06.299> more<00:02:06.329> moisture<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:07.229> I've<00:02:07.500> already

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
in a lot more moisture and I've already

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.830 
in a lot more moisture and I've already
taken<00:02:07.979> care<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.459> work<00:02:08.640> here<00:02:08.910> by<00:02:09.300> selecting

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
taken care of the work here by selecting

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.260 
taken care of the work here by selecting
plants<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.379> like<00:02:10.619> moisture

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
plants that like moisture

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.490 
plants that like moisture
and<00:02:11.360> they<00:02:11.480> should<00:02:11.720> be<00:02:11.870> fine<00:02:12.110> inside<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.470> a

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
and they should be fine inside of a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.050 
and they should be fine inside of a
train<00:02:12.740> like<00:02:12.980> this<00:02:13.190> really<00:02:13.520> what<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:13.880> have<00:02:13.970> to

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
train like this really what you have to

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.970 
train like this really what you have to
watch<00:02:14.210> out<00:02:14.450> for<00:02:14.480> it's<00:02:15.140> too<00:02:15.440> much<00:02:15.620> condensation

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
watch out for it's too much condensation

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.040 
watch out for it's too much condensation
around<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.030> edge<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.510> terrarium<00:02:17.810> and

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
around the edge of the terrarium and

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.650 
around the edge of the terrarium and
it's<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.320> very<00:02:18.500> simple<00:02:18.890> process<00:02:19.100> of<00:02:19.550> taking<00:02:20.270> off

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
it's a very simple process of taking off

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.360 
it's a very simple process of taking off
the<00:02:20.900> lid<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.350> all<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.620> do<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:21.890> leave<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.100> lid

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
the lid and all you do is leave the lid

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.010 
the lid and all you do is leave the lid
off<00:02:22.520> or<00:02:22.820> just<00:02:23.180> leave<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.480> lid<00:02:23.630> kind<00:02:23.900> of

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
off or just leave the lid kind of

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.560 
off or just leave the lid kind of
cracked<00:02:24.260> about<00:02:24.470> halfway<00:02:24.950> like<00:02:25.310> this<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.910> then

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
cracked about halfway like this and then

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.660 
cracked about halfway like this and then
all<00:02:26.840> your<00:02:27.020> problems<00:02:27.230> will<00:02:27.470> go<00:02:27.590> away<00:02:27.710> you<00:02:28.490> might

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
all your problems will go away you might

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.430 
all your problems will go away you might
be<00:02:28.790> wondering<00:02:29.030> how<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.390> water<00:02:29.780> terrariums

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
be wondering how you water terrariums

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.790 
be wondering how you water terrariums
such<00:02:30.590> as<00:02:30.740> this<00:02:30.920> it's<00:02:31.610> actually<00:02:31.790> very<00:02:32.240> simple

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
such as this it's actually very simple

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.530 
such as this it's actually very simple
personally<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:34.040> like<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.700> go<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:34.940> route<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.150> the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
personally I like to go the route of the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.690 
personally I like to go the route of the
turkey<00:02:35.870> baster<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.590> allows<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.130> get<00:02:37.340> water

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
turkey baster it allows you to get water

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.700 
turkey baster it allows you to get water
right<00:02:38.030> down<00:02:38.300> in<00:02:38.600> by<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.870> roots<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.470> plant

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
right down in by the roots of the plant

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.410 
right down in by the roots of the plant
right<00:02:40.190> at<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.430> base<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:40.820> you<00:02:40.910> don't<00:02:41.060> get<00:02:41.150> too

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
right at the base so you don't get too

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.270 
right at the base so you don't get too
much<00:02:41.570> water<00:02:41.810> on<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.200> foliage<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.100> course

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
much water on the foliage and of course

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.860 
much water on the foliage and of course
if<00:02:43.460> you<00:02:43.580> don't<00:02:43.730> have<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:43.940> turkey<00:02:44.300> baster<00:02:44.450> lying

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
if you don't have a turkey baster lying

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.810 
if you don't have a turkey baster lying
around<00:02:45.070> and<00:02:46.070> I<00:02:46.130> couldn't<00:02:46.400> imagine<00:02:46.490> who

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
around and I couldn't imagine who

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.520 
around and I couldn't imagine who
wouldn't<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.600> can<00:02:47.780> always<00:02:48.020> use<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.200> spray

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
wouldn't you can always use a spray

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.520 
wouldn't you can always use a spray

terrarium you'll be able to tell if
you've<00:02:53.180> over<00:02:53.420> why<00:02:53.540> did<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.750> try<00:02:53.990> them<00:02:54.050> by

you've over why did you try them by

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.080 
you've over why did you try them by
looking<00:02:54.680> at<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:54.890> bottom<00:02:55.280> where<00:02:55.850> there's<00:02:56.030> a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
looking at the bottom where there's a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.760 
looking at the bottom where there's a
layer<00:02:56.300> of<00:02:56.540> rocks<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.110> if<00:02:57.320> there's<00:02:57.500> too<00:02:57.740> much

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
layer of rocks and if there's too much

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.980 
layer of rocks and if there's too much
water<00:02:58.220> down<00:02:58.430> there<00:02:58.700> you'll<00:02:59.330> definitely<00:02:59.780> see

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
water down there you'll definitely see

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.150 
water down there you'll definitely see
it<00:03:00.050> moving<00:03:00.320> around<00:03:00.440> then<00:03:00.860> you're<00:03:00.980> probably

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
it moving around then you're probably

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.380 
it moving around then you're probably
just<00:03:01.340> gonna<00:03:01.550> leave<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.910> lid<00:03:02.090> off<00:03:02.240> your
