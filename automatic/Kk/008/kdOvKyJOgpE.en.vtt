because I'm going to build a wall unit

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.110 
because I'm going to build a wall unit
in<00:02:17.580> here<00:02:18.510> using<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.640> barnwood<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.880> maybe<00:02:21.030> a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
in here using the barnwood and maybe a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.340 
in here using the barnwood and maybe a
little<00:02:21.240> bit<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.630> cedar<00:02:21.900> are<00:02:22.080> kind<00:02:22.290> of

people I know that if you don't deal on

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.180 
people I know that if you don't deal on
the<00:02:29.220> rail<00:02:29.370> plan<00:02:29.760> tree<00:02:30.000> or<00:02:30.180> reclaimed<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
the rail plan tree or reclaimed and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.800 
the rail plan tree or reclaimed and
stuff<00:02:32.190> see<00:02:32.550> if<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.730> find<00:02:32.970> any<00:02:33.120> more<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.510> cedar

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
stuff see if I find any more the cedar

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.910 
stuff see if I find any more the cedar
because<00:02:34.020> I'd<00:02:34.170> like<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.410> use<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.530> little<00:02:34.800> bit

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
because I'd like to use a little bit

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.220 
because I'd like to use a little bit

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
the day is fast you can build a three

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.170 
the day is fast you can build a three
tier<00:02:43.620> I'm<00:02:44.100> gonna<00:02:44.250> finish<00:02:44.490> up<00:02:44.640> these<00:02:44.850> shelves

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
tier I'm gonna finish up these shelves

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.880 
tier I'm gonna finish up these shelves
either<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:45.690> tacked<00:02:45.930> on<00:02:46.170> here<00:02:46.440> just<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.740> get

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
either just tacked on here just to get

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.930 
either just tacked on here just to get
it<00:02:49.100> idea<00:02:50.100> where<00:02:50.250> we're<00:02:50.400> going<00:02:50.520> we<00:02:50.640> got<00:02:50.790> our

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
it idea where we're going we got our

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.230 
it idea where we're going we got our
pattern<00:02:51.360> down<00:02:51.510> there<00:02:52.280> but<00:02:53.280> I've<00:02:53.400> made<00:02:53.790> for

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
pattern down there but I've made for

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.450 
pattern down there but I've made for
this<00:02:54.390> binge<00:02:55.170> it's<00:02:55.530> been<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> pretty<00:02:55.920> trick<00:02:56.190> deal

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
this binge it's been a pretty trick deal

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.520 
this binge it's been a pretty trick deal

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
doing all these these bends and curves

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.320 
doing all these these bends and curves
and<00:02:59.100> stuffs<00:02:59.370> kind<00:02:59.550> of<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.850> different<00:03:00.270> thing

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
and stuffs kind of a different thing

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.030 
and stuffs kind of a different thing
that's<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.050> hadn't<00:03:01.470> done<00:03:01.620> before<00:03:03.830> so<00:03:04.830> anyway

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
that's I hadn't done before so anyway

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.620 
that's I hadn't done before so anyway
it's<00:03:05.160> time<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.400> build<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.760> three-term<00:03:06.210> I<00:03:06.420> build

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
it's time to build a three-term I build

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.050 
it's time to build a three-term I build
a<00:03:06.750> tier<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.080> don't<00:03:07.380> know<00:03:07.470> sliding<00:03:08.130> it's<00:03:08.760> really

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
a tier I don't know sliding it's really

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.850 
a tier I don't know sliding it's really
messing<00:03:09.390> with<00:03:09.450> everything<00:03:09.840> I'm<00:03:10.680> going<00:03:10.800> to

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
raise us I'm going to have a shelf here

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.150 
raise us I'm going to have a shelf here
and<00:03:17.570> to<00:03:18.570> lower<00:03:18.780> our<00:03:18.930> show<00:03:19.170> up<00:03:19.230> on<00:03:19.350> this<00:03:19.530> side
