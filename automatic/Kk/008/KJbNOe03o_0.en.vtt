you don't looking at the place looking

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.170 
you don't looking at the place looking
at<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> defense<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.670> much<00:01:08.729> did<00:01:09.060> I

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
at the defense it's just so much did I

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.580 
at the defense it's just so much did I
deal<00:01:09.390> with<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.600> first<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.500> know

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
deal with that first but you know

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.380 
deal with that first but you know
hopefully<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.010> slows<00:01:11.189> down<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.640> me<00:01:11.760> that's<00:01:12.270> not

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
hopefully it slows down to me that's not

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.780 
hopefully it slows down to me that's not
develop<00:01:12.900> right<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.500> our<00:01:14.010> offense<00:01:14.430> has<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
develop right it's our offense has the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.190 
develop right it's our offense has the
potential<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.270> extremely<00:01:15.659> potent<00:01:16.140> you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
potential to be extremely potent you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.660 
potential to be extremely potent you
know<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.530> players<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
know the players that we have the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.730 
know the players that we have the
schemes<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.049> detail<00:01:19.590> down

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
schemes if we just get this detail down

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.020 
schemes if we just get this detail down
I<00:01:19.770> think<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.189> showed<00:01:20.400> today<00:01:20.580> when<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:20.970> were

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
I think it showed today when we were

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.480 
I think it showed today when we were
clicking<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:22.290> know<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> possibilities

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
clicking you know it's the possibilities

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.770 
clicking you know it's the possibilities
are<00:01:23.549> endless<00:01:23.610> for<00:01:24.060> us<00:01:24.119> i<00:01:24.299> think<00:01:24.479> it's<00:01:24.600> just

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
are endless for us i think it's just

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.570 
are endless for us i think it's just
this<00:01:24.900> attention<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.350> detail<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:26.430> that

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
this attention to detail you know that

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.310 
this attention to detail you know that
we<00:01:26.700> need<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.880> get<00:01:27.090> down<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.600> our<00:01:27.960> offense<00:01:28.229> is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
we need to get down and our offense is

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.370 
we need to get down and our offense is
going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.680> explosive<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.909> know<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.030> think

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
going to be explosive you know I think

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
going to be explosive you know I think
you<00:01:31.380> know<00:01:31.470> watching<00:01:31.710> film<00:01:32.159> obviously<00:01:32.850> getting

back angle you know maybe hiding what
the<00:01:38.250> play<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.490> or<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.570> reading<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> defense

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the play is or just reading the defense

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the mental reps of it just getting that

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.350 
the mental reps of it just getting that
down<00:01:49.770> will<00:01:50.009> help<00:01:50.100> me<00:01:50.280> find<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.909> field<00:01:51.149> I

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
end yeah I think it's just something we

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.830 
end yeah I think it's just something we
all<00:02:23.670> know<00:02:23.850> when<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.090> get<00:02:24.180> better<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.750> it's

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
all know when you get better and it's

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.790 
all know when you get better and it's
something<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.140> know<00:02:25.230> we've<00:02:25.380> been<00:02:25.410> up<00:02:25.650> and

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
something you know we've been up and

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.110 
something you know we've been up and
down<00:02:25.830> with<00:02:25.950> all<00:02:26.280> spring<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.610> something<00:02:27.000> our

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
down with all spring and something our

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.790 
down with all spring and something our
main<00:02:27.300> focus<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.350> know<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.470> think<00:02:28.590> we'll

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
main focus and you know I think we'll

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.790 
main focus and you know I think we'll
get<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.100> point<00:02:29.280> where<00:02:29.460> we<00:02:29.520> gotta<00:02:29.700> study<00:02:29.970> a

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
get to the point where we gotta study a

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.050 
get to the point where we gotta study a
steady<00:02:31.800> stream<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.370> know<00:02:32.460> consistency

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
steady stream of you know consistency

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.460 
steady stream of you know consistency
there<00:02:33.270> but<00:02:33.600> it's<00:02:34.020> something<00:02:34.170> we'll<00:02:34.320> continue

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
there but it's something we'll continue

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.840 
there but it's something we'll continue
to<00:02:34.680> work<00:02:34.800> on<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.220> continue<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.520> get<00:02:35.610> better<00:02:35.760> at

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
to work on and continue to get better at

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.790 
to work on and continue to get better at
I<00:02:36.180> think<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:36.960> just<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.170> establishing<00:02:37.650> a

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
I think it's just to establishing a

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.200 
I think it's just to establishing a
leadership<00:02:38.280> role<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.550> crew<00:02:38.820> team<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.120> get

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
leadership role and crew team to get

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.160 
leadership role and crew team to get
better<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.480> think<00:02:39.600> every<00:02:39.870> day<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.080> an

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
better I think every day is an

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.320 
better I think every day is an
opportunity<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:41.310> know<00:02:41.400> step<00:02:41.700> up<00:02:41.910> be<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.180> guy

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
opportunity you know step up be the guy

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.820 
opportunity you know step up be the guy
and<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.780> continue<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.170> get<00:02:43.260> better<00:02:43.470> as<00:02:43.710> an

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
and to continue to get better as an

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.960 
and to continue to get better as an
individual<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.370> that's<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.760> know<00:02:44.790> the
