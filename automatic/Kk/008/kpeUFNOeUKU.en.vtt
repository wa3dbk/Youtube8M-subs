of different ways how you could use

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.140 
of different ways how you could use
applications<00:01:37.320> across<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:38.220> number<00:01:38.850> of

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
platforms and this is not something we

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.300 
platforms and this is not something we
as<00:01:44.700> relevant<00:01:45.270> alone<00:01:45.720> or<00:01:46.049> any<00:01:46.380> company<00:01:46.950> alone

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
as relevant alone or any company alone

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.660 
as relevant alone or any company alone
could<00:01:48.119> find<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> next<00:01:49.229> big<00:01:49.439> company<00:01:50.399> or<00:01:50.520> the

could find the next big company or the
next<00:01:50.850> big<00:01:51.149> thing<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.530> much<00:01:52.799> much<00:01:53.009> better

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
next big thing so it's much much better

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.010 
next big thing so it's much much better
to<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:56.430> think<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.939> ways<00:01:57.119> how<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.420> could<00:01:57.719> tap

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
to to think of ways how we could tap

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.580 
to to think of ways how we could tap
into<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:59.189> brightest<00:01:59.700> talent<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.590> having

into the brightest talent and having

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.230 
into the brightest talent and having
such<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> competition<00:02:02.369> obvious<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> very

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
such a competition obvious is a very

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.280 
such a competition obvious is a very
good<00:02:03.299> way<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:04.380> do<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:06.170> really<00:02:07.170> look

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
good way to do so so I really look

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.369
