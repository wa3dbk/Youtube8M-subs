00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
insects America publishing I don't know

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.050 
insects America publishing I don't know
whether<00:02:44.850> that's<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.360> buggy<00:02:45.860> or<00:02:46.860> not<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.520> don't

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
whether that's a buggy or not I don't

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.990 
whether that's a buggy or not I don't
think<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.570> is<00:02:48.810> cuz<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.500> think<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.460> operators

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
think that is cuz I think the operators

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.830 
think that is cuz I think the operators
would<00:02:51.390> be<00:02:51.570> smart<00:02:51.990> enough<00:02:52.460> not<00:02:53.460> to<00:02:53.520> let<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.600> be

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
would be smart enough not to let that be

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.980 
would be smart enough not to let that be
a<00:02:54.870> bug<00:02:55.880> honestly<00:02:56.880> I'm<00:02:57.000> not<00:02:57.360> gonna<00:02:57.600> lie<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.840> you

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
a bug honestly I'm not gonna lie to you

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.160 
a bug honestly I'm not gonna lie to you
guys

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
guys

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.610 
guys
I<00:02:58.320> think<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.920> operators<00:03:00.230> would<00:03:01.230> fix<00:03:01.500> that

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
I think the operators would fix that

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.170 
I think the operators would fix that
like<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:03.240> bug<00:03:03.860> so-called<00:03:04.860> bug<00:03:05.310> would

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
like this this bug so-called bug would

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.310 
like this this bug so-called bug would
be<00:03:07.040> gone<00:03:08.040> cuz<00:03:08.670> this<00:03:08.910> bug<00:03:09.180> was<00:03:09.390> in<00:03:09.420> like<00:03:09.720> back<00:03:10.110> to

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
be gone cuz this bug was in like back to

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.280
