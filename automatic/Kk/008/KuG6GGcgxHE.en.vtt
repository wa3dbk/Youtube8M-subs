okay well today people we're building a

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.880 
okay well today people we're building a
box<00:00:11.850> for<00:00:13.010> these<00:00:14.010> two<00:00:14.570> jvc<00:00:15.619> 12<00:00:16.619> inch<00:00:16.800> subs<00:00:17.070> okay

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
box for these two jvc 12 inch subs okay

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.689 
box for these two jvc 12 inch subs okay
150<00:00:19.890> watts<00:00:20.070> each<00:00:20.220> RMS<00:00:21.859> they're<00:00:22.859> just<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.250> single

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
150 watts each RMS they're just a single

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.840 
150 watts each RMS they're just a single
for<00:00:23.910> home<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.510> what<00:00:24.630> they<00:00:24.750> were<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:25.020> now

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
for home this is what they were in now

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.810 
for home this is what they were in now
ready<00:00:27.109> that's<00:00:28.220> this<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.580> crappiest

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
ready that's this is the crappiest

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.540 
ready that's this is the crappiest
little<00:00:30.210> boxes<00:00:30.539> ever<00:00:30.689> part<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> interior<00:00:32.400> I

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
little boxes ever part of the interior I

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.049 
little boxes ever part of the interior I
would<00:00:32.760> say<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.269> a<00:00:33.300> 20<00:00:33.780> litre<00:00:33.989> box

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
would say that is a 20 litre box

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.910 
would say that is a 20 litre box
okay<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.269> is<00:00:36.300> tiny<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.930> really<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.469> once<00:00:37.800> you

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
okay that is tiny it really is once you

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.680 
okay that is tiny it really is once you
get<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.130> magnet<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.520> there<00:00:38.640> okay

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
get the magnet in there okay

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.389 
get the magnet in there okay
that<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.260> way<00:00:40.500> too<00:00:40.559> small<00:00:40.980> for<00:00:41.309> those

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that is just way too small for those

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.060 
that is just way too small for those
subs<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.850> don't<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.600> 12<00:00:43.320> inch<00:00:43.469> sub<00:00:43.680> would<00:00:43.920> be

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
subs I don't what 12 inch sub would be

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.979 
subs I don't what 12 inch sub would be
that<00:00:44.280> would<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:44.910> right<00:00:45.090> size<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.540> I<00:00:45.719> got

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
that would be the right size that I got

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.660 
that would be the right size that I got
would<00:00:46.260> cut<00:00:46.530> up<00:00:46.680> there's<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> top<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.610> bottom

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
would cut up there's the top and bottom

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.319 
would cut up there's the top and bottom
of<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> box<00:00:52.340> it's<00:00:53.340> gonna<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.550> very<00:00:53.760> flat<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
of the box it's gonna be very flat and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.189 
of the box it's gonna be very flat and
there's<00:00:55.230> media<00:00:55.850> signs<00:00:56.899> these<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:58.079> been

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
there's media signs these have been

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.889 
there's media signs these have been
sanded<00:00:58.829> with<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.730> it<00:01:00.420> actually<00:01:00.719> works

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
sanded with that it actually works

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:01.610 
sanded with that it actually works
really<00:01:00.989> well

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
really well

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.850 
really well
I<00:01:01.649> mean<00:01:01.860> 35<00:01:02.309> bucks<00:01:02.629> brand-new<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.680> works

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
I mean 35 bucks brand-new and it works

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.310 
I mean 35 bucks brand-new and it works
really<00:01:05.190> well<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:06.180> know<00:01:06.630> there's<00:01:06.899> a<00:01:06.960> little<00:01:07.110> bit

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
really well I know there's a little bit

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.230 
really well I know there's a little bit
of<00:01:07.350> grooves<00:01:08.009> in<00:01:08.250> there<00:01:08.369> but<00:01:08.549> that's<00:01:08.640> because<00:01:08.850> I

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
of grooves in there but that's because I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.539 
of grooves in there but that's because I
can't<00:01:09.810> send<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.140> side<00:01:10.380> down<00:01:10.619> because<00:01:10.860> this

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
can't send this side down because this

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.920 
can't send this side down because this
was<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> bigger<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.630> they're<00:01:12.810> about

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
was the bigger one and now they're about

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.740 
was the bigger one and now they're about
the<00:01:13.049> same<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.880> doesn't<00:01:15.090> matter<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.630> might

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the same so but doesn't matter you might

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.390 
the same so but doesn't matter you might
say<00:01:16.020> any<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.229> those<00:01:16.350> joins<00:01:16.680> they'll<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.100> up

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
say any of those joins they'll be up

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.190 
say any of those joins they'll be up
against<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.909> top<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.210> bottom<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.720> fine

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
against the top and bottom so it's fine

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.429 
against the top and bottom so it's fine
and<00:01:19.500> then<00:01:19.680> here's<00:01:19.860> me<00:01:20.070> two<00:01:20.220> big<00:01:20.430> sheets<00:01:21.439> oops

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
and then here's me two big sheets oops

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.859 
and then here's me two big sheets oops
again<00:01:22.970> actually<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> different<00:01:24.360> sides<00:01:24.570> there

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
again actually the different sides there

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.270 
again actually the different sides there
that's<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> stock<00:01:25.470> side<00:01:25.680> that's<00:01:25.979> design<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
that's the stock side that's design I

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.210 
that's the stock side that's design I
come<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.600> anyway<00:01:27.900> worked<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.950> well

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
come but anyway worked really well

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.490 
come but anyway worked really well
saying<00:01:29.700> them<00:01:29.850> pretty<00:01:30.060> quick<00:01:30.299> volume<00:01:31.229> wise

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
saying them pretty quick volume wise

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.749 
saying them pretty quick volume wise
this<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.130> should<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:32.840> roughly<00:01:34.009> double<00:01:35.009> okay

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
this one should be roughly double okay

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.140 
this one should be roughly double okay
maybe<00:01:36.079> 45<00:01:37.079> 40<00:01:37.470> 40<00:01:37.979> 45<00:01:38.310> percent<00:01:38.640> bigger<00:01:38.790> but

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
maybe 45 40 40 45 percent bigger but

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.499 
maybe 45 40 40 45 percent bigger but
ported<00:01:39.509> obviously<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.540> this<00:01:43.340> okay

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
ported obviously and that is this okay

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.910 
ported obviously and that is this okay
I'm<00:01:45.509> obviously<00:01:45.930> that's<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> bit<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.799> need

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
I'm obviously that's just the bit I need

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.590 
I'm obviously that's just the bit I need
to<00:01:47.100> cut<00:01:47.310> out<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.729> don't<00:01:47.970> need<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.149> cut<00:01:48.329> out<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
to cut out I don't need to cut out the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.749 
to cut out I don't need to cut out the
whole<00:01:48.720> shape<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> end<00:01:50.700> of

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
whole shape of it it's just the end of

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.090 
whole shape of it it's just the end of
it<00:01:50.880> okay<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> front<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.890> box

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
it okay and this is the front of the box

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.749 
it okay and this is the front of the box
here<00:01:53.720> anyway<00:01:54.720> because<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.079> amps<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:56.460> side

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
here anyway because the amps that side

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.370 
here anyway because the amps that side
is<00:01:57.119> where<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.390> speakers<00:01:57.720> come<00:01:57.750> out<00:01:58.020> send<00:01:58.290> me<00:01:58.350> a

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
there perfectly straight you know I got

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.390 
there perfectly straight you know I got
about<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.330> millimeter<00:03:03.780> overhang<00:03:04.230> on<00:03:04.470> one

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
about a millimeter overhang on one

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.509 
about a millimeter overhang on one
length<00:03:05.730> way<00:03:06.090> like<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:07.080> yeah<00:03:07.409> I'm<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.980> big<00:03:08.250> deal

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
length way like that yeah I'm a big deal

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.720 
length way like that yeah I'm a big deal
you<00:03:08.970> would<00:03:09.120> think<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.720> port<00:03:10.019> is<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.830> that

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
you would think the port is that that

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.180 
you would think the port is that that
thing<00:03:12.379> looks<00:03:13.379> like<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.530> little<00:03:13.739> door<00:03:15.379> okay<00:03:16.379> so

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
thing looks like a little door okay so

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.070 
thing looks like a little door okay so
that's<00:03:17.370> glued<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.060> screwed<00:03:18.150> now<00:03:18.629> that's<00:03:18.930> a

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
that's glued and screwed now that's a

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.759 
that's glued and screwed now that's a
solid<00:03:19.620> frame<00:03:20.720> okay<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.290> next<00:03:22.409> thing<00:03:22.590> is

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
solid frame okay so the next thing is

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.040 
solid frame okay so the next thing is
I'm<00:03:22.890> going<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.069> grab<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.310> top<00:03:23.840> half<00:03:24.840> under

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
I'm going to grab that top half under

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.800 
I'm going to grab that top half under
the<00:03:25.170> carpet<00:03:25.530> for<00:03:25.590> some<00:03:25.769> reason<00:03:26.159> and<00:03:26.510> I'm<00:03:27.510> going

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
the carpet for some reason and I'm going

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.990 
the carpet for some reason and I'm going
to<00:03:27.989> cut<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.440> poor<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.769> out<00:03:28.890> now<00:03:29.640> it's<00:03:29.670> going<00:03:29.940> to

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
to cut the poor it out now it's going to

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.660 
to cut the poor it out now it's going to
be<00:03:30.060> 8<00:03:30.239> by<00:03:30.450> 2<00:03:30.510> inches<00:03:31.129> because<00:03:32.129> the<00:03:32.280> 12<00:03:32.519> inch

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
be 8 by 2 inches because the 12 inch

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.030 
be 8 by 2 inches because the 12 inch
subs<00:03:32.909> so<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.569> thought<00:03:33.810> that<00:03:33.989> was<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.170> appropriate

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
subs so I thought that was a appropriate

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.170 
subs so I thought that was a appropriate
size<00:03:35.280> for<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.700> port<00:03:37.459> once<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.610> looking<00:03:38.970> I

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
size for the port once in looking I

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.369 
size for the port once in looking I
didn't<00:03:39.420> want<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.629> to<00:03:39.659> look<00:03:39.780> too<00:03:39.900> small<00:03:40.260> I'd

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
didn't want it to look too small I'd

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.020 
didn't want it to look too small I'd
rather<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.739> be<00:03:40.769> tall<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.250> ski<00:03:41.430> then<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.760> short

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
rather it be tall and ski then the short

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.119 
rather it be tall and ski then the short
and<00:03:42.120> fat<00:03:42.330> oh<00:03:42.569> yeah<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.140> mean<00:03:43.319> squared<00:03:43.650> rather<00:03:43.950> be

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
and fat oh yeah I mean squared rather be

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:45.740 
and fat oh yeah I mean squared rather be
a<00:03:44.159> rectangle<00:03:44.610> just<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.879> look<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.450> I<00:03:45.510> wanted

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
a rectangle just to look and I wanted

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.539 
a rectangle just to look and I wanted
the<00:03:45.870> slot<00:03:46.080> for<00:03:46.349> it<00:03:46.379> and<00:03:46.769> then<00:03:47.159> it's<00:03:47.370> going<00:03:47.489> to

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
the slot for it and then it's going to

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.960 
the slot for it and then it's going to
be<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.810> 4.3<00:03:48.810> inches<00:03:49.080> deep<00:03:49.409> the<00:03:49.440> port<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.670> that's

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
be a 4.3 inches deep the port and that's

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.670 
be a 4.3 inches deep the port and that's
what<00:03:51.209> it's<00:03:51.360> supposed<00:03:51.659> to<00:03:51.750> -<00:03:51.959> now<00:03:52.140> I'm<00:03:52.260> tuning

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
what it's supposed to - now I'm tuning

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.289 
what it's supposed to - now I'm tuning
the<00:03:52.769> box<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.099> around<00:03:53.340> 45<00:03:53.849> Hertz

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
the box to around 45 Hertz

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.110 
the box to around 45 Hertz
now<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:54.810> know<00:03:54.989> that's<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.290> little<00:03:55.409> higher<00:03:55.680> maybe

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
now I know that's a little higher maybe

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.759 
now I know that's a little higher maybe
it's<00:03:57.120> very<00:03:57.510> good<00:03:57.629> for<00:03:57.689> SPL<00:03:58.110> but<00:03:58.260> it's<00:03:58.379> crap<00:03:58.560> for

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
it's very good for SPL but it's crap for

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.690 
it's very good for SPL but it's crap for
bass<00:03:59.220> but<00:03:59.970> it's<00:04:00.390> my<00:04:00.480> mom's<00:04:00.689> car<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.140> she's<00:04:01.799> she
