the intel side and you need to make sure
you<00:00:56.520> want<00:00:56.760> intel<00:00:57.180> core<00:00:57.210> 2<00:00:57.809> duo<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.469> which<00:00:59.070> is

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you want intel core 2 duo and which is

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.910 
you want intel core 2 duo and which is
running<00:00:59.609> at<00:00:59.730> two<00:00:59.910> point<00:01:00.180> 66<00:01:00.809> gigahertz<00:01:01.199> for

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
running at two point 66 gigahertz for

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.340 
running at two point 66 gigahertz for
the<00:01:01.980> AMD<00:01:02.489> people<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.149> going<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.539> 2.4

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the AMD people is going to be 2.4

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.500 
the AMD people is going to be 2.4
gigahertz<00:01:04.409> or<00:01:05.100> better<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:06.060> does<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
gigahertz or better so does that the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.440 
gigahertz or better so does that the
game<00:01:06.689> does<00:01:06.930> work<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.380> both<00:01:07.590> intel<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.729> AMD<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
game does work on both intel and AMD and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.719 
game does work on both intel and AMD and
kind<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.200> basis<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.860> don't<00:01:11.130> worry<00:01:11.250> about<00:01:11.340> that

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
kind of basis so don't worry about that

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.240 
kind of basis so don't worry about that
whatever<00:01:12.180> process<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.810> got<00:01:13.070> just<00:01:14.070> make<00:01:14.220> sure

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
whatever process you got just make sure

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.280 
whatever process you got just make sure
obviously<00:01:14.610> will<00:01:15.030> work<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.479> your<00:01:15.509> process<00:01:16.080> to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
obviously will work on your process to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.840 
obviously will work on your process to
find<00:01:16.470> out<00:01:16.680> how<00:01:16.830> many<00:01:16.890> giga<00:01:17.250> hertz<00:01:17.490> you're<00:01:17.729> on

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
find out how many giga hertz you're on

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.570 
find out how many giga hertz you're on
and<00:01:18.060> find<00:01:18.780> out<00:01:18.960> what<00:01:19.140> your<00:01:19.290> processor<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.040> just

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
and find out what your processor is just

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.890 
and find out what your processor is just
to<00:01:20.670> make<00:01:20.820> sure<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.090> game<00:01:21.240> will<00:01:21.390> actually<00:01:21.659> run

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
to make sure the game will actually run

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.560 
to make sure the game will actually run
another<00:01:22.650> random<00:01:23.009> access<00:01:23.549> memory<00:01:23.939> or<00:01:24.119> Ram<00:01:24.390> they

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
another random access memory or Ram they

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.570 
another random access memory or Ram they
recommend<00:01:25.020> you're<00:01:25.200> having<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.710> six<00:01:26.340> gigabytes

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
recommend you're having is six gigabytes

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.249 
recommend you're having is six gigabytes

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
head I do know quite a few laptops that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.760 
head I do know quite a few laptops that
are<00:01:34.470> run<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:35.060> four<00:01:36.060> gigabytes<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.600> RAM<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.170> make

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
are run on four gigabytes of RAM so make

obviously<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.479> me<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.810> sounds<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.200> hell<00:01:58.380> of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
they including this it's 50 gigabytes

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.060 
they including this it's 50 gigabytes
and<00:02:03.020> obviously<00:02:04.020> some<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.439> guys<00:02:04.560> only<00:02:04.950> have

maybe 500 gigabyte pcs I'm not hundred

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.830 
maybe 500 gigabyte pcs I'm not hundred
percent<00:02:08.340> sure<00:02:08.429> we<00:02:08.970> need<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.330> make<00:02:09.479> sure<00:02:09.509> you

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
percent sure we need to make sure you

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.080 
percent sure we need to make sure you
have<00:02:10.080> 50<00:02:10.530> gigabytes<00:02:10.770> hard<00:02:11.310> drive<00:02:11.550> space<00:02:11.730> or

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
have 50 gigabytes hard drive space or

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.260 
have 50 gigabytes hard drive space or
more<00:02:12.660> and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
more and

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.910 
more and
so<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.780> hell<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.050> lot<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.500> have<00:02:14.680> for<00:02:14.890> a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
so that is a hell of lot to have for a

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.910 
so that is a hell of lot to have for a
game<00:02:15.130> but<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.580> kind<00:02:15.820> of<00:02:15.940> for<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.140> obvious<00:02:17.680> ease

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
game but I kind of for the obvious ease

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.800 
game but I kind of for the obvious ease
get<00:02:18.160> into<00:02:18.340> next<00:02:18.580> generation<00:02:19.300> sort<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.600> things

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
get into next generation sort of things

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.260 
get into next generation sort of things
the<00:02:19.960> game<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.320> get<00:02:20.500> more<00:02:21.000> complicated<00:02:22.000> and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
the game to get more complicated and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.210 
the game to get more complicated and
there<00:02:22.420> including<00:02:22.870> lots<00:02:23.050> more<00:02:23.320> kind<00:02:23.860> of<00:02:23.980> things

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
there including lots more kind of things

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.770 
there including lots more kind of things
