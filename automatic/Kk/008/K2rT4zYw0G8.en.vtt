00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
could have really gone either way that

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.050 
could have really gone either way that
the<00:01:14.010> judges<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.150> obviously<00:01:15.689> thought<00:01:15.869> that

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
the judges of the obviously thought that

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.990 
the judges of the obviously thought that
Floyd<00:01:18.060> one<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.170> their<00:01:19.770> scorecards<00:01:20.610> were

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
Floyd one and their scorecards were

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.580 
Floyd one and their scorecards were
except<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.689> one<00:01:21.750> judge<00:01:22.140> their

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
except for that one judge their

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.399 
except for that one judge their
scorecards<00:01:23.189> or<00:01:23.369> were<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:24.000> little<00:01:24.990> too<00:01:25.200> wide<00:01:25.380> for

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
scorecards or were a little too wide for

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.289 
scorecards or were a little too wide for
my<00:01:25.710> taste<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.430> what<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.790> that's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
my taste but it is what it is that's

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.550 
my taste but it is what it is that's
what<00:01:27.420> I'm<00:01:27.479> not<00:01:27.630> really<00:01:27.750> pissed<00:01:28.049> off<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
what I'm not really pissed off with the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.590 
what I'm not really pissed off with the
decision<00:01:29.070> because<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.820> really<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> close

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
decision because it really was a close

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.929 
decision because it really was a close
fight<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.020> could<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.259> gone<00:01:31.290> either<00:01:31.500> way

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
fight that could have gone either way

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.700 
fight that could have gone either way
but<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.210> said<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.420> thought<00:01:33.689> my<00:01:34.259> done<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.470> did

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710

really were a lot of close rounds I mean
that<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:01.409> me<00:02:01.939> here<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:02.969> threw<00:02:03.270> away<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.689> throw

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
that to me here I threw away I throw

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.810 
that to me here I threw away I throw
away<00:02:04.200> my<00:02:04.380> scorecards<00:02:04.950> already<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.430> was

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
away my scorecards already I was

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.190 
away my scorecards already I was
cleaning<00:02:06.090> earlier<00:02:06.479> today<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.869> throw<00:02:07.049> away

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
cleaning earlier today and I throw away

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.169 
cleaning earlier today and I throw away
my<00:02:07.320> scorecards<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.190> remember<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.149> remember

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
my scorecards but I remember I remember

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.660 
my scorecards but I remember I remember
saying<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.989> basically<00:02:10.440> half<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.340> fight

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
saying that basically half of that fight

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.840 
saying that basically half of that fight
was<00:02:12.330> close<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.440> capped

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
was close that capped

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.130 
was close that capped
were<00:02:13.910> like<00:02:14.090> six<00:02:14.420> rounds<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.870> could<00:02:15.050> have

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
were like six rounds that could have

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.390 
were like six rounds that could have
gone<00:02:15.170> either<00:02:15.350> way<00:02:15.590> at<00:02:15.890> least<00:02:16.010> in<00:02:16.160> my<00:02:16.280> opinion

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
gone either way at least in my opinion

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.260 
gone either way at least in my opinion
that's<00:02:16.730> what<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:16.910> remember<00:02:16.970> saying<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:19.270> yeah

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
that's what I remember saying and yeah

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.740 
that's what I remember saying and yeah
it<00:02:20.570> wasn't<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.900> clear<00:02:21.140> win<00:02:21.760> but<00:02:22.760> believe<00:02:23.600> what

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
it wasn't a clear win but believe what

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.070 
it wasn't a clear win but believe what
you<00:02:23.840> want<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.110> believe<00:02:24.520> if<00:02:25.520> you<00:02:26.180> really

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
you want to believe if you really

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.670 
you want to believe if you really
believe<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.550> my<00:02:28.550> dad<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:28.760> want<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.240> then<00:02:29.680> go

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
believe that my dad I want it then go

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.320 
believe that my dad I want it then go
ahead<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:30.980> if<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.460> believe<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:32.090> Floyd

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
ahead and if you believe that the Floyd

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.440 
ahead and if you believe that the Floyd
really<00:02:33.170> clearly<00:02:33.410> wanted<00:02:33.860> then<00:02:34.100> go<00:02:34.340> ahead<00:02:34.490> I

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
really clearly wanted then go ahead I

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.720 
really clearly wanted then go ahead I
guess<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.470> only<00:02:36.560> way<00:02:36.710> to<00:02:36.860> sort<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.370> out<00:02:37.460> it's<00:02:37.670> a

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
guess the only way to sort it out it's a

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.520 
guess the only way to sort it out it's a
rematch<00:02:38.090> but<00:02:38.420> we'll<00:02:38.930> have<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.080> wait<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.350> see

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
rematch but we'll have to wait and see

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.770 
rematch but we'll have to wait and see
about<00:02:39.710> that<00:02:40.040> but<00:02:40.820> anyway<00:02:41.330> just<00:02:41.480> time<00:02:41.660> know

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
about that but anyway just time know
