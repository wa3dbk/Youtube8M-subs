00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.499 
differently so a size three in the voila
might<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.400> different<00:01:23.759> from<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.970> size<00:01:24.150> three<00:01:24.420> of

the trans francais and different from
the<00:01:26.640> Hugh<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:28.170> need<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.530> make<00:01:28.680> sure

that you check before you purchase
different<00:01:33.119> brands<00:01:33.869> affect<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:35.100> fit<00:01:35.340> as<00:01:35.549> well

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
different brands affect the fit as well

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.840 
different brands affect the fit as well
American<00:01:37.229> brands<00:01:37.560> tend<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.040> larger<00:01:38.549> they

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
American brands tend to be larger they

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.469 
American brands tend to be larger they
have<00:01:39.030> more<00:01:39.299> room<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:39.810> tend<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.170> longer

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
have more room they tend to be longer

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.770 
have more room they tend to be longer
European<00:01:42.479> brands<00:01:42.930> tend<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:43.500> made<00:01:43.770> small

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
European brands tend to be made small

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.230 
European brands tend to be made small
because<00:01:45.780> Europeans<00:01:46.409> tend<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:47.090> smaller<00:01:48.090> I

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
because Europeans tend to be smaller I

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.060 
because Europeans tend to be smaller I
know<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.659> generalization<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.799> that's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
know it's a generalization but that's

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.139 
know it's a generalization but that's
just<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> way<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.579> tights<00:01:50.939> bit<00:01:52.399> so<00:01:53.399> also<00:01:54.000> no

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
just the way the tights bit so also no

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.850 
just the way the tights bit so also no
two<00:01:54.329> brands<00:01:54.659> fit<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> same<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.590> need<00:01:55.740> to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
two brands fit the same so you need to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.730 
two brands fit the same so you need to
keep<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.280> mind<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.530> even<00:01:58.530> though<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
keep that in mind so even though the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.149 
keep that in mind so even though the
Hugh<00:01:59.009> fits<00:01:59.430> long<00:02:00.409> another<00:02:01.409> American<00:02:01.920> brand

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
Hugh fits long another American brand

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.190 
Hugh fits long another American brand
might<00:02:02.460> not<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.180> Canadian<00:02:03.630> brand<00:02:03.899> Monde

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
might not like the Canadian brand Monde

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.089 
might not like the Canadian brand Monde
or<00:02:04.409> its<00:02:05.310> small<00:02:06.180> if<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.840> runs<00:02:07.290> fairly<00:02:07.649> true<00:02:08.009> to

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
or its small if it runs fairly true to

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.100 
or its small if it runs fairly true to
size<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> smaller<00:02:09.360> fit<00:02:09.720> there's<00:02:09.959> not

so make sure that you ask about that

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.920 
so make sure that you ask about that
before<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.340> buy<00:02:18.610> because<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:19.750> can<00:02:19.900> affect

before you buy because it can affect

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.850 
before you buy because it can affect
which<00:02:20.620> size<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.099> get<00:02:22.349> if<00:02:23.349> you<00:02:23.530> find<00:02:23.739> that

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
which size you get if you find that

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.500 
which size you get if you find that
you're<00:02:24.010> at<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.220> end<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.459> a<00:02:24.520> size<00:02:24.730> range<00:02:25.060> make

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
you're at the end of a size range make

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.050 
you're at the end of a size range make
sure<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:25.989> get<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.319> next<00:02:26.590> size<00:02:26.770> up

sure that you get the next size up

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.550 
sure that you get the next size up
because<00:02:28.060> if<00:02:28.270> you're<00:02:28.420> at<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.660> end<00:02:28.690> they'll

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
because if you're at the end they'll

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.580 
because if you're at the end they'll
probably<00:02:29.830> be<00:02:30.340> too<00:02:30.550> small<00:02:30.940> for<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.590> they

so the right size is really important to
get<00:02:44.290> because<00:02:44.950> if<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.459> get<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.640> pair<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:45.970> are

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
too small the crotch will hang down

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.479 
too small the crotch will hang down
below<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.060> knees<00:02:49.420> or<00:02:49.930> between<00:02:50.319> it'll<00:02:51.220> just<00:02:51.340> be

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
they might not go all the way up but if

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.130
