00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.979
 very good to all kids welcome 

00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:07.070
 once again to my channel and this time 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:10.400
 I will do a modern warfare tutorial 2 on 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.870
 first video 2.0 what I promised you 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.640
 audio averages that I bring you 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.200
 hands to explain it all the best that 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.730
 can so that you learn to 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.619
 do these little effects that was 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.960
 teaching and good the effect that 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.849
 we will learn today will be the tofu shot a 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.249
 quite pretty effect that remains 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.649
 pretty beast the trick shot and that in 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.539
 general is not used is not used 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:33.050
 much by itself is because people do not 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.320
 He knows how to do it because it is ugly because it is 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.879
 difficult I do not know but to me it is an effect 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.590
 I like it a lot, I like it a lot 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.090
 how it is and nothing I have come to explain 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.310
 First of all, it is not necessary 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.470
 play extreme clear play with play 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.820
 cloud or on both fingers to make 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.309
 this trick shot but I feel more 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.410
 comfortable playing string cloud since it is 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:58.520
 as always I play in this game 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.989
 and I move better then the first thing 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.329
 everything is that to do this freakshow 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.640
 this effect you need bayern or bullet 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.610
 charger worth you need to have a bad 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.460
 - in the charger 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.980
 and what you have to do is turn for a 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.870
 side to another because we need the 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.670
 look crooked note you know that 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.130
 demand is on the one hand and right after 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.830
 point to either this side or the 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.140
 another one because the look scales like ice cream and 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.550
 that is something fundamental that is the first 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.470
 step to make this effect worth 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.320
 then when we already have a bullet 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.450
 emptied we rotate and aim is worth the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.950
 next step is to reload that is the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.300
 why we have emptied the rod 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.910
 at the beginning alert we rotate we aim 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.530
 we recharge and the next step is to cancel 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.119
 the recharge is worth and here is where 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.240
 divided into different ways of 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.150
 do this effect depending on the style 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.370
 of trick shot of height etc 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.290
 to make complex is something that is usually 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.940
 do quite this effect is used 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.640
 enough for complex but that does not have 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.590
 why be only for complex what 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.870
 what is done is to make one after the other 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.790
 pretty fast since in a round of 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.970
 time ago three or four confusions 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.700
 I would come to do would come to be 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.020
 the next thing would be rotate aim good 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.780
 then more than anything for you to see 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.960
 as to the effect that is, that is, you see 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.430
 that the franc rises up 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.430
 the effect is that bullet 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.209
 and what they do now is what they 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.450
 used for the components that is 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.580
 make one and then another another another and 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.200
 make the most of us at the minimum 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.780
 possible time is like the 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.819
 state registry that you know that many 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.460
 sad in extreme extremes and what 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.820
 I feel in 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.580
 in complex then it is to abuse without counting 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.560
 put as many defects in it 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.010
 Wolf time would already be changes 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.990
 difficult and all that and well this is 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.130
 something that is used quite and ya 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.900
 I say is the next turn to aim 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.230
 reload sprint re-target 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.450
 reload give re-point recharge 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.730
 the pri half 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.730
 ok it 's something continuous that keeps repeating 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.760
 and is doing one after the other 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.860
 and then the other way and the one that I 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.080
 I use more frequently when I do 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.269
 this effect is to make a tofu shot and 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.370
 then make a like to do a like 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.440
 to give the next round either 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.319
 continue or robert and shoot the bullet 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.010
 It would be something like that 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:35.250
 tofu light 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.250
 2 fusion light and we brake vale 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.180
 for example, imagine that you are 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.180
 here 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.320
 okay 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.850
 and then the other way that also 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.920
 she looks pretty and does not have to 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.700
 being complex is with coolness 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.700
 thrown vale 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.430
 to make the effect reload and remove the 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.030
 red credit 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.030
 okay 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.500
 would be these are the three ways 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.130
 d 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.720
 to make the tofu shorebank you have to 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.700
 keep in mind that to do this 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.070
 text you have to point to you have to 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.350
 aiming with the aim is not necessary that 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.109
 you see the cross is worth but yes you have 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.350
 what to put a little more you have to 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.810
 spend some time being still and 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.400
 giving the l1 this which means that if 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.960
 you have a very small height like 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.570
 would come from here to the ground or 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.010
 something similar will give us time to 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.230
 watch what you should do 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.900
 up and then jump and make a line 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.520
 recharging something and shoot since 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.620
 this is a stretch that if this is a 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.129
 effect that if you do it in the air 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.159
 we are going 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:47.949
 it's going to consume us time is worth it and not what 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:49.689
 are you going to be able to do in any way or 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.969
 if you need a minimum to yield 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:53.889
 this effect I recommend a 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:55.719
 height appeared this is a height 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.879
 quite appropriate to do this 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:05:01.059
 trichet and what would come to do the 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:03.759
 tricot as I have already told you is to turn 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:05.469
 point reload sprint if you want 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.999
 continue doing this effect once 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:09.610
 behind another 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:11.259
 good you have to repeat in each time 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.869
 cancel is to put another auto fusion until 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.429
 that one obviously while doing two 

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:17.289
 courses one after the other there is a moment 

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:19.659
 in which the sight is getting or is 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.819
 it would be getting straight straighter more 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:25.149
 straight straighter and there is a time when 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:28.019
 in which the effect is lost and no longer 

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:30.999
 would leave valeria at the beginning if it comes out 

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:32.529
 but little by little he kept losing and every 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:35.139
 once the franc and it would look more straight until 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:37.419
 that there is a moment when I would not leave 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.759
 but how do you best know how to do this 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.649
 effect plus tofu followed you can do 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.659
 now a time when you can do 20 

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:45.460
 then he tried me was served without 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.319
 lose the effect 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.919
 this already depends 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:54.620
 you will see 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:57.039
 in the air it would be slowing down a 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.039
 moment and 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:03.880
 but it has not come out excuse me 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:08.290
 it would be slowing down but in a moment of 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:10.620
 aim reload light and shoot would be 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.620
 something like that 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:24.210
 ok and good as more time you point more 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.920
 exaggerated you will get the effect but more 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.450
 time you are going to lose and therefore you are 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.240
 touching the ground and that's the worst thing 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.980
 I can have a reach 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:38.150
 ok and nothing the tofu sotés these kids 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:40.910
 but it is already understood and the hands 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:44.810
 and that's the advantage of 2.0 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:47.210
 It's worth nothing kids I hope that I have 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.510
 served this video give cane to learn 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.820
 To do it 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.890
 and good I hope you liked the 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.790
 video give the like to subscribe and we 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.790
 we see in the next
