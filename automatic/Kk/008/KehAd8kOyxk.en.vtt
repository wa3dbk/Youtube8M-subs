00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.150
 I ran the stove 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.630
 January 13 practically no such index 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.630
 but their own hawk on the internet 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.749
 in the beginning I thought it better from day 3 they 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.410
 the pink house where he delivers 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.499
 even sounded in early February 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.109
 while they said that the delivery of the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.939
 I dedicate to this confirms payment seems to have stayed 10 days feel 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.779
 a lot more three days 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.880
 good the first payment arrived 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.349
 it being the month of January he came spoiled with throat problem 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.280
 because I'll bet on the plan 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.790
 the piece as shown in the video 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.790
 he who screwed up ended up raising all this pomp here 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.200
 certainly over time they end up spoiling even more 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.700
 Well, I asked for the exchange. They took much longer here. 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.270
 also wait for the exchange 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.800
 then they made exchanges and met the stove 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.230
 so say neutron on the second wall 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.170
 and staging is also with a much worse problem this time the fact 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.480
 simply does not pay 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.239
 he is in trouble 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.719
 it came completely kneaded in the low lumine profile of the foot 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.090
 because it is urgent to put tyson and then 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.240
 4th shows here 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.140
 The one that I asked for normal 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.620
 They say I cook, we wanted to go. 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.140
 so we wrote back 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.140
 as the compatriot treat their clients 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.820
 he simply does not know if they are their carrier but if the 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.800
 responding carrier 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.100
 she says she injured 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.310
 and this gre-nal treats its customer is the second time that the bad exchange 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.909
 because wants 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.830
 the product is 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.210
 how do you rate 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.970
 this time worse than the first 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.570
 it does not stop until you can see 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.570
 one can use the product like that now I'm waiting 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.130
 usually the exchange that work is the case of the potato also that they 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.640
 promised that in searching for products 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.830
 so this is thanks for the attention just one more little thing 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.189
 today, April 4 just to be clear 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.930
 that the purchase was made on January 3 and April 4, but rather a 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.759
 solution before
