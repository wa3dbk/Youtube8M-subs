is that losing weight is a matter of

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.520 
is that losing weight is a matter of
metabolism<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.330> especially<00:01:15.689> keeping<00:01:16.350> that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
metabolism and especially keeping that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.030 
metabolism and especially keeping that
weight<00:01:16.770> off<00:01:16.979> okay

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
weight off okay

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.490 
weight off okay
the<00:01:20.040> level<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.939> impact<00:01:21.570> your

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the level that you can impact your

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.999 
the level that you can impact your
metabolic<00:01:22.860> function<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.939> level<00:01:24.860> that<00:01:25.860> will

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
metabolic function is a level that will

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.499 
metabolic function is a level that will
determine<00:01:26.310> how<00:01:26.490> quickly<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.090> actually

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
determine how quickly you can actually

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.260 
determine how quickly you can actually
get<00:01:27.810> results<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.439> how<00:01:28.590> easy<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.400> for<00:01:29.670> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
get results and how easy it is for you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.550 
get results and how easy it is for you
to<00:01:30.329> keep<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> weight<00:01:30.810> off<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.140> that's<00:01:31.259> why<00:01:31.500> you

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
to keep the weight off so that's why you

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.390 
to keep the weight off so that's why you
typically<00:01:32.159> see<00:01:32.570> people<00:01:33.740> who<00:01:34.740> seem<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.310> able

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
typically see people who seem to be able

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.929 
typically see people who seem to be able
to<00:01:35.579> eat<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.270> lot<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.049> things<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:38.670> gain

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
to eat a lot of things and not gain

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.359 
to eat a lot of things and not gain
weight<00:01:39.210> okay<00:01:39.960> well<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.560> boils<00:01:40.950> down<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
weight okay well it boils down to the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.410 
weight okay well it boils down to the
fact<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.700> they<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> much<00:01:42.210> more

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
fact that they have a much more

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.260 
fact that they have a much more
efficient<00:01:43.079> metabolism<00:01:43.640> than<00:01:44.640> what<00:01:44.909> other

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
efficient metabolism than what other

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.020 
efficient metabolism than what other
people<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.100> not<00:01:47.250> true<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.820> every

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
people have know it's not true in every

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.789 
people have know it's not true in every
instance<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.810> course<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.350> there's<00:01:49.560> their

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
instance of course that there's their

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.760 
instance of course that there's their
circumstances<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.630> everything<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.229> if<00:01:52.590> when

circumstances to everything but if when
I've<00:01:52.890> seen<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.280> vast<00:01:53.490> majority<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.540> time

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
I've seen the vast majority of the time

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.760 
I've seen the vast majority of the time
that<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.860> what's<00:01:56.100> causing<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.670> okay<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.770> in

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
that is what's causing it okay so in

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.120 
that is what's causing it okay so in
addressing<00:01:59.430> dairy<00:01:59.700> products<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:01.130> personally

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
addressing dairy products I personally

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.719 
addressing dairy products I personally
keep<00:02:02.369> them<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> very<00:02:03.810> minimum<00:02:04.740> alright<00:02:05.490> it's

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
keep them to a very minimum alright it's

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.850 
keep them to a very minimum alright it's
not<00:02:06.060> because<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> dairy<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.590> itself

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
not because the dairy in and of itself

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.969 
not because the dairy in and of itself
is<00:02:08.099> bad<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.879> simply<00:02:09.750> because<00:02:09.979> dairy

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
is bad it's simply because dairy

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.590 
is bad it's simply because dairy

cows can produce more milk when they

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.900 
cows can produce more milk when they
process<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.590> stuff<00:02:34.860> typically<00:02:35.310> hormones<00:02:35.730> are

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
added for processes like homogenous

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.910 
added for processes like homogenous
Asian<00:02:38.850> okay<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.750> then<00:02:39.840> pasteurization<00:02:40.770> and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
Asian okay and then pasteurization and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.260 
Asian okay and then pasteurization and
stuff<00:02:41.130> like<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.520> which<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.820> lot<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.060> people

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
stuff like that which a lot of people

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.690 
stuff like that which a lot of people
don't<00:02:42.600> realize<00:02:43.040> okay<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.220> when<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.490> stuff

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
don't realize okay and when that stuff

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.180 
don't realize okay and when that stuff
goes<00:02:44.970> into<00:02:45.180> your<00:02:45.330> system<00:02:45.920> especially<00:02:46.920> if

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
goes into your system especially if

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.010 
goes into your system especially if
you're<00:02:47.280> drinking<00:02:47.550> on<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.910> daily<00:02:48.360> basis<00:02:48.870> in

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
you're drinking on a daily basis in

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.560 
you're drinking on a daily basis in
large<00:02:49.230> quantities<00:02:49.860> I've<00:02:50.550> seen<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.360> it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
large quantities I've seen that it

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.360 
large quantities I've seen that it
actually<00:02:51.900> hinders<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.440> metabolic<00:02:52.950> function

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
actually hinders the metabolic function

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.970 
actually hinders the metabolic function
of<00:02:53.490> people<00:02:53.880> okay<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.440> causes<00:02:55.680> them

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
of people okay and that it causes them

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.430 
of people okay and that it causes them
to<00:02:56.040> retain<00:02:56.550> body<00:02:56.880> fat<00:02:57.330> okay<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:57.900> personally<00:02:58.380> I

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
to retain body fat okay so personally I

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.830 
to retain body fat okay so personally I
keep<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.920> milk<00:02:59.190> drinking<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.760> very<00:03:00.180> minimum

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
keep the milk drinking to a very minimum

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.620 
keep the milk drinking to a very minimum
if<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.560> put<00:03:01.800> milk<00:03:02.130> on<00:03:02.280> my<00:03:02.700> oatmeal<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.390> will<00:03:03.480> be

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
if I put milk on my oatmeal it will be

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.400 
if I put milk on my oatmeal it will be
skim<00:03:04.050> milk<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:05.160> eat<00:03:05.700> cheese<00:03:06.030> very<00:03:06.390> sparingly<00:03:07.050> in
