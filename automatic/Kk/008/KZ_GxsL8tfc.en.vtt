and then also BTW i radeon graphics is

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.880 
and then also BTW i radeon graphics is
built-in<00:01:58.330> that's<00:01:58.810> an<00:01:58.960> integrated<00:01:59.530> graphics

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
built-in that's an integrated graphics

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.370 
built-in that's an integrated graphics
card<00:02:00.400> and<00:02:00.640> then<00:02:01.450> right<00:02:01.990> here<00:02:02.020> on<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.350> corner

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
card and then right here on the corner

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.460 
card and then right here on the corner
you'll<00:02:02.710> see<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:03.040> it<00:02:03.190> says<00:02:03.310> HD<00:02:03.820> ready<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:05.110> I

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
you'll see that it says HD ready so I

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.699 
you'll see that it says HD ready so I
think<00:02:06.460> that<00:02:06.820> this<00:02:07.149> one<00:02:07.390> should<00:02:07.720> support<00:02:08.110> HD

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
think that this one should support HD

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.469 
think that this one should support HD
video<00:02:09.039> I<00:02:09.069> haven't<00:02:09.520> personally<00:02:09.700> tested<00:02:10.330> it

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
video I haven't personally tested it

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.910 
video I haven't personally tested it
will<00:02:10.600> probably<00:02:10.780> test<00:02:11.050> it<00:02:11.230> in<00:02:11.319> another<00:02:11.650> video

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
will probably test it in another video

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.660 
will probably test it in another video
but<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:13.030> did<00:02:13.300> notice<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:14.010> I'm<00:02:15.010> outputs

at<00:03:00.670> this<00:03:00.959> this<00:03:01.959> is<00:03:02.200> basically<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.769> MSI<00:03:03.340> you

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
at this this is basically the MSI you

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.520 
at this this is basically the MSI you
212<00:03:05.379> inch<00:03:06.299> definitely<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.420> screen<00:03:07.870> is<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.170> lot

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
212 inch definitely the screen is a lot

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.550 
212 inch definitely the screen is a lot
larger<00:03:09.329> one<00:03:10.329> good<00:03:10.659> thing<00:03:10.689> about<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.200> screen

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
larger one good thing about the screen

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.849 
larger one good thing about the screen
resolution<00:03:12.219> is<00:03:12.400> this<00:03:13.090> actually<00:03:13.659> I<00:03:14.319> believe

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
resolution is this actually I believe

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:20.129 
resolution is this actually I believe
runs<00:03:15.099> at<00:03:15.299> 1368<00:03:16.299> x<00:03:17.340> 768<00:03:18.340> or<00:03:18.609> it's<00:03:18.879> like<00:03:19.000> 1366<00:03:19.959> x

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
runs at 1368 x 768 or it's like 1366 x

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.490 
runs at 1368 x 768 or it's like 1366 x
768<00:03:20.790> which<00:03:21.790> like<00:03:22.060> rivals<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.959> lot<00:03:23.200> of<00:03:23.409> the

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
768 which like rivals a lot of the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.349 
768 which like rivals a lot of the
screens<00:03:23.829> out<00:03:24.040> there<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:24.459> terms<00:03:24.609> of<00:03:24.819> native

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
screens out there in terms of native

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.330 
screens out there in terms of native
resolution<00:03:25.689> so<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:26.709> mean<00:03:26.950> this<00:03:27.099> is<00:03:27.159> a

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
resolution so I mean this is a

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.030 
resolution so I mean this is a
high-definition<00:03:28.109> like<00:03:29.109> ultra-bright<00:03:29.739> LED

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
high-definition like ultra-bright LED

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.780 
high-definition like ultra-bright LED
screen<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:32.470> with<00:03:33.069> like<00:03:33.310> super<00:03:33.639> high

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
screen and with like super high

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.780 
screen and with like super high
resolution<00:03:34.409> so<00:03:35.409> that's<00:03:35.560> another<00:03:35.829> really<00:03:36.579> do

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
resolution so that's another really do

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.460 
resolution so that's another really do
think<00:03:36.939> keyboard<00:03:37.480> feels<00:03:37.720> really<00:03:38.049> good<00:03:38.230> on<00:03:38.290> this

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
think keyboard feels really good on this

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.819 
think keyboard feels really good on this
unit<00:03:39.569> you<00:03:40.569> know<00:03:40.629> not<00:03:40.780> too<00:03:40.959> much<00:03:41.079> flex<00:03:41.439> on<00:03:41.650> it

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
unit you know not too much flex on it

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.729 
unit you know not too much flex on it
and<00:03:42.329> then<00:03:43.329> right<00:03:44.109> here<00:03:44.139> you<00:03:44.290> have<00:03:44.409> the<00:03:44.560> same

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
msi wind indicator lights and then the

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.949 
msi wind indicator lights and then the
cool<00:03:48.159> thing<00:03:48.340> is<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.519> headlock<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:49.540> know<00:03:49.659> left
