00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
does is it takes a 12-volt current

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.420 
does is it takes a 12-volt current
through<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.540> blue<00:00:45.720> wire<00:00:45.989> drops<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.070> down<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.400> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
through the blue wire drops it down to a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.160 
through the blue wire drops it down to a
very<00:00:47.640> low<00:00:47.790> amperage<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.750> allowed<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
very low amperage and allowed it to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.020 
very low amperage and allowed it to
travel<00:00:49.379> through<00:00:49.619> the<00:00:49.710> center<00:00:50.070> cable<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.640> the

travel through the center cable of the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.000 
travel through the center cable of the
aerial<00:00:51.510> which<00:00:52.019> will<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.290> turn<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.589> amplifier

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
aerial which will in turn the amplifier

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.340 
aerial which will in turn the amplifier
on<00:00:53.309> when<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.790> stereo<00:00:54.089> has<00:00:54.180> turned<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.199> that

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
on when the stereo has turned on so that

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.960 
on when the stereo has turned on so that
the<00:00:55.409> signal<00:00:55.769> can<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:55.949> boosted<00:00:56.580> and<00:00:56.790> brought

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
the signal can be boosted and brought

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.060 
the signal can be boosted and brought
through<00:00:57.150> to<00:00:57.299> the<00:00:57.390> stereo<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.619> do<00:00:58.769> not<00:00:58.860> use

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
through to the stereo if you do not use

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.950 
through to the stereo if you do not use
one<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.280> these<00:00:59.519> then<00:01:00.299> you<00:01:00.390> will<00:01:00.510> probably<00:01:00.600> find

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
one of these then you will probably find

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.509 
one of these then you will probably find
that<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> signal<00:01:01.559> will<00:01:01.650> be<00:01:01.739> very<00:01:01.979> very<00:01:02.250> weak

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
that the signal will be very very weak

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.280 
that the signal will be very very weak
you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.000> mistake<00:01:03.119> this<00:01:03.540> is<00:01:03.750> having<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.080> bad

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you can mistake this is having a bad

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.140 
you can mistake this is having a bad
aerial<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.610> simply<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
aerial it's just simply that the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.539 
aerial it's just simply that the
amplifier<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.659> not<00:01:06.780> turned<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> kitna

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
amplifier is not turned on so the kitna

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.420 
amplifier is not turned on so the kitna
signal<00:01:08.850> cannot<00:01:09.030> get<00:01:09.210> through<00:01:10.310> there<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.400> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
signal cannot get through there is a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.429 
signal cannot get through there is a
second<00:01:11.850> version<00:01:12.000> which<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:12.960> unit<00:01:13.260> here

which is a PC five that's 136 it's
exactly<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> same<00:01:18.060> type<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.390> thing<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
exactly the same type of thing but it

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.899 
exactly the same type of thing but it
has<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.560> adapter<00:01:19.950> for<00:01:20.039> the<00:01:20.130> farc<00:01:20.369> rakaat<00:01:20.700> type

plug the arrow head up to room and we

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.929 
plug the arrow head up to room and we
take<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.899> blue<00:01:31.049> cable<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.679> either<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.549> remote

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
take the blue cable to either a remote

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.120 
take the blue cable to either a remote

ignition source off the back of the
stereo<00:01:36.859> it<00:01:37.859> has<00:01:38.070> both<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.179> remote

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
stereo it has both then the remote

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.010 
stereo it has both then the remote
output<00:01:39.929> is<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> preferred<00:01:40.530> option<00:01:42.020> slight

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
output is a preferred option slight

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.039 
output is a preferred option slight
stereo<00:01:43.499> else<00:01:44.899> Porter<00:01:45.899> cabling<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.439> words<00:01:46.679> so

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.450 

we<00:01:52.049> now<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.770> aerial<00:01:52.979> connection<00:01:53.310> here

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
we now have the aerial connection here

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.010 
we now have the aerial connection here
which<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:53.939> vehicle<00:01:54.179> is<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.780> fiber

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
which in this vehicle is the fiber

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.599 
which in this vehicle is the fiber
connection<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:55.979> need<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.280> use<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> one

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
connection so we need to use the one

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.870 
connection so we need to use the one
three<00:01:56.880> six<00:01:57.119> which<00:01:57.359> we<00:01:57.509> plug<00:01:57.719> into<00:01:58.579> the<00:01:59.579> aerial

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
three six which we plug into the aerial

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.649 
three six which we plug into the aerial
simply<00:02:00.920> we<00:02:01.920> then<00:02:02.069> need<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.340> put<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:03.299> female

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
simply we then need to put the female

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.989 
simply we then need to put the female
area<00:02:04.049> onto<00:02:04.139> the<00:02:04.259> back<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.619> stereo<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.549> this

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:05.999 
area onto the back of the stereo on this

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
the ignition source so we would not need

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.900 
the ignition source so we would not need
this<00:03:05.819> piece<00:03:06.090> we<00:03:06.269> can<00:03:06.390> put<00:03:06.569> this<00:03:06.690> off<00:03:07.910> strip

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
this piece we can put this off strip

of<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.340> cable<00:03:18.830> now<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:19.890> need<00:03:20.099> to<00:03:20.390> put<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.480> two

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
of the cable now you need to put the two

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.839 
of the cable now you need to put the two
cable<00:03:22.019> together<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.440> twist<00:03:22.680> them<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:23.700> they

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
cable together and twist them so they

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.470 
cable together and twist them so they
lock<00:03:24.120> together<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.670> because<00:03:26.970> these<00:03:27.090> cables

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
lock together and because these cables

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.050 
lock together and because these cables
are<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:27.690> thin<00:03:27.989> you<00:03:28.590> need<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.980> fold<00:03:29.700> them<00:03:29.880> over

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
are so thin you need to fold them over

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.610 
are so thin you need to fold them over
on<00:03:30.239> themselves<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.840> make<00:03:30.959> them<00:03:31.079> thicker<00:03:31.320> today

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
on themselves to make them thicker today

properly now to crimp connection is a

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.590 
properly now to crimp connection is a
straightforward<00:03:41.640> but<00:03:41.850> connection<00:03:42.299> which<00:03:42.450> you

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
straightforward but connection which you

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.760 
on the other cable and that is that cake
that<00:04:05.180> connection<00:04:05.570> now<00:04:05.690> installed<00:04:06.140> so<00:04:06.530> we<00:04:06.620> have

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
that connection now installed so we have

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.220 
that connection now installed so we have
the<00:04:06.920> aerial<00:04:07.250> working<00:04:07.640> if<00:04:08.540> you<00:04:08.690> installed<00:04:09.170> it

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
the aerial working if you installed it

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.660 
the aerial working if you installed it
without<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.560> blue<00:04:09.680> cable<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.430> would<00:04:10.520> have

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
without the blue cable you would have

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.730 
without the blue cable you would have
the<00:04:10.760> same<00:04:10.790> situation<00:04:11.690> you<00:04:11.720> would<00:04:11.930> have<00:04:12.110> the

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
the same situation you would have the

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.930 
the same situation you would have the
aerial<00:04:13.040> coming<00:04:13.250> through<00:04:13.460> but<00:04:13.610> you<00:04:13.670> wouldn't

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
aerial coming through but you wouldn't

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.370 
aerial coming through but you wouldn't
have<00:04:14.060> a<00:04:14.090> signal<00:04:14.480> coming<00:04:14.630> through<00:04:14.720> very<00:04:15.320> well

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
have a signal coming through very well

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.250 
have a signal coming through very well
so<00:04:15.650> you<00:04:15.740> would<00:04:16.180> have<00:04:17.180> a<00:04:17.209> bad<00:04:17.480> signal<00:04:17.810> thinking

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
so you would have a bad signal thinking

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.259 
so you would have a bad signal thinking
that<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:19.100> aerial<00:04:19.400> has<00:04:19.519> not<00:04:19.670> been<00:04:19.820> connected

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
that the aerial has not been connected

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.180 
that the aerial has not been connected
simply<00:04:21.200> connect<00:04:21.350> this<00:04:21.500> piece<00:04:21.709> up<00:04:21.920> to<00:04:22.100> an

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
simply connect this piece up to an

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.120 
simply connect this piece up to an
ignition<00:04:22.430> or<00:04:22.760> preferred<00:04:23.540> remote<00:04:24.230> output<00:04:24.620> and

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
ignition or preferred remote output and

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.790 
ignition or preferred remote output and
everything<00:04:25.400> will<00:04:25.490> be<00:04:25.580> fine
