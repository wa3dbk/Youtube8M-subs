 and here reside computers watches timer here 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.819

 every hour I spend a quarter of an hour the whole fan 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.480

 What there is 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.200
 inside first 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.220
 excellent evening 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.540
 the incubator 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.290
 it is expected that the economy is basically the athlete 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.150
 and he adds he is the one who decides 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.190
 when it reaches 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.660
 I would have to manipulate what watches that temporized to adjudicate 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.979
 to each one between now 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.979
