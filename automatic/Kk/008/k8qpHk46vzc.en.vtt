00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.380
 occasion and scratched is the end has thrown 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.390
 a new visual record that is the one of 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.790
 tweets that used to look like a puppet 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.799

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.509

 league of legends and as well as the 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.439
 animations that have improved them so 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.329
 to see when they take them out they have very 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.340
 few days because you sign up to have 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.350
