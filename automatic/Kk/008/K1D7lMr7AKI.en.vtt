00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:20.430
 This is a carnivorous plant that is classified as a pitfall type. 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:34.259
 The tip of the leaf is deformed and it looks like a bag. 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:34.259
 This is called a captive insect, and in this sack is caught three species 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.520
 I'm approaching now 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.770
 You can see things like flowers by looking at the lid part of the dropout 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:00.140
 It's a closet and three out of here 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.140
 I invite insects with a sweet smell 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.120
 There is a fell 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:14.170
 If you look inside you will find water here 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.170
 This is not the water but the digestive fluid 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.380
 I will look in the middle of the belt 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.950
 Only the person under the flower has black spots on the surface that is wet with water 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.080
 I will expand and see 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:46.229
 This black spot is a fire hydrant and it is a source of digestive fluid from here to dissolve neglected muscles etc. 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.229
 Absorb as nutrition 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.490
 Thank you again 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:02:01.040
 It is said to engrave the rim part of Utubokazura, but here it becomes slippery so that insects fall easily 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.040
 I am 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:13.800
 The white area on the back of the table is made of wax which is easy to peel off and the insects escape 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.800
 Is not it has become way 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:23.970
 A carnivorous plant that can not move has many functions to catch insects
