00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 and it shows everything if we are in gt5 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.009
 I distract a new game in which 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.560
 you will be able to find vehicles 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.480
 quite strange and they cool a lot 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.519
 and that perhaps because in the online is a 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.469
 little complicated to find them or not 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.820
 are the truth this is pretty cool this 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.859
 serial acosta until after I eat 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.619
 You see is an authentic past molarÃ­a 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.510
 very much that this type of vehicle 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.060
 we could buy and use them with the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.010
 and the truth that stops to take a while 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.840
 of laughter with friends and all this the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.660
 that would molar quite then how are you 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.000
 seeing here this would be the vehicle this 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.170
 of the expresses is the one that leads to 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.719
 the processes to jail that what 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.520
 they showed in the trailer the robberies to 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.320
 banks that the truth is pretty cool is 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.670
 pretty cool then on the other hand 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.890
 we have this piece of vehicle that is 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.500
 giant that can be driven then 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.870
 there 's also a pink limousine that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.090
 You see a lot the police motorcycle 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.559
 then it's also like I'm seeing that 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.559
 the left would be what would be the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.390
 armored car a lot of vehicles 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.609
 more as you see here a bike is that 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.039
 it's pretty cool also then this one 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.870
 it would be the funeral home car that is 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.369
 also so in pink things is that it is a 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.600
 authentic passed this type of vehicles 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.580
 as I say 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.159
 we could without buying them or 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.630
 have them when we wanted to put online 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.830
 to be able to use it and take some 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.869
 how many laughs that is true that 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.430
 it would be pretty good then over here 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.080
 is already 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.970
 this vehicle here that is like a 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.520
 Excavator that pretty cool now you go 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.470
 to see that I use it and I start to throw 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.320
 the cars and hill all the truth that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.510
 as I say to play it online this 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.770
 It would be a blast heading the 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.350
 you will have in the description if 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.960
 you want to try it on about three or 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.369
 four days I went up one that was for 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.180
 playstation 3 and playstation 4 in which 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.250
 appeared 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.020
 If I do not remember, it was the request 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.450
 other vehicles too that were very 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.520
 rare and that could not be used and is 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.620
 today the one I bring is for xbox 360 and 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.030
 for the kilowatt although you're also going to 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.979
 have one for playstation 3 and 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.570
 playstation 4 in the description in the 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.490
 which, as I say, can use the 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.290
 alien vehicle other vehicles 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.150
 also quite rare but this is 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.410
 only for 360 equipment and for equipment 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.600
 The truth is that it is quite good 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.280
 how am I seeing here how I was going to 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.630
 throw away the vehicles and the truth that is 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.030
 an authentic pass yes this vehicle 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.430
 I was to buy online without 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.500
 doubt would be the first to buy it because 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.030
 is that vejen I would love to go for the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.890
 street thus pulling the vehicles the 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.900
 true that that would be pretty cool as well 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.310
 that nothing as you see the truth a game 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.350
 pretty cool what on the other hand also 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.580
 you're going to have a little more hunting 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.350
 section of this area that as I am 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.670
 watching right now I was not catching and 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.840
 nothing I hope you liked to leave 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.340
 and for more if you want it to keep going up 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.450
 most heading of these structures were 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.950
