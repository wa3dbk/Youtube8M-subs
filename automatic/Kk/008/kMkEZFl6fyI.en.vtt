00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.330
 Yes Hi no Channel by Hara everyone iphone 5 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:14.320
 I wonder if there are many who got it 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.320
 I'm still iphone 4 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.380
 Oh oh 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.380
 Contact Wow over 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:33.380
 I did iphone 5 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.510
 It was intensified 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:42.290
 Compared to iphone 4 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.440
 Spread minute video school that I screen now lightly widened to now thin 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.710
 Fixed invisible 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:52.840
 I feel like I'm reflected in the old configuration 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:56.970
 Well many people already give me comparison videos, but I just 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.900
 And iphone 4 of this iphone 4 years ago 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.890
 iphone 5 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:06.700
 This is the best I have with you 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:12.130
 A little with apps that have slow startup times 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.600
 I would like to compare how much there is a difference in startup time 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.140
 Yes 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.850
 First of all I wanted to get into a situational house 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:26.530
 Both are suitable to be understood as lodging mixed with app 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.510
 The slowest app I have in this state is 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.540
 It is this power pro 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:37.250
 Par pro 11 a little old but 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.950
 A Purochu 1 I'm I'm I fucked slow is this tree video 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.640
 How much this 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:47.590
 I would like to go for a while to see if it falls to startup time 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.590
 No to go you'll Whittier 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.790
 The 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.790
 Birth 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:07.470
 I wonder if this will go down like this 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.470
 Yes, I tried the rise to be complete towards the iphone 5 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.030
 iphone 4 now it is only this 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.920
 When the app's launch time falls 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:26.330
 I'm feeling is good though after all this touch 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.160
 It was a little comparison video, but if there is something to be worried about from now on again from now on 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.180
 Occasionally that 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:36.780
 I think that I want to go up 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:39.770
 Say yes that i bought iphone 5 too 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.770
 It was a report
