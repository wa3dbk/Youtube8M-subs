is a very good example I don't think I

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.920 
is a very good example I don't think I
have<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.340> really<00:01:56.640> point<00:01:57.000> out<00:01:57.270> what<00:01:57.600> went<00:01:57.810> wrong

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
have to really point out what went wrong

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.160 
have to really point out what went wrong
there<00:01:58.530> but<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.610> ball<00:01:59.820> just<00:02:00.030> went<00:02:00.240> straight

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
there but that ball just went straight

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.289 
there but that ball just went straight
through<00:02:01.200> his<00:02:01.590> hands<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.280> mean<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.790> happens<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
through his hands I mean this happens a

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.630 
through his hands I mean this happens a
lot<00:02:03.479> he's<00:02:03.810> always<00:02:04.320> bottling<00:02:04.979> things<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.520> are

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
lot he's always bottling things that are

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.410 
lot he's always bottling things that are
very<00:02:05.670> easy<00:02:06.270> catches<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:08.879> stuff

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
very easy catches and you know stuff

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.510 
very easy catches and you know stuff
like<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.780> happens<00:02:10.229> there's<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.129> better<00:02:11.250> angle

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
like this happens there's a better angle

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.010 
like this happens there's a better angle
up<00:02:11.849> from<00:02:12.150> behind

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
up from behind

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.820 
up from behind
where<00:02:13.350> look<00:02:13.770> this<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:14.400> goes<00:02:15.410> right<00:02:16.410> through

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
where look this just goes right through

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.890 
where look this just goes right through
his<00:02:16.980> hands<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:17.820> guy<00:02:18.060> gets<00:02:18.570> paid

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
his hands and this guy gets paid

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.490 
his hands and this guy gets paid
hundreds<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.950> thousands<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.550> dollars<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.910> year

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
hundreds of thousands of dollars a year

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:31.070 
hundreds of thousands of dollars a year
for<00:02:22.760> this<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:29.450> think<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:30.600> is<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.780> highlight

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
for this I think this is a highlight

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.050 
for this I think this is a highlight
that<00:02:31.230> really<00:02:31.470> shows<00:02:31.710> off<00:02:31.950> pretty<00:02:32.460> much<00:02:32.670> all<00:02:32.850> of

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
that really shows off pretty much all of

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.690 
that really shows off pretty much all of
his<00:02:33.180> weaknesses<00:02:33.600> in<00:02:33.780> one<00:02:33.960> play<00:02:34.260> as<00:02:34.680> we<00:02:35.460> see

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
his weaknesses in one play as we see

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.970 
his weaknesses in one play as we see
here<00:02:35.730> with<00:02:36.290> Colorado<00:02:37.290> coming<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.830> wing

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
here with Colorado coming on the wing

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.100 
here with Colorado coming on the wing
gamma<00:02:38.310> caster<00:02:38.760> Ellen<00:02:39.120> whips<00:02:39.390> that<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
gamma caster Ellen whips that in and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.590 
gamma caster Ellen whips that in and
there's<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.160> shot<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.550> gets<00:02:41.700> saved<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.360> then

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
there's a shot that gets saved and then

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.510 
there's a shot that gets saved and then
it's<00:02:42.750> bundled<00:02:43.020> over<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.470> line<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:44.040> love<00:02:44.400> that

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
it's bundled over the line I love that

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.580 
it's bundled over the line I love that
he<00:02:44.640> puts<00:02:44.850> his<00:02:44.970> arms<00:02:45.240> up<00:02:45.390> here<00:02:45.720> as<00:02:46.290> in<00:02:46.470> for

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
he puts his arms up here as in for

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.050 
he puts his arms up here as in for
saying<00:02:46.770> well<00:02:46.890> what<00:02:47.040> could<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.340> have<00:02:47.460> done<00:02:47.520> and

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
saying well what could I have done and

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.210 
saying well what could I have done and
the<00:02:48.150> answer<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:49.140> lot<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:49.890> things

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
the answer that is a lot of things

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.460 
the answer that is a lot of things
really<00:02:50.430> as<00:02:51.180> we<00:02:51.450> move<00:02:51.540> forward<00:02:51.720> here<00:02:51.990> past<00:02:52.290> all

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
really as we move forward here past all

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.500 
really as we move forward here past all
this<00:02:52.620> celebrating<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.670> see<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.000> balls<00:02:54.330> out

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
on the wing here and she pawned it here

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
bad defending to be fair but still he

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.470 
bad defending to be fair but still he

dealt with a danger but he can still he
still<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.040> fairly<00:04:02.340> good<00:04:02.520> position<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.820> make

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
still a fairly good position to make

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.850 
still a fairly good position to make
this<00:04:03.150> save<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:03.780> he<00:04:04.170> can<00:04:04.320> still<00:04:04.500> save<00:04:04.709> himself

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
this save and he can still save himself

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.890 
this save and he can still save himself
because<00:04:05.310> that's<00:04:05.340> all<00:04:05.670> though<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:06.480> comes<00:04:06.660> a<00:04:06.780> bit

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
because that's all though it comes a bit

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.060 
because that's all though it comes a bit
late<00:04:07.110> and<00:04:07.260> he<00:04:07.320> doesn't<00:04:07.560> have<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:07.740> much<00:04:07.890> time

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
late and he doesn't have that much time

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.380 
late and he doesn't have that much time
to<00:04:08.190> react<00:04:08.400> that's<00:04:08.580> still<00:04:08.760> a<00:04:08.820> pretty<00:04:08.850> simple

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
to react that's still a pretty simple

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.770 
to react that's still a pretty simple

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
goal you know if he could come for the

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.449 
goal you know if he could come for the
cross<00:04:15.750> looked<00:04:16.560> up<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.950> see<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.310> guy<00:04:17.430> was

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
cross looked up to see that the guy was

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.420 
cross looked up to see that the guy was
there<00:04:18.060> or<00:04:18.330> even<00:04:18.390> just<00:04:19.260> caught<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.859> shot<00:04:20.100> then

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
there or even just caught the shot then

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.370 
there or even just caught the shot then
that<00:04:20.850> goal<00:04:21.120> could<00:04:21.390> have<00:04:21.479> been<00:04:21.630> prevented<00:04:21.870> but

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
that goal could have been prevented but

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.430 
that goal could have been prevented but
in<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.620> end<00:04:22.740> he<00:04:23.160> wasn't<00:04:24.150> able<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.479> do<00:04:24.660> that

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
in the end he wasn't able to do that

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.350 
in the end he wasn't able to do that
and<00:04:25.530> he<00:04:25.770> got<00:04:25.950> scored<00:04:26.340> on<00:04:26.520> so<00:04:26.880> he<00:04:27.030> was<00:04:27.150> right

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
and he got scored on so he was right
