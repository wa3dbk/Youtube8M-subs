00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.230
 hello everyone with you evgeny build point 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.250
 com today on the agenda a few 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.090
 words about spigen covers are ultra both 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.580
 a friend of mine gave it to me 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.410
 enjoy for a few days and for these 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.810
 no course I managed to fold some 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.420
 impressions strictly speaking 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:27.150
 than i will share with you friend thanks 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.189
 so let's start spain ultra and bride it 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.000
 frame and as written on the site are made 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.180
 from and to the polyurethane mixture field and 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.100
 polycarbonate 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.480
 the back is made of transparent 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.910
 plastic and frame and heel made 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.640
 just perfect all great quality 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.579
 very pleasant to the touch 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.190
 on the phone it all sits as it should 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.879
 that is, all sitka here cover sits 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.840
 as poured on the machine itself 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.379
 enjoy honestly say one thing 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.390
 pleasure is all slotted on the ultra case 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.210
 breed performed exactly in their places 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.330
 there is nothing from there is nothing special 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.880
 very interesting buttons are made 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.880
 control ie power and button 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.390
 changes in volume they are like 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.619
 part of the cover itself part of the frame itself 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.759
 I would even say that 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.509
 and at first it seemed to me that it was uncomfortable 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.130
 but using I can say 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.829
 the reverse ie use them 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.630
 comfortable enough with that 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.150
 are really like a part 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.090
 frame they are pressed very easily then 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.640
 there is 1 and yes right under the finger 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.960
 feel the press itself unfortunately 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.119
 such an arrangement of buttons 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.149
 there is one significant minus when 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.399
 the phone is in your pocket then it is on 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.090
 groping define through for example through 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.060
 jeans 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.170
 where the button is located is simply unrealistic 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.350
 have accounted for 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.259
 you put your hand in your pocket 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.540
 business blindly also define the buttons not 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.950
 always possible can 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.630
 be a matter of habit since i am 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.470
 I use the cover only a few days 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.209
 maybe if you get used to something 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.450
 define the blind although honestly I donâ€™t 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.450
 I think here that is just half 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.959
 buttons you try to push and that is below 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.300
 lower than it could be and nothing 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.510
 it is also pressed there is such a thing that 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.550
 when the phone is on the table and I 'm trying 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.310
 raise it and became too often 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.280
 pushing a button without knowing it 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.700
 but I can honestly say it is not for me 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.769
 critical and so go on like 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.780
 change a few words about protection 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.810
 smartphone with a cover 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.120
 ultra and bride first thing I want to point out 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.280
 it is scratch resistant here it is just 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.530
 at the highest level and front and back 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.049
 transparent back protects the back 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.750
 and legs protruding from the frame like you 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.579
 see here such as straight legs 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.359
 made that is crap when the phone 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:02.010
 falls on us on any surface 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:05.430
 the case itself does not scratch does not give 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.980
 scratch behind the back of the smartphone and with 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.810
 front end 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.230
 dawn cover is protected by sides 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.480
 the bumpers are big enough and when we 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.580
 I will put the cover on like a Lego flat 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.190
 the surface then the side does not give the screen 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.070
 touch that surface on which 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.470
 we put it 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.620
 in appearance case ultra i breed 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.400
 looks very cool that is, he sits 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.550
 like a glove 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.780
 on the smartphone itself due to sharp lines 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.970
 which here he is great lies in 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.400
 even though its size 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.710
 quite big with overclocking 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.030
 telephone he i would say so enough 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.710
 very different 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.290
 another interesting point is 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.290
 the back of it is transparent and 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:59.890
 under the rear under the rear cover you can 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:04.270
 fold any lining by cutting them out 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:08.290
 anything from colored paper and magazines 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.970
 carbon from what is there not only can 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.709
 head to come in and not even print on 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.489
 printer something interesting could 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.920
 be nice 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.750
 sure many this element design 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.910
 I came to taste 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.700
 disadvantages of this cover on the hall two 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.350
 things first is his size that is he 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.980
 really increases the smartphone when 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.360
 first dressed 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.370
 This case on your nexus I had it 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.310
 the impression that in my hands some 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.150
 paw at least honestly when 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.510
 using 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.160
 this feeling quickly passed and I would say 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.730
 something from the time even whose likes 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.280
 here is who 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.600
 increased size so keep this 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.610
 in view when choosing 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.010
 the second disadvantage of this case 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.730
 is the gap between transparent 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.250
 the plate and the back cover of the smartphone then 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.140
 there is a transparent one under it 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.610
 this plate is hammered just huge 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.110
 amount of dust as you can here 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.360
 see clearly that there is between 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.420
 them such a gap that here that with 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.550
 The sides of the headphone are overwhelmed 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.190
 lightning fast but i think if you lay there 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.880
 any lining this problem may 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.130
 partially smooth spigen ultra hebrew 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.460
 can be purchased on the Internet 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:26.240
 around 20 dollars in the package 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:29.210
 along with the case itself usually comes in 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.270
 and a film on the screen and several rear 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.830
 lining regret their corner 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.860
 show me how he 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.820
 Got a clean case without a box without 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.970
 any additions but 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.430
 I think it is uncritical whether it is worth its 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.560
 money is it worth 20 dollars i'm honest 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.490
 I think it's a little expensive so 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.040
 would he 15 that would be the normal price i 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.520
 so so imagine this but 20 this 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.630
 Somehow too much such a spigen case 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.310
 ultra breed I think you can 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.650
 wrap up if you liked the video 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:09.990
 Like Like Dislike Like Like 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.990
 all until we meet again
