they're<00:01:31.859> one<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.130> top<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> other<00:01:32.729> right

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
they're one on top of the other right

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.090 
they're one on top of the other right
where<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.359> should<00:01:33.390> cut<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:34.320> select<00:01:34.710> cut<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
where it should cut we select cut and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.700 
where it should cut we select cut and
then<00:01:35.520> set<00:01:35.820> start<00:01:36.149> and<00:01:36.359> let<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.659> go<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:37.500> peel

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
then set start and let it go then peel

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.170 
then set start and let it go then peel
off<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.979> excess<00:01:38.009> fabric<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> two

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
off the excess fabric and the two

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.670 
off the excess fabric and the two
circles<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.689> end<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.140> should<00:01:40.289> look<00:01:40.500> like

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
circles you end up with should look like

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.410 
circles you end up with should look like
this<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.100> now<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.579> start<00:01:41.670> assembling<00:01:41.939> our

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
this and now we can start assembling our

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.660 
this and now we can start assembling our
keychain<00:01:42.899> now<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.500> need<00:01:43.770> some<00:01:43.979> interfacing

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
keychain now we need some interfacing

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.039 
keychain now we need some interfacing
and<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.060> see<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.479> pretty<00:01:45.659> stiff

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and you can see this is pretty stiff

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.539 
and you can see this is pretty stiff
it's<00:01:46.229> going<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.439> give<00:01:46.590> some<00:01:46.799> good<00:01:47.009> body<00:01:47.219> to<00:01:47.460> our

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
it's going to give some good body to our

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.789 
it's going to give some good body to our
keychain<00:01:47.969> I'm<00:01:48.210> using<00:01:48.570> Pelham's<00:01:49.109> peltex

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
keychain I'm using Pelham's peltex

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.099 
keychain I'm using Pelham's peltex
72<00:01:50.340> F<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.850> means<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.179> fusible<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.840> both

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
72 F that means it's fusible on both

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.980 
72 F that means it's fusible on both
sides<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.679> it's<00:01:53.100> heavyweight<00:01:53.990> fusible

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.840 
sides and it's heavyweight fusible
interfacing<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:56.100> all<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.310> did<00:01:56.429> was<00:01:56.670> take<00:01:56.789> a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
interfacing so all I did was take a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.999 
interfacing so all I did was take a
circle<00:01:57.210> one<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.840> my<00:01:57.929> circle<00:01:58.350> pieces<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.770> fabric

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
circle one of my circle pieces of fabric

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.919 
circle one of my circle pieces of fabric
and<00:01:59.369> lay<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.670> top<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.210> interfacing<00:02:00.840> and

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
and lay it on top of the interfacing and

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.959 
and lay it on top of the interfacing and
then<00:02:01.350> use<00:02:01.499> it<00:02:01.530> as<00:02:01.710> your<00:02:01.859> template<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.490> cut<00:02:02.700> out

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
then use it as your template to cut out

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.609 
then use it as your template to cut out
one<00:02:03.240> layer<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.020> interface<00:02:04.380> because

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
one layer of the interface because

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.440 
one layer of the interface because
that's<00:02:04.770> all<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.070> need<00:02:05.280> two<00:02:05.939> circles<00:02:06.329> of

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
that's all you need two circles of

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.389 
that's all you need two circles of
fabric<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.960> one<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.170> interfacing<00:02:07.740> now<00:02:08.250> lay

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
fabric and one of interfacing now lay

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.580 
fabric and one of interfacing now lay
one<00:02:08.640> circle<00:02:09.119> over<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> interfacing<00:02:10.170> circle

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
one circle over the interfacing circle

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.559 
one circle over the interfacing circle
and<00:02:10.740> fuse<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.159> into<00:02:11.459> place<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.819> only<00:02:12.120> do<00:02:12.420> this

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
and fuse it into place and only do this

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.690 
and fuse it into place and only do this
for<00:02:12.810> one<00:02:13.019> of<00:02:13.050> them<00:02:13.319> okay<00:02:13.650> we<00:02:13.830> need<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.400> create<00:02:14.610> a

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
for one of them okay we need to create a

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.000 
for one of them okay we need to create a
loop<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.209> put<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.480> inside<00:02:15.870> before<00:02:16.140> we<00:02:16.409> fuse<00:02:16.620> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
loop to put it inside before we fuse the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.009 
loop to put it inside before we fuse the
inside<00:02:17.310> down<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:17.730> let's<00:02:17.909> do<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.989> a

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
inside down so let's do that I have a

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.050 
inside down so let's do that I have a
piece<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.409> fabric<00:02:19.590> here<00:02:19.799> that<00:02:20.189> measures<00:02:20.610> three

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
piece of fabric here that measures three

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.210 
piece of fabric here that measures three
and<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.209> half<00:02:21.360> inches<00:02:21.720> by<00:02:21.930> two<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.349> half<00:02:22.530> flip

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
and a half inches by two and a half flip

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.309 
and a half inches by two and a half flip
it<00:02:23.370> over<00:02:23.610> then<00:02:24.239> fold<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:24.689> in<00:02:24.780> half<00:02:24.810> lengthwise

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
it over then fold it in half lengthwise

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.170 
it over then fold it in half lengthwise
and<00:02:25.829> give<00:02:26.159> it<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.340> good<00:02:26.489> press<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.970> make<00:02:27.150> a

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
and give it a good press to make a

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.119 
and give it a good press to make a
crease<00:02:27.569> right<00:02:27.689> down<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.110> center<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.650> then

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
crease right down the center and then

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.550 
crease right down the center and then
fold<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.549> shorter<00:02:29.909> sides<00:02:30.180> right<00:02:30.689> in<00:02:30.900> towards

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
fold the shorter sides right in towards

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.589 
fold the shorter sides right in towards
that<00:02:31.739> center<00:02:32.189> crease<00:02:32.459> line<00:02:32.700> then<00:02:33.299> you<00:02:33.450> give

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
that center crease line then you give

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.660 
that center crease line then you give
the<00:02:33.720> whole<00:02:33.930> thing<00:02:33.959> another<00:02:34.349> press<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:34.950> refold

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
the whole thing another press and refold

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.210 
the whole thing another press and refold
it<00:02:35.790> right<00:02:36.150> on<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.420> center<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.959> hide<00:02:37.530> basically

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
it right on the center to hide basically

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.910 
it right on the center to hide basically
the<00:02:38.370> two<00:02:38.579> long<00:02:38.879> raw<00:02:39.209> edges<00:02:39.420> those<00:02:40.079> two<00:02:40.379> short

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
the two long raw edges those two short

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.890 
the two long raw edges those two short
raw<00:02:41.159> edges<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.579> still<00:02:41.849> have<00:02:42.000> open<00:02:42.569> there<00:02:42.750> are

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
raw edges we still have open there are

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.330 
raw edges we still have open there are
actually<00:02:43.470> going<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.650> be<00:02:43.709> hidden<00:02:43.950> inside<00:02:44.129> the

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
can grab our keychain split rings I have

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.140 
can grab our keychain split rings I have
two<00:02:48.659> already<00:02:49.290> connected<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.099> just<00:02:50.640> slip<00:02:50.849> one

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
two already connected and just slip one

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.910

through<00:02:51.390> your<00:02:51.450> strip<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:51.959> then<00:02:52.319> fold<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.829> in

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
through your strip and then fold it in

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.559 
through your strip and then fold it in
half<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.370> create<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.760> loop<00:02:53.909> so<00:02:54.180> one<00:02:54.359> is<00:02:54.450> going

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
half to create the loop so one is going

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:55.970 
half to create the loop so one is going
to<00:02:54.629> be<00:02:54.750> attached<00:02:55.079> to<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.379> keychain<00:02:55.590> by<00:02:55.920> the

to be attached to the keychain by the
loop<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.519> then<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.120> other<00:02:57.269> one<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.480> going<00:02:57.690> to

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
loop and then the other one is going to

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.170 
loop and then the other one is going to
be<00:02:57.870> for<00:02:58.079> your<00:02:58.200> actual<00:02:58.500> keys<00:02:58.799> so<00:02:59.519> place<00:02:59.819> it<00:02:59.849> so

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
be for your actual keys so place it so

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.059 
be for your actual keys so place it so
that<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.420> two<00:03:00.629> raw<00:03:00.870> edges<00:03:01.049> are<00:03:01.409> going<00:03:01.739> towards

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
that the two raw edges are going towards

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.949 
that the two raw edges are going towards
the<00:03:02.220> center<00:03:02.639> of<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:02.909> circles<00:03:03.299> and<00:03:03.569> you<00:03:03.750> want

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
the center of the circles and you want

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.330 
the center of the circles and you want
to<00:03:04.019> leave<00:03:04.139> about<00:03:04.349> half<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.799> an<00:03:04.920> inch<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.190> three

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
to leave about half of an inch to three

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.069 
to leave about half of an inch to three
quarters<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.940> an<00:03:06.060> inch<00:03:06.120> sticking<00:03:06.389> out<00:03:06.840> from

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
quarters of an inch sticking out from

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.170 
quarters of an inch sticking out from
the<00:03:07.170> circle<00:03:07.560> edge<00:03:07.739> then<00:03:08.370> fuse<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:08.849> down<00:03:09.030> into

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
the circle edge then fuse it down into

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.530 
the circle edge then fuse it down into
place

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
place

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.089 
place
and<00:03:09.780> that's<00:03:09.989> going<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.230> help<00:03:10.379> keep<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.799> loop

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
and that's going to help keep that loop

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.460 
and that's going to help keep that loop
there<00:03:11.129> steady<00:03:11.940> until<00:03:12.420> we<00:03:12.780> stitch<00:03:13.019> it<00:03:13.139> all<00:03:13.260> down

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
there steady until we stitch it all down

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.319 
there steady until we stitch it all down
now<00:03:13.980> we<00:03:14.040> can<00:03:14.250> take<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.519> our<00:03:14.730> sewing<00:03:15.000> machine

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
now we can take it to our sewing machine

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:16.819 
now we can take it to our sewing machine
so<00:03:15.510> we<00:03:15.629> can<00:03:15.659> stitch<00:03:16.049> around<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.530> entire

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
so we can stitch around the entire

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.860 
so we can stitch around the entire
circle<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.459> in<00:03:17.549> case<00:03:17.760> all<00:03:18.000> those<00:03:18.150> raw<00:03:18.329> edges<00:03:18.359> I

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
circle and in case all those raw edges I

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.930 
circle and in case all those raw edges I
selected<00:03:19.680> just<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:19.980> really<00:03:20.250> tight<00:03:20.459> zig<00:03:20.730> zag

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
selected just a really tight zig zag

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.000 
selected just a really tight zig zag
