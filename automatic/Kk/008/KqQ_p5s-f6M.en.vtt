00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello everyone welcome back to 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.230
 our channel 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.900
 today I come with another diet this diet 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.269
 it's called the three-day diet and then 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.760
 I have to do it alone and today is the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.040
 today is my first day and very much better 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.750
 well this is what most called me the 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.900
 attention of this diet is that you can 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.520
 I eat ice cream and I am addicted to 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.560
 ice cream to the snow and in this case this is not 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.690
 has can not can not be any 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.180
 snow tell you to be vanilla and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.550
 that is light they say how much you can 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.079
 eating is I think once a day 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.620
 I'm been searching the internet and 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.940
 different recipes and I 'm going to 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.489
 leave as three I found below the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.690
 first that I left them of those three that 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.640
 they're fine or up is the one I'm 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.950
 next I suggest you read the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.079
 three diets because all three have 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.090
 report very important information and 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.070
 again if you like to follow this to any 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.350
 another diet first consult it with your 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.350
 doctor implement breakfast to me 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.000
 taste 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.689
 it's a slice of bread with two 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.310
 spoonfuls of peanut butter just do not 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.110
 you're depriving me hunger not me 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.760
 he was hungry today 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.440
 also what I'm changing is that 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.290
 I'm drinking a lot of water and they're going to see it 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.480
 in the video only in my opinion I the 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.500
 I'm doing with our figure diets 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.930
 a figure more like a schedule of my 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.610
 meals as if as if 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.210
 made this food something that today I'm going to 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.100
 approach ok now tuna that's not that 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.740
 Say something and I had to eat pure lettuce 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.440
 or I had to go through is not the opposite 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.420
 he's going to see my food today was 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:50.810
 full of ice cream to meat is lettuce and 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.030
 an apple only my father touched me and if 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.090
 until I fill the ice cream in almost no 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.920
 it fit but I was not going to waste it 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.100
 apart from then that exercise to help 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.050
 now I have been seeing that there are many 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.420
 that if it gives a lot of results it touched me 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.570
 read one that says if you do dieting 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.340
 maybe this one does not work for you they are to see 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.140
 How do I give? No, I said no. 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.600
 Sorry to try it because I'm 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.880
 eating and exercising and also 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.890
 something very important is that it says no 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.600
 it's because it works, you have to 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.850
 follow to the letter 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.370
 you can not substitute anything or take away 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.260
 nothing or add anything this what yes 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.600
 says you can do is add salt and 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.700
 pepper to what you like and what you do not 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.790
 says and that as it says a cup of 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.180
 vanilla is nothing more than a cup but the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.670
 lettuce with lemon does not say how many there 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.860
 says it's what you want without 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.380
 exaggerating also what it says here is that 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.660
 this diet works by a process of 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.820
 chemical transformation and is proven 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.180
 and most importantly this diet is that 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.520
 one should not eat everything while 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.900
 sitting not at two hours go to chop 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.360
 again more meat or more snow not all 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.220
 while sitting and until you 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.440
 touch the next meal and for this 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.960
 diet you must lose between 4 kilos to 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:14.690
 4.5 kilos that is being as a / I think 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.830
 that from 8 to 10 pounds if it gave you good 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.400
 results if you want to return it to 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.130
 try 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.410
 you have to leave between 4 days to a 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.880
 rest week and you can go back to 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:28.910
 try it you can lose again between 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.340
 8 to 10 pounds or until you can lose 20 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.500
 pounds in two weeks good as three 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.480
 weeks and to take care of bounces this 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.450
 diet between those four days at a 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.830
 week that you have free you can eat 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:45.380
 normally but do not try to empty 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.790
 your refrigerator because obviously this 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.130
 You will increase what you lost 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.690
 I was seeing again comments and saw 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:56.480
 to see this many and many answers 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.490
 positive many who did say that I did 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.410
 I lost that because I did not want to 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.150
 try and it went very well they will see 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.130
 everything I ate like today is the first 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.860
 day tomorrow I will come with some 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.750
 results if I lost buttonholes and lost the 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.370
 today but also I'm going to 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.620
 saying good is all that I wanted them 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.210
 say in this video below are going to 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.560
 see what I ate that is going to be my block 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.410
 daily 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.060
 and I hope to see you until next time here 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.139
 is my lunch lunch is a 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.419
 slice of toast with two 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.260
 good scoops is one comes but as 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:34.190
 one and a half tablespoon of cream 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.169
 peanut or peanut and then are mediated 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.320
 red and coffee 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.000
 the coffee is pure water and as a medium 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.090
 spoonful or three quarters of a 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.919
 spoonful of coffee and well I imagine that 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.590
 the coffee is to give you an energy 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.300
 during the day in sun I never took it 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.250
 well to see how he knows me because he does not have 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.780
 no sugar or anything else I already have in my 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.590
 I refri the waters that I want to take 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.919
 during the day I was barely going as per 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.380
 here but they are counting these are seven 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.960
 bottles and I'll see if I can 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.380
 take during the day that I finish one and 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.229
 I have six left and I stayed three bottles 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.980
 and nothing else is left for me to be five 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.750
 did here is my meal of the day 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.000
 that is very happy because I do not know 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.270
 feels like diet are two pieces of 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.100
 meat says that approximately 85 grams 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:31.300
 and here only 80 a girl apple lettuce 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:33.460
 with lemon and the most delicious cup of 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.230
 snow but the food I forgot 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.680
 to mention them I'm going to finish this water 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:42.010
 so that I only stayed in 4 hours 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:45.490
 exercise that I 420 calories in 50 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.470
 minutes are 442 and almost 5 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.060

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.850
 three waters here is my dinner is 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.120
 supposed to be half a cup of tuna and a 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:06:00.419
 bread a slice of bread we could only 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:05.310
 put together I think that I think it's average 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:10.280
 tuna cup is a small tin and 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:12.710

 good flame fits another waters and now nothing 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.780
 more I have two left here is my last

 this was my last water bottle and 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:29.120
 Well, I did drink a lot of water today 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.930
