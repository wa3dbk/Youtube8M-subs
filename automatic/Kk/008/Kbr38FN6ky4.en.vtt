okay<00:00:00.810> so<00:00:00.870> this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.589> phrase<00:00:01.860> drying<00:00:02.250> up

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
okay so this is the phrase drying up

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.700 
okay so this is the phrase drying up
your<00:00:02.790> event<00:00:02.850> and<00:00:03.480> this<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.110> reason<00:00:04.529> this

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
your event and this is the reason this

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.039 
your event and this is the reason this
is<00:00:04.770> worth<00:00:05.130> these<00:00:05.819> dry<00:00:06.060> areas<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.600> it<00:00:06.690> reduce

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
is worth these dry areas and it reduce

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.709 
is worth these dry areas and it reduce
water<00:00:07.410> from<00:00:08.010> our<00:00:08.220> Syria<00:00:09.179> orange<00:00:09.540> juice

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
water from our Syria orange juice

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.320 
water from our Syria orange juice
samples<00:00:12.259> the<00:00:13.259> Rose<00:00:13.769> appearance<00:00:14.429> as<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.150> can

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
samples the Rose appearance as you can

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.670 
samples the Rose appearance as you can
see

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
see

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.010 
see
and<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.130> water<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.820> subliming<00:00:18.660> out<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
and the water is subliming out of the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.529 
and the water is subliming out of the
things<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.529> being<00:00:19.710> expected<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.849> we<00:00:20.939> take

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
things and being expected and we take

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.080 
things and being expected and we take
samples<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.349> determine<00:00:23.160> how<00:00:23.640> fast<00:00:23.910> that

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
samples to determine how fast that

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.630 
samples to determine how fast that
happen<00:00:24.509> we<00:00:25.470> take<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> data<00:00:25.950> point<00:00:26.160> what<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.490> do

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
happen we take a data point what we do

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.880 
happen we take a data point what we do
is<00:00:26.789> we're<00:00:26.939> going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.090> pull<00:00:27.329> off<00:00:27.770> we're<00:00:28.770> going

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
is we're going to pull off we're going

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.130 
is we're going to pull off we're going
to<00:00:28.950> close<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.430> the<00:00:29.550> vacuum<00:00:29.930> we're<00:00:30.930> going<00:00:31.079> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
to close it to the vacuum we're going to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.500 
to close it to the vacuum we're going to
pull<00:00:31.320> off<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.710> sample<00:00:32.269> and<00:00:33.269> then<00:00:33.420> we're

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
pull off this sample and then we're

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.680 
pull off this sample and then we're
gonna<00:00:33.800> weigh<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.489> measure<00:00:36.390> how<00:00:36.570> much

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
gonna weigh it so measure how much

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.139 
gonna weigh it so measure how much
water's<00:00:37.080> been<00:00:37.910> dried<00:00:38.910> taking<00:00:39.480> out

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.119 

good<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:44.989> then<00:00:45.020> we'll<00:00:45.199> just<00:00:45.379> take<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:45.949> and

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
good and then we'll just take it and

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.530 
good and then we'll just take it and
right<00:00:46.910> back<00:00:47.090> home<00:00:47.800> as<00:00:48.800> quickly<00:00:49.070> as<00:00:49.250> possible

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
right back home as quickly as possible

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.580 
right back home as quickly as possible
and<00:00:50.540> these<00:00:50.690> are<00:00:50.840> a<00:00:50.870> little<00:00:51.019> hard<00:00:51.260> to<00:00:51.350> get<00:00:51.440> on

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
and these are a little hard to get on

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.740 
and these are a little hard to get on
but<00:00:51.829> you<00:00:51.949> just<00:00:52.100> kind<00:00:52.370> of<00:00:52.930> do<00:00:53.930> it<00:00:53.960> hard<00:00:54.290> and<00:00:54.530> then

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
but you just kind of do it hard and then

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.799 
but you just kind of do it hard and then
turn<00:00:56.750> this<00:00:56.899> up<00:00:57.140> dial<00:00:57.680> up<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.129> so<00:00:58.309> that<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.579> can

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
turn this up dial up and so that it can

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.110 
turn this up dial up and so that it can
recalibrate<00:00:59.809> and<00:01:00.379> in<00:01:01.070> that<00:01:01.250> vacuum<00:01:01.460> back<00:01:01.850> and

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
recalibrate and in that vacuum back and

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.229 
recalibrate and in that vacuum back and
I<00:01:02.210> should<00:01:02.420> start<00:01:02.720> counting<00:01:03.050> down<00:01:03.079> it<00:01:03.829> it's<00:01:03.979> now

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
I should start counting down it it's now

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.120 
I should start counting down it it's now
it'll<00:01:05.239> get<00:01:05.390> below<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:05.930> usually<00:01:06.259> 400<00:01:06.979> and

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
it'll get below and usually 400 and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.830 
it'll get below and usually 400 and
that's<00:01:07.250> what<00:01:07.580> it's<00:01:07.729> supposed<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.060> be<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.570> so

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
that's what it's supposed to be and so

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.410 
that's what it's supposed to be and so
so<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.800> beginning<00:01:09.950> of<00:01:10.250> every<00:01:10.520> experiment<00:01:11.300> we

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
so the beginning of every experiment we

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.539 
so the beginning of every experiment we
have<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.690> freeze<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.229> samples<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.190> so<00:01:13.399> we'll

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
have to freeze the samples and so we'll

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.700 
have to freeze the samples and so we'll
turn<00:01:13.729> on<00:01:13.880> both<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.299> pump<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.320> the

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
turn on both the pump and and the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.859 
turn on both the pump and and the
cooling<00:01:16.160> to<00:01:16.399> cool<00:01:16.910> down<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.240> ethanol<00:01:17.539> make

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
cooling to cool down the ethanol make

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.490 
cooling to cool down the ethanol make
sure<00:01:18.050> that's<00:01:18.200> inside<00:01:18.649> the<00:01:18.979> bath<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.660> then

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
sure that's inside the bath and then

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.070 
sure that's inside the bath and then
what<00:01:21.679> we'll<00:01:21.800> do<00:01:21.979> is<00:01:22.330> implica<00:01:23.330> samples<00:01:23.810> and

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
what we'll do is implica samples and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.550 
what we'll do is implica samples and
then<00:01:24.920> we'll<00:01:25.070> turn<00:01:25.250> on<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:26.600> belts<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.229> then

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
then we'll turn on the belts and then

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.340 
then we'll turn on the belts and then
we'll<00:01:27.679> stick<00:01:27.920> each<00:01:28.190> sample<00:01:28.729> within<00:01:28.909> the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
we'll stick each sample within the

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.590 
we'll stick each sample within the
ethanol<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:30.979> that<00:01:31.130> it<00:01:31.250> spins<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.360> we<00:01:32.420> get<00:01:32.570> a

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
ethanol so that it spins and we get a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.990 
ethanol so that it spins and we get a
nice<00:01:32.830> I<00:01:33.830> guess<00:01:34.670> freezing<00:01:35.360> around<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.840> entire

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
nice I guess freezing around the entire

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.490 
nice I guess freezing around the entire
I<00:01:38.030> guess<00:01:38.600> glass<00:01:38.960> hem<00:01:39.320> glass<00:01:39.560> here<00:01:41.170> we<00:01:42.170> let<00:01:42.320> that

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
I guess glass hem glass here we let that

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.340 
I guess glass hem glass here we let that
go<00:01:42.710> it<00:01:42.860> usually<00:01:43.250> takes<00:01:43.490> about<00:01:43.930> five<00:01:44.930> to<00:01:45.140> ten

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
go it usually takes about five to ten

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.500 
go it usually takes about five to ten
minutes<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.860> freeze<00:01:46.160> completely<00:01:46.370> and<00:01:46.970> then

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
minutes to freeze completely and then

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.970 
minutes to freeze completely and then
that's<00:01:47.870> when<00:01:48.020> we'll<00:01:48.140> start<00:01:48.350> moving<00:01:48.680> it<00:01:48.770> over

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
that's when we'll start moving it over

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:56.350 
that's when we'll start moving it over
to<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.220> back<00:01:54.550> but<00:01:55.550> all<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.760> glucose<00:01:56.180> is

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
to the back but all the glucose is

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.020 
to the back but all the glucose is
hardened<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.020> random<00:01:57.380> chip<00:01:57.560> amounts<00:01:58.130> is

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
hardened the random chip amounts is

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.220 
hardened the random chip amounts is
brogard<00:02:00.460> bad<00:02:01.460> for<00:02:01.730> the<00:02:01.820> day<00:02:01.940> so<00:02:02.840> it's<00:02:02.990> then

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
brogard bad for the day so it's then

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.880 
brogard bad for the day so it's then
next<00:02:03.710> time<00:02:04.090> we<00:02:05.090> will<00:02:05.300> mix<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.750> solution<00:02:06.020> and

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
next time we will mix the solution and

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.219 
next time we will mix the solution and
our<00:02:07.070> body<00:02:07.310> venture<00:02:07.610> class<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.720> then<00:02:08.869> pour<00:02:09.110> it

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
our body venture class and then pour it

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.780 
our body venture class and then pour it
in<00:02:09.380> we<00:02:09.649> don't<00:02:09.830> have<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.010> chip<00:02:10.250> again

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
in we don't have to chip again

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.640 
in we don't have to chip again
everything<00:02:11.420> that<00:02:12.080> was<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.230> problem<00:02:13.990> yeah<00:02:15.020> okay

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
everything that was a problem yeah okay

want to measure each your samples with

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.490 
want to measure each your samples with
the<00:02:21.800> same<00:02:22.390> stoppers<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:23.930> what<00:02:24.110> we've<00:02:24.260> got

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
going here is we have I just lined each

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.230 
going here is we have I just lined each
stopper<00:02:27.650> up<00:02:27.770> with<00:02:27.950> with<00:02:28.340> each<00:02:28.610> of<00:02:28.790> its<00:02:28.910> it's

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
stopper up with with each of its it's

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.400 
stopper up with with each of its it's
violent

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
violent

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.710 
violent
now<00:02:31.310> one<00:02:31.610> thing<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:32.150> have<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.420> make<00:02:32.570> sure

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
now one thing that you have to make sure

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.630 
now one thing that you have to make sure
as<00:02:32.870> well<00:02:33.080> when<00:02:33.440> you're<00:02:33.590> taking<00:02:34.100> these<00:02:34.190> off<00:02:34.400> is

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
as well when you're taking these off is

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.670 
as well when you're taking these off is
you<00:02:34.760> never<00:02:35.000> want<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.330> turn<00:02:35.570> this<00:02:35.930> file<00:02:36.380> but

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
you never want to turn this file but

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.880 
you never want to turn this file but
with<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:37.490> this<00:02:38.270> whole<00:02:38.540> part<00:02:38.900> right<00:02:39.080> here<00:02:39.410> up

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
with this this whole part right here up

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.430 
with this this whole part right here up
on<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.250> top<00:02:40.580> otherwise<00:02:41.000> that'll<00:02:41.900> mess<00:02:42.290> with

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
on the top otherwise that'll mess with

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.110 
on the top otherwise that'll mess with
the<00:02:42.530> vacuum<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.100> I<00:02:43.160> think<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.490> opens<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.030> up

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
the vacuum and I think it opens it up

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.640 
the vacuum and I think it opens it up
today<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.900> atmosphere<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:45.470> whenever

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
today to the atmosphere so whenever

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.470 
today to the atmosphere so whenever
you're<00:02:45.920> pulling<00:02:46.220> off<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:47.030> want<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.270> turn<00:02:47.450> that

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
you're pulling off you want to turn that

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.810 
you're pulling off you want to turn that
down<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.620> that<00:02:48.680> will<00:02:48.890> close<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.370> off<00:02:49.490> to<00:02:49.700> the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
down and that will close it off to the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.300 
down and that will close it off to the
sample<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.540> then<00:02:51.200> when<00:02:51.320> you<00:02:51.410> pull<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:51.800> off<00:02:51.920> you

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
sample and then when you pull it off you

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.830 
sample and then when you pull it off you
want<00:02:52.460> to<00:02:52.520> put<00:02:52.700> your<00:02:52.820> two<00:02:53.030> fingers<00:02:53.390> up<00:02:53.570> here<00:02:53.600> at

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
want to put your two fingers up here at

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.440 
want to put your two fingers up here at
the<00:02:53.930> top<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.710> just<00:02:55.040> sort<00:02:55.460> of<00:02:55.520> pull<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.150> up<00:02:56.270> like

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
the top and just sort of pull it up like

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.510 
the top and just sort of pull it up like
this<00:02:56.690> as<00:02:57.200> opposed<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.710> grabbing<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.250> down<00:02:58.430> at

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
this as opposed to grabbing it down at

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
this as opposed to grabbing it down at
the<00:02:58.550> bottom<00:02:58.790> in<00:02:59.060> which<00:02:59.210> you<00:02:59.390> could

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
the bottom in which you could

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.520 
the bottom in which you could
potentially<00:03:00.170> break<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.890> vial<00:03:01.070> that<00:03:01.250> way<00:03:02.530> and

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
potentially break the vial that way and

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.900 
potentially break the vial that way and
we'll<00:03:03.650> just<00:03:03.830> measure<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.190> one<00:03:04.340> again<00:03:04.550> when

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
we'll just measure this one again when

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.210 
we'll just measure this one again when
you<00:03:05.000> put<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.270> back<00:03:05.300> on<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:06.050> just<00:03:06.230> want<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.530> just

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
you put it back on you just want to just

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.160 
you put it back on you just want to just
stick<00:03:07.490> it<00:03:07.580> on<00:03:07.670> as<00:03:07.820> hard<00:03:08.030> as<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.180> can<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.930> then

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
stick it on as hard as you can and then

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.980 
stick it on as hard as you can and then
turn<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.530> vial<00:03:09.680> back
