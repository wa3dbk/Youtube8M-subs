00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.020

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.450
 with your email address 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.680
 microsismica for gmail.com according 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.930
 if in a week I have not been sent 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.280
 I will do the same thing that I just did 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.410
 do in this video I do not teach in the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.090
 next video and nothing else I leave you with 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.090
 the review of watch lipsticks 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.180
 for all that good I bring you a 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.500
 review of the new blocks of revealed 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.260
 in cast the sale ends that are the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.640
 colors of stain ministrers teach you 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.350
 two of them in purchases 15 of 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.780
 makeup in May and the truth that I 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.520
 they liked it so much that I went for three more in 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.290
 the very good hard shoulder I really like the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.479
 texture the color it brings to the lips 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.130
 and the truth that I have decided I say I make you 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.900
 a video directly focused on them 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.490
 and so I can explain a little more 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.020
 tonalities and teach well also how 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.150
 there are the lips that always make a difference 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.830
 a bit between the hand soft to like 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.330
 only the first thing that remains on the lip 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.850
 Mention is the package if I do not like it 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.560
 very much because it is the little square 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.259
 similar to maybelline I think I have here 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.670
 to color the ix and it's very similar but 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.050
 this one I like a little more what is 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.240
 the packaging because the edges are 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.000
 completely as straight lines is 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.120
 completely enfilÃ³ and I do not know why you 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.650
 it seems nicer I do not know it always happens what 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.390
 same change the package a bit and they say 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.340
 oh how nice it is because that happens to me 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.410
 right now I like this package 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.910
 a lot apart I love that we can see 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.310
 well the tonality of which we are 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.530
 catching then back we always have the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.700
 name with the color and I like this 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.490
 also because at the time of later 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.750
 keep it in the drawer and everything 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.220
 I can place it in such a way that 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.140
 I can see directly where I want to 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.610
 and it's much easier that it's not like 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.960
 some lipstick that you then have to 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.700
 be seeing all to know the color 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.200
 you want to use this instead 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.450
 you can directly see the naturalness 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.980
 well and in store is easier at the time 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.480
 to choose the product because the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.760
 tonality that you are going to see here is the one 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.130
 you're going to have it in the lip I tell you 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.060
 let's make sure the applicator is also 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.280
 another thing that I'm liking 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.200
 because it's not completely like roll or 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.570
 drop of water that is a little more oval 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.490
 but we have the two sides more 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.900
 straight then I do not know why for me 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.000
 it's easier now to apply soto in the 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.250
 I can place the lower lip and 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.870
 I pass it is simpler and more 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.300
 make up completely make up what 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.620
 it's the whole lower part of the lip not 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.930
 I know why but it 's been a lot 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.160
 more comfortable and easier than in relation 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.140
 who has the mouthpiece a little more in 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.970
 oval shape and then the tip the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.500
 shape of the beak is much simpler 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.480
 especially the people that we have the 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.430
 lipstick I do not always have 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.110
 we see an obvious type of applicator 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.820
 to be able to reach the whole area well and 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.860
 that is perfect or has more beautiful 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.750
 that the oval issue does not cost us a 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.920
 little more be more precise in that area and 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.840
 blogs and talking about what 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.250
 important are glosses that give you a 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.040
 effect as wet 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.600
 wet they call it gloss and wet color and 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.340
 yes you find it naught that 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.560
 you apply on the lip you see that effect 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.150
 Super monkey shine and I really like it 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.580
 especially the for crazy topic not summer 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.110
 spring-summer this kind of thing are 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.000
 which I like to carry because they give 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.580
 color but from the luminosity and 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.320
 lip gloss and I love what they are 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.240
 gloss is that they will hydrate your lip 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.640
 they have vitamin e and they have halo then 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.890
 it's pretty good because they are not the ones 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.350
 they are sticky that maybe you take us 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.690
 as you do not like a lot of sense not 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.100
 They are nothing sticky and apart they are not going to 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.450
 resect nothing on the lip nor does it 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.550
 they will accentuate you if we have areas a 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.500
 slightly more dry it is not accentuated 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.870
 but you apply it super easy and apart 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.269
 they will hydrate us throughout the day and 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.220
 another thing that has to be the line 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.960
 color stay we all know that more is done 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.150
 as the foundation of makeup that is the one 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.560
 it stays intact all day the 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.110
 correctors are super good then 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.700
 focusing on that line this kind of 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.100
 gloss is once you take off 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.300
 let's say in the above we are going to 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.919
 keep the lip a little tinted 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.360
 because I realized at the time of 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.669
 make the 8 in my hand then when I 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.020
 I'll take it off for a while with the brand 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.210
 of the blog in hand 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.710
 you do not have that gloss effect and but it 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.270
 you stay here the kind of then they are 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.280
 gloss is that maybe a colorado 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.229
 of the day we lose a bit the brightness 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.669
 the intensity of the color is always us 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.319
 the tonality will be all we can 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.400
 eat we can drink water we can do 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.080
 what we want we are always going to 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.370
 have that sub tone that color that does not 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.900
 we knew how to apply the lips and we're going to 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.000
 remain intact then that part I 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.460
 really like it because simply because 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.830
 if after eating we want to apply a 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.110
 little by having that kind of gloss effect 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.430
 brightness effect as we can catch it is 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.460
 super easy we apply it 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.620
 and it is not going to resect us or the 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.570
 I take layer on layer nothing stays 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.000
 super well sits fast is absorbed 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.790
 and I love it 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.190
 the composition the product itself is 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.720
 great and good to teach the 5 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.030
 tonalities that I bought the first 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.920
 of them india in trick and I like it 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.960
 a lot because it's like a color between pink 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.690
 moralito but pulling and a little more 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.150
 for the dark side I am a lover is like that 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.950
 for the dark side it is not completely 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.270
 bright but I love tonality and 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.340
 about all this I also like because 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.050
 for the winter theme I also see it 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.360
 a very wearable color not only for 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.610
 summer the next one that I caught is reason to 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.930
 knight's this when I saw him I said this one 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.330
 it has to be mine since it's the only one 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.950
 have a little Spanish word said I did 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.140
 I have to buy and I love tonality 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.640
 because it is a color like super fuchsia 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.410
 monkey I take it also because the lips and 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.180
 As you can see, it brings a lot of color to 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.130
 makeup and just with this and 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.020
 Eyelash mask for summer is 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:10.290
 enough and I love this tonality 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.770
 the next river flush we 're a 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.990
 little more pulling that neon rosadito and 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.740
 I also know the color is super cute and 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.080
 they look great on the lips 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.729
 and I love this tonality and both 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.770
 The last ones are already a little pulling mass 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.630
 coral is the first thing to teach them 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.240
 cannes crush and I like this one because it's 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.650
 a super neon coral color plus 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.990
 it looks a lot like some nail polish 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.639
 I have now in summer and I say look at this 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.690
 color will be very good and on 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:36.550
 everything when we take a little more 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.380
 This color must be very dark 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.240
 well in the face so this is one of 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.710
 them and the last one that I took is miami 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.599
 feeder this I like because it is 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.800
 directly orange or one time 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:46.509
 applied the lip you see it beats 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.979
 realities completely orange but 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:50.770
 they are very beautiful I think that having 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:52.360
 That gloss effect does not stand out so much that 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.370
 be orange but the finish is super 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.560
 monkey and I like very much put in the 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.909
 Then, as you can see, it focuses 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.319
 a little more a subject of roses but the 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:01.810
 true that the two corals that I have caught 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:04.210
 I like finishing very much especially 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.220
 cannes crush this was one of the last 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.569
 I have caught now once I went and I 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.460
 love me, I really like the 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:11.199
 tonality and good before finishing that 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.300
 I forgot and the price is seven 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:14.710
 hours with 95 depending on where you look for it 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.240
 can reach up to 92 so there's 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.580
 that look well where can we buy it 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.590
 and then another very important thing is that 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.930
 It's not limited edition will suffice 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.539
 fixed revlon 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.190
 then it's a good idea the truth that 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:28.229
 I have seen it very well when I read it 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.120
 I've done less wrong because it's going to be a lot 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:32.340
 easier to be able to buy it 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.780
 internet the people who sell it are not going to 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.090
 inflate both the process them editing 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.280
 Limited are cleaned and then are fixed 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.050
 also the pages that sell revealed me 

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.210
 I imagine that soon they will be able 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.680
 sell to the gods and in case 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.259
 you are in Spain 'in the perfumeries 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.639
 Marvimundo is the only perfume shop that I 

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:49.289
 I found that he sells the revlon brand 

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:50.669
 then in the case that you are in 

00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:53.039
 Spain so look for one of those 

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:55.590
 perfumeries and you can ask what 

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:56.880
 better that soon it is but I imagine 

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.860
 that these types of euros can you 

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.120
 find there also agree and nothing 

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.650
 more wait than you liked the 

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.090
 review are the gloss is revlon no os 

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.830
 forget to give me I like to subscribe 

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.759
