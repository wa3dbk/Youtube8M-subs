directional kind of XV inspired type of

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.779 
directional kind of XV inspired type of
board<00:00:21.710> some<00:00:22.710> key<00:00:22.890> features<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.640> we're

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
board some key features on it we're

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.099 
board some key features on it we're
gonna<00:00:23.880> run<00:00:24.180> like<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.510> said<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> super

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
gonna run like I said a super

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.839 
gonna run like I said a super
directional<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> definite

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
directional so you have a definite

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.519 
directional so you have a definite
offset<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.510> thing<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.810> built<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.230> get<00:00:28.410> up

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
offset this thing is built to get up

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.050 
offset this thing is built to get up
into<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> powder<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.310> definitely<00:00:29.760> float

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
into the powder and definitely float

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.810 
into the powder and definitely float
it's<00:00:30.689> got<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.160> super<00:00:32.160> directional<00:00:32.640> flex

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
it's got a super directional flex

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.459 
it's got a super directional flex
pattern<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.480> scale<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.719> 1<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:33.989> 10

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
pattern so on a scale of 1 to 10

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.400 
pattern so on a scale of 1 to 10
sensor<00:00:35.070> we're<00:00:35.190> gonna<00:00:35.280> go<00:00:35.489> 8<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.390> tip<00:00:36.630> 8<00:00:37.140> in

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
sensor we're gonna go 8 in the tip 8 in

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.170 
sensor we're gonna go 8 in the tip 8 in
the<00:00:37.530> center<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.040> 9<00:00:38.430> at<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.730> tail<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.059> it's

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the center and 9 at the tail so it's

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.910 
the center and 9 at the tail so it's
actually<00:00:39.270> got<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.510> stiffer<00:00:39.750> tail<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.200> really

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
actually got a stiffer tail to really

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.740 
actually got a stiffer tail to really
kind<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.670> carve<00:00:41.879> out<00:00:42.030> those<00:00:42.210> turns

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
kind of carve out those turns

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.779 
kind of carve out those turns
we're<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.350> use<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.559> twin<00:00:43.800> wood<00:00:44.010> 3<00:00:44.250> core<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:44.579> this

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
we're in use a twin wood 3 core on this

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.040 
we're in use a twin wood 3 core on this
guy<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.270> use<00:00:45.420> three<00:00:45.600> different<00:00:45.840> kinds<00:00:46.020> of

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
guy so we use three different kinds of

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.170 
guy so we use three different kinds of
wood<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> get<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> perfect<00:00:47.070> balance<00:00:47.610> feeling

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
wood to get the perfect balance feeling

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.970 
wood to get the perfect balance feeling
on<00:00:48.300> here<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.960> base<00:00:49.170> material<00:00:49.680> we're<00:00:49.890> gonna

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
on here the base material we're gonna

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.270 
on here the base material we're gonna
bump<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.579> up<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> basically<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.129> 7500<00:00:53.129> base

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
bump this up to a basically a 7500 base

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.709 
bump this up to a basically a 7500 base
what<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:53.579> call<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.270> thing<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
what we call it and that thing is the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.389 
what we call it and that thing is the
best<00:00:54.899> base<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.320> got<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.590> snowboard<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.190> thing

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
best base we got in snowboard this thing

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.029 
best base we got in snowboard this thing
collides<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> champion<00:00:57.930> from<00:00:58.890> there

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
collides like a champion from there

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.830 
collides like a champion from there
we're<00:00:59.160> gonna<00:00:59.280> use<00:00:59.520> kind<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> best<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.809> both

there is we're gonna use about 40% of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.679 
there is we're gonna use about 40% of
this<00:01:08.189> board<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.640> gonna<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:09.000> camber

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
this board it's gonna have camber

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.899 
this board it's gonna have camber
underneath<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> underneath<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> feet<00:01:11.490> which

great perch great balance then we're

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.710 
great perch great balance then we're
gonna<00:01:16.080> go<00:01:16.259> out<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.439> about<00:01:16.740> 60%<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.450> tip<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
gonna go out to about 60% of the tip and

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.179 
gonna go out to about 60% of the tip and
the<00:01:18.810> tail<00:01:18.960> will<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.290> rockered<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:19.860> once<00:01:20.070> you
