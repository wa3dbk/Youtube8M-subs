00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.380
 the work is not only possible 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.290
 super fast in the morning it is very very 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.949

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.640

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.320
 and it's an eyecatcher you're going to 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.220
 every case at work on it 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.609
 addressed 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.720
 it is really a dream in the otto few 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:35.280
 ingredients and always go with three 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:37.230
 tablespoons oatmeal and a full 1 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.020
 or 1 1 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.489
 a cup of greek yogurt ii are 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.030
 150 grams 3 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:49.800
 you need something half time 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.809
 teaspoon sugar vanilla sugar that can 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.489
 I link you a great thing 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.730
 But you have to be very happy with that 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.550
 sparing it is very intense 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.570
 often over half a teaspoon 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.449
 baking powder here i have waldstein 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.450
 baking powder you need some milk 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.390
 optional of course if you a 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.890
 banana would have crushed her pretty 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.909
 week then you can have the milk 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.799
 namely save 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.250
 I like that but I have it here 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.000
 No banana at home that's why I take 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.070
 Now with her, she needs 30 grams of whey 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.080
 protein powder thereby the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.450
 taste banana that we 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.340
 of course, to match the banana I do 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.320
 namely not at home you can 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.180
 but also vanilla do not take up any topic 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.460
 you can do it all in chocolate too 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.460
 make a taste then you add the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.579
 all revealed a little bit weak 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.430
 soder reveals that cocoa and her 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.560
 Of course you can also get the whey protein 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.630
 powder in taste shock or too 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.020
 furthermore , you still need to take 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.100
 Such frozen berries here is such a 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.680
 mix it from inside you can do it too 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.549
 Take or be pure as well 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.979
 always and I take something else too 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.140
 kings cheese but still a little bit 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.570
 just because I like that but you could 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.209
 also all a Greek yogurt for 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.950
 So I'll go now and show 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.950
 how easy it is for you 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.440
 b 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.260
 you are now shooting for two 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.609
 minutes into the microwave and then 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.510
 Let's see how the whole thing looks like 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:43.750
 now takes this customer and transfers 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.489
 the whole also put such a cellar 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.670
 that one minute again in the 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.549
 microwave and if your example 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.219
 have hot bears then put one 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:57.129
 part of the bears 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:03:00.129
 besides that, I got the whole thing out 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.590
 The surface is now dry 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.919
 That's the way it should look like, that means you have 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.980
 Now only three minutes to bake 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:11.409
 This cake is needed and that is 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.510
 really, very little about it 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.639
 By the way, I still have a little tip 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.549
 for you if you all for the 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:22.329
 wanted to transport work separately 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:25.719
 I recommend you such a bowl the 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.840
 now such a kink closure which 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:31.810
 the whole in such a round bowl 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.319
 baked almost all the ideal there 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.209
 purely 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.430
 you get the shots at ikea her 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.769
 can also bake the mass in it and 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.650
 immediately close with to work 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.280

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.280
 continue the doping 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:44.740
 that's done we said that I find 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:47.710

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.479
