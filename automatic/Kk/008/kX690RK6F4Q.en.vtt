movie<00:00:00.690> clips<00:00:00.930> also<00:00:01.170> run<00:00:01.589> independently

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
movie clips also run independently

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.519 
movie clips also run independently
without<00:00:02.730> stopping<00:00:03.330> so<00:00:04.110> we<00:00:04.259> can<00:00:04.380> use

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
without stopping so we can use

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.440 
without stopping so we can use
ActionScript<00:00:05.250> on<00:00:05.370> their<00:00:05.580> timelines<00:00:06.150> to

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
ActionScript on their timelines to

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.459 
ActionScript on their timelines to
control<00:00:06.870> whether<00:00:07.140> they<00:00:07.290> stop<00:00:07.589> or<00:00:08.040> go<00:00:09.320> here<00:00:10.320> are

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
control whether they stop or go here are

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.160 
control whether they stop or go here are
our<00:00:10.590> beginning<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.219> after<00:00:11.360> flash<00:00:12.360> movies<00:00:12.840> and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
our beginning and after flash movies and

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.140 
our beginning and after flash movies and
we<00:00:13.950> can<00:00:14.099> see<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.549> beginning<00:00:14.700> movie

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
we can see that the beginning movie

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.330 
we can see that the beginning movie
continuously<00:00:15.750> plays<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.590> ending<00:00:17.010> movie

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
continuously plays so the ending movie

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.609 
continuously plays so the ending movie
is<00:00:18.060> already<00:00:18.359> done<00:00:18.660> playing<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.199> since<00:00:19.439> they

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
is already done playing and since they

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.890 
is already done playing and since they
are<00:00:19.650> movie<00:00:20.100> clips<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.520> there's<00:00:20.670> no<00:00:20.900> keyframes

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
are movie clips and there's no keyframes

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.689 
are movie clips and there's no keyframes
or<00:00:22.080> any<00:00:22.199> extra<00:00:22.529> frames<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.130> main<00:00:23.430> timeline

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
or any extra frames on the main timeline

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.570 
or any extra frames on the main timeline
we<00:00:24.029> can't<00:00:24.300> use<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.810> menu<00:00:25.769> inside<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.340> flash

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
we can't use the menu inside the flash

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.580 
we can't use the menu inside the flash
player<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.330> we'll<00:00:27.449> close<00:00:27.720> these<00:00:28.019> real<00:00:28.289> quickly

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
player so we'll close these real quickly

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:36.139 
player so we'll close these real quickly
and<00:00:29.269> I'll<00:00:30.269> open<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:32.390> completed<00:00:33.980> example<00:00:35.149> and

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
and I'll open the completed example and

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.319 
and I'll open the completed example and
just<00:00:36.180> run<00:00:36.989> test<00:00:37.410> movie<00:00:37.800> real<00:00:38.010> quick<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.610> you

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
just run test movie real quick and you

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.810 
just run test movie real quick and you
can<00:00:39.480> see<00:00:39.660> how<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.110> opens<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.129> comes

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
can see how that just opens up and comes

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.630 
can see how that just opens up and comes
to<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> stop<00:00:42.739> so<00:00:43.739> let's<00:00:43.890> get<00:00:44.040> our<00:00:44.190> starting

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
to a stop so let's get our starting

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.250 
to a stop so let's get our starting
movie<00:00:44.940> open

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.950 

and<00:00:53.040> we'll<00:00:53.309> save<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.790> a<00:00:53.820> practice<00:00:54.329> file<00:00:59.960> and

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
and we'll save as a practice file and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.170 
and we'll save as a practice file and
let's<00:01:01.140> examine<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:01.739> we<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:02.040> first<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.970> have

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
let's examine what we have first we have

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.170 
let's examine what we have first we have
one<00:01:03.600> layer<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.470> scene<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.369> timeline<00:01:05.700> as

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
one layer on the scene one timeline as

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.650 
one layer on the scene one timeline as
two<00:01:06.390> objects<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.890> I'm<00:01:08.580> going<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.180> move<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
two objects and I'm going to move the

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.540 
two objects and I'm going to move the
stage<00:01:09.900> up<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.380> closer<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.040> properties

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
stage up here closer to the properties

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.930 
stage up here closer to the properties
window<00:01:11.759> and<00:01:13.220> we'll<00:01:14.220> open<00:01:14.369> up<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.640> properties

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
window and we'll open up the properties

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.460 
window and we'll open up the properties
window<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.390> we<00:01:15.509> click<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.869> each<00:01:15.930> one<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.290> these

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
window and we click on each one of these

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.490 
window and we click on each one of these
we<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.770> see<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:18.030> first<00:01:18.300> object<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
we can see that the first object on the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.830 
we can see that the first object on the
timeline<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.550> circle<00:01:21.090> eyes<00:01:21.240> drawling

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
timeline is the circle eyes drawling

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.590 
timeline is the circle eyes drawling
movie<00:01:22.140> clip<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:23.550> second<00:01:23.880> object<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
movie clip and the second object is the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.230 
movie clip and the second object is the
same<00:01:25.070> movie<00:01:26.070> clip<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.700> difference<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.210> that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
same movie clip the difference is that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.350 
same movie clip the difference is that
one<00:01:27.570> was<00:01:27.840> flipped<00:01:28.229> horizontally<00:01:29.030> if<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.149> go<00:01:30.300> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
one was flipped horizontally if we go to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.960 
one was flipped horizontally if we go to
the<00:01:30.479> library<00:01:31.100> we<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.130> see<00:01:32.460> inside<00:01:32.789> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the library we can see inside the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.940 
the library we can see inside the
library<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.630> two<00:01:34.050> movie<00:01:34.380> clips<00:01:34.619> one's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
library we have two movie clips one's

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.100 
library we have two movie clips one's
called<00:01:35.280> circle<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.539> we'll<00:01:36.660> just<00:01:36.780> open<00:01:37.080> that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
called circle I so we'll just open that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.730 
called circle I so we'll just open that
briefly<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.630> circle<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.530> has

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
briefly and circle I you can see it has

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.490 
briefly and circle I you can see it has
two<00:01:41.160> layers<00:01:41.430> one<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> pupil<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:43.140> for

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
two layers one for a pupil and one for

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.850 
two layers one for a pupil and one for
the<00:01:43.530> eye<00:01:44.660> and<00:01:45.660> we'll<00:01:46.140> take<00:01:46.289> a<00:01:46.350> look<00:01:46.530> at<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the eye and we'll take a look at the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.020 
the eye and we'll take a look at the
circle<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.429> growing<00:01:47.880> movie<00:01:48.360> clip<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.880> we<00:01:50.880> can

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
circle I growing movie clip and we can

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.700 
circle I growing movie clip and we can
see<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.330> Dead<00:01:51.539> has<00:01:51.690> a<00:01:51.720> tween<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.530> an

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
see the Dead has a tween on it an

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.969 
see the Dead has a tween on it an
animation<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.759> there's<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.330> tween<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.979> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
animation and there's a tween and the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.080 
animation and there's a tween and the
object<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.819> here<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.209> the<00:01:57.450> circle<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.050> object

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
object on here is the circle I object

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:09.660 
object on here is the circle I object
and<00:02:00.090> we<00:02:00.720> can<00:02:00.750> actually<00:02:01.170> see<00:02:01.349> how<00:02:01.470> that<00:02:01.619> works

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.940 

so<00:02:10.509> let's<00:02:10.720> test<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.140> movie<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.620> just<00:02:11.770> see<00:02:11.920> how

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
so let's test the movie and just see how

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.230 
so let's test the movie and just see how
it<00:02:12.100> works<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:18.280> we<00:02:18.400> can<00:02:18.430> see<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.970> movie

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
it works and we can see that the movie

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.059 
it works and we can see that the movie
clips<00:02:19.510> keep<00:02:19.750> repeating<00:02:20.110> themselves<00:02:20.410> because

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
clips keep repeating themselves because

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.100 
clips keep repeating themselves because
there's<00:02:21.340> no<00:02:21.640> stop<00:02:22.120> action<00:02:22.420> on<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.900> last

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
there's no stop action on the last

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.570 
there's no stop action on the last
keyframe<00:02:27.240> so<00:02:28.240> we'll<00:02:28.390> close<00:02:28.570> this<00:02:29.010> window<00:02:30.010> and

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
keyframe so we'll close this window and
