this<00:00:04.650> is<00:00:04.770> day<00:00:04.890> two<00:00:04.950> of<00:00:05.160> our<00:00:05.400> setup<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:05.910> we've

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
this is day two of our setup and we've

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.970 
this is day two of our setup and we've
done<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.180> fair<00:00:06.450> bit<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.660> work<00:00:06.870> already<00:00:07.109> over

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
done a fair bit of work already over

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.700 
done a fair bit of work already over
here<00:00:08.189> we've<00:00:08.610> got<00:00:08.820> these<00:00:09.230> bouncing<00:00:10.230> arches

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
here we've got these bouncing arches

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.350 
here we've got these bouncing arches
these<00:00:11.190> are<00:00:11.340> new<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.610> year<00:00:11.670> three<00:00:12.150> meter

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
these are new this year three meter

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.509 
these are new this year three meter
poles<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.710> we<00:00:13.860> have<00:00:14.070> some<00:00:14.370> eight

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
poles and on that we have some eight

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.730 
poles and on that we have some eight
sections<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.269> green<00:00:15.540> light<00:00:15.750> on<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.500> ground

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
sections of green light on the ground

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.500 
sections of green light on the ground
over<00:00:17.070> here<00:00:17.100> it's<00:00:17.520> important<00:00:17.940> we<00:00:18.029> test<00:00:18.300> all<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
over here it's important we test all the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.929 
over here it's important we test all the
mega<00:00:18.810> tree<00:00:19.109> lighting<00:00:19.500> before<00:00:19.920> we<00:00:20.520> get<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.820> up

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
mega tree lighting before we get it up

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.939 
mega tree lighting before we get it up
on<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.210> tree<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.840> spread<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.140> out<00:00:22.320> through

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
on the tree so we spread it out through

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.849 
on the tree so we spread it out through
here<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.340> have<00:00:23.460> 12<00:00:23.730> sectors<00:00:24.300> each<00:00:24.710> sector<00:00:25.710> has

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
here we have 12 sectors each sector has

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.009 
here we have 12 sectors each sector has
three<00:00:26.189> different<00:00:26.369> colors<00:00:26.910> red<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.480> big<00:00:27.840> fun

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
three different colors red a big fun

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.859 
three different colors red a big fun
pink<00:00:28.260> white<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.830> blue<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.720> hopefully<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
pink white and blue and hopefully the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.510 
pink white and blue and hopefully the
end<00:00:30.990> result<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.560> they<00:00:31.830> all<00:00:31.980> work<00:00:32.219> if<00:00:32.430> they

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
end result is that they all work if they

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.740 
end result is that they all work if they
don't<00:00:32.700> work<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.120> fix<00:00:33.300> them<00:00:33.420> down<00:00:33.570> here

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
don't work we can fix them down here

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.970 
don't work we can fix them down here
because<00:00:33.840> it's<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> lot<00:00:34.260> easier<00:00:34.290> fixing<00:00:34.890> them

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
because it's a lot easier fixing them

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.920 
because it's a lot easier fixing them
there<00:00:35.190> than<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.880> fixing<00:00:36.510> them<00:00:36.630> up<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
there than it is fixing them up on the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.100 
there than it is fixing them up on the
tree<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.610> four<00:00:38.969> cards<00:00:39.809> from

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
tree so here we have four cards from

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.790 
tree so here we have four cards from
lighter<00:00:40.379> amah

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
lighter amah

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.910 
lighter amah
this<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.670> smart<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.660> sends<00:00:43.110> signals<00:00:43.860> to

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
this is the smart that sends signals to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.560 
this is the smart that sends signals to
these<00:00:44.070> power<00:00:44.340> points<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.730> turn<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.149> or<00:00:45.270> off<00:00:45.300> for

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
these power points to turn on or off for

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.959 
these power points to turn on or off for
a<00:00:45.629> millisecond<00:00:46.230> there's<00:00:46.710> 64<00:00:47.219> power<00:00:47.520> points<00:00:47.850> in

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
a millisecond there's 64 power points in

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.240 
a millisecond there's 64 power points in
here<00:00:48.210> I've<00:00:48.360> got<00:00:48.719> 64<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.469> other<00:00:49.590> garage<00:00:50.039> and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
here I've got 64 in the other garage and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.430 
here I've got 64 in the other garage and
then<00:00:50.340> I've<00:00:50.430> got<00:00:50.579> two<00:00:50.789> separate<00:00:51.449> boxes<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.960> 32

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
then I've got two separate boxes of 32

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.709 
then I've got two separate boxes of 32
channels<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.039> another<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.730> 16<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.449> allows

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
channels and another of 16 that allows

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.319 
channels and another of 16 that allows
us<00:00:54.930> some<00:00:55.199> 178<00:00:56.070> channels<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.670> think<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.239> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
us some 178 channels I think it is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.500 
us some 178 channels I think it is
Antoni<00:00:57.960> across<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.440> road<00:00:58.620> has<00:00:59.100> another<00:00:59.460> 32<00:01:00.359> as

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
Antoni across the road has another 32 as

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.360 
Antoni across the road has another 32 as
well<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:01.140> sometimes<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.160> look<00:01:02.280> at

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
well but sometimes if you have a look at

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.450 
well but sometimes if you have a look at
this<00:01:02.460> one<00:01:02.609> down<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.390> put<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:04.460> what

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
this one down here we have to put a what

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.130 
this one down here we have to put a what
is<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.729> light<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> small<00:01:06.479> light<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.960> there

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
is that a light a small light on there

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.500 
is that a light a small light on there
the<00:01:07.439> reason<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.890> do<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> soaks<00:01:09.299> up

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the reason we do that is so it soaks up

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.179 
the reason we do that is so it soaks up
load<00:01:09.780> because<00:01:10.080> these<00:01:10.200> are<00:01:10.380> made<00:01:10.470> for<00:01:10.680> American

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
load because these are made for American

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.670 
load because these are made for American
110-volt<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.570> use<00:01:12.750> 24<00:01:13.229> volt<00:01:13.500> lighting

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
110-volt and we use 24 volt lighting

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.590 
110-volt and we use 24 volt lighting
there's<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.369> whole<00:01:14.520> host<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.909> problems<00:01:15.119> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
there's a whole host of problems that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.149 
there's a whole host of problems that
the<00:01:15.689> Americans<00:01:16.140> don't<00:01:16.320> get<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.680> enjoy<00:01:16.799> but

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the Americans don't get to enjoy but

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.140 
the Americans don't get to enjoy but
after<00:01:17.490> tell<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> what

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
after tell you what

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.510 
after tell you what
once<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.630> gets<00:01:18.750> working<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.860> forget<00:01:20.250> all<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
once it gets working we forget all the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.730 
once it gets working we forget all the
dramas<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.229> house<00:01:22.409> we've<00:01:22.710> got

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
dramas so this is the house we've got

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.429 
dramas so this is the house we've got
