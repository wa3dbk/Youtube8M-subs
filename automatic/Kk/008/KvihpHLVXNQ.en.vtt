00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.670 
that's something that I really love
about<00:01:40.060> this<00:01:40.390> because<00:01:40.780> they're<00:01:40.930> not<00:01:40.960> all<00:01:41.350> just

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
about this because they're not all just

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.800 
about this because they're not all just
the<00:01:41.830> same<00:01:42.130> type<00:01:42.460> of<00:01:42.490> figure<00:01:42.939> there's<00:01:43.479> little

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
the same type of figure there's little

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.899 
the same type of figure there's little
differences<00:01:44.320> like<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.799> postures<00:01:45.340> that

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
differences like the postures that

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.460 
differences like the postures that
really<00:01:46.210> make<00:01:46.360> them<00:01:46.540> stand<00:01:46.900> out<00:01:47.080> from<00:01:47.350> each

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
really make them stand out from each

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.770 
really make them stand out from each
other<00:01:47.710> which<00:01:48.369> is<00:01:48.520> essential<00:01:49.030> considering

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
other which is essential considering

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.600 
other which is essential considering
these<00:01:49.900> are<00:01:50.080> all<00:01:50.229> different<00:01:50.439> types<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:51.070> apes<00:01:51.369> in

00:04:59.079 --> 00:04:59.089 
package in two halves but it just has a

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:00.670

presses together very easily and

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.209 
presses together very easily and
actually<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.469> fact<00:05:03.649> that<00:05:03.740> it<00:05:03.889> can<00:05:03.979> split

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:04.219 
actually the fact that it can split

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:05.469 
actually the fact that it can split
apart<00:05:04.460> makes<00:05:04.699> it<00:05:04.819> a<00:05:04.849> little<00:05:04.999> bit<00:05:05.149> easier<00:05:05.449> to

apart makes it a little bit easier to

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.389 
apart makes it a little bit easier to
put<00:05:05.749> it<00:05:05.839> in<00:05:05.930> koba's<00:05:06.289> hands<00:05:06.680> for<00:05:07.099> some<00:05:07.249> of<00:05:07.339> the
