here's<00:02:18.060> another<00:02:18.209> example<00:02:18.870> where<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.140> cut<00:02:19.379> away

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
here's another example where I cut away

all the fabric between the seams instead

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.680 
all the fabric between the seams instead
of<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:22.049> cutting<00:02:22.379> a<00:02:22.470> straight<00:02:22.709> line<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:24.480> like

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
of just cutting a straight line so like

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.150 
of just cutting a straight line so like
I<00:02:24.810> said<00:02:24.870> before<00:02:25.049> you<00:02:25.470> can<00:02:25.530> use<00:02:25.769> this<00:02:25.920> technique

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
I said before you can use this technique

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.220 
I said before you can use this technique
on<00:02:26.519> lots<00:02:26.879> of<00:02:27.000> different<00:02:27.090> types<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.660> fabric<00:02:28.049> but

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
on lots of different types of fabric but

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.320 
on lots of different types of fabric but
it<00:02:28.349> works<00:02:28.530> really<00:02:28.920> great<00:02:29.160> for<00:02:29.519> getting<00:02:29.549> logos

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
it works really great for getting logos

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.650 
it works really great for getting logos
off<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.989> t-shirts<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:32.370> Center<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.209> design

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
over the previous logo and then you'll

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.030 
over the previous logo and then you'll
be<00:02:36.569> cutting<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:37.019> away<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.470> then<00:02:37.680> it's<00:02:37.860> gone

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
be cutting it away and then it's gone
