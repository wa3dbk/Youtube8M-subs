going to want to know about or aperture

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.639 
going to want to know about or aperture
ISO<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.399> shutter<00:00:32.570> speed<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.840> let's<00:00:34.559> talk

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
ISO and shutter speed so let's talk

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.560 
ISO and shutter speed so let's talk
about<00:00:34.739> aperture<00:00:35.100> real<00:00:35.370> fast<00:00:35.610> aperture<00:00:36.329> is

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
about aperture real fast aperture is

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.330 
about aperture real fast aperture is
also<00:00:36.840> known<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.079> f-stop<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.010> that's<00:00:38.190> what

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
also known as f-stop and that's what

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.920 
also known as f-stop and that's what
you'll<00:00:38.460> usually<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.270> when<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.540> see<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.780> on

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
you'll usually see it when you see it on

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.380 
you'll usually see it when you see it on
cameras<00:00:40.320> F<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.160> number<00:00:41.489> F<00:00:41.670> 1<00:00:41.910> point<00:00:42.149> 4

F 5 point 6 at point 9.0 and you know

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.569 
F 5 point 6 at point 9.0 and you know
anything<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.079> between<00:00:46.200> now<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> good<00:00:47.250> news<00:00:47.309> is

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
anything in between now the good news is

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.130 
anything in between now the good news is
about<00:00:47.789> aperture<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.719> really<00:00:48.870> don't<00:00:49.079> have

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
about aperture is you really don't have

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.020 
about aperture is you really don't have
to<00:00:49.230> worry<00:00:49.440> about<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:49.980> set<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.670> something

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
to worry about it just set it something

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.850 
to worry about it just set it something
in<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> middle<00:00:51.360> five<00:00:51.750> point<00:00:52.020> six<00:00:52.260> maybe<00:00:52.739> a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
in the middle five point six maybe a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.350 
in the middle five point six maybe a
little<00:00:53.010> bit<00:00:53.219> lower<00:00:53.430> if<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.670> want<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.969> let<00:00:54.149> get

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
little bit lower if you want to let get

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.090 
little bit lower if you want to let get
more<00:00:54.570> light<00:00:54.809> into<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.110> camera<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
more light into the camera but for the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.500 
more light into the camera but for the
most<00:00:56.250> part<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.610> really<00:00:56.879> don't<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.270> worry

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
most part you really don't have to worry

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.299 
most part you really don't have to worry
about<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.410> two<00:00:58.559> settings<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.129> do

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
about it the two settings that you do

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.529 
about it the two settings that you do
need<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.609> worry<00:00:59.789> about<00:00:59.910> when<00:01:00.180> you're<00:01:00.239> taking

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
need to worry about when you're taking

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.290 
need to worry about when you're taking
photos<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.140> called<00:01:01.590> ISO<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.370> shutter<00:01:02.399> speed

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
photos is called ISO and shutter speed

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.140 
photos is called ISO and shutter speed
so<00:01:03.570> let's<00:01:04.470> talk<00:01:04.559> about<00:01:04.619> ISO<00:01:05.070> real<00:01:05.280> fast<00:01:05.519> what

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
so let's talk about ISO real fast what

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.359 
so let's talk about ISO real fast what
is<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.450> well<00:01:06.869> basically<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.890> film

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
is it well basically it's film

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.630 
is it well basically it's film
sensitivity<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.360> light<00:01:09.530> now<00:01:10.530> granted<00:01:11.010> most

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
sensitivity to light now granted most

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.859 
sensitivity to light now granted most
cameras<00:01:12.030> these<00:01:12.210> days<00:01:12.420> are<00:01:12.570> all<00:01:12.630> digital

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
cameras these days are all digital

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.870 
cameras these days are all digital
they're<00:01:13.260> not<00:01:13.350> using<00:01:13.500> film<00:01:13.830> anymore<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.729> it's

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
they're not using film anymore but it's

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.520 
they're not using film anymore but it's
kind<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.210> carryover<00:01:15.720> from<00:01:16.020> when<00:01:16.200> they<00:01:16.320> were

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
kind of a carryover from when they were

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.929 
kind of a carryover from when they were
using<00:01:16.950> film<00:01:17.159> they<00:01:17.340> still<00:01:17.549> use<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> same

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
using film they still use the same

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.820 
using film they still use the same
terminology<00:01:18.360> because<00:01:18.869> basically<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
terminology because basically the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.200 
terminology because basically the
concepts<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> same<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.939> instead<00:01:21.150> of

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
concepts the same it's just instead of

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.749 
concepts the same it's just instead of
film<00:01:21.479> using<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.200> sensor<00:01:22.409> what's<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.460> mean<00:01:23.610> to

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
film using a sensor what's that mean to

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.300 
film using a sensor what's that mean to
you<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.350> means<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.950> higher

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you it means that if you have a higher

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.070 
you it means that if you have a higher
ISO<00:01:26.580> you're<00:01:27.390> gonna<00:01:27.509> let<00:01:27.720> more<00:01:27.869> light<00:01:27.900> in

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
ISO you're gonna let more light in

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.679 
ISO you're gonna let more light in
that's<00:01:28.979> really<00:01:29.130> all<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.369> means<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:30.570> you're

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
that's really all it means so if you're

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.240 
that's really all it means so if you're
in<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> darker<00:01:31.140> room<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.890> need<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.130> let

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
in a darker room and you need to let

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.590 
in a darker room and you need to let
more<00:01:32.430> light<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.640> without<00:01:33.000> using<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> flash

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
more light in without using the flash

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.929 
more light in without using the flash
and<00:01:34.439> you've<00:01:35.040> put<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.310> all<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> lights<00:01:35.759> that

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
and you've put in all the lights that

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.719 
and you've put in all the lights that
you<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:36.990> still<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.680> not<00:01:37.890> wide

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
you can but it's still just not wide

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.270 
you can but it's still just not wide
enough<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> camera<00:01:39.600> turn<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:40.560> your<00:01:40.680> ISO<00:01:41.040> is

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
enough in the camera turn up your ISO is

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.010 
enough in the camera turn up your ISO is
gonna<00:01:41.610> basically<00:01:42.150> make<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> shot<00:01:43.409> brighter

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
gonna basically make the shot brighter

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.039 
gonna basically make the shot brighter
now<00:01:46.020> you'll<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.470> here<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.860> these<00:01:46.979> examples

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
now you'll see here in these examples

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.260 
now you'll see here in these examples
got<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> couple<00:01:49.320> different<00:01:49.530> shots<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:50.340> for

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
got a couple different shots here for

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.300 
got a couple different shots here for
different<00:01:51.689> ISOs<00:01:53.390> ISO<00:01:54.390> settings<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.159> can

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
different ISOs ISO settings and you can

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.310 
different ISOs ISO settings and you can
see<00:01:56.490> basically<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> difference<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.750> how<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
see basically the difference in how the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.459 
see basically the difference in how the
photo<00:01:58.850> comes<00:01:59.850> out<00:02:00.090> depending<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.780> how<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.049> ISO

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
photo comes out depending on how the ISO

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.910 
photo comes out depending on how the ISO
setting<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:02.360> okay

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
setting is okay

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.440 
setting is okay
now<00:02:04.920> there<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.189> pitfall<00:02:05.759> with<00:02:05.909> ISO<00:02:06.270> that

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
now there is one pitfall with ISO that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.330 
now there is one pitfall with ISO that
you're<00:02:06.600> probably<00:02:06.899> going<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.290> fall<00:02:07.469> into<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
you're probably going to fall into the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.859 
you're probably going to fall into the
more<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.670> take<00:02:08.819> photos<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.360> that's<00:02:09.690> called

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
more you take photos and that's called

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.040 
more you take photos and that's called
noise<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:11.190> also<00:02:11.430> referred<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:11.879> grain

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
noise it's also referred to as grain

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.900 
noise it's also referred to as grain
okay<00:02:13.170> let<00:02:13.770> me<00:02:13.860> show<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.990> okay<00:02:15.990> so<00:02:16.610> you'll<00:02:17.610> see

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
okay let me show you okay so you'll see

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.200 
okay let me show you okay so you'll see
here<00:02:18.480> on<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:19.050> photo<00:02:19.490> let<00:02:20.490> me<00:02:20.580> zoom<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:21.030> real

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
here on this photo let me zoom in real

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.860 
here on this photo let me zoom in real
fast<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:23.550> see<00:02:23.760> all<00:02:23.910> this<00:02:24.030> greenness<00:02:24.660> right

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
fast you see all this greenness right

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.250 
fast you see all this greenness right
here

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
here

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.320 
here
that's<00:02:25.800> what's<00:02:26.070> referred<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.400> as<00:02:26.550> noise<00:02:26.940> and

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
that's what's referred to as noise and

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.650 
that's what's referred to as noise and
that's<00:02:27.780> caused<00:02:28.140> because<00:02:28.740> of<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.130> ISO<00:02:29.660> so

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
that's caused because of the ISO so

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.020 
that's caused because of the ISO so
there's<00:02:30.930> two<00:02:31.110> basic<00:02:31.770> ways<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:31.980> fix<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.550> you

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
there's two basic ways to fix that you

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.940 
there's two basic ways to fix that you
need<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.330> fix<00:02:33.570> that<00:02:33.780> before<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.650> take<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
need to fix that before you take the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.190 
need to fix that before you take the
shot<00:02:35.190> by<00:02:35.970> making<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.360> camera<00:02:36.600> settings<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
shot by making the camera settings the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.290 
shot by making the camera settings the
correct<00:02:37.470> way<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.770> they<00:02:37.860> need<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.040> be<00:02:38.280> or<00:02:38.850> you

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
correct way that they need to be or you

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.540 
correct way that they need to be or you
can<00:02:39.330> do<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:39.780> post<00:02:39.990> now<00:02:40.920> I'm<00:02:41.310> using

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
can do it in post now I'm using

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.070 
can do it in post now I'm using
Photoshop<00:02:41.820> here<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.570> don't<00:02:42.750> have<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.960> use

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
Photoshop here you don't have to use

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.210 
Photoshop here you don't have to use
Photoshop<00:02:43.560> there's<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.830> lot<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.070> other

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
Photoshop there's a lot of other

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.800 
Photoshop there's a lot of other
programs<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.910> can<00:02:45.030> use<00:02:45.210> a<00:02:45.240> lot<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.570> free

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
programs that you can use a lot of free

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.750 
programs that you can use a lot of free
programs<00:02:46.230> even<00:02:46.470> on<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:47.280> internet<00:02:47.610> and

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
programs even on the internet and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.940 
programs even on the internet and
whatnot<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.240> can<00:02:48.480> use<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.870> they<00:02:49.740> have

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
whatnot that you can use and they have

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.640 
whatnot that you can use and they have
what's<00:02:50.220> called<00:02:50.310> noise<00:02:50.940> reduction<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:52.380> if<00:02:52.530> you

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
what's called noise reduction so if you

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.850 
what's called noise reduction so if you
see<00:02:52.860> here<00:02:53.280> if<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.300> up<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.870> noise<00:02:55.050> reduction<00:02:55.320> did

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
see here if I up the noise reduction did

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.300 
see here if I up the noise reduction did
this<00:02:56.540> you'll<00:02:57.540> see<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.770> graininess<00:02:59.070> is

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
this you'll see that the graininess is

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.060 
this you'll see that the graininess is
gone<00:02:59.490> away<00:02:59.730> now<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.630> problem<00:03:00.990> with<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.140> it

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
gone away now the problem with that it

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.200 
gone away now the problem with that it
always<00:03:02.190> seems<00:03:02.400> like<00:03:02.520> there's<00:03:02.700> more<00:03:02.760> problems

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
always seems like there's more problems

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.600 
always seems like there's more problems
aren't<00:03:03.450> there<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:04.140> problem<00:03:04.410> with<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.610> is

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
aren't there the problem with that is

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.280 
aren't there the problem with that is
that<00:03:05.850> you'll<00:03:06.000> notice<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.690> does<00:03:06.960> take

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
that you'll notice that it does take

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.590 
that you'll notice that it does take
away<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.560> little<00:03:07.740> bit<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.160> detail<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:09.390> more

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
away a little bit of the detail the more

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.420 
away a little bit of the detail the more
noise<00:03:09.780> reduction<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.470> use<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:11.250> less

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
noise reduction that you use the less

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.540 
noise reduction that you use the less
detail<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:11.970> have<00:03:12.110> but<00:03:13.110> on<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.530> plus<00:03:13.710> side<00:03:13.770> all

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
detail you have but on the plus side all

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.640 
detail you have but on the plus side all
these<00:03:14.850> photos<00:03:15.270> when<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.750> put<00:03:15.900> them<00:03:15.990> into<00:03:16.110> MLS

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
these photos when you put them into MLS

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.470 
these photos when you put them into MLS
you're<00:03:17.160> not<00:03:17.310> gonna<00:03:17.459> have<00:03:17.670> them<00:03:17.790> quite<00:03:18.090> as<00:03:18.239> big

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
you're not gonna have them quite as big

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.240 
you're not gonna have them quite as big
as<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:18.840> they're<00:03:19.110> not<00:03:19.230> gonna<00:03:19.380> be<00:03:19.500> fullscreen

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
as this they're not gonna be fullscreen

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.449 
as this they're not gonna be fullscreen
photos<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.360> can<00:03:21.570> kind<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.830> flesh<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.130> just

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
photos so you can kind of flesh it just

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.490 
photos so you can kind of flesh it just
a<00:03:23.580> little<00:03:23.730> bit<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.180> can<00:03:24.420> kind<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.780> play<00:03:25.350> around

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
a little bit you can kind of play around

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.160 
a little bit you can kind of play around
with<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:26.040> numbers<00:03:26.220> there<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.820> see<00:03:27.330> where<00:03:27.570> the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
with the numbers there and see where the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.860 
with the numbers there and see where the
sweet<00:03:28.410> spot<00:03:28.739> is<00:03:28.980> but<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.090> better<00:03:30.300> thing<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.570> do

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
sweet spot is but the better thing to do

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.540 
sweet spot is but the better thing to do
is<00:03:31.050> to<00:03:31.200> actually<00:03:31.350> fix<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:31.950> while<00:03:32.370> you're

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
is to actually fix it while you're

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.340 
is to actually fix it while you're
taking<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.940> shot<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.780> way<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.930> do<00:03:34.140> that

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
taking the shot and the way to do that

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.370 
taking the shot and the way to do that
is<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:35.040> lower<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.340> ISO<00:03:35.700> just<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.060> tad<00:03:36.300> and<00:03:36.600> enter

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
is to lower the ISO just a tad and enter

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.960 
is to lower the ISO just a tad and enter
in<00:03:37.470> some<00:03:37.650> more<00:03:37.739> lights<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.550> other<00:03:38.580> thing<00:03:38.880> you

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
in some more lights the other thing you

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.570 
in some more lights the other thing you
can<00:03:39.120> do<00:03:39.300> is<00:03:39.590> apply<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.680> third<00:03:41.040> setting<00:03:41.430> which

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
can do is apply the third setting which

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.380 
can do is apply the third setting which
is<00:03:41.730> shutter<00:03:42.000> speed

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
is shutter speed

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.870 
is shutter speed
now<00:03:42.959> what<00:03:43.140> shutter<00:03:43.380> speed<00:03:43.680> basically<00:03:44.640> shutter

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
now what shutter speed basically shutter

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.210 
now what shutter speed basically shutter
speed<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.300> how<00:03:45.450> quickly<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.500> camera<00:03:46.860> takes<00:03:47.100> a

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
speed is how quickly the camera takes a

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.490 
speed is how quickly the camera takes a
shot<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:48.510> way<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.750> Sherriff<00:03:49.020> works<00:03:49.230> is

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
shot the way the Sherriff works is

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.830 
shot the way the Sherriff works is
basically<00:03:50.070> like<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.310> barn<00:03:50.640> door<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:51.090> opens<00:03:51.630> up

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
basically like a barn door it opens up

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.290 
basically like a barn door it opens up
you<00:03:52.410> got<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.590> sensor<00:03:52.950> back<00:03:53.070> here<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.700> opens<00:03:54.090> up

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
you got a sensor back here it opens up

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.350 
you got a sensor back here it opens up
lets<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.989> light<00:03:55.200> in<00:03:55.610> okay<00:03:56.610> and<00:03:56.850> then<00:03:57.270> the

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
lets the light in okay and then the

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.510 
lets the light in okay and then the
sensor<00:03:57.780> takes<00:03:58.050> whatever<00:03:58.350> light<00:03:59.070> is<00:03:59.100> coming

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
sensor takes whatever light is coming

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.040 
sensor takes whatever light is coming
through<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.730> lens<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.239> creates<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.840> photo

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
through the lens and creates a photo

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.979 
through the lens and creates a photo
with<00:04:01.260> it<00:04:01.410> in<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:02.160> most<00:04:02.370> basic<00:04:02.790> sense<00:04:02.989> shutter

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
with it in this most basic sense shutter

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.540 
with it in this most basic sense shutter
speed<00:04:04.260> refers<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.560> how<00:04:04.800> quickly<00:04:05.100> that<00:04:05.340> barn

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
speed refers to how quickly that barn

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.000 
speed refers to how quickly that barn
door<00:04:05.640> opens<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:06.209> closes<00:04:06.620> now<00:04:07.620> if<00:04:07.709> you've<00:04:07.830> got

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
door opens and closes now if you've got

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.770 
door opens and closes now if you've got
a<00:04:08.040> really<00:04:08.280> fast<00:04:08.700> shutter<00:04:09.030> speed<00:04:09.390> really

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
a really fast shutter speed really

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.960 
a really fast shutter speed really
really<00:04:10.080> fast<00:04:10.380> upwards<00:04:10.950> -<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.519> can<00:04:11.670> go<00:04:11.790> all<00:04:11.850> the

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
really fast upwards - you can go all the

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.699 
really fast upwards - you can go all the
way<00:04:12.000> up<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.180> 4,000<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:12.930> Beyond<00:04:13.230> on<00:04:13.530> some

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
way up to 4,000 and Beyond on some

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.620 
way up to 4,000 and Beyond on some
cameras<00:04:14.070> if<00:04:14.580> you've<00:04:14.730> got<00:04:14.910> it<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.150> fast<00:04:15.390> it's

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
cameras if you've got it that fast it's

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.180 
cameras if you've got it that fast it's
really<00:04:15.959> really<00:04:16.290> fast<00:04:16.530> this<00:04:16.799> is<00:04:16.919> four

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
really really fast this is four

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.090 
really really fast this is four
thousandth<00:04:17.640> of<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.940> second<00:04:18.299> basically<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.890> it's

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
thousandth of a second basically so it's

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.590 
thousandth of a second basically so it's
opening<00:04:20.430> up<00:04:20.549> really<00:04:20.820> fast<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:21.270> doesn't<00:04:21.479> have<00:04:21.570> a

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
opening up really fast it doesn't have a

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.060 
opening up really fast it doesn't have a
whole<00:04:21.780> lot<00:04:21.900> of<00:04:21.930> time<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.350> level<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.620> lot<00:04:22.800> light

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
whole lot of time to level a lot light

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.770 
whole lot of time to level a lot light
in<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:23.880> means<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.330> shot<00:04:24.570> is<00:04:24.690> going

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
in and that means that the shot is going

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.370 
in and that means that the shot is going
to<00:04:24.840> be<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.020> little

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
to be a little

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.490 
to be a little
darker<00:04:25.820> but<00:04:26.820> this<00:04:27.600> also<00:04:27.810> means<00:04:28.170> that<00:04:28.260> is<00:04:28.410> gonna

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
darker but this also means that is gonna

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.860 
darker but this also means that is gonna
be<00:04:28.680> very<00:04:28.920> very<00:04:29.070> crisp<00:04:29.520> because<00:04:30.090> a<00:04:30.300> palm<00:04:30.630> that

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
be very very crisp because a palm that

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.260 
be very very crisp because a palm that
you<00:04:30.960> can<00:04:31.110> run<00:04:31.290> into<00:04:31.470> a<00:04:31.620> shutter<00:04:31.980> speed<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:33.060> if

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
you can run into a shutter speed is if

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.060 
you can run into a shutter speed is if
the<00:04:33.390> shutter<00:04:33.600> speed<00:04:33.900> is<00:04:33.990> too<00:04:34.170> low<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.470> let<00:04:34.890> more

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
the shutter speed is too low to let more

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.470 
the shutter speed is too low to let more
light<00:04:35.100> in<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.670> thus<00:04:35.850> make<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.270> photo

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
light in and thus make the photo

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
light in and thus make the photo
brighter<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.970> can<00:04:39.150> be<00:04:39.270> blurry<00:04:39.540> I'll<00:04:40.200> show<00:04:40.410> you

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
brighter it can be blurry I'll show you

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.360 
brighter it can be blurry I'll show you
what<00:04:40.620> I<00:04:40.650> mean<00:04:41.510> this<00:04:42.510> shot<00:04:42.720> was<00:04:42.870> done<00:04:43.340> with<00:04:44.340> a

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
what I mean this shot was done with a

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.270 
what I mean this shot was done with a
lower<00:04:44.730> shutter<00:04:45.300> speed<00:04:45.650> and<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.770> was<00:04:46.860> also<00:04:47.040> on<00:04:47.160> a

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
lower shutter speed and it was also on a

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.640 
lower shutter speed and it was also on a
handheld<00:04:47.730> I<00:04:48.240> tried<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.960> remain<00:04:49.170> as<00:04:49.320> steady<00:04:49.530> as

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
handheld I tried to remain as steady as

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.380 
handheld I tried to remain as steady as
I<00:04:49.740> could<00:04:49.980> but<00:04:50.430> I<00:04:50.490> just<00:04:50.640> couldn't<00:04:51.000> get<00:04:51.090> quite

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
I could but I just couldn't get quite

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.080 
I could but I just couldn't get quite
get<00:04:51.600> it<00:04:51.720> near<00:04:52.530> where<00:04:52.560> I<00:04:52.710> needed<00:04:52.980> to<00:04:53.100> so<00:04:53.760> how<00:04:54.030> to

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
get it near where I needed to so how to

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.710 
get it near where I needed to so how to
fix<00:04:54.300> that

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
fix that
