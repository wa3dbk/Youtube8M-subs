00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:06.109
 Personally speaking this may look like a cart in Leandro Gobatto 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:11.789
 vanity 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.469
 on your swing 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.390
 These mistakes are called lack squats by the left midfielder and are suitable for 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.550
 addicted bricks 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.310
 here are the network settings 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.770
 The first fairy tale score is that a snowball with this base 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.960
 without doing anything that has two functions 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.960
 to load with the mouse and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.780
 already had the battery 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.780
 single and without losing 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.160
 of about 14 hours if direct play 8 72 hours for normal 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.820
 another point is that it is the series b 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.670
 to talk 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.670
 if it is in its normal operation of the film 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.000
 that is you 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.530
 with this posture is not cbf 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.530
 You can work with the goal. 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.290
 without this aid mainly to the solid result here 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.990
 No problem 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.990
 other small detail breast has seven buttons 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.840
 and all of them 'including apodi here all can be configured of possible 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.840
 crying attacks with the click that menu option 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.070
 these two buttons here side 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.700
 which unfortunately can only be used for this support to be 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.980
 used each 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.570
 I can be another one I will use 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.570
 you will lose the buttons are cooperative 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.850
 this is something that we continued 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.320
 for reservations until the resolution is scheduled 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.870
 of mouse 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.390
 and if we is that it reaches up to 5 thousand and 600 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.620
 deivison costa the thumb in Portuguese 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.500
 resolution 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.240
 to have an idea what normal is a mouse will drive at most 800 dpi 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.249
 Here are several types of credit and passwords 

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:00.890

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.070
