00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.489
 I want to like 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:39.510
 why play chop would be better than 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:44.040
 more fun for me here is the principle leave 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.380
 this notebook is in the description now we 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.090
 select the same code after 0x 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:54.640
 here he is copying everything 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.360
 we insert into our program replace vyv and 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:04.629
 click ok 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:13.819
 then save save and change 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:20.109

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:29.290
 close the notebook we do not need now 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:33.919
 need save editor further we click 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:39.830
 more precisely choose our replay to change to 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:44.180
 the file that we just changed everything 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:47.360
 we loaded we director again take 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.960
 and we see nobody now we have to 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.960
 choose 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:59.780
 michael as he was replaced further 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:02.800
 save the file we throw on the cat 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.720
 turn on our console street console 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:12.110
 dump on the console and you go on 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:14.780
 see throw off everything is inserted now we 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.270
 must run the lesson all these ghostly 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.260
 time appears shook frozen beat 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.660
 that is, we cannot do anything and 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.789
 such a small minus but basically you 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.250
 right we have to go now to the network 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:36.470
 any session at least by invitation even 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:38.750
 In general , we all load load so 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.750
 dude will come out here I loaded the connection 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:46.520
 taipan its now switch on 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:51.130
 Michael and what do we see there is need to 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:56.000
 it is necessary it is necessary it is necessary it is necessary chop spawn 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:58.490
 we play for chop principle we all have 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.090
 quit subscribe to the channel put 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.580
 huskies

 so chop can bite snatch pieces 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:11.060
 everyone will think that this is an ordinary michael 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:14.009
 but it will be chop study not to be more expensive 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:17.009
