00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.500
 but so says cake of mind 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.950
 inevitably opens a world of 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.950
 memories 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.300
 start by blowing the apples we divide them 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.399
 in slices we take away the core we have 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.199
 we remove small bits that 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.930
 we will let it rest with some juice 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.269
 lemon not to make them rings now 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.199
 beat the egg with the sugar until 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:44.680
 make it frothy add art e 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.420
 of the butter we melted earlier 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.500
 add half a packet of yeast a 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:55.780
 flour mix the powders well 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.780
 together and we begin to join the compound 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.119
 add the remaining milk until 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.930
 obtain a creamy and non-creamy consistency 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:04.930
 too liquid 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.650
 and at this point to perfume 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.050
 further our dough one 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.050
 beautiful grated lemon zest 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.020
 we poke the apples from the lemon juice 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.020
 and pour them directly into the dough 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.370
 we amalgamate everything and the over we are in 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.110
 a baking mold we have 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.110
 previously buttered and floured 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.810
 as we have seen the dough must not 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.270
 be excessively liquid in that 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.150
 the penalty during cooking will release the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:57.000
 his on who we are ready for the oven 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.320
 then 180 degrees for about 30 minutes 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.150
 after cooking time 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.530
 let it cool for about an hour 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.530
 before serving 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:17.120
 and here it is apple pie a 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.120
 classic between the three times
