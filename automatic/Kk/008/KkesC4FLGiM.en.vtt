00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:05.210
 photosynthesis is a process by which plants use the light of the 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.019
 sun water and carbon dioxide to obtain sugars and other 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.759
 energy-rich substances while releasing oxygen 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.329
 this process is carried out in two different phases 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:22.889
 in the clear phase lost and colitis of chloroplasts captures solar energy 

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:28.269
 and together with the absorbed water they transform it into chemical energy at &amp; t and 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.269
 reducing power has bird that h releasing oxygen 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.820
 in the dark phase of photosynthesis this chemical energy and power 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.000
 reducer come out of those who care for it and pass to the chloroplast stroma 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.040
 by a set of reactions known as Calvin cycle the 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.430
 carbon dioxide is fixed and converted into sugars amino acids and 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.190
 fatty acids that are the source of energy for the whole plant 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.399
 that is more important for life on earth the photos 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.189
 through this process 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.889
 the three emblematic points produce oxygen adjustment as well as carbohydrates 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.460
 essential lipids and proteins for life 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.110
 nozar so unfair with scientists can perform this function the appointment 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.110
 that have a green colored substance called 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.310
 no no 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.560
 this substance 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.029
 it is the only one that can transform the luminous energy hénin iaquinta 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.060
 chlorophyll is located in all parts of the body the best set 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.039
 equestrian 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.530
 specifically in another also the moles called I do not know them 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.430
 somehow the chloroplasts are responsible for the board in the 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.580
 ditch in the matter 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.270
 in these are roads in mind the complex laboratory that turned the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.270
 inorganic matter inda the junior klan 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.879
 so that photosynthesis can be carried out, the following are necessary 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.019
 raw Materials 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.449
