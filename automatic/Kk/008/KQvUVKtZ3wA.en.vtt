spent but but primarily on the trail it
can<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.110> done<00:00:46.320> at<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> pretty<00:00:47.430> affordable<00:00:48.800> price

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
can be done at a pretty affordable price

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.950

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
when you go into towns I found that

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.020 
when you go into towns I found that
essentially<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.620> majority<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.760> money

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
essentially the majority of the money

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.020 
essentially the majority of the money
that<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.750> spent<00:01:01.289> was<00:01:01.530> spent<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.039> towns<00:01:02.730> at

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that I spent was spent in towns at

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.820 
that I spent was spent in towns at
hotels<00:01:04.220> at<00:01:05.360> restaurants<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.560> mentioned

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
hotels at restaurants so I mentioned

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.410 
hotels at restaurants so I mentioned
this<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.250> couple<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.580> my<00:01:08.670> previous<00:01:09.119> videos

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
this in a couple of my previous videos

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.140 
this in a couple of my previous videos
but<00:01:09.450> those<00:01:10.409> those<00:01:11.159> different<00:01:11.610> areas<00:01:11.790> are

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
but those those different areas are

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.010 
but those those different areas are
where<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.810> really<00:01:13.650> spend<00:01:13.950> money<00:01:14.659> fast<00:01:15.659> if

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
where you can really spend money fast if

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.490 
where you can really spend money fast if
you're<00:01:16.140> not<00:01:16.200> careful<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:18.060> hotels<00:01:18.600> hostels

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
you're not careful so the hotels hostels

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.710 
you're not careful so the hotels hostels
even<00:01:20.100> hostels<00:01:20.640> they<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> lot<00:01:21.509> more

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
even hostels they get a lot more

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.749 
even hostels they get a lot more
expensive<00:01:21.960> once<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.439> get<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.220> further<00:01:23.460> north

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
expensive once you get the further north

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.550 
expensive once you get the further north
you<00:01:23.820> head<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.299> trail<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:25.080> really

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
you head on the trail so you can really

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.660 
you head on the trail so you can really
spend<00:01:25.770> some<00:01:25.890> money<00:01:26.159> there<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.460> you're<00:01:26.640> not

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
spend some money there if you're not

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.590 
spend some money there if you're not
careful<00:01:27.030> now

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
careful now

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.899 
careful now
I<00:01:27.630> definitely<00:01:28.590> met<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> lot<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.340> people<00:01:29.490> that

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
I definitely met a lot of people that

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.300 
I definitely met a lot of people that
were<00:01:30.030> out<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:31.200> we're<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:32.159> into

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
were out there that we're not going into

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.890 
were out there that we're not going into
towns<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.820> much<00:01:33.030> except<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:33.720> their

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
towns that much except to get their

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.080 
towns that much except to get their
resupply<00:01:34.439> boxes<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.159> leaving<00:01:35.579> if<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.820> want

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
resupply boxes and leaving if you want

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.050 
resupply boxes and leaving if you want
to<00:01:36.180> really<00:01:36.600> make<00:01:36.960> sure<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.790> do<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.939> as

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
to really make sure that you do it as

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.480 
to really make sure that you do it as
affordable<00:01:39.450> as<00:01:39.780> possible<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.409> would<00:01:40.860> recommend

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
affordable as possible I would recommend

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.380 
affordable as possible I would recommend
sending<00:01:42.180> drop<00:01:42.630> boxes<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.409> towns

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
sending drop boxes to the towns

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.240 
sending drop boxes to the towns
therefore<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:46.140> will<00:01:46.350> find<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.220> will

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
therefore you will find that you will

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.580 
therefore you will find that you will
not<00:01:47.520> be<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.299> spending<00:01:48.810> extra<00:01:49.470> money

kind of thing you were i really think

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.050 
kind of thing you were i really think
you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.009> for<00:02:11.280> less<00:02:11.400> than<00:02:11.520> 2,000

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
you can do it for less than 2,000

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.790 
you can do it for less than 2,000
probably<00:02:12.750> less<00:02:12.900> than<00:02:12.930> 1,500<00:02:13.590> i

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
probably less than 1,500 i

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.080 
probably less than 1,500 i
no<00:02:13.980> there<00:02:14.280> are<00:02:14.370> people<00:02:14.430> out<00:02:14.730> there<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.940> I

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
no there are people out there that I

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.400 
no there are people out there that I
personally<00:02:15.510> talked<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:15.990> have<00:02:16.110> done<00:02:16.290> it

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.200 
personally talked to that have done it
for<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.650> amount<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.040> it's<00:02:17.310> possible<00:02:17.520> I

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
for that amount so it's possible I

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.340 
for that amount so it's possible I
probably<00:02:19.050> spent<00:02:19.530> more<00:02:19.790> towards<00:02:20.960> around<00:02:21.960> three

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
probably spent more towards around three

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.580 
probably spent more towards around three
to<00:02:22.560> four<00:02:22.770> thousand<00:02:23.190> dollars<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> trail

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
actually probably more like four

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.460 
actually probably more like four
thousand<00:02:27.000> dollars<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.170> could<00:02:28.290> have<00:02:28.380> been

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
thousand dollars and it could have been

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.650 
thousand dollars and it could have been
a<00:02:28.500> lot<00:02:28.680> more<00:02:28.950> than<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.940> as<00:02:30.120> well<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.450> yeah
