00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:15.400
 show such a thing as lining on 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.510
 pedals yes they fly off differently by design 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:25.000
 here they are loaded 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:26.810
 blows I set before winter he even 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.369
 big frosts were 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.830
 these are the cheapest cost options 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:37.309
 whether 150 rubles tule 200 they are straight there 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.690
 tonics pomniki the most it is like 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.460
 such an option 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.219
 casting 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.890
 Chris bolts I was thinking how to attach 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:49.899

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.850
 would they have looked at you like that to the collective farm 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:56.050
 you didn't hold anything from me 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.550
 especially nothing and I just decided, as it were , 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.450
 fair 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.360
 building tape you called 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.460
 bilateral 5 happens here is how to get to 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.780
 black such 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.320
 two sides of us double-sided tape 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.010

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.860
 otkatal vive and everything is fine and 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:22.360
 I am happy mother went 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.360
 of course yes 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.909
 secured initially the industry for has 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.390
 help when you first press Khan moved 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.720
 than comfortable but I forgot how about the fact that 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.720
 my 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.720
 pedal analysis formed her 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.890
 Now how about these rezinochki 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.530
 little black yes they are shorter well, roughly speaking 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.320
 Here I have legs for the whole winter to the handle 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.900
 the valley 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.650
 did not slip from and how it used to 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.380
 in the winter 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.360
 you go in there shoes you won't clean the Inca 0 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.840
 points spanked so I personally 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.960
 fingers it with 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.450
 cleaned up then who else looked so paper 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.500
 buy it and it looks more or less like that 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.410
 and the price of the question applies it want 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.250
 worn out this topic then sell yes there for 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.430
 one and a half for 2000 can even be 5 for 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.069
 different car models your lining then we 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.200
 called 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:27.959
 i'm not there they will be fat ponies 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.700
 installation is not yet interested in the fact that I 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.420
 watched while out of the hole under their can 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.569
 to drill 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.180
 Well, this is not the option that up to 150 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.130
 rubles, it was put on tape 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.380
 double sided 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.290
 street calle paragraph for perform as 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.090
 can beauty there is sportiness there plus 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.950
 three horses of motifs adding distance 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.610
 some kind of fantasy and watch i am ganesh 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.310
 dirty but it seems 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.770
 coming from men and now it's spring 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.940
 but we just started the winter here 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:04.280
 so nato about ahirata probably about 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.959
 In terms of expensive linings, this is ours 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:12.890
 or they should be removed like to put on 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.170
 good how are you him drilled in the morning 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.280
 self-tapping pedal 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:23.560
 so they kept there I without knowing pushing 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:29.380
 tried yes oh I don't know that first 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.380
 uncomfortable very uncomfortable 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.650
 drill a pedal on the report 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.430
 will then important rum drill blew and 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.470
 and the photos looked up to the body to some 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.790
 the table to do is just not done is given 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:49.090
 road inspection course there is certainly no 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.970
 will allow the budget to go away are watching 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.520
 Of course it's karma that is, at least for 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.810
 Marusya Yes, I advise everyone who has 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:02.440
 problems are so simple appearance how to be 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.960
 car to give all the advice fly away 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.600
 put or under expensive things they too 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.590
 lining but there is no news and reinforcement 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.750
 how was all that they would be like both pedals 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.560
 unity the cons of these linings here nefig 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.470
 and type have thin metal ponies see 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.840
 time to pass will pass to mind not 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.840
 how can I believe that I bent them under 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:30.370
 pedal and because pedals 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.919
 they are so indirect and rounded 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.290
 the flow of the planetary is convenient what can 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.229
 bend it expensive pads yes say 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.860
 what you have to get used to here is expensive 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.680
 they are there 6 aluminum seems to be bent whine 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.500
 the phrase is kind of lost and 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.669
 The initial view will have to get used to because 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.669
 what's the system 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.670
 we have a scheme 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.670
 how would 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.780
 she is 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:07.580
 korosten she beat up so i'm talking about 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:10.069
 lining they give out they give you 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.020
 you will return them when they can direct 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:15.159
 will have to go to the eyes here are so straight 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.979
 site under this will have 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:20.660
 how to get used was different but 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:24.220
 just addictive 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:27.200
 describing and advise everyone so yes if you 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.890
 look on the internet if the material 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.380
 complete where what how convenient uncomfortable but 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:36.290
 the fact that you but we will not distort it I 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.790
 from thanks all I hope it 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.790
 the video was useful to someone
