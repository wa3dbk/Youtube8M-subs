00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.069
 in my good in all here I bring you a 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.139
 new video of which I am going to teach you 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.030
 something quite interesting that is a 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.340
 windows simulator is me in which 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.500
 we do not have to download anything 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.210
 absolutely nothing is simply a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.100
 web page that is created simply 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.960
 for that to simulate what is the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.730
 windows 8 for this let's go to the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.140
 description of the video and we will have a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.910
 link that is going to be this one here 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.160
 we just give people and we are 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.470
 the page that you see here will appear 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.480
 we open them and we see that we have the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.430
 start decision we give here for 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.040
 enter since it does not require any 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.380
 password and first of all I tell them that 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.310
 this windows phone or rather of this 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.810
 page 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.670
 It is made for all those people 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.130
 who want to try windows 8 or can not 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.370
 or also want to try it and it is not governed 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.230
 nothing to what it is to change or try it and 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.059
 so I invite you to look at this 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.579
 website since it is very very but very 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.649
 well gotten worth is exactly 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.739
 Like the windows, I'm telling you 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.510
 it really works and so let's go to what 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.240
 more expected than people want or 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.010
 we also do not see what the panel of 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.560
 control panel start 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.650
 let's go for example to this that would be 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.380
 the desktop we open computer and we see 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.910
 that we have things here, not if 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.230
 For example, we double-click on it 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.540
 to open for the simple fact that they are 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.460
 images and it's a web page no no either 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.160
 expect so much from a web page since 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.000
 that takes apart from the fact that they take a long time 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.690
 in what it is to appear also costs 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.210
 time and money and are images images 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.220
 I am full of images and others if it would be 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.229
 a mess no but good let's in the panel 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.020
 this since it is very, very, very good 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.870
 got seriously is exactly the same 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.430
 the panel is worth going to zetina now 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.920
 and we will see that we can change what is 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.050
 the background the vrac ground of what it is 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.440
 of this here and in the nor by 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.110
 example we can put to see 12 of 'news 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.600
 this way and fernando be good we are going to 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.090
 leave it like this we give here to remove it 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.869
 and for example let's open any 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.429
 thing for example photos the apps 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.050
 usually take a little while to load 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.690
 which is a web page do not wait anymore 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.700
 as I said before let's see any 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.700
 image in like for example this here 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.010
 we see this move as it is 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.730
 loading and demanded a better I remove it already 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.110
 that usually takes a little while 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.780
 this is already seen by us in your house 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.990
 quiet because in the video I need 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.990
 weather 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.000
 and then let's go for example to the 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.099
 YouTube application 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.340
 we hope that we will leave this here 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.910
 for example let's get to see 12 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.440
 years 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.970
 Well, there really are not going to be many 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.970
 videos or any video 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.420
 and neither will videos 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.070
 related to that but good is 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.980
 normal is such an application only for 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.930
 show what windows 8 is good 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.390
 let's go for example to the calculator 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.200
 and good that it gets better than between two 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.000
 the result is not true 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.060
 the scientist we can see that 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.500
 we have good if a little more advanced 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.120
 but practically the same as the 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.980
 basic or similar 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.719
 we no longer look at others calmly as 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.849
 I said before we also have here games 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:27.689
 like for example angry birds the fruit 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.280
 ninja and other games like this I'm like that 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.290
 I can not put it because it takes a long time 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.469
 in loading and then I would go very very slow 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.349
 everything and take too long is not ideal 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:39.150
 to make a video of this but good 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.160
 very for example here to youtube channel to 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.020
 watch 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.060
 and if the microsoft page does not appear 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.560
 good good 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.680
 microsoft not because my version does not have 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.570
 well which subscribers and account 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.020
 well let's go back because we see 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.020
 the rest 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.019
 and we have for example here music videos 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.849
 as if they were folders and that's why 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.150
 they look at us calmly 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.670
 since they have beautiful things and can see 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.610
 pretty good what is windows 8 well 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.230
 as if it were really windows 8 not 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.140
 they were seeing where things are and 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.140
 others since it is very well achieved 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.140
 here 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.139
 the truth is that I am very successful 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.300
 the 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.749
 well here I say goodbye I hope there 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.240
 liked this video and see you in the 

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:31.300
 next good I also have videos like 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.759
 download windows 8 and reviews and others and 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.960
 things like that on my channel so go and 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.960
 well, nothing here, see you
