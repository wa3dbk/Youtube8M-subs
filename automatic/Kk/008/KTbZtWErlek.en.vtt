00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.830 
this time I think I finally had my
character<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.059> point<00:00:09.269> where<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.510> wanted<00:00:09.750> to

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.680 
character to the point where I wanted to
be<00:00:09.929> as<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.530> said<00:00:10.860> yesterday<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.639> built<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.330> strike

be as I said yesterday I built a strike
skill<00:00:12.960> character<00:00:13.170> that's<00:00:13.530> based<00:00:13.769> around

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
skill character that's based around

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.180 
skill character that's based around
strike<00:00:14.250> attacks<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.849> switched<00:00:15.389> my<00:00:15.540> armor<00:00:15.839> from

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
strike attacks I switched my armor from

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.720 
strike attacks I switched my armor from
the<00:00:18.080> mirror<00:00:19.080> armor<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.830> back<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.340> cosmic

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the mirror armor to back the cosmic

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.070 
the mirror armor to back the cosmic
because<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:20.939> realized<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.449> mere<00:00:21.600> arm<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.930> had<00:00:22.050> a

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
because I realized the mere arm I had a

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.400 
because I realized the mere arm I had a
huge<00:00:22.590> huge<00:00:23.189> issue<00:00:23.730> with<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.600> know<00:00:24.660> losing

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
huge huge issue with you know losing

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.950 
huge huge issue with you know losing
health<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.859> stamina<00:00:26.119> and<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.510> think<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.930> time

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
health and stamina and I think this time

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.300 
health and stamina and I think this time
I'm<00:00:28.230> really<00:00:28.439> different<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.010> let's<00:00:29.160> see<00:00:29.220> what

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
I'm really different so let's see what

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.609 
I'm really different so let's see what
we<00:00:29.369> can<00:00:29.400> do<00:00:29.580> against<00:00:30.050> reprints<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.199> can't

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
we can do against reprints I can't

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.130 
we can do against reprints I can't
Verger<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.009> Rai<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.669> one<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:32.969> only<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.420> think

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
Verger to Rai the one and only I think

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.290 
Verger to Rai the one and only I think
is<00:00:34.350> probably<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.649> best<00:00:34.920> fighter<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:35.700> all<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
is probably the best fighter in all of

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.840 
is probably the best fighter in all of
the<00:00:37.170> xenoverse<00:00:37.770> lands<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.399> let's<00:00:38.550> see<00:00:38.700> if<00:00:38.790> we

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
the xenoverse lands so let's see if we

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.520 
the xenoverse lands so let's see if we
can<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.719> around<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.230> let's<00:00:40.350> try<00:00:40.469> to

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
can do this around it so let's try to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.030 
can do this around it so let's try to
hit<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.770> these<00:00:40.860> crash<00:00:41.489> whew<00:00:42.800> got<00:00:43.800> him<00:00:43.920> to
