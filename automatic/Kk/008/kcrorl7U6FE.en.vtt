because<00:01:47.220> they<00:01:47.340> call<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.640> one<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> saltwater

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
because they call this one a saltwater

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.090 
because they call this one a saltwater
edition<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.170> they've<00:01:49.380> done<00:01:49.590> some<00:01:49.799> things<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
edition so they've done some things to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.590 
edition so they've done some things to
protect<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> from<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> environment<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.540> you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
protect it from the environment so you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.880 
protect it from the environment so you
can<00:01:51.899> use<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.259> boat<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> saltwater

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
can use this boat in a saltwater

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.590 
can use this boat in a saltwater
environment<00:01:53.490> Dave<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.060> know<00:01:54.180> we've<00:01:54.360> called

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
environment Dave you know we've called

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.359 
environment Dave you know we've called
this<00:01:54.720> thing<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:55.020> pontoon<00:01:55.470> boat<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.159> name

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
this thing a pontoon boat just the name

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.950 
this thing a pontoon boat just the name
that<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.640> always<00:01:56.820> think<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.329> these<00:01:57.570> it's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
that you always think of these it's

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.410 
that you always think of these it's
actually<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> try<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.790> well<00:01:59.790> yeah<00:02:00.119> you're<00:02:00.299> right

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
actually a try to well yeah you're right

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.850 
actually a try to well yeah you're right
it<00:02:00.600> does<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.899> another<00:02:01.079> pontoon<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.560> runs

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
it does have another pontoon that runs

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.560 
it does have another pontoon that runs
right<00:02:02.040> down<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.399> center<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.850> boat<00:02:03.030> that's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
right down the center of the boat that's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.149 
right down the center of the boat that's
gonna<00:02:03.780> give<00:02:03.990> us<00:02:04.020> more<00:02:04.350> displacement<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.070> we

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
gonna give us more displacement so we

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.399 
gonna give us more displacement so we
can<00:02:05.280> support<00:02:05.579> more<00:02:05.820> way<00:02:05.969> displace<00:02:06.450> it

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
can support more way displace it

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.680 
can support more way displace it
a I'm<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.399> fisherman<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.149> don't<00:02:09.390> know<00:02:09.509> what<00:02:09.660> a

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
a I'm a fisherman I don't know what a

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.690 
a I'm a fisherman I don't know what a
pontoon<00:02:10.170> boat<00:02:10.410> displaces<00:02:10.739> what<00:02:11.430> does<00:02:11.550> that

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
pontoon boat displaces what does that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.430 
pontoon boat displaces what does that
mean<00:02:11.879> well<00:02:12.090> all<00:02:12.269> votes<00:02:12.599> they<00:02:12.900> float<00:02:13.170> by

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
mean well all votes they float by

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.140 
mean well all votes they float by
displacement<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.430> it's<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.670> real<00:02:14.819> simple

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
displacement and it's a real simple

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.640 
displacement and it's a real simple
thing<00:02:15.330> for<00:02:15.360> every<00:02:15.780> pound<00:02:16.019> of<00:02:16.230> water<00:02:16.470> you

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
thing for every pound of water you

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.740 
thing for every pound of water you
displace<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:17.370> can<00:02:17.519> support<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.180> pound<00:02:18.599> of

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
displace you can support a pound of

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.570 
displace you can support a pound of
weight<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.650> if<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:19.830> take<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.129> volume<00:02:20.340> of

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
weight so if you take the volume of

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.100 
weight so if you take the volume of
water<00:02:20.760> your<00:02:21.030> weigh<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.540> displace<00:02:21.900> that

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
water your weigh it and displace that

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.570 
water your weigh it and displace that
much<00:02:22.319> weight<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.830> can<00:02:22.950> support<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.340> much

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
much weight you can support that much

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.729 
much weight you can support that much
weight<00:02:23.819> this<00:02:24.299> boat<00:02:24.569> can<00:02:24.750> carry<00:02:25.019> ten<00:02:25.500> maybe

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
weight this boat can carry ten maybe

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.770 
weight this boat can carry ten maybe
fifteen<00:02:26.220> people<00:02:26.670> plus<00:02:26.879> dive<00:02:27.180> gear<00:02:27.450> you've<00:02:27.629> got

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
fifteen people plus dive gear you've got
