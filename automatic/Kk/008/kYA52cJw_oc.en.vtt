00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.489

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.970

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.130

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.220
 it's called the pyramid I'm back in 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.660

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.330
 jobs and duties that I have to do 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.250
 but before, it occurred to me that I was going to open 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.610
 my chocolate calendar for 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.860
 show them 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.450
 I think I missed opening yesterday and 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.700
 today so I 'm going to open two days 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.700
 and we talk about the calendar this is the 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.270
 calendar and I love these calendars 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:29.660
 I always try to have one and have 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.360
 let's look for the day although I do not even know 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.850
 that I saw being or 1616 because today begins 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:41.860
 the ninth let me know if you also 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:43.990
 I pray the ninth but very 1616 and here it is 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.250
 here 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.250
 and now like this 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.510
 and he 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:59.170
 and colate ok I think I can not get it out 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.000
 with one hand but I think that also 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:09.220
 I would have to open 15 so I'm going to 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:13.230
 search 15 15 what is this 112 5 ok 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.610
 this is more difficult here is fine 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.080
 we just prayed the ninth and wanted 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.240
 show them from the tree because you already have a 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.550
 little bit more gifts and looks super 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.250
 pretty so he's going to show us there is 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:29.160
 the tree and already has more gifts so 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.160
 It looks more like full and prettier 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.689
 and none of those gifts from bach is 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:38.599
 for us but 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:41.149
 It looks nice and the gifts are 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.769
 beautifully packed the same as I am 

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:44.179
 editing the video to put it right now 

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:46.159

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:47.839
 so I wanted to tell you guys 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:51.729
