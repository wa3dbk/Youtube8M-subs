I thought we got over that but it's

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.569 
I thought we got over that but it's
obviously<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.290> haven't<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> last<00:01:47.460> few

Radamel<00:02:35.190> Falcao<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.970> then<00:02:36.300> we<00:02:36.390> lost<00:02:36.570> someone

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
Radamel Falcao and then we lost someone

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.150 
Radamel Falcao and then we lost someone
who<00:02:36.960> could<00:02:37.110> hold<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.410> ball<00:02:37.590> with<00:02:37.740> his<00:02:37.770> back<00:02:38.010> to

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160

it's<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.350> bit<00:02:40.500> frustrating<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:41.370> think<00:02:42.120> we<00:02:42.180> just

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
it's a bit frustrating I think we just

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.520 
it's a bit frustrating I think we just
need<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.570> get<00:02:42.660> all<00:02:42.840> our<00:02:42.870> players<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.500> fit
