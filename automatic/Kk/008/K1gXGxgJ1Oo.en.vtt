Lego<00:00:08.370> like<00:00:08.670> bricks<00:00:09.120> these<00:00:09.750> were<00:00:09.900> made<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.170> the

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
Lego like bricks these were made in the

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.070 
Lego like bricks these were made in the
1930s<00:00:10.590> in<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.130> UK<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:11.940> they're<00:00:12.120> called<00:00:12.509> many

bricks<00:00:13.500> they<00:00:14.250> were<00:00:14.309> all<00:00:14.610> rubber<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.330> complete

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
bricks they were all rubber the complete

building system in miniature and here

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.090 
building system in miniature and here
are<00:00:18.359> some<00:00:18.510> kids<00:00:18.720> building<00:00:19.260> them<00:00:19.439> hey<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.920> looks

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
are some kids building them hey it looks

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.500 
are some kids building them hey it looks
quite<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> lot<00:00:20.550> like<00:00:20.730> Legos<00:00:21.090> there<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
quite a lot like Legos there in the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.410 
quite a lot like Legos there in the
picture<00:00:21.720> yeah<00:00:22.470> but<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:22.859> not<00:00:23.100> quite<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:24.150> not

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
picture yeah but it's not quite it's not

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.420 
picture yeah but it's not quite it's not
quite<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.529> what<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.830> bricks<00:00:26.070> look<00:00:26.250> like

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
quite this is what the bricks look like

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.120 
quite this is what the bricks look like
and<00:00:26.670> they<00:00:26.820> were<00:00:26.880> made<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.300> all<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.900> rubber<00:00:28.380> one

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
and they were made of all a rubber one

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.460 
and they were made of all a rubber one
of<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.279> problems<00:00:29.609> with<00:00:29.670> all<00:00:29.910> rubber<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.470> over

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
of the problems with all rubber is over

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.770 
of the problems with all rubber is over
time<00:00:31.679> they've<00:00:31.830> turned<00:00:32.009> into<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.430> rocks<00:00:32.910> and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
time they've turned into like rocks and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.840 
time they've turned into like rocks and
if<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.050> look<00:00:34.230> at<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> top<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> studs<00:00:35.399> you

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
if you look at the top of the studs you

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.160 
if you look at the top of the studs you
can<00:00:36.059> see<00:00:36.210> they're<00:00:36.360> more<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.630> doorknob

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
can see they're more like doorknob

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.619 
can see they're more like doorknob
shapes<00:00:37.500> because<00:00:38.430> they<00:00:38.550> were<00:00:38.700> rubber<00:00:39.030> they

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
shapes because they were rubber they

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.450 
shapes because they were rubber they
were<00:00:39.690> soft<00:00:40.170> rubber<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.829> they<00:00:40.920> were<00:00:40.980> intended

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
were soft rubber and they were intended

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.560 
were soft rubber and they were intended
to<00:00:41.550> snap<00:00:41.910> together

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
to snap together

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.940 
to snap together
of<00:00:42.870> course<00:00:43.200> now<00:00:43.320> after<00:00:43.620> all<00:00:43.739> these<00:00:43.890> years

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
of course now after all these years

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.590 
of course now after all these years
they're<00:00:44.460> hard<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> rock<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.120> they<00:00:45.450> don't

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
they're hard as a rock and they don't

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.779 
they're hard as a rock and they don't
snap<00:00:45.870> or<00:00:46.110> unsnap<00:00:46.680> anymore<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.610> they<00:00:47.730> were

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
snap or unsnap anymore so if they were

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.979 
snap or unsnap anymore so if they were
put<00:00:47.969> together<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.539> box

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
put together in the box

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.330 
put together in the box
they're<00:00:49.140> staying<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.860> forever<00:00:50.100> unless

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
they're staying like that forever unless

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.220 
they're staying like that forever unless
you<00:00:50.520> bust<00:00:50.760> them<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.969> get<00:00:51.090> them<00:00:51.180> apart<00:00:51.270> now

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
you bust them to get them apart now

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
you bust them to get them apart now
unlike<00:00:52.620> Lego<00:00:53.010> building<00:00:53.550> bricks<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.180> method

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
unlike Lego building bricks the method

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.209 
unlike Lego building bricks the method
of<00:00:54.510> construction<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:55.110> different<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.949> build

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
of construction is different you build

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.689 
of construction is different you build
them<00:00:56.399> upside<00:00:57.149> down<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.649> had<00:00:58.829> baseplate

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
them upside down and you had baseplate

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.479 
them upside down and you had baseplate
that<00:01:00.329> were<00:01:00.449> actually<00:01:00.899> cardboard<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.370> were

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that were actually cardboard that were

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.700 
that were actually cardboard that were
elevated<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.449> cardboard<00:01:03.960> strips<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.530> bring

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
elevated with cardboard strips to bring

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.789 
elevated with cardboard strips to bring
them<00:01:04.860> off<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.339> table<00:01:05.790> edge<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:07.229> built

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
them off the table edge and you built

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.340 
them off the table edge and you built
them<00:01:07.950> upside<00:01:08.520> down<00:01:08.810> which<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.960> don't<00:01:10.020> think<00:01:10.260> was

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
them upside down which I don't think was

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.500 
them upside down which I don't think was
a<00:01:10.380> very<00:01:10.470> good<00:01:10.650> pattern<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.490> use<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.390> that's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
a very good pattern to use but that's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.660 
a very good pattern to use but that's
how<00:01:12.720> they<00:01:12.869> designed<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:14.250> course<00:01:14.280> they

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
how they designed it and of course they

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.910 
how they designed it and of course they
say<00:01:14.880> mini<00:01:15.479> bricks<00:01:15.810> base<00:01:16.080> plates<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.740> best

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
say mini bricks base plates the best

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.830 
say mini bricks base plates the best
foundation<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.670> building<00:01:17.790> lifelike<00:01:18.360> models

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
foundation for building lifelike models

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.170 
foundation for building lifelike models
they<00:01:19.470> literally<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.070> crumbled<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.119> fell

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
they literally just crumbled and fell

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.090 
they literally just crumbled and fell
apart<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.900> quality<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.439> cardboard<00:01:22.799> was

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
apart the quality of the cardboard was

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.370 
apart the quality of the cardboard was
so<00:01:23.280> poor<00:01:23.640> they<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.259> disintegrated<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
so poor they just like disintegrated and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.530 
so poor they just like disintegrated and
so<00:01:26.130> did<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> windows<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.820> doors<00:01:27.000> which<00:01:27.390> were

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
so did the windows and doors which were

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.480 
so did the windows and doors which were
just<00:01:27.689> cardboard<00:01:28.049> components<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.070> fit<00:01:29.310> into

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
just cardboard components that fit into

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.420 
just cardboard components that fit into
the<00:01:29.759> little<00:01:30.390> tiny<00:01:30.689> holes<00:01:31.170> now<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.189> didn't

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the little tiny holes now if you didn't

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.219 
the little tiny holes now if you didn't
have<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> baseplate<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
have a baseplate like this the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.050 
have a baseplate like this the
foundation<00:01:34.829> pieces<00:01:35.070> had<00:01:35.400> holes<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.850> each<00:01:36.030> side

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
foundation pieces had holes on each side

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.510 
foundation pieces had holes on each side
so<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.020> lay<00:01:37.200> down<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.409> foundation<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:38.220> that

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
so you lay down a foundation like that

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.340 
so you lay down a foundation like that
and<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.880> would<00:01:39.000> take<00:01:39.150> your<00:01:39.360> pieces<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.990> snap

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
and you would take your pieces and snap
