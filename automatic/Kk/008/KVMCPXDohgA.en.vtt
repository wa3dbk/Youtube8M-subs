these are the common stone flies and

these are the common stone flies and
they're<00:01:22.569> a<00:01:22.810> large<00:01:23.289> predator<00:01:23.740> so<00:01:24.189> they<00:01:24.310> eat

they're a large predator so they eat

other aquatic insects and they tend to

other aquatic insects and they tend to
be<00:01:28.359> one<00:01:28.899> of<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.049> more<00:01:29.229> common<00:01:29.619> stone<00:01:29.890> flies

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.399 
be one of the more common stone flies
that<00:01:30.369> you'll<00:01:30.490> find<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:32.049> they<00:01:32.140> are<00:01:32.259> very

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
that you'll find but they are very

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.639 
that you'll find but they are very
sensitive<00:01:33.069> to<00:01:33.340> pollution<00:01:34.030> so<00:01:34.719> having<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.499> lot

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
sensitive to pollution so having a lot

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.169 
sensitive to pollution so having a lot
of<00:01:35.740> these<00:01:35.859> guys<00:01:36.069> means<00:01:36.700> that<00:01:36.939> you<00:01:37.030> probably

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
of these guys means that you probably

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.260 
of these guys means that you probably
have<00:01:37.479> pretty<00:01:37.630> good<00:01:37.780> water<00:01:37.960> quality<00:01:38.999> um<00:01:39.999> we

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
have pretty good water quality um we

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.389 
have pretty good water quality um we
collect<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.749> whole<00:01:40.869> sample<00:01:41.170> so<00:01:41.679> all<00:01:41.979> of<00:01:42.219> the

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
collect the whole sample so all of the

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.480 
collect the whole sample so all of the
leaves<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.119> rocks<00:01:43.359> and<00:01:43.719> things<00:01:43.869> that<00:01:44.109> are<00:01:44.490> in

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.550 
the net we will put those into a bucket
and<00:01:49.149> then<00:01:49.270> run<00:01:49.479> that<00:01:49.509> through<00:01:49.869> a<00:01:49.929> sieve<00:01:50.259> and

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
and then run that through a sieve and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.719 
and then run that through a sieve and
then<00:01:51.600> all<00:01:52.600> that<00:01:52.869> material<00:01:53.560> is<00:01:54.159> then<00:01:54.369> put<00:01:54.700> into

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
then all that material is then put into

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.050 
then all that material is then put into
a<00:01:54.999> jar<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.299> will<00:01:55.569> take<00:01:55.719> back<00:01:55.929> to<00:01:56.109> the<00:01:56.200> lab
