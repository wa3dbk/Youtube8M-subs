cut down trees camera that I'm using
right<00:00:53.190> now<00:00:53.390> doesn't<00:00:54.390> work<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.170> well<00:00:56.270> but<00:00:57.270> you

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
right now doesn't work that well but you

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.349 
right now doesn't work that well but you
can<00:00:57.660> get<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> very<00:00:58.260> good<00:00:58.489> downward<00:00:59.489> force<00:01:00.030> and

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
can get a very good downward force and

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.139 
can get a very good downward force and
whack<00:01:00.899> into<00:01:01.199> something<00:01:01.559> big<00:01:01.770> with<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.030> like<00:01:03.030> I

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
whack into something big with it like I

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.130 
whack into something big with it like I
said<00:01:03.390> I've<00:01:03.510> cut<00:01:03.719> down<00:01:03.750> trees<00:01:05.450> the<00:01:06.450> blade

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.149 
said I've cut down trees the blade
I<00:01:07.170> used<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:10.070> probably<00:01:11.360> last<00:01:12.360> summer<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.869> think

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
I used this probably last summer I think

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.679 
I used this probably last summer I think
me<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.280> Mac<00:01:14.460> had<00:01:14.700> at<00:01:14.850> our<00:01:14.939> camp<00:01:16.070> I<00:01:17.570> beat<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
me and Mac had at our camp I beat the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.560 
me and Mac had at our camp I beat the
heck<00:01:18.960> out<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:20.520> started<00:01:21.270> throwing

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
heck out of it and we started throwing

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.920 
heck out of it and we started throwing
it<00:01:22.350> some<00:01:22.799> trees<00:01:23.299> which<00:01:24.299> probably<00:01:24.540> wasn't<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
it some trees which probably wasn't a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.010 
it some trees which probably wasn't a
good<00:01:24.960> idea<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.070> kind<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.369> knife<00:01:26.549> but<00:01:27.020> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
good idea for this kind of knife but the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.469 
good idea for this kind of knife but the
blade<00:01:28.290> got<00:01:28.560> kind<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.860> beat<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.159> doing<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.909> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
blade got kind of beat up doing that and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.289 
blade got kind of beat up doing that and
since<00:01:30.840> its<00:01:30.990> 440c<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.130> had<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> pretty<00:01:32.880> hard<00:01:33.180> time

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
since its 440c I had a pretty hard time

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.980 
since its 440c I had a pretty hard time
getting<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.810> good<00:01:34.020> edge<00:01:34.290> back<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.810> did<00:01:36.810> get

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
getting a good edge back on it I did get

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.330 
getting a good edge back on it I did get
a<00:01:37.049> good<00:01:37.259> edge<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:37.979> they're<00:01:38.130> still

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
a good edge on it but they're still

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.530 
a good edge on it but they're still
chunks<00:01:38.790> missing<00:01:40.189> but<00:01:41.189> overall<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
chunks missing but overall this is a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.990 
chunks missing but overall this is a
pretty<00:01:42.780> good<00:01:42.990> knife<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> fire<00:01:44.430> starter

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
pretty good knife I have a fire starter

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.380 
pretty good knife I have a fire starter
that<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.540> usually<00:01:45.720> use<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:47.240> start<00:01:48.240> our

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that I usually use to start our

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.319 
that I usually use to start our
campfires<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.520> back<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:50.970> thing<00:01:51.210> you

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
campfires and the back of this thing you

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.020 
campfires and the back of this thing you
can<00:01:51.450> tell<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.110> hear<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:52.850> it's<00:01:53.850> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
can tell if you can hear that but it's a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.080 
can tell if you can hear that but it's a
straight<00:01:54.630> edge<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.350> great<00:01:55.680> for<00:01:56.090> using

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
straight edge and it's great for using

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.800 
straight edge and it's great for using
the<00:01:57.149> striker<00:01:58.700> like<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.850> said<00:02:00.090> out<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.509> box

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
the striker like I said out of the box

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.170 
the striker like I said out of the box
this<00:02:01.079> thing<00:02:01.320> was<00:02:01.439> pretty<00:02:01.799> sharp<00:02:02.869> I<00:02:05.090> want<00:02:06.090> to

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
this thing was pretty sharp I want to

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.850 
this thing was pretty sharp I want to
say<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.750> was<00:02:06.930> about<00:02:08.810> twenty-five<00:02:09.860> dollars

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
say it was about twenty-five dollars

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.000 
say it was about twenty-five dollars

again and again started to come loose

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.840 
again and again started to come loose
and<00:02:37.230> now<00:02:37.440> it'll<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.010> slide<00:02:38.580> out

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
and now it'll just slide out

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.780

once it's in once it's in and snap shut

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.610 
once it's in once it's in and snap shut
it's<00:03:11.040> not<00:03:11.250> coming<00:03:11.520> out<00:03:11.900> like<00:03:12.900> no<00:03:13.230> way<00:03:13.410> it's

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
it's not coming out like no way it's

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.229 
it's not coming out like no way it's
coming<00:03:13.830> out<00:03:14.300> belt<00:03:15.300> loop<00:03:15.480> it's<00:03:16.320> pretty<00:03:16.560> big<00:03:16.770> so

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
coming out belt loop it's pretty big so

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.790 
coming out belt loop it's pretty big so
that's<00:03:18.239> nice<00:03:18.650> but<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:20.870> rough<00:03:21.870> getting<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.650> out

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
that's nice but it rough getting it out

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.040 
that's nice but it rough getting it out
especially<00:03:23.010> when<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.550> first<00:03:23.760> buy<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.959> I

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
especially when you first buy it and I

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:32.030 
especially when you first buy it and I
doubt<00:03:25.620> you'll<00:03:25.860> be<00:03:25.890> able<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.310> see<00:03:26.550> this<00:03:30.980> but<00:03:31.980> I

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
doubt you'll be able to see this but I

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.610 
doubt you'll be able to see this but I
sliced<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.450> knob<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.750> can<00:03:33.870> see<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.350> I

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
sliced the knob you can see that I

piece<00:03:37.440> inside<00:03:38.070> of<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.450> but<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.600> way<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.930> tapers

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
piece inside of it but the way it tapers

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.259 
piece inside of it but the way it tapers
down<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.900> big<00:03:43.170> part<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.680> knife<00:03:44.269> sliced

down the big part of the knife sliced
through<00:03:45.630> that<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.470> I've<00:03:46.590> messed<00:03:46.800> up<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.130> whole

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
through that so I've messed up the whole
