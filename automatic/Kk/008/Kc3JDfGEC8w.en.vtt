00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760

wants<00:02:45.150> him<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.450> feel<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.870> think<00:02:46.080> they've<00:02:46.260> been<00:02:46.290> a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560

bit perturbed with his criticisms of the
team<00:02:49.350> over<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.770> last<00:02:49.920> couple<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.370> months<00:02:50.550> and

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
team over the last couple of months and

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.440 
team over the last couple of months and
his<00:02:51.480> flirtation<00:02:52.050> with<00:02:52.760> red<00:02:53.760> ball<00:02:53.970> over<00:02:54.300> their

vacant and seat next to Sebastian Vettel

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.750 
vacant and seat next to Sebastian Vettel
I<00:02:57.720> think<00:02:57.959> was<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.170> final<00:02:58.590> straw<00:02:58.800> for<00:02:59.130> Luca<00:02:59.459> di

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
I think was the final straw for Luca di

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.210 
I think was the final straw for Luca di
Montezemolo<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.260> think<00:03:01.800> they've<00:03:01.920> put<00:03:02.130> him

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
Montezemolo so I think they've put him

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.590 
Montezemolo so I think they've put him
in<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.370> place<00:03:02.580> now<00:03:02.790> where<00:03:02.820> they've<00:03:03.090> said<00:03:03.300> okay

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
in a place now where they've said okay

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.930 
in a place now where they've said okay
it's<00:03:03.810> harder<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.320> complain<00:03:04.709> about<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.700> team

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
it's harder to complain about the team

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.240 
it's harder to complain about the team
if<00:03:06.180> your<00:03:06.330> teammate<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:07.110> performing<00:03:07.920> better

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
if your teammate is performing better

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.010 
if your teammate is performing better
than<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.060> same<00:03:09.270> car<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.840> big

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
than you in the same car the big

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.680 
than you in the same car the big
challenge<00:03:10.560> for<00:03:10.800> them<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.209> really<00:03:12.209> managing

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
challenge for them is really managing

those egos because Alonso together with

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.570 
those egos because Alonso together with
Hamilton<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.840> McLaren<00:03:16.680> was<00:03:16.860> an<00:03:17.010> absolute

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
Hamilton and McLaren was an absolute

disaster absolutely right now the
expectations<00:03:20.580> of<00:03:20.730> Ferrari<00:03:21.090> are<00:03:21.750> just<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:22.440> high

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
expectations of Ferrari are just so high

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.530

on<00:03:22.890> their<00:03:23.130> year-on-year<00:03:23.580> it's<00:03:24.180> been<00:03:24.360> so

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
on their year-on-year it's been so

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.449 
on their year-on-year it's been so
frustrating<00:03:24.720> for<00:03:25.380> them<00:03:25.530> really<00:03:26.100> for<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.430> last

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
frustrating for them really for the last

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.640 
frustrating for them really for the last
five<00:03:26.820> or<00:03:26.850> six<00:03:27.150> season<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:27.630> is<00:03:27.870> this<00:03:28.080> going<00:03:28.560> to

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
five or six season so is this going to

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.520 
five or six season so is this going to
be<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.860> answer<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.250> their<00:03:29.400> problems<00:03:30.470> well<00:03:31.470> I

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
be the answer to their problems well I

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.220 
be the answer to their problems well I
think<00:03:31.590> what<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:31.920> can<00:03:32.160> say<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:32.760> Kimi<00:03:33.330> knows<00:03:33.900> how

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
think what you can say is Kimi knows how

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.280 
think what you can say is Kimi knows how
to<00:03:34.290> win<00:03:34.680> where<00:03:35.040> arguably<00:03:35.519> Massa<00:03:36.480> didn't<00:03:37.050> so

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
to win where arguably Massa didn't so

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.610 
to win where arguably Massa didn't so
much<00:03:37.530> he<00:03:37.800> is<00:03:37.950> consistency<00:03:39.320> personified<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.560> I

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
much he is consistency personified and I

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.710 
much he is consistency personified and I
think<00:03:40.890> if<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.580> race<00:03:41.760> in<00:03:41.970> Singapore<00:03:42.480> goes

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
think if the race in Singapore goes

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.160 
think if the race in Singapore goes
badly<00:03:43.080> for<00:03:43.590> Ferrari<00:03:43.950> they<00:03:44.340> may<00:03:44.820> opt<00:03:45.180> to

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
badly for Ferrari they may opt to

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.600 
badly for Ferrari they may opt to

faster<00:03:54.299> car<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.900> think<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.040> Fossey<00:03:56.459> may<00:03:56.820> be

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
faster car I think that a Fossey may be

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.699 
faster car I think that a Fossey may be
feeling<00:03:57.269> that<00:03:57.540> next<00:03:57.870> year<00:03:58.019> could<00:03:58.320> be<00:03:58.500> their

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
feeling that next year could be their

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.080 
feeling that next year could be their
year<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.190> rightly<00:03:59.790> so

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
year and rightly so

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.870 
year and rightly so
and<00:04:00.600> after<00:04:01.440> eight<00:04:01.590> years<00:04:01.620> Felipe<00:04:02.310> Massa<00:04:02.459> is

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
and after eight years Felipe Massa is

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.030 
and after eight years Felipe Massa is
now<00:04:03.360> leaving<00:04:03.600> Maranello<00:04:04.290> how<00:04:04.470> is<00:04:04.530> he<00:04:04.739> going<00:04:04.950> to

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
now leaving Maranello how is he going to

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.030 
now leaving Maranello how is he going to
be<00:04:05.130> remembered<00:04:05.580> do<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:05.760> think<00:04:06.739> well<00:04:07.739> I<00:04:07.769> think

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
be remembered do you think well I think

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.880 
be remembered do you think well I think
he<00:04:08.640> came<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:09.090> close<00:04:09.269> didn't<00:04:09.660> he<00:04:09.720> in<00:04:09.810> 2008<00:04:10.680> he

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
he came so close didn't he in 2008 he

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.920 
he came so close didn't he in 2008 he
missed<00:04:11.160> out<00:04:11.370> on<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.640> world<00:04:12.000> title<00:04:12.239> by<00:04:12.660> just

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
missed out on that world title by just

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.890 
missed out on that world title by just
one<00:04:13.170> point<00:04:13.470> -<00:04:13.680> Lewis<00:04:13.950> Hamilton<00:04:14.430> 11<00:04:15.360> wins<00:04:15.600> for

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
one point - Lewis Hamilton 11 wins for

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.500 
one point - Lewis Hamilton 11 wins for
the<00:04:15.989> Ferrari<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.680> think<00:04:16.950> he<00:04:17.519> really<00:04:17.970> was<00:04:18.180> a

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
the Ferrari and I think he really was a

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.599 
the Ferrari and I think he really was a
great<00:04:19.169> driver<00:04:19.500> for<00:04:19.830> them<00:04:19.979> and<00:04:20.130> probably<00:04:20.459> was

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
great driver for them and probably was

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.630 
great driver for them and probably was
never<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.000> same<00:04:21.030> after<00:04:21.479> his<00:04:22.169> injury<00:04:22.470> when<00:04:23.400> a

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
never the same after his injury when a

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.610 
never the same after his injury when a
piece<00:04:24.030> of<00:04:24.060> debris<00:04:24.300> hit<00:04:24.660> him<00:04:24.750> in<00:04:25.020> there<00:04:25.289> in<00:04:25.470> the

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
piece of debris hit him in there in the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.390 
piece of debris hit him in there in the
helmet

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
helmet

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.400 
helmet
I<00:04:26.520> think<00:04:27.090> he<00:04:27.210> will<00:04:27.419> be<00:04:27.570> remembered<00:04:27.930> as<00:04:28.199> one<00:04:28.380> of

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
I think he will be remembered as one of

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.129 
I think he will be remembered as one of
the<00:04:28.560> nicest<00:04:29.100> guys<00:04:29.270> on<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.449> grid<00:04:30.660> I<00:04:30.690> know<00:04:30.870> when
