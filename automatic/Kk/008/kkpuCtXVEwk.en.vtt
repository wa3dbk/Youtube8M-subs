00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.390
 Good day, everyone, hello internet 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.980
 shop get rid my name is vladimir 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.500
 Now I want to tell you about our 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.539
 This product is an incubator 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.789
 Neptune software with automatic 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:31.720
 a coup at 80 and its main kind 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:34.660
 operating characteristics of the body itself 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.059
 pretty foam in itself 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.010
 he is bulky 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.710
 temperature control unit are located 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.860
 here about the demolition in the middle of it is 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.809
 temperature is regulated from 36 to 39 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.820
 degrees using this potentiometer 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.860
 when we plug it in 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.540
 lights up there is light at the 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.220
 red when dialing 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.019
 the temperature starts blinking and then 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.379
 then observation windows and here it is 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.430
 four valves for ventilation 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.450
 air vents not closed 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.509
 such plastic caps when 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.369
 humidity is elevated and starts 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.140
 I paid the children the glasses there 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.229
 open these 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.040
 she so that you could see well 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.650
 here and on the side there is such a shred 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.799
 this is just the mechanism for the coup of 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.470
 for their twisting in his work 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.110
 immediately determine if it works 0 no no 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.760
 it will turn out because the first inclusion 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.280
 happens in about forty minutes 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.909
 during the day these turn on 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.360
 seven times all the days included therefore 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:47.020
 To check the work we take it and everything 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.240
 from the fridge making a marker on it 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.390
 or is there a felt-tip pen? 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.430
 we put it inside and then check 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.430
 the mechanism of the hands as if within an hour we show 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.320
 the inside of the lid here is like 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.800
 you see 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.740
 heating element and is a sensor 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.369
 temperature I want to say 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.820
 following 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.190
 sometimes it doesnâ€™t like here or 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.170
 on the contrary of a lot of temperature here 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.830
 You can fix this situation very much 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:25.360
 quickly and quickly when the indicator 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.710
 is close you temperature us 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.440
 the case will be smaller 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.930
 that is, it will shut down faster 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.300
 to raise the temperature we just have it 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.280
 as if we take the guy closer to the balls 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.410
 milk turns them temperature then 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.990
 inside rises for damn from this 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.610
 segment work longer and how would such 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.630
 Well, I think that these nuances you 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:51.630
 read it yourself, and then I clean the payer 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:55.360
 this thing aside now 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.010
 the inside of the hull itself as 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.320
 see here there is a vent 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.959
 the hole is for natural exchange 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.360
 air and here there are such semicircular 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.220
 slot it up just for water for 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.989
 the entire incubation here must necessarily 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.459
 be water as seen here inside the hull 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.160
 we will lead to the thrust 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.820
 this is just for connecting mechanism 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.820
 egg roll 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:30.450
 inside initially we collect the floor he 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.450
 consists of four such grids 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.130
 going pretty fast 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.980
 indoor incubator 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.800
 it is desirable that this temperature was 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.319
 below 15 degrees on horizontal 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.600
 surfaces and best of course this 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.970
 do on the table or some sort of pallet or 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.519
 coasters one to the ground it was 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.610
 but not less than half a meter 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:05.739
 that is, the bridge is large then later 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.739
 egg grid 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.849
 she has here in the middle of such a bolt for 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.340
 attachment to the pitch 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:16.060
 that is, in principle, in her fit 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.769
 i'm 80 years old she connects from traction in 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.130
 principle like an incubator yourself 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.620
 further in the set we go where such 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.720
 stands are needed for installation 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.810
 thermometer thermometer used here 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.370
 alcohol is of this type that is you 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.370
 fastened here on these here podstavochki 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.260
 It is installed inside the case in the zone 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.789
 viewing viewing windows to his 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.080
 seen from above through the cover and 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:50.280
 installed on this site so in 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.280
 principle principle we put back the cap 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.530
 a test run of the device in operation 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.890
 setting the temperature you pour 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.390
 water temperature set if 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.280
 temperature does not get a little 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.170
 open the lid do reset 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.610
 temperatures at close and try 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.100
 set the desired potentiometer 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.760
 temperature is basically everything 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.760
 Thanks for attention
