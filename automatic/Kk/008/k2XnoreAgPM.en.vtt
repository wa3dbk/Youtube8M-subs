00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:10.200
 uicn 4 of course or m there is too much hurray carrier 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.719
 to make a small point of the culprits the other 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.050
 the club will try it 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.019
 I make my head even though I did it 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.060
 obviously disappointment 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.730
 so we'll start right now so we go in texture color 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.460
 some other titles 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.460
 all year long which will not be a fal'cie very wise decision 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.110
 jonathan at description 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.110
 that's enough to eat 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.810
 m 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.790
 so luxury will be declined 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.790
 we must be exemplary this country 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.850
 we lose 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.110
 that's it for the note 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.470
 so you're going to tell me with these funds look 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.810
 for the color outraged by officials I'm afraid 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.120
 the state 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.560
 Jupiter 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.320
 it's over so it's perfect 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.300
 each morning 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.219
 p 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.219
 it shows a balance 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.420
 here 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.300
 I make sure that staff at the ump 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.420
 nobody is perfect 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.370
 three texts 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.690
 with a small spoon 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.230
 m 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.230
 in parallel we were far 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.340
 for me 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.510
 this result opens its door but when we see an employee 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.770
 we see that I have arrived 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.140
 as a result 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.140
 we will lose money 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.100
 back to about 90 degrees 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.510
 we can read 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.210
 particular be pretty much anything no official count 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.060
 the agreement with the culture none am not there 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.489
 let's go 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.859
 the focus you have a small point 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.829
 clubs like I do not want you can put it 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.769
 the fear is that we the people 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.859
 there in a few months 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:31.980
 during the past year 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.439
 question 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.119
 double the selling price 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:36.269
 so 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.759
 of europe good luck written m 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.739
 they commit 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.409
 so we what we wanted three doctors to make themselves known 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:49.359
 here is author of a correct match clegg 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:51.889
 he is to see 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.889
 or how to put a little bit everywhere 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:59.109
 alongside my people 3 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.779
 here 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:08.249
 so that's why not 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:10.029
 so you are 

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:15.949
 to recognize it cupertino we will be able to go faster than we talk about them anymore 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:20.269
 profits provoked on the fact that it controls controversial coproduced lo 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.579
 indeed all the Jews 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.719
 know 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.159
 statistics 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.989
 no 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.599
 so here's the press in place as you want 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:38.869
 that's attias martin trepanier the two hot folders of people put more 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:40.430
 strict on a little more 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.399
 look for a godfather 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:47.209
 the dam however there my first job rotation to the fact like that 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:49.769
 it's like leaving 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.869
 next door - hello 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:55.869
 the program is 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:59.219
 m 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.219
 so why 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.929
 after why about the future convatec inc 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.769
 the door with whom we all agree we will put all you are not 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:11.929
 of attack 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:15.999
 so here you see that it takes the workers they are better 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.300
 dwight anderson i find 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.150
 short morning with the text josÃ© socrates 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.240
 p 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:37.849
 not one more however especially as we will put three suicide bombers 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:41.120
 as a reminder some benchmarks 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.120
 anything I'm looking for the police 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.840
 the state can do it with 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.840
 she begins by saying 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.569
 in the victory a choice 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.719
 so that's called 8th 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:00.719
 excellent track record 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:04.309
 so the link will be in the discussion 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.870
 we go with he comes 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:15.309
 india for snapshots 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.499
 g 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:23.120
 we should not forget to demarcate even crater they also scored percent 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.270
 other 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.270
 simply foursome of actors very nice 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.870
 a beautiful race 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.509
 all now 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.509
 we will not go head on corner in the match our text 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.129
 what to do 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:46.129
 the study 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:49.800

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.060
 peace time for the hour 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.550

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:20.369

 with afp the focus is because it was in a top 10 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.319
 that I have already hurt it was a first step 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.380
 that's how is applied 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.560
 but you looked fresh registration it's true that it's okay we're at 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.210
