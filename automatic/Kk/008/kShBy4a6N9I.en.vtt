basically what you've done is you've
created<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:06.100> sticker<00:03:07.020> when<00:03:08.020> you've<00:03:08.140> come<00:03:08.350> that

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.790 
created a sticker when you've come that
far<00:03:08.830> then<00:03:09.190> kind<00:03:09.580> of<00:03:09.730> place<00:03:10.390> them<00:03:10.570> down<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.140> see

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
far then kind of place them down and see

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.920 
far then kind of place them down and see
where<00:03:12.150> where<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.270> want<00:03:13.480> them<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:13.720> how<00:03:13.870> you

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
where where you want them and how you

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.220 
where where you want them and how you
would<00:03:14.200> like<00:03:14.410> for<00:03:14.590> them<00:03:14.740> to<00:03:14.770> be<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:16.240> when<00:03:17.110> you

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
would like for them to be and when you

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.130 
would like for them to be and when you
do<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.530> after<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.100> do<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.370> go<00:03:18.930> ahead<00:03:19.930> and

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
do that after you do that go ahead and

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.300 
do that after you do that go ahead and
peel<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:20.590> this<00:03:20.710> can<00:03:20.860> be<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.010> little<00:03:21.130> bit

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
peel it and this can be a little bit

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.920 
peel it and this can be a little bit
challenging<00:03:21.520> to<00:03:21.790> get<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.210> separated<00:03:23.280> so<00:03:24.930> there

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
challenging to get it separated so there

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.080 
challenging to get it separated so there
we<00:03:26.080> go

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
we go

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.130 
we go
and<00:03:28.090> carefully<00:03:28.660> take<00:03:29.050> it<00:03:29.200> apart<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:30.900> place<00:03:31.900> it

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
and carefully take it apart and place it

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.830 
and carefully take it apart and place it
on<00:03:32.320> on<00:03:33.040> your<00:03:33.640> plaque<00:03:33.910> where<00:03:34.240> you<00:03:34.360> want<00:03:34.600> it<00:03:34.720> to

it might take two coats you want to be
careful<00:04:43.229> the<00:04:43.380> edge<00:04:43.500> is<00:04:43.680> not<00:04:43.860> to<00:04:44.009> try<00:04:44.190> to<00:04:44.220> shove

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
careful the edge is not to try to shove

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.340 
careful the edge is not to try to shove
anything<00:04:45.120> underneath<00:04:45.630> there<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.139> color

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
anything underneath there the color

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.740 
anything underneath there the color

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
crisp as possible but it isn't gonna be

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.980 
crisp as possible but it isn't gonna be
perfect<00:04:51.630> okay<00:04:53.030> when<00:04:54.030> you<00:04:54.120> have<00:04:54.330> it<00:04:54.509> covered<00:04:54.690> as

perfect okay when you have it covered as

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.460 
perfect okay when you have it covered as
well<00:04:55.139> as<00:04:55.289> you<00:04:55.410> want<00:04:55.970> or<00:04:56.970> as<00:04:57.690> solidly<00:04:58.169> as<00:04:58.350> you

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
reveal and you're just gonna peel from

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.529 
reveal and you're just gonna peel from
the<00:05:09.000> edge<00:05:09.180> of<00:05:10.190> your<00:05:11.190> stickers<00:05:11.729> and<00:05:11.970> pull<00:05:12.419> it

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
the edge of your stickers and pull it

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:18.050 
the edge of your stickers and pull it
off<00:05:15.350> and<00:05:16.350> as<00:05:16.710> you<00:05:16.860> can<00:05:16.949> see<00:05:17.160> I<00:05:17.190> didn't<00:05:17.910> have

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
off and as you can see I didn't have

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.110 
off and as you can see I didn't have
some<00:05:18.240> of<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.389> edges<00:05:18.690> perfectly<00:05:18.720> down<00:05:21.560> so<00:05:22.560> I'll

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
some of the edges perfectly down so I'll

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.279 
some of the edges perfectly down so I'll
we'll<00:05:24.120> figure<00:05:24.270> out<00:05:24.419> a<00:05:24.510> way<00:05:24.720> to<00:05:24.750> make<00:05:25.020> that<00:05:25.229> work

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
we'll figure out a way to make that work

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.540 
we'll figure out a way to make that work
so<00:05:25.860> keep<00:05:26.520> going<00:05:26.910> and<00:05:27.060> keep<00:05:27.120> peeling<00:05:27.510> off

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
so keep going and keep peeling off

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.700 
so keep going and keep peeling off
carefully<00:05:29.550> peel<00:05:29.729> them<00:05:29.849> off<00:05:30.259> and<00:05:31.259> if<00:05:31.410> you<00:05:31.500> find

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
carefully peel them off and if you find

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.629 
carefully peel them off and if you find
that<00:05:31.889> um<00:05:33.740> that's<00:05:34.740> some<00:05:34.979> of<00:05:35.099> them<00:05:35.190> you<00:05:35.340> did<00:05:35.520> it

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
that um that's some of them you did it

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.589 
that um that's some of them you did it
here<00:05:35.789> better<00:05:36.060> like<00:05:36.360> I<00:05:36.510> apparently<00:05:36.750> did<00:05:37.139> here

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
here better like I apparently did here

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.939 
here better like I apparently did here
just<00:05:39.599> take<00:05:39.750> a<00:05:39.780> craft<00:05:40.080> knife<00:05:40.320> to<00:05:40.349> kind<00:05:40.680> of<00:05:40.770> get

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
just take a craft knife to kind of get

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.750 
just take a craft knife to kind of get
an<00:05:41.039> edge<00:05:41.220> going<00:05:42.410> we<00:05:43.410> now<00:05:43.590> have<00:05:43.889> the<00:05:44.190> color<00:05:44.370> here

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
an edge going we now have the color here

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.020 
an edge going we now have the color here
and<00:05:45.500> it<00:05:46.500> did<00:05:46.800> run<00:05:47.160> under<00:05:47.430> the<00:05:47.550> edges<00:05:47.909> a<00:05:47.940> little

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
and it did run under the edges a little

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.870 
and it did run under the edges a little
bit<00:05:48.330> so<00:05:48.659> I'm<00:05:49.620> okay<00:05:49.919> with<00:05:49.949> that<00:05:50.099> what<00:05:50.639> I<00:05:50.669> was
