different<00:00:57.910> ways<00:00:58.090> to<00:00:58.720> make<00:00:58.930> a<00:00:59.140> more<00:00:59.350> durable

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
different ways to make a more durable

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.170 
different ways to make a more durable
edge<00:01:00.280> that<00:01:00.970> also<00:01:01.149> provides<00:01:01.540> more<00:01:01.840> edge<00:01:02.079> hold

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
edge that also provides more edge hold

Squeezebox<00:01:04.180> core<00:01:04.540> profile<00:01:05.079> just<00:01:05.320> has<00:01:05.470> the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
Squeezebox core profile just has the

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.500 
Squeezebox core profile just has the
core<00:01:05.950> milled<00:01:06.280> out<00:01:06.490> in<00:01:06.670> certain<00:01:06.909> areas<00:01:07.240> so<00:01:07.390> it's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
core milled out in certain areas so it's

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.600 
core milled out in certain areas so it's
thicker<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.020> thinner<00:01:08.440> so<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:09.340> gives<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:09.580> more

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
thicker and thinner so it gives you more

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.910 
thicker and thinner so it gives you more
snap<00:01:10.060> more<00:01:10.360> pop<00:01:10.630> but<00:01:10.870> also<00:01:11.050> more<00:01:11.380> durability

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
snap more pop but also more durability

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.530 
snap more pop but also more durability
where<00:01:12.760> you<00:01:12.940> need<00:01:13.210> it

tips and Tails and it just transfers

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.180 
tips and Tails and it just transfers
that<00:01:19.240> energy<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:20.170> meet<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.380> snap<00:01:20.680> and<00:01:20.890> pop

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
that energy to meet the snap and pop

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.730 
that energy to meet the snap and pop
that<00:01:21.220> you<00:01:21.490> need<00:01:21.790> just<00:01:22.090> sometimes<00:01:22.870> lose<00:01:23.170> you've
