00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.490 

when<00:00:34.090> you<00:00:34.210> see<00:00:34.449> that<00:00:34.660> sticker<00:00:34.930> and<00:00:35.079> just<00:00:35.320> for

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
when you see that sticker and just for

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.709 
when you see that sticker and just for
what<00:00:35.649> it<00:00:35.739> represents<00:00:36.340> you<00:00:36.760> know<00:00:36.940> having<00:00:37.660> a

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
what it represents you know having a

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.590 
what it represents you know having a
clean<00:00:38.019> game<00:00:38.230> and<00:00:38.559> I<00:00:38.680> think<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.449> what<00:00:40.449> it<00:00:40.570> means

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
clean game and I think the what it means

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.290 
clean game and I think the what it means
is<00:00:41.050> so<00:00:41.410> broad<00:00:41.710> not<00:00:42.250> only<00:00:42.460> you<00:00:42.760> know<00:00:42.790> an<00:00:42.969> illegal

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
is so broad not only you know an illegal

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.759 
is so broad not only you know an illegal
substances<00:00:43.720> but<00:00:43.960> I<00:00:44.199> think<00:00:44.620> even

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
substances but I think even

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.560 
substances but I think even
sportsmanship<00:00:45.430> is<00:00:45.760> underneath<00:00:46.149> that<00:00:46.360> you

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
sportsmanship is underneath that you

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.240 
sportsmanship is underneath that you
know<00:00:46.690> how<00:00:46.870> we<00:00:46.930> conduct<00:00:47.350> ourselves<00:00:47.649> on<00:00:48.100> the

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
know how we conduct ourselves on the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.430 
know how we conduct ourselves on the
court<00:00:48.460> off<00:00:48.640> the<00:00:48.670> court<00:00:48.850> you're<00:00:49.510> not<00:00:49.780> just<00:00:49.809> the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
court off the court you're not just the

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.250 
court off the court you're not just the
whole<00:00:51.190> drug<00:00:51.550> aspect<00:00:51.729> but<00:00:52.269> I<00:00:52.329> think<00:00:52.629> when<00:00:52.809> a<00:00:52.989> lot

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
whole drug aspect but I think when a lot

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.660 
whole drug aspect but I think when a lot
of<00:00:53.379> kids<00:00:53.589> probably<00:00:53.920> when<00:00:54.129> they<00:00:54.220> see<00:00:54.280> is<00:00:54.489> are

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
of kids probably when they see is are

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.250 
of kids probably when they see is are
