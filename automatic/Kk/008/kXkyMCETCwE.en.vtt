well<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.560> know<00:02:55.680> they<00:02:55.829> you<00:02:56.190> could<00:02:56.340> say<00:02:56.519> that

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
well you know they you could say that

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.170 
well you know they you could say that
about<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.180> guy<00:02:57.329> at<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.569> body<00:02:57.840> shop<00:02:59.090> does<00:03:00.090> it

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
about the guy at the body shop does it

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.890 
about the guy at the body shop does it
make<00:03:00.329> it<00:03:00.420> art<00:03:00.569> no<00:03:00.920> okay

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
make it art no okay

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.600 
make it art no okay
so<00:03:03.900> there's<00:03:04.140> certain<00:03:04.500> things<00:03:04.530> which<00:03:05.220> are<00:03:05.430> not

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
so there's certain things which are not

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.140 
so there's certain things which are not
art<00:03:06.000> even<00:03:06.480> though<00:03:06.810> they<00:03:07.079> are<00:03:07.260> good<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.340> I

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
art even though they are good and I

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.120 
art even though they are good and I
think<00:03:09.389> we<00:03:09.480> all<00:03:09.690> understand<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.500> but<00:03:10.950> at<00:03:11.100> the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
think we all understand that but at the

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.699 
think we all understand that but at the
same<00:03:11.250> time<00:03:11.910> there<00:03:12.870> are<00:03:12.989> certain<00:03:13.350> things<00:03:13.380> which

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
same time there are certain things which

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.890 
same time there are certain things which
are<00:03:13.859> a<00:03:13.889> little<00:03:13.980> bit<00:03:14.220> confusing<00:03:14.880> as<00:03:15.420> well<00:03:15.750> you

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
are a little bit confusing as well you

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.309 
are a little bit confusing as well you
know<00:03:16.049> that<00:03:16.350> art<00:03:16.530> ceramics<00:03:19.700> not<00:03:20.700> art<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:22.260> has

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
know that art ceramics not art it has

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.819 
know that art ceramics not art it has
the<00:03:22.680> function<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.700> being<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.389> pot<00:03:24.780> or<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.260> plate

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
the function of being a pot or a plate

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.860 
the function of being a pot or a plate
it's<00:03:26.760> not<00:03:27.000> art<00:03:27.620> now<00:03:28.620> can't<00:03:29.459> ceramics<00:03:30.180> be<00:03:30.480> hard

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
function okay it's pretty simple what

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.860 
function okay it's pretty simple what
about<00:03:42.780> graffiti<00:03:44.600> his<00:03:45.600> graffiti<00:03:46.230> art<00:03:46.560> well<00:03:47.010> I

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
have to say graffiti is art because I

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.309 
have to say graffiti is art because I
don't<00:03:50.609> know<00:03:51.540> there's<00:03:51.870> no<00:03:51.989> function<00:03:54.319> now

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
don't know there's no function now

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.250 
don't know there's no function now
here's<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.620> really<00:03:55.859> difficult<00:03:56.190> one<00:03:58.040> tattoo<00:04:00.260> is

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
here's a really difficult one tattoo is

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.870 
here's a really difficult one tattoo is
it<00:04:01.590> art<00:04:01.919> now<00:04:02.190> we<00:04:02.299> hear<00:04:03.299> that<00:04:03.919> the<00:04:04.919> person<00:04:05.639> is

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
it art now we hear that the person is

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.000 
it art now we hear that the person is
called<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:06.269> tattoo<00:04:06.840> artist<00:04:08.690> so<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:10.470> sort<00:04:10.919> of

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
called a tattoo artist so it sort of

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.440 
called a tattoo artist so it sort of
would<00:04:11.190> seem<00:04:11.639> like<00:04:11.940> he's<00:04:12.150> an<00:04:12.299> artist<00:04:12.629> well<00:04:12.870> yeah

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
would seem like he's an artist well yeah

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.360 
would seem like he's an artist well yeah
the<00:04:15.450> tattoo

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
the tattoo

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.580 
the tattoo
would<00:04:16.579> seem<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:17.209> be<00:04:17.239> hard<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.930> me<00:04:20.590> simply

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
would seem to be hard to me simply

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.620 
would seem to be hard to me simply
because<00:04:21.709> it's<00:04:22.040> not<00:04:22.250> really<00:04:22.610> a<00:04:22.639> function<00:04:23.360> now

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
because it's not really a function now

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.700 
because it's not really a function now
the<00:04:23.690> problem<00:04:24.500> comes<00:04:24.770> in<00:04:25.580> is<00:04:26.360> with<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:27.350> is

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
the problem comes in is with that is

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.500 
the problem comes in is with that is
that<00:04:28.240> people<00:04:29.240> are<00:04:30.669> decorating<00:04:31.669> their<00:04:31.910> bodies

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
that people are decorating their bodies

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:39.070 
that people are decorating their bodies
with<00:04:33.220> images<00:04:34.220> okay<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:37.750> there<00:04:38.750> is<00:04:39.050> a

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
with images okay and there is a

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.010 
with images okay and there is a
distinction<00:04:39.800> between<00:04:41.770> real<00:04:42.770> art<00:04:43.070> and

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
distinction between real art and

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.710 
distinction between real art and
decorative<00:04:45.020> art<00:04:45.290> okay<00:04:45.889> so<00:04:46.550> you<00:04:47.090> know<00:04:47.210> one<00:04:47.510> is

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
decorative art okay so you know one is

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.210 
decorative art okay so you know one is
sort<00:04:48.020> of<00:04:48.169> a<00:04:48.440> good<00:04:49.340> thing

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
sort of a good thing

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.629 
sort of a good thing
something<00:04:52.220> else<00:04:52.400> is<00:04:52.760> a<00:04:53.560> sort<00:04:54.560> of<00:04:54.680> not<00:04:55.039> so<00:04:55.370> great

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
something else is a sort of not so great

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.159 
something else is a sort of not so great
but<00:04:55.970> you<00:04:56.270> know<00:04:56.360> it's<00:04:56.510> a<00:04:56.600> little<00:04:56.750> bit<00:04:56.990> debatable

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
but you know it's a little bit debatable

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.029 
but you know it's a little bit debatable
there<00:04:57.889> okay<00:04:59.080> and<00:05:00.080> I<00:05:00.199> know<00:05:00.410> it<00:05:00.680> some<00:05:00.860> of<00:05:00.889> you

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039

here<00:05:12.139> is<00:05:12.500> a<00:05:12.530> functional<00:05:13.430> item<00:05:14.800> that<00:05:15.800> we<00:05:15.919> sit<00:05:16.190> it

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
here is a functional item that we sit it

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.969 
here is a functional item that we sit it
so<00:05:18.560> let<00:05:19.130> me<00:05:19.160> repeat<00:05:19.940> this<00:05:20.419> very<00:05:20.979> simple

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
so let me repeat this very simple

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.219 
so let me repeat this very simple
concept<00:05:22.400> to<00:05:23.330> people<00:05:23.840> okay<00:05:24.340> that<00:05:25.340> art<00:05:26.120> has<00:05:26.930> no

concept to people okay that art has no

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.570 
concept to people okay that art has no
function<00:05:27.950> and<00:05:28.180> it<00:05:29.180> doesn't<00:05:29.660> really<00:05:30.050> matter

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
function and it doesn't really matter

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.520 
function and it doesn't really matter
how<00:05:31.580> good<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:33.919> thing<00:05:34.250> is
