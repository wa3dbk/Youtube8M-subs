00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.149
 hello everyone can watch a video very 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.279
 short project that can be very 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:07.689
 interesting to many of you and 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.059
 I think that many times we just 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.860
 we paint the eyes of the other colors 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.389
 at most times we do not try 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.759
 another one that we think will keep us 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.080
 bad and good there really are many 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.550
 colors that stick with our colors 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.460
 of eyes so many others we have blue 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.660
 greens brown gray black so 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.660
 Well I hope you like it 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.130
 I'm going to start with black eyes and 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.930
 dark browns 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.080
 to that kind of eyes you can say that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.180
 all the colors are going to join you in 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.160
 how much the eyeliner the best are the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.690
 black males and as for the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.090
 shadows the best will be the greens 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.450
 dark or dark blue pulling 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.489
 good the electric blue better said and 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.050
 males especially if they are in the range 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.330
 of earth colors are the ones that 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.330
 we are going to lay our eyes now 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.160
 I'm going to move on to light brown colors and 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.420
 pulling the color milk is also 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.120
 question that for this type of color of 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.949
 eyes all colors stick and remain 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.190
 good but good I have to emphasize 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.150
 some so it has brown browns those 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.479
 dark greens 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.210
 the golden bronzes the roses and purples 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.970
 lilacs and especially also a lot the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.380
 color silver and black and as soon as 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.950
 high line is therefore a bit of the previous 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.990
 the black males the purples and the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.729
 dark greens 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.880
 I had green eyes the 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.939
 only colors that he did not advise us are 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.649
 the logical green greens and the blues are 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.630
 colors that are not seeing however 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.159
 the dark green yes that is a kind of 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.259
 shadow that will favor us a lot 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.899
 then the dark green along with 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.820
 violets and roses and also the range 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.429
 of earth colors and as for the high 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.100
 line is as always the black purple and 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.630
 light dark green no and if I had the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.939
 blue eyes is the opposite to 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.530
 green colors we will look good 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.390
 light blue however the blue 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.520
 electric and will not favor 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.649
 the greens so the areas whose said 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.110
 the navy blue the electric blue black 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.090
 gray light browns beige and 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.799
 also the very clear roses in 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.049
 to the eyeliner I would highlight two the 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.940
 black as always and dark blue or 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.560
 electric blue and finally it would be the 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.239
 gray eyes as for the dancers 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.920
 He also highlighted two colors that 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.810
 would be the black as good at least as 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.790
 in all eyes and the blue ones to be able 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.370
 be dark in terms of the shadows os 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.890
 I recommend the purple lilacs the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.120
 the gray or silver colors and also a 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.190
 color that will also perform a lot 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.840
 this look are muse or beige colors 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.340
 or the girls as you see this has been a 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.620
 very short video I hope you have 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.209
 served and nothing if you have any questions 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.500

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.980

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.980
