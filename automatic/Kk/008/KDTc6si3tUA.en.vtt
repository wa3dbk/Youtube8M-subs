00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.729
 wonderful good evening I always dangerous and in the video I had the 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:07.930
 Last days, no time with Super Glide 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.479
 general designs 

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.629
 9 such action is very much fun it becomes 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.680
 Also for various reports from the media and there is still good news I 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.679
 I finally reached the programmers I do not know if I did not notice 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.570
 it is actually always platform on the bass percent of my page is yes 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.079
 and around the Ammersee is already done when you see Jung right 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:30.729
 Japhet McNeil 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.230
 this brazen goal 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.960
 to say the thought of the USA or in Basel and I am sure reached 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.710
 but it said Euro transfers the money back 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.810
 and for that there was far too complicated history she did not want to 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.920
 explain the case 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.090
 for Munich for a platform 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.830
 and I would much rather be one 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.930
 in the private area installation also does stuff like that 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.100
 Unfortunately, I am not always successful in training or work 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.140
 Round in mediocrity is again so many many people that my education as 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.420
 Fachinformatiker and spare you the trendy job many want to do 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.390
 I write many things here 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.250
 with worry lines train area 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.110
 This year everything will have to do differently than being an organist in this one 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.060
 Stomach and weighed the case 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.080
 sitting again soon 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.840
 Jade Goody just make a little video I have not seen for so long 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.820
 made 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.469
 and I do not have Fantasia anymore 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.229
 whoever believes it can hardly be 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.630
 We have it at home but I think I can do so well over the others 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.140
 Round 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.110
 yes I have you today Laufacher digs or dream without worries 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.440
 mistakenly for doing something 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.070
 I always do that 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.790
 constantly because of 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.070
 the SK fall 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.870
 the townhouses wants to introduce street sign 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.820
 Yes and 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.310
 Rheine's other model is already the SV celebrated the question of whether not better 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.950
 Look for a better day 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.619
 I break especially since I'm standing there I forgot all these by the way 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.119
 new camera angle 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.570
 We may be a programmatic so people make a logical statement 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.090
 have around 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.760
 there is an application and there are new drivers for the cameras and 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.499
 should act accordingly 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:12.949
 dive 280 times 27 record HD and take for it 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:14.859
 it does me anyway somehow 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.239
 nothing to do in this sense but always written together 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.239
 I always go about this from solar cells and 27 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.909
 I'll try it out 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.319
 He also sees the logo 4 percent 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.459
 There he was no idea 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.479
 then there are new ones if I have to pack now 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:31.579
 I have the quality 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.579
 is visit stand 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.969
 arrest mode 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.070
 I'm supposed to go through the slot 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.179
 by Günter Bork 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.179
 "Of course this is quite blümerant this area Landshut 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.549
 Problem is the lighting conditions but so saves the value lost 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:47.769
 excellent 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.379
 but father 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.249
 is of course also a reason for the tables 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.859
 Surely it's super 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.380
 Jason it was useful 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.869
 the production is form 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.199
 that has to stop 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:02.429
 Straw apologies back to the criminal division 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:05.429
 under me has the whole thing when I then also in SKV 1 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.439
 Chartier or another 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.449
 finally have been exceeded 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.989
 our music also a bit 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.479
 Yes, that is him 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:17.739
 Finds from SK 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.739

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:26.099
 undisputed super 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.649
 What percent the Plöner See is with his team of the head 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:31.290
 its a bit lower 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.639
 than others 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.409
 Fans from other manufacturers 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.519
 Thought it was already thought outnumbered is our normal catch 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.449
 reduce or federal leagues critical citizens to another and video 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.569
 - Post shot 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.269
 Wednesdays and so on 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.509
 not so supple aluminum foil 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:52.289
 I'm here now 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:55.650
 Schumacher that's incredible, I'm especially happy in the country 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.280
 i initially did i have no idea about that means i have to go now 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.270
 every big coalition she gets torn to pieces that's a big party 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.279
 that's their fear and marketing of big supermarket 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:09.699
 the jurors 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.859
 Photo Norman Palmer and he already at the side 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.189
 completely over your head 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:20.189
 it also covers it from the height there is no Huggel 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:22.779
 Soost 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:24.169
 on the train II 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.169
 and that's how the hospital looks 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.409
 not sure at the moment either 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:36.749
 Jülich 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:38.969
 the art is ready to be finished 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:40.270
 you look at the clock 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.340
 Yes, in ten seconds, the basic values ​​are the next trough 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.229
 and 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.360
 but with the right format 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.840
 He already knows clients excellent 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.830
 These are moments to enjoy daily use right back 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.210
 coca-cola come 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.330
 we'll meet Again 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330
 Aalen 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.309
 the purchase will be said Stocker 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:10.589
 around this 6 7 but if it's a bit less than the one at the hopman cup 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:13.589
 must be careful that you probably have to experience once 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.629
 what are the requirements 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.309
 maybe a few more holes for doctors 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:21.939
 So what is to be done and allow it to 50 minutes and want 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:24.300
 that's a problem 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.660
 Gallen 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.660
 Gallen 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.020
 Gallen 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.620
 Until then, solvente should be used 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.599
 easier for me back to the roots 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.120
 that's okay for the roundabout you get everywhere 

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:51.039
 even now 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.039
 we also have to look to this crisis for ourselves 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.210
 and he 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.469
 Definitely fits me at Servette Geneva 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.889
 they existed 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.789
 have conceded gellen can 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.399
 then they should have built me ​​up and basically the same 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:12.839
 I do not know which players are not alone, for example 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:17.299
 and also regularly with the autostart folder the lanky said in the 

00:06:17.299 --> 00:06:18.309
 Case of the future 

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:20.990
 apparently focused on the new page 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.990
 if the new button and brawn of a farmer and 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.759
 the problems would be 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:29.279
 To defeat Premiere videos 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:32.710
 by Michael Fischer to invest the ball in a lot of time time and time again 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.100
 Of course the people are happy to do a lot, of course 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.520
 make a whole in front of you are them 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.730
 then of course there will be a lot of new tournaments in these weeks 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.490
 to reward but that who would have anything you also read them 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.080
 do not betray too much 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.009
 otherwise I'm pretty confused about their home to pay for content 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:55.219
 x celebrate again in series the celebrated hero easier to master 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:58.789
 Personnel overwhelmed and it is not further 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:01.629
 and otherwise I will write reports again for my education 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:04.629
 the manager chance that can show what i am doing there 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:06.699
 what's going on there 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:10.430
 and unimaginable heights and so easy the question if I have to look I will 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.949
 Club Monday and watermelons are responsible for electricity 

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:17.189
 everything would come two more simple videos 

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:20.999
 without all that blabbering a lot of people mean when now locals though 

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:23.990
 again just shit to tell us the following 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.779
 expected before departure 

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:29.029
 so it is read by twitter users and me on food 

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:33.270
 and the 0 3 regional bishop has already fallen behind 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.930
