00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 for those who doubt this relationship of 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.030
 spark and they just made a tattoo 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.550
 who got a tattoo 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.150
 I still do not know what happened 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.160
 where did the body go and what does it say 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.280
 I am shocked with the tattoo that 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.770
 he made the spark 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:26.360
 and a tattoo that just came to me if 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.820
 the director please was the new 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.520
 tattoo that we could interpret it with 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.520
 one being I intertwined with another being 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.520
 chanel 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.730
 a few days 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.879
 let's remember that the roth voucher with the 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.489
 Mr. new woman also became a 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.550
 tattoo and the customs of the tattooed 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.690
 of the tattooed ones spoke for you and for me 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.149
 that we 've never had a tattoo 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.370
 end has not even appeared that is mufa 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.869
 finally the contacts for the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.049
 riberos but people when they tattoo 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.750
 things in common and the same sometimes 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.090
 things do not turn out to gods and as I have 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.550
 understood as they are commenting on me 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.890
 three days the spark was made this tattoo 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.619
 and it's the same as claudia 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.229
 schmidt somewhere in your body and 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.229
 he would have done it out of love 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:38.380
 finally but it is a copy the drawing 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.960
 I could interpret it like that but it's from 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:46.319
 this behavior approximately ending in 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.319
 the dream but it 's permission from here 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.850
 here I had the spark tattoo 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.820
 colo colo affection carlos 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.009
 copying the person without today together 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.740
 this means the experts me only 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.629
 I have two tattoos and they say I love you so much 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.369
 Greetings but it has nothing to do with 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:15.560
 These days relationships are the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.480
 tattoos with you 80 is also true 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.260
 that have your back the plane to 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.260
 escape the rent 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.780
 so we the rest in this type 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.780
 from there do not go 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.440
 in this relationship 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.890
 I think the fundamental of this photo 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.930
 I really want to repeat last year 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.670
 that he said the reality was not done 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.130
 inside the reality show but he knew nothing 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.600
 more of this cover and I want to tell 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.940
 the people who complain 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.740
 maybe the opposite world probably 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.080
 be the most watched program in this minute 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.600
 however, the percentage of 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.460
 your rating compared to last year and 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.550
 if nakasone keeps lowering the percentage 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.010
 of his rating will stop being him the 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.450
 great teacher of tradition this week 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.830
 and it is in the first place it is 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.540
 playing everything for everything because he has 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.400
 lowered his audience how did that come to you 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.230
 good as well I have firm makes a 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.270
 couple of days sparks follow in three worlds 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.310
 Opposites 2 would be entering the signature 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.200
 German confirmed 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.180
 and with regard to the photo that came to me 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.920
 novel the source but the only thing that had 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.390
 to say is that sparkle to me does not want me 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.390
 then nothing from him 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.430
 because this first one was but if you 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.180
 basically send a picture of her 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.180
 because I want 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:48.000
 the famous also happens in the advertisement 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:49.620
 is that they are analyzing not nakasone 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.030
 managed to put not in the world teleserie 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.550
 opposite and in the programs of france 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.550
 lots of salt in this collection the world
