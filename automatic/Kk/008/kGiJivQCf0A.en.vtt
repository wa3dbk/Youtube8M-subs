the most politically correct I

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.199 
the most politically correct I
understand<00:02:49.409> but<00:02:50.099> this<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:50.639> the<00:02:50.760> worldview

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
understand but this is the worldview

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
mainly that if you tried them once there

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.009 
mainly that if you tried them once there
was<00:02:58.919> a<00:02:58.950> 70%<00:02:59.639> chance<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.450> would<00:03:00.599> end<00:03:00.720> up<00:03:00.840> dead
