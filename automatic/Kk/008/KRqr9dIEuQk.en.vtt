00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.430
 we were initially preparing 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.080
 projects for other personalities and 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.750
 indirectly we met his 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.950
 representative and we access him and what 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.110
 we got into a project of 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.910
 investigation and finally that consolidated 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.529
 an ideal house for him he was 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.390
 also looking for a place to live 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.989
 permanently in Barcelona and this was 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.989
 the opportunity 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.330
 I imagine that by the essence of 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.190
 architecture I believe that in the past 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.629
 years before perhaps less in the past 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.879
 years my architecture has become very 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.370
 symbolic because I want the symbol 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.290
 represent in the intrinsic nature 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.180
 from a city to a character from a 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.739
 person in general then what 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.970
 try in my architecture with the 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.180
 independence of many others 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.640
 factors is that 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.170
 have the ability to thrill and over 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.540
 everything to make its occupants happy 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.989
 then the symbolism helps me 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.910
 very much then trying to get 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.479
 the essence of a person I create forms 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.490
 intrinsically related to her I 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.340
 I think this excited him as messi 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.380
 It excites other clients of mine because 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.180
 we really believe and he identified that 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.710
 the house is very much related to him 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.910
 with his idiosyncrasy with his personality 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.910
 with their own torments 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.030
 well it's not a single symbol when 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.210
 we make a building we do not just use 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.820
 a symbol usually I forced my 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.100
 I collaborate with myself to my students 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.770
 etcetera to at least identify 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.330
 20 related symbols or more angles 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.610
 directly others more indirectly 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.140
 with a certain personality in the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.030
 case of messina the same thing happened 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.380
 there with the 20 symbols I would say that the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.560
 most important symbol of the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.020
 Messi's personality is the duality in 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.540
 the duality and also the tenacity the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.550
 Self-demand is a person who has gone 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.380
 from little to more and has had to demand 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.630
 himself very much and he is followed 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.310
 demanding though many times a lot 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.470
 people say it 's a talent really 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.110
 there is suffering and a job 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.850
 then continued his house 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.740
 the main symbolism from home 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.880
 it was duality 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.750
 the ethereal I solidify the water the earth the 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.660
 right the left the whole project 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.210
 they have two sides and then there are 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.790
 some obvious symbols the number ten 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.980
 so loved by month and own 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.739
 symbology that implies this number 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.010
 own will be the soccer ball itself 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.409
 the forcefulness the roundness the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.900
 self-imposed in the house is full of 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:47.370
 symbols and it really is something complex of 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.370
 explain all of them there are almost 20 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.450
 because the house is a structure like 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.160
 all I do because that's a 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.470
 invariant mine all the houses that I 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.090
 I make are removable that is to say all the 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.490
 houses are composed on the basis of 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.459
 precast concrete 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.350
 steel and wood throughout my writing 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.360
 It is thus made the n if so then 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.720
 is an important structure in the form of 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.610
 hexagon with some big arcs 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.830
 centrifugal that in turn holds other 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.700
 metal supporting elements that 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.870
 time 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.120
 they hold a certain beams 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.310
 alveolar is the characteristic of being 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.200
 prefabricated elements and that is that 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.970
 can disassemble say can be assembled 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.980
 with screws very quickly and it 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.290
 can dismantle what I'm looking for with 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.200
 this is the null environmental impact 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.480
 a very well-studied house makes one 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.420
 feels fully integrated with the 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.250
 nature will change the way you see 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.420
 the nature your way of seeing the human 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.920
 your way of seeing life 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.750
 you can transcend as a human 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.670
 living a house perfectly 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.010
 bioclimatic because you are going to feel the 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.440
 pulsar of nature will vibrate 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.870
 like nature and you go to 3 zender 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.900
 as a human being this is very important for 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.900
 my
