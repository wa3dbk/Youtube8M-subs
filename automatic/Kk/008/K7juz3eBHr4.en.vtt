00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.760
 since we have shown on television the 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.460
 sexual behavior of many fish 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.140
 people will be surprised to know that 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.660
 in some species 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.880
 all individuals are born with the same 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.710
 sex 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.500
 the groupers and other members of their 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.060
 family are born females but today we go 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.160
 know some parts that have a 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.680
 reproductive behavior exactly the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.559
 otherwise let's meet them, steal them 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.059
 with this case we all got hurt and only 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.370
 after a few years it is 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.109
 turns into genes and we'll try 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.640
 find a school of them right here 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.699
 alcides dutra and the sea 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.920
 dive into the waters of the island of the grove 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:58.010
 a marine biological reserve that has 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.409
 as the main objective to protect the fauna 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.909
 and ensure security for your 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:07.700
 playback in places that are reasonably 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.640
 preserved like this there are times when 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.229
 the fish move away from the rocks as if 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.229
 were taking a walk 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.950
 the relaxed meeting has participation 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.750
 even from some predators but 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.750
 it seems that even they enter the climate 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.600
 this should be one of those moments that 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.760
 fishermen are frustrated because despite 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.980
 many fish I do not even have one 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.980
 little interested without biting the baits 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.240
 suddenly hidden behind a 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.149
 rock alcides another sight what 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:13.250
 was looking for 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:15.650
 there they are stealing them the stolen ones 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.140
 live in both fresh and salt water 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.450
 and here a marine environment they are 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:26.930
 found within 20 meters of 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:28.930
 deep sea ​​bass are among the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.140
 fish that presents a curious 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.260
 reproductive adaptation there is no birth 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.200
 of faeces all the sea bass begin their 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.620
 sexual life as males and only after 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.629
 some years change their sex and they can pass 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.629
 the rest of life as happy 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.150
 studies done with a kind of 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.940
 steal it demonstrate that all females 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.970
 become sexually mature with 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:13.480
 three years old but before that 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:15.370
 they could act like males the stolen ones 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.400
 spent most of his life in 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.030
 estuaries of rivers migrating to the sea in 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.470
 spawning function 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.090
 this spectacle that we just 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.140
 watch should be a succession of 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.090
 productive 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.170
 the fish chose this location to 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.660
 procreate 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.320
 this further reinforces the importance of 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.320
 reserve of the grove 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.130
 conservation of life depends on the 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.380
 knowledge about each species 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.200
 and today we know that to keep 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.430
 sea ​​bass and all the wealth that the sea 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.710
 provides 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.100
 we have to conserve their sanctuaries and 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.670
 and the reserve of the grove is a 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.670
 their 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.800
 only with concrete actions that guarantee 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.650
 in fact the security of this paradise and the 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.590
 surrounding waters, we can ensure the 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.880
 extraordinary diversity of life in the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.880
 santa catarina coast
