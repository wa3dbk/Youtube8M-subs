00:00:52.740 --> 00:01:00.110

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.700

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.700

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.990

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.280

 So I opened it so I entered the shop 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.680
 from now 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.420
 Is spy starting? 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.420
 I Masenpa one closest went there Te 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.439
 10 o'clock yesterday 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.439
 ran 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:12.270
 Yes, I am in the way of the release date 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:17.270
 I was able to give time to these two people 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.270
 So I would like to introduce myself to the guests 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.360
 Other games leak 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.640
 To say that producer 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.840
 It is a master 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.100
 I think that I made a lid with Omega ruby ​​alpha sapphire this time 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.319
 A couple of days ago 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.440
 I think it was handed over 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.200
 Robbie Sapphire's 12th Anniversary 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.660
 In also Shireman 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:51.840
 It's easy to increased feelings on the results Department because he told me double-double feeling terribly 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:54.120
 Well after all this in Te my way to another little like a I Iyahho customer's are tears Once 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.580
 It is amazing happy 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.810
 12 years ago everyone together in Shinjuku 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.810
 I went to buy in directly below 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:23.860
 Buber pretty hiaros even now 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:28.660
 In Daite I was also feeling like it may either friends with each other that it is 12 years ago what to write you 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:33.110
 I think that it was basic to play, but it was communication cable this time 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:36.920
 It is a land mine because it is wireless and underground, for example, and the connect environment is also complete . 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:42.410
 Let's all together, for example, it's really twitter, or you can act on youtube 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:46.490
 Or The decade of ruby spark of being able to play the style that say while watching it this time 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:49.880
 I think that I can do another experience and I like that 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.410
 Amazing that enjoy play something and the user of the people 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.580
 I think I'm looking forward to it too 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:59.450
 But there is also Toka have become had, for example, 3 d model saying at opening 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:05.200
 Something like the current point of interest 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.200
 If you have a hard time here and you want to see Yuri, there is such a place 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:25.500
 I want Booby to have a one night experience 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.150
 I think I can 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:37.300
 Have you high school one more time you are there Do not want you to experience feelings 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:41.759
 Do you issued a nut full Haahaa Haa grow to everyone Yes 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.759
 The present is the highlight 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:05:00.650
 I've been playing here for a long time, but I'm wondering if you might be surprised at the beginning 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.590
 But I as a person Now is Tsu this time Sarn 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.400
 not 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:09.090
 Model on the screen that the tail is inserted or various high pokemons 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.660
 I use it as information, but I usually catch it 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.040
 And it was too late say or replication remembered even 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:19.360
 I have new discoveries 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:23.800
 For example, in order to catch even the Pokemon that I have seen, it is said that there is actually a considerable difference 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.630
 There is also a fact that it will be advantageous to actually meet and catch various Pokemon. 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.480
 so 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.610
 I think that I want you to have caught the Pokemon 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:35.409
 It is quite characteristic of ruby, so it is Umar 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:40.830
 It looks like the weather is reflected in the water 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:46.639
 Because there is, I try copying the area myself- 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:50.169
 It's a photo like that. 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.169
 If you feel interesting 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:57.759
 So I think I want to get on the sidelines as soon as possible 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.789
 v Because it is a jump 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:04.940
 There is 20dec 21st and Jump Festa 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:10.960
 Then I think I would like to promote this with a video that makes a little bit 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.960
 I guess I feel or Irassha' the venue two people I have a well's stage 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:22.190
 Try to include not a stage not to have Ah ha ha ha page that seen in the shade 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.260
 So yes 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:29.120
 It is school on sale date 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:33.790
