this is John Mendez with expert village

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.829 
this is John Mendez with expert village
and<00:00:03.240> now<00:00:04.020> that<00:00:04.259> we've<00:00:04.410> got<00:00:05.100> our<00:00:05.839> strands

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
and now that we've got our strands

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.650 
and now that we've got our strands
strung<00:00:07.140> on<00:00:07.290> one<00:00:07.859> side<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.370> our<00:00:08.490> clasp<00:00:08.790> we<00:00:09.480> can

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
strung on one side of our clasp we can

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.720 
strung on one side of our clasp we can
go<00:00:09.870> ahead<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.110> start<00:00:10.260> beating<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.610> can

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
go ahead and start beating and you can

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.020 
go ahead and start beating and you can
see<00:00:11.910> where<00:00:12.420> i<00:00:12.450> strung<00:00:13.320> them<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.860> did<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.000> very

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
see where i strung them I did the very

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.359 
see where i strung them I did the very
ends<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.960> then<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.260> two<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.770> middle<00:00:17.039> I've

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
ends and then the two in the middle I've

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.240 
ends and then the two in the middle I've
skipped<00:00:17.670> two<00:00:17.970> loops<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.650> way<00:00:20.010> it's

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
skipped two loops and the way it's

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.450 
skipped two loops and the way it's
strung<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.880> works<00:00:21.600> out<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:21.990> end<00:00:22.220> they<00:00:23.220> just

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
strung it works out in the end they just

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.300 
strung it works out in the end they just
don't<00:00:23.880> make<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.090> class<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.990> fits<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:26.010> four

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
don't make a class that fits a four

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.589 
don't make a class that fits a four
strand<00:00:26.689> perfectly<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.529> choose<00:00:28.949> a

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
strand perfectly for this so I choose a

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.229 
strand perfectly for this so I choose a
six<00:00:30.599> strand<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.230> work<00:00:31.800> around<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:33.030> once

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
six strand and work around it so once

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.660 
six strand and work around it so once
you<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.570> done<00:00:34.040> we<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.070> go<00:00:35.370> ahead<00:00:35.489> and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
you have that done we can go ahead and

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.540 
you have that done we can go ahead and
put<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.090> our<00:00:36.360> first<00:00:36.630> bar<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.370> keep

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
put on our first bar and I like to keep

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.180 
put on our first bar and I like to keep
all<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.910> head<00:00:39.149> heads<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> head<00:00:40.530> pins<00:00:40.829> on

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
all the head heads of the head pins on

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.700 
all the head heads of the head pins on
one<00:00:41.969> side<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.930> soldered<00:00:43.290> ends<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
one side and the soldered ends on the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.770 
one side and the soldered ends on the
other<00:00:43.920> two<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.489> get<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> nice<00:00:45.210> clean<00:00:45.570> look

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
other two just get it a nice clean look

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.319 
other two just get it a nice clean look
so<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.800> either<00:00:46.950> start<00:00:47.280> from<00:00:47.489> either

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
so we can either start from either

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.110 
so we can either start from either
either<00:00:48.930> end<00:00:49.260> will<00:00:49.770> be<00:00:49.800> your<00:00:50.070> top<00:00:50.340> or<00:00:50.550> bottom<00:00:50.700> so

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
either end will be your top or bottom so

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.900 
either end will be your top or bottom so
I<00:00:52.370> like<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:54.000> string<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.870> first<00:00:55.140> one<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
I like to just string the first one and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.410 
I like to just string the first one and
then<00:00:56.910> choose<00:00:57.360> your<00:00:57.660> second<00:00:58.500> one

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
then choose your second one

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.420 
then choose your second one
for<00:01:01.019> the<00:01:01.199> second<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.980> you'll<00:01:02.910> notice<00:01:03.359> that

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
for the second and you'll notice that

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.240 
for the second and you'll notice that
we're<00:01:05.430> doing<00:01:05.670> this

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.750 

so<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.120> the<00:01:09.900> bars<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.440> on<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:11.010> side<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
so that the bars are on one side and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.730 
so that the bars are on one side and
you'll<00:01:12.480> want<00:01:12.690> to<00:01:12.780> keep<00:01:13.290> that

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.130 

going<00:01:16.490> in<00:01:16.610> that<00:01:16.729> pattern<00:01:17.090> every<00:01:17.420> time<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:17.930> put

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
going in that pattern every time you put

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.970 
going in that pattern every time you put
a<00:01:18.170> bar<00:01:18.439> on

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.039 

because<00:01:21.490> you<00:01:21.640> don't<00:01:21.820> want<00:01:21.940> it<00:01:22.210> to<00:01:22.360> be

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
because you don't want it to be

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:39.110 
because you don't want it to be
unsymmetrical

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.840 

and<00:01:40.120> this<00:01:40.480> bracelet<00:01:41.140> will<00:01:41.440> take<00:01:41.680> a<00:01:41.890> while<00:01:42.430> to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
and this bracelet will take a while to

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.750 
and this bracelet will take a while to
make

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
make

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.630 
make
the<00:01:45.150> first<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.630> ever<00:01:45.750> made<00:01:46.460> probably<00:01:47.460> took

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the first one I ever made probably took

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.520 
the first one I ever made probably took
me<00:01:47.850> two<00:01:48.060> days<00:01:48.090> because<00:01:48.660> I<00:01:48.900> had<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.110> figure<00:01:49.380> out

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
me two days because I had to figure out

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.200 
me two days because I had to figure out
the<00:01:49.680> pattern<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.490> put<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.360> down

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
the pattern and put it down

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.840 
the pattern and put it down
look<00:01:52.570> at<00:01:52.780> it<00:01:52.930> so<00:01:53.860> if<00:01:53.979> you<00:01:54.070> get<00:01:54.190> frustrated<00:01:54.430> you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
look at it so if you get frustrated you

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.170 
look at it so if you get frustrated you
go<00:01:55.000> is<00:01:55.240> put<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.540> down<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:56.229> come<00:01:56.380> back<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:57.180> so

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
go is put it down and come back to it so

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.060 
go is put it down and come back to it so
what<00:01:58.510> we<00:01:58.720> want<00:01:58.930> to<00:01:59.020> do<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.320> we<00:01:59.500> want<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.830> pull

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
what we want to do is we want to pull

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.850 
what we want to do is we want to pull
that<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:01.210> can<00:02:01.360> see<00:02:01.630> how<00:02:01.990> it'll<00:02:02.170> just<00:02:02.530> line

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
that and you can see how it'll just line

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.460 
that and you can see how it'll just line
up<00:02:02.890> at<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.310> end<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:05.020> going<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.229> look<00:02:05.380> a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
up at the end it's going to look a

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.920 
up at the end it's going to look a
little<00:02:05.619> strange<00:02:05.979> now<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:07.240> once<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:07.600> get<00:02:07.720> all

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
little strange now but once you get all

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.260 
little strange now but once you get all
of<00:02:08.110> your<00:02:08.229> pieces<00:02:08.470> on<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.880> other<00:02:10.030> end

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
of your pieces on and the other end

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.940 
of your pieces on and the other end
attached<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:11.590> will<00:02:12.180> line<00:02:13.180> up<00:02:13.620> really<00:02:14.620> nicely

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
attached it will line up really nicely

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.850 
attached it will line up really nicely
and<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:16.090> can<00:02:16.239> see<00:02:16.480> when<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.810> put<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:17.200> on<00:02:17.319> you

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
and you can see when you put it on you

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.430 
and you can see when you put it on you
don't<00:02:18.069> even<00:02:18.190> notice
