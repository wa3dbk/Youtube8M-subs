00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello everyone is robert 87000 for 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.700
 a new resale buying video 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.820
 I hope you all go very well 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.260
 so I wanted to make a video 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.700
 really to help you during this 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.170
 period of head because doing the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.660
 scam sale during there all 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.170
 just it's very complicated I was 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.220
 the first impact and so why is it 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.600
 complicated simply there is 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.699
 a lot of players who have arrived 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.990
 at least the price range and 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.910
 which do not sell so in the end 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.800
 how to make sales scam when 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.029
 players do not sell even at 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.340
 lower of their price range 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.380
 it's almost impossible mission so 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.910
 the players we will try to target 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.100
 it's not necessarily very players 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.809
 dear but we will save two two types 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.219
 people 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.110
 boost players who are going to be at 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.530
 borrowings from credit 1 because we're going into 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.640
 find 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.340
 as we did you take a 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.649
 tech boost team as I had created there 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.149
 High up in the team you chalk team 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.100
 tips you take the tec boost like 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.570
 here and there the goal is not necessarily to 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.329
 to watch but especially not to 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.280
 buy above the price of ten thousand 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.600
 credit and you will succeed in making 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.800
 credits on it and I promise you that 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.339
 you go we found one of the players 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.780
 like that at less than 10000 credit each other 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.119
 solution for those with less 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.369
 credits is to be teak 650 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.240
 so there you put prymack 650 is this 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.500
 what are you going to do if you have 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.180
 watched the players who will finish in 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.100
 not long and you buy to in 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.430
 six-year function in it's too expensive 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.259
 for him who loose no it's too expensive 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.580
 also and you look like that will make me 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.070
 the aca 650 obviously that's 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.720
 interesting and you will find full 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.890
 of players like that who are selling when 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.659
 even more expensive than that normally 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.549
 and that you have to succeed to catch at 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.400
 unbeatable prices 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.979
 hop if we take you see looks and 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.600
 you got caught at 650 kagawa 700 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.140
 650m bonus chuckles at 650 kabila 605 when

 talk after behind luis gustavo 650 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.939
 kagawa 650 and there I just won 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.280
 dembélé at 700 dembélé I do not know 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.469
 how much this wind exactly but I 'm 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.100
 sure to make at least 300 400 credits on 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:08.220
 benefit if it's not worse 7000 8000 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.080
 7000 8000 7007 here is 1007 a price 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.860
 minimum he turned credit on 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.970
 only one player see 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.980
 damman if you have a lot of credit 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.210
 it can assemble a little complicated but 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.110
 in any case for those who do not have 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.640
 a lot of credit it's really a 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.650
 technique that is super safe and you 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.840
 go make a max credit on it 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.460
 it's really very simple everything is 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.200
 like it was in the 1002 1003 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.180
 bonus in the 1000s pretty much American 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.910
 in the myths 3004 cabella in the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.440
 thousand 3000 4 the best is that this 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.930
 would I get to achopper fellaini 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.320
 at 700 it is worth about in the 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.990
 media 1009 2000 but miralas amir al 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.040
 assil over the 1000 is certain 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.540
 despite lower prices I'm sure 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.100
 that he is above the 1000 then he goes 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.280
 not be well above, but that's it 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.410
 it's going to be a thousand miles are the same 1 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.420
 on this type of players there to get put 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.890
 a bit like young make the mistake but 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.739
 do not forget to put three days on it 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.810
 mocks time in the end because the 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.940
 player he will pick the player the most 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.530
 down and in the end your player will be 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.670
 necessarily attractive to him 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.620
 it's not like you're doing 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.790
 the ateq airplane or there it is important to 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.650
 put an hour for it to be in 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.239
 last page is in any case that his 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.739
 price is attractive compared to 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.170
 others that have not sold yet 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.110
 so that's the tech 650 it works from 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.220
 thunder really it works terry you 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.640
 see every day that I managed to 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.049
 take in less than an hour less than one 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.049
 hour for less than twenty minutes 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.070
 less than twenty minutes fellaini to 700 he 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.110
 must be at 2000 almost 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.470
 there is one there sometimes we find 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.910
 1 1002 true, let's go tell catherine 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.830
 must leave like little bit to my 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.450
 opinion it's not big bnf but at 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.880
 final I do not complete many texts 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.580
 compared to the price do you say that at 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.519
 do that no miles 3 that's where it's going 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.320
 do 6 552 bnf it's not bad huh it's 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.730
 not bad and as and when and it is 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.320
 sells the advantage very quickly when 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.880
 you put them in here at the lowest prices 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.930
 with others by putting on 3 days 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.489
 you do not need to teach yourself 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.370
 the head is important to have when 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.630
 same meaning at the level of the list of 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.340
 transfers so do not hesitate to the 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.690
 request and if you do not have in the 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.730
 comments there are plenty who have it 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.120
 thanks to that in the comments of 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.739
 videos 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.079
 the other point that I wanted to see with 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.430
 you this is compared to the jersey because 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.720
 that players like that but maybe 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.590
 after a while you are numerous to 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.870
 do it so it does not necessarily 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.180
 walk watch jerseys cd jersey 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.310
 even though we are priced at 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.240
 on it and I advise you not to 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.670
 to exceed 150 in taken to purchase 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.230
 like that and you 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.450
 fix on certain types of jerseys the 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.810
 see tonight the barca the minimum is at 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.510
 900 I want to put it at 1000 or 900 km 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.410
 at 9,100 and 150 holes sold 900 that's 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.240
 still super attractive 950 crazy king 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.160
 so I advise you to target in 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.420
 the jerseys the jersey of the team of 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.270
 france of the great nations jersey 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.030
 like that germany italy spain brazil 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.620
 it works very well and after real madrid 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.240
 barcelona bayern munich 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.040
 it's really the big three clubs that 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.780
 work best and after there are some 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.420
 small porto exceptions ago 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.800
 a lot of supporters so porto son 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.990
 jersey often rather well 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.970
 here you look at the outer jersey 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.860
 real madrid here I buy it at 150 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.980
 like this especially in this technique does 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.760
 did not exceed 150 must be bought at 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.710
 150 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.810
 and you will you make bubbles in 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.550
 North because see these 900 here 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.070
 900 does not feel the lowest price 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.410
 159 is so direct we are done when 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.790
 even a good big step on it for 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.190
 it bought well at a starting price 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.960
 auction only at 150 to be 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.060
 sure to make maximum profits 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.230
 on it here for this video she was 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.910
 very short but I think she was 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.890
 very important this channel you have been 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.430
 very many to ask me questions at 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.420
 make the purchase resale during the fabric 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.230
 obviously for big budget it's 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.610
 always more complicated in these 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.840
 periods as the price ranges 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.340
 players are already at the bottom of the 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.990
 price range that will have to 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.670
 wait it's the end of the tops prices 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.530
 will necessarily increase behind 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.630
 especially for the tots players so 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.310
 keep your credit if you do not open 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.720
 of Easter the marrow yesterday I did a 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.940
 pack opening because I had 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.930
 fifa points thanks to you but you 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.060
 do not open steps that you go 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.370
 lose credits you better keep them 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.230
 and buy toast behind 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.310
 you will be able to buy them 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.470
 at the lowest price we will see who is already 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.200
 at the lowest price but as soon as there will be 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.400
 more his players in top of the case anyway 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.980
 that they will be more available their 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.150
 prices vary increased so from if 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.310
 you have credits for example 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.050
 buy toc 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.370
 some like vera stems think he 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.170
 will work well in a lot of equipped 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.700
 of league 1 people will want it and seen 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.900
 that it will no longer be available at any 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.030
 pact for a while 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.590
 its price will increase and therefore inevitably 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.450
 it will be interesting so here's for the 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.000
 big budget you have to wait pretty much 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.130
 we will say Tuesday night ah yes it was 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.570
 Wednesday night you buy when they 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.800
 are lower for example is relative 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.000
 at prices this case you can buy from 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.110
 now but it's a shame to block 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.610
 credits for nothing 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.050
 you fall at the last moment and from 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.190
 the following days it's price goes 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.360
 start to increase because 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.160
 necessarily but will not be available 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.630
 in the bins so it will be more rare and 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.820
 obviously there are players who will want 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.110
 to have missed a market in 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.970

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.650
