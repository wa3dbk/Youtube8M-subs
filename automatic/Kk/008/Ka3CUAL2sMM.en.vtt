know give myself that chance because she

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.540 
know give myself that chance because she
was<00:00:28.380> playing<00:00:28.590> really<00:00:28.769> well<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.279> felt<00:00:29.490> that

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
was playing really well and I felt that

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.730 
was playing really well and I felt that
she<00:00:29.640> was<00:00:29.760> really<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.720> know<00:00:30.750> dominating<00:00:31.590> all

she was really you know dominating all

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.959 
she was really you know dominating all
the<00:00:31.769> points<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.309> because<00:00:32.550> she<00:00:32.669> was<00:00:32.759> stepping

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the points just because she was stepping

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.819 
the points just because she was stepping
in<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.360> taking<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.780> risks<00:00:34.079> early<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.739> it

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
in and taking the risks early on and it

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.280 
in and taking the risks early on and it
was<00:00:34.950> working<00:00:35.340> she<00:00:35.460> was<00:00:35.610> serving<00:00:35.790> well<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:37.050> I

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
was working she was serving well so I

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.170 
was working she was serving well so I
think<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.710> few<00:00:38.579> things<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.969> were<00:00:39.059> really

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
think a few things that were really

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.910 
think a few things that were really
going<00:00:39.450> well<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:39.930> had<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.379> know<00:00:40.410> my<00:00:40.590> forum

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
going well for I had you know my forum

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.020 
going well for I had you know my forum
wasn't<00:00:41.219> really<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> way<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:41.879> I

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
wasn't really going the way that I

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.580 
wasn't really going the way that I
wanted<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.480> hit<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> net<00:00:42.930> tape<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.260> few<00:00:43.440> times

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
wanted to hit the net tape a few times

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.580 
wanted to hit the net tape a few times
and<00:00:44.300> but<00:00:45.300> then<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.600> think<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.170> know<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.410> was<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and but then I think you know it was a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.170 
and but then I think you know it was a
smart<00:00:46.950> move<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.489> really<00:00:47.700> mix<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
smart move to just really mix it up a

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.069 
smart move to just really mix it up a
little<00:00:48.210> bit<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.629> beginning<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.989> that

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
little bit in the beginning of that

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.690 
little bit in the beginning of that

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
second set throw some high balls in

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
after after a couple of matches and

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.850 
after after a couple of matches and
everything<00:03:57.120> but<00:03:57.240> I'm<00:03:57.360> sure<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.570> when<00:03:57.960> you

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
everything but I'm sure that when you

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.290 
everything but I'm sure that when you
know<00:03:58.980> when<00:03:59.160> she<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.610> know<00:03:59.640> plays<00:03:59.910> with<00:04:00.090> bigger

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
know when she you know plays with bigger

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.910 
know when she you know plays with bigger
matches<00:04:00.510> she's<00:04:00.960> she's<00:04:01.440> going<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.620> be<00:04:01.740> ready

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
matches she's she's going to be ready

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.740 
matches she's she's going to be ready
for<00:04:02.160> then<00:04:02.460> you<00:04:02.880> know<00:04:03.120> she<00:04:03.210> doesn't<00:04:03.480> need<00:04:03.630> to

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
for then you know she doesn't need to

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.180 
for then you know she doesn't need to
think<00:04:03.900> that<00:04:04.020> many<00:04:04.260> steps<00:04:04.560> good<00:04:04.830> those<00:04:04.980> long

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
think that many steps good those long

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.830 
think that many steps good those long
legs<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:05.730> not<00:04:06.000> think<00:04:06.210> she<00:04:06.270> can<00:04:06.510> just<00:04:06.660> take

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
legs so you not think she can just take

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:18.330 
legs so you not think she can just take
the<00:04:06.870> pressure<00:04:07.170> off<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.410> little<00:04:07.620> bit<00:04:07.770> there

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.440 

above<00:04:18.579> the<00:04:18.730> rain

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.300 

look<00:04:22.140> I<00:04:22.320> really<00:04:22.530> hope<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:22.920> she's<00:04:23.100> not

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
look I really hope that she's not

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.250 
look I really hope that she's not
letting<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.640> get<00:04:23.790> to<00:04:23.850> her<00:04:24.090> because<00:04:24.570> you<00:04:25.110> know<00:04:25.140> I

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
letting it get to her because you know I

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.770 
letting it get to her because you know I
was<00:04:25.440> in<00:04:25.560> that<00:04:25.650> situation<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:27.000> few<00:04:27.210> years<00:04:27.570> ago

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
was in that situation a few years ago

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.540 
was in that situation a few years ago
where<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.440> know<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:28.590> was<00:04:28.830> number<00:04:29.040> one<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.310> not

dementieva<00:05:54.710> Kuznetsov<00:05:55.220> I've<00:05:55.669> kind<00:05:56.030> of<00:05:56.120> helped

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
dementieva Kuznetsov I've kind of helped

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.560 
dementieva Kuznetsov I've kind of helped
develop<00:05:57.350> I<00:05:57.470> think<00:05:57.680> 10<00:05:58.220> is<00:05:58.370> a<00:05:58.400> Russian<00:05:58.850> and<00:05:59.090> I

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
develop I think 10 is a Russian and I

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.969 
develop I think 10 is a Russian and I
think<00:05:59.960> that's<00:06:00.139> kind<00:06:00.470> of<00:06:00.530> what<00:06:00.680> we're<00:06:00.830> seeing

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
think that's kind of what we're seeing

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:03.490 
think that's kind of what we're seeing
right<00:06:01.100> now<00:06:01.250> is<00:06:01.400> that<00:06:01.729> it's<00:06:02.360> this<00:06:02.810> really<00:06:02.870> it's

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
right now is that it's this really it's

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.990 
right now is that it's this really it's
a<00:06:03.590> really<00:06:03.710> popular<00:06:03.949> sport<00:06:04.490> there<00:06:04.639> right<00:06:04.820> now

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
a really popular sport there right now

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.200 
a really popular sport there right now
and<00:06:05.240> then<00:06:05.419> so<00:06:05.930> I<00:06:05.960> guess<00:06:06.290> they<00:06:06.669> helped<00:06:07.669> creating

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
and then so I guess they helped creating

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.080 
and then so I guess they helped creating
those<00:06:08.300> tennis<00:06:08.660> players<00:06:08.930> that
