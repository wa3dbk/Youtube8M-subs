00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
when I'm the one cheesing so we'll see

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.660 
when I'm the one cheesing so we'll see
how<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.229> strategy<00:01:52.740> works<00:01:52.829> out<00:01:53.070> by<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.549> way

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
how this strategy works out by the way

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.649 
how this strategy works out by the way
if<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.850> guys<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.149> been<00:01:54.210> watching<00:01:54.390> this

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
what the heck do I have cooked up and my

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.459 
what the heck do I have cooked up and my
strategy<00:01:59.250> today<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.790> going<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.420> be<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.630> proxy

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
strategy today is going to be a proxy

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.270 
strategy today is going to be a proxy
for<00:02:02.990> basically<00:02:03.990> what<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> proxy<00:02:04.619> Thor<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.979> you

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
for basically what a proxy Thor is you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.340 
for basically what a proxy Thor is you
just<00:02:05.490> get<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.880> factory<00:02:06.689> down<00:02:06.930> right<00:02:07.200> outside

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
just get a factory down right outside

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.930 
just get a factory down right outside
your<00:02:07.560> opponent's<00:02:08.039> base<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.610> build<00:02:08.819> a

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
your opponent's base and you build a

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.160 
your opponent's base and you build a
Thor<00:02:09.619> it's<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:10.979> pretty<00:02:11.280> much<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.670> simple

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
Thor it's it's pretty much that simple

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.250 
Thor it's it's pretty much that simple
you<00:02:13.170> know<00:02:13.349> proxy<00:02:13.709> gave

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
you know proxy gave

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.210 
you know proxy gave
Stargate<00:02:14.709> broth<00:02:14.890> or<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:17.080> works<00:02:17.319> I've<00:02:18.010> seen

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
Stargate broth or so it works I've seen

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.280 
Stargate broth or so it works I've seen
it<00:02:18.370> work<00:02:18.519> few<00:02:18.970> times<00:02:19.090> before<00:02:19.299> good<00:02:20.079> players

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
it work few times before good players

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.429 
it work few times before good players
can<00:02:20.590> can<00:02:21.250> use<00:02:21.489> it<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.939> it<00:02:22.060> works<00:02:22.439> mostly

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
can can use it and it works mostly

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.350 
can can use it and it works mostly
against<00:02:23.860> protoss<00:02:24.280> I've<00:02:24.700> never<00:02:24.879> seen<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.269> work

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
against protoss I've never seen it work

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.479 
against protoss I've never seen it work
against<00:02:25.659> a<00:02:25.780> zerg<00:02:25.810> or<00:02:26.290> another<00:02:26.500> Terran<00:02:26.920> but<00:02:27.430> it

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
against a zerg or another Terran but it

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.559 
against a zerg or another Terran but it
works<00:02:27.640> really<00:02:27.790> well<00:02:27.909> against<00:02:28.150> protoss<00:02:28.420> the

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
works really well against protoss the

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:29.970 
works really well against protoss the
reason<00:02:28.810> for<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:28.959> is<00:02:29.049> because<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.349> thor<00:02:29.739> is

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
reason for that is because the thor is

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.069 
reason for that is because the thor is
can<00:02:30.280> crush<00:02:30.610> force<00:02:30.879> fields<00:02:31.209> yeah<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.840> guys

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
can crush force fields yeah you guys

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.630 
can crush force fields yeah you guys
didn't<00:02:32.319> know<00:02:32.379> that<00:02:32.560> it's<00:02:32.860> actually<00:02:33.459> an

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
didn't know that it's actually an

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.640 
didn't know that it's actually an
ability<00:02:33.849> that<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.269> Thor<00:02:34.450> has<00:02:34.659> that<00:02:34.989> doesn't

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
ability that the Thor has that doesn't

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.470 
ability that the Thor has that doesn't
really<00:02:35.799> get<00:02:35.920> seen<00:02:36.280> too<00:02:36.489> often<00:02:36.700> but<00:02:37.000> Thor's<00:02:37.269> and

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
really get seen too often but Thor's and

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.180 
really get seen too often but Thor's and
Colossus<00:02:37.870> can<00:02:38.019> actually<00:02:38.349> crush<00:02:38.650> for<00:02:38.920> students

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
Colossus can actually crush for students

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.550 
Colossus can actually crush for students
if<00:02:39.280> they<00:02:39.370> walk<00:02:39.489> over<00:02:39.819> them<00:02:39.940> so<00:02:40.870> if<00:02:41.200> your

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
if they walk over them so if your

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.479 
if they walk over them so if your
opponent<00:02:41.739> is<00:02:42.040> doing<00:02:42.640> three<00:02:42.879> gate<00:02:43.030> Expo<00:02:43.420> or

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
opponent is doing three gate Expo or

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.740 
opponent is doing three gate Expo or
well<00:02:45.489> pretty<00:02:45.670> much<00:02:45.790> three<00:02:46.030> good<00:02:46.180> Expo<00:02:46.480> if<00:02:46.659> he's

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
well pretty much three good Expo if he's

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.390 
well pretty much three good Expo if he's
doing<00:02:46.870> an<00:02:47.200> expo<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:47.590> he's<00:02:47.709> got<00:02:47.859> those<00:02:48.099> force

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
doing an expo and he's got those force

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.680 
doing an expo and he's got those force
fields<00:02:48.459> out<00:02:48.819> to<00:02:48.970> block<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.299> ramp<00:02:49.450> you<00:02:49.569> could

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
fields out to block the ramp you could

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.630 
fields out to block the ramp you could
just<00:02:49.780> walk<00:02:50.019> your<00:02:50.170> Thor<00:02:50.319> up<00:02:50.500> there<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:50.890> crush

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
just walk your Thor up there and crush

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.020 
just walk your Thor up there and crush
the<00:02:51.849> ramp<00:02:52.030> pretty<00:02:52.389> quickly<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:54.700> that's<00:02:54.940> the

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
the ramp pretty quickly so that's the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.270 
the ramp pretty quickly so that's the
basic<00:02:55.659> gist<00:02:55.870> behind<00:02:56.260> this<00:02:56.349> strategy<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:56.920> on

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
basic gist behind this strategy and on

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.530 
basic gist behind this strategy and on
top<00:02:57.639> of<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.760> it's<00:02:57.970> kind<00:02:58.060> of<00:02:58.150> cool<00:02:58.329> to<00:02:58.359> see

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
top of that it's kind of cool to see

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.520 
top of that it's kind of cool to see
your<00:02:58.629> opponent's<00:02:58.900> reaction<00:02:59.230> when<00:02:59.349> he<00:02:59.379> sees

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
your opponent's reaction when he sees

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.580 
your opponent's reaction when he sees
the<00:02:59.680> Thor<00:02:59.980> outside<00:03:00.879> his<00:03:01.060> base<00:03:01.269> but<00:03:01.569> I<00:03:01.989> am<00:03:02.560> a

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
the Thor outside his base but I am a

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.839 
the Thor outside his base but I am a
little<00:03:02.769> bit<00:03:02.950> late<00:03:03.099> right<00:03:03.280> now<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.519> supposed<00:03:03.790> to

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
little bit late right now is supposed to

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.849 
little bit late right now is supposed to
get<00:03:03.940> my<00:03:04.030> factory<00:03:04.420> down<00:03:04.599> as<00:03:04.900> soon<00:03:05.260> as<00:03:05.379> I<00:03:05.409> got<00:03:05.530> 100

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
get my factory down as soon as I got 100

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.849 
get my factory down as soon as I got 100
gas<00:03:06.299> unfortunately<00:03:07.299> i<00:03:07.329> forgot<00:03:08.139> to<00:03:08.170> scout<00:03:08.680> my

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
gas unfortunately i forgot to scout my

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.470

I'm gonna get my my factory right there
which<00:03:19.930> isn't<00:03:20.379> the<00:03:20.739> best<00:03:21.040> place<00:03:21.280> for<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.760> factory

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
which isn't the best place for a factory

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.330 
which isn't the best place for a factory
you<00:03:22.359> kind<00:03:22.629> of<00:03:22.660> want<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.870> build<00:03:23.049> it<00:03:23.139> where<00:03:23.980> your

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
you kind of want to build it where your

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.650 
you kind of want to build it where your
opponent<00:03:24.760> won't<00:03:24.879> see<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.329> and<00:03:25.540> unfortunately

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
little glimpse but a stalker did walk

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.220 
little glimpse but a stalker did walk
past<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.180> factory<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.690> was<00:03:31.780> like<00:03:31.870> oh<00:03:31.989> crap

past the factory and I was like oh crap
maybe<00:03:33.190> I<00:03:33.280> should<00:03:33.459> have<00:03:33.519> put<00:03:33.639> it<00:03:33.699> down<00:03:33.849> a<00:03:33.910> little

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
maybe I should have put it down a little

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.770 
maybe I should have put it down a little
bit<00:03:34.389> more<00:03:34.569> to<00:03:34.900> decide<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:36.609> we'll<00:03:37.209> see<00:03:37.569> what

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
happens hopefully he didn't see the

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.580 
happens hopefully he didn't see the

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
by that time I mean I don't know what

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.510 
by that time I mean I don't know what
his<00:04:44.900> reaction<00:04:45.320> was<00:04:45.380> right<00:04:45.590> now<00:04:45.710> hopefully<00:04:46.370> he

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
his reaction was right now hopefully he

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.560 
his reaction was right now hopefully he
was<00:04:46.630> panicking<00:04:47.630> but<00:04:48.530> it<00:04:49.520> was<00:04:49.670> actually<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.030> this

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
was panicking but it was actually a this

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.850 
was panicking but it was actually a this
is<00:04:50.690> actually<00:04:50.990> a<00:04:51.020> big<00:04:51.200> problem<00:04:51.500> for<00:04:51.620> me<00:04:51.740> because

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
is actually a big problem for me because

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.650 
is actually a big problem for me because
since<00:04:52.730> he's<00:04:52.880> seen<00:04:53.030> this<00:04:53.180> he<00:04:53.330> can<00:04:53.420> actually

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
since he's seen this he can actually

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.210 
since he's seen this he can actually
snipe<00:04:53.930> my<00:04:54.050> buildings<00:04:54.380> and<00:04:54.530> my<00:04:54.590> Thor's<00:04:54.830> just

snipe my buildings and my Thor's just
now<00:04:55.370> starting<00:04:55.700> to<00:04:55.760> build<00:04:55.910> as<00:04:56.060> you<00:04:56.120> guys<00:04:56.240> can

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
now starting to build as you guys can

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.140

unfortunately wasn't even get a bunker

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.420 
unfortunately wasn't even get a bunker
up<00:05:03.020> in<00:05:03.140> time<00:05:03.290> and<00:05:03.470> I<00:05:03.590> realized<00:05:04.010> okay<00:05:04.250> what<00:05:04.400> I

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430

and<00:05:09.560> basically<00:05:10.190> let<00:05:10.760> the<00:05:11.000> factory<00:05:11.540> tank<00:05:11.960> some

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
and basically let the factory tank some

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.800 
and basically let the factory tank some
damage<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:12.860> just<00:05:13.070> let<00:05:13.400> it<00:05:13.550> buy<00:05:13.820> time<00:05:14.180> while<00:05:14.480> I

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
damage and just let it buy time while I

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.540 
damage and just let it buy time while I
wait<00:05:15.020> for<00:05:15.050> my<00:05:15.200> STDs<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.770> come<00:05:15.950> so<00:05:16.130> I<00:05:16.160> was<00:05:16.280> hoping

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
wait for my STDs to come so I was hoping

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.030 
wait for my STDs to come so I was hoping
my<00:05:17.510> opponent<00:05:17.840> wouldn't<00:05:18.110> would<00:05:18.350> be<00:05:18.470> smart<00:05:18.800> and

my opponent wouldn't would be smart and

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.340 
my opponent wouldn't would be smart and
or<00:05:19.700> would<00:05:20.000> be<00:05:20.030> dumb<00:05:20.300> and<00:05:20.510> not<00:05:20.660> hit<00:05:20.840> my<00:05:20.960> factory

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
or would be dumb and not hit my factory
