00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
so get this list started we have

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.260 
so get this list started we have
Magneton<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.160> reason<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.550> cards<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.059> my

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
Magneton and the reason this cards in my

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.760 
Magneton and the reason this cards in my
list<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.840> because<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.430> artwork

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
list is because of the artwork

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.080 
list is because of the artwork
everything<00:00:52.770> looks<00:00:52.949> real<00:00:53.160> realistic<00:00:53.579> but<00:00:53.969> it's

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
everything looks real realistic but it's

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.099 
everything looks real realistic but it's
in<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> cartoon<00:00:55.020> style<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:56.180> I<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
in a cartoon style and I like the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.420 
in a cartoon style and I like the
mountains<00:00:58.500> here<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> think<00:00:59.160> these<00:00:59.399> look

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
mountains here if the I think these look

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.689 
mountains here if the I think these look
like<00:00:59.609> mountains<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.359> either<00:01:00.570> side<00:01:00.930> and

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
like mountains on either side and

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.529 
like mountains on either side and
Magneton<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:03.000> going<00:01:03.180> through<00:01:03.300> that

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
Magneton is just going through that

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.710 
Magneton is just going through that
narrow<00:01:03.930> opening<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:05.390> could<00:01:06.390> see<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.600> actually

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
narrow opening I could see it actually

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.620 
narrow opening I could see it actually
getting<00:01:07.049> crushed<00:01:07.380> between<00:01:07.680> there<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.299> just

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
getting crushed between there but I just

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.450 
getting crushed between there but I just
really<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.409> looks<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.040> all<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
really like the looks of it and all the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.100 
really like the looks of it and all the
screws<00:01:11.790> coming<00:01:12.150> out<00:01:12.240> from<00:01:12.420> magnet<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.840> just

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
screws coming out from magnet on just

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.550 
screws coming out from magnet on just
the<00:01:13.200> artwork<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.799> magnet<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.520> general

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
the artwork of magnet on in general

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.310 
the artwork of magnet on in general
number<00:01:16.560> nine<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.189> nods<00:01:17.610> leaf<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
number nine is nods leaf so I like the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.920 
number nine is nods leaf so I like the
realistic<00:01:19.950> feel<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> magnet<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.720> at

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.749 
realistic feel of the magnet on at
number<00:01:22.170> 10<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.920> card<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
number 10 this card I just like the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.570 
number 10 this card I just like the
bright<00:01:24.000> colors<00:01:25.100> nuzleaf<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.310> fairly

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
bright colors nuzleaf is fairly

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.149 
bright colors nuzleaf is fairly
realistic<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.450> then<00:01:27.630> all<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.710> bright<00:01:28.920> colors

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
realistic but then all the bright colors

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.390 
realistic but then all the bright colors
back<00:01:29.520> here<00:01:30.530> nazli<00:01:31.530> was<00:01:31.619> probably<00:01:31.890> doing<00:01:32.070> fake

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
back here nazli was probably doing fake

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.300 
back here nazli was probably doing fake
out<00:01:32.960> probably<00:01:33.960> not<00:01:34.110> gentle<00:01:34.619> slap<00:01:34.920> but

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
out probably not gentle slap but

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.980 
out probably not gentle slap but
probably<00:01:35.880> doing<00:01:36.119> fake<00:01:36.360> out<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.900> all

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
probably doing fake out and that all

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.630 
probably doing fake out and that all
these<00:01:37.170> bright<00:01:37.409> colors<00:01:37.439> are<00:01:37.950> coming<00:01:38.220> off<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.400> it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
these bright colors are coming off of it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.780 
these bright colors are coming off of it
that's<00:01:39.119> why<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.659> card<00:01:40.549> number<00:01:41.549> 8<00:01:41.640> in

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
that's why I like this card number 8 in

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.870 
that's why I like this card number 8 in
the<00:01:41.820> list<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.329> Blaziken<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.579> the<00:01:44.579> reason<00:01:44.820> i

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the list is Blaziken and the reason i

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.780 
the list is Blaziken and the reason i
like<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.180> card<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.920> looks<00:01:47.130> cool<00:01:47.369> since<00:01:47.640> as

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
a reverse holo but this is Blaziken in

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.149 
a reverse holo but this is Blaziken in
action<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.200> looks<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:52.770> fighting

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
action it looks like it's fighting
