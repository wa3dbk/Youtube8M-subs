00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.369
 fucking steps to upload a video that I feel 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.990
 for that part but good today I bring you 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.449

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.650
 in a job for you my player I think that 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.939
 in the streaming was the first 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.890
 games that I hit maps 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.960
 I had no fucking idea of ​​the maps and 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.609
 well then this morning has put 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.259

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.810
 of so many zombies it's time for 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.579
 upload a map gameplay from your map 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.480
 multiplayer and I jump two games 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:39.579
 is in dif online on the 24 a 30 a 30 3 and 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.649
 the other one in take off the stadium a 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.120
 remastered has been a 26 1 of vigo 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.070
 Well, let's put together the best of 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.260
 each game and so I put the others 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.850
 maps and it's pretty good talking about 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.530
 the maps are looking at all the faces 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.750
 days from now on in the description 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.780
 I always leave you a one page link 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.570
 code to buy a goal to buy 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.399
 xbox points and so on is not a page 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.960
 that I do not put it by chance 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.519
 what this page will do to me gives me sponsor 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.869
 and why I do not recommend it to you the truth 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.159
 that apart from the fact that it gives me 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.009
 sponsor is paying 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.350
 page you have to name your great 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.999
 offers offered because I the truth 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.789
 I got curious and gave some 

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:16.960
 offers points and goals quite 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.030
 pretty good better than you can 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.140
 find in the bazaar and well then I 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.600
 I recommend it in case you have thought 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.850
 buy the new maps talking about 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.579
 buy maps for the people of play 3 or 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.880
 even those from xbox 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.340
 it's really worth buying the dlc 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.049
 'apocalypse sincerely dads 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.299
 with multiplayer I think that of all 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.310
 the dlc have been the best 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.259
 many people like the previous DLCI 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.439
 of the bourget zombies because he had 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.450
 the psuv remastered the map of the island 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.729
 of the coffe that the truth many people 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.099
 you liked already you see that app 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.719
 except for the summit the kof map 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:55.329
 had a respawn sainz that is that in 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.459
 general the paintball map reaches you 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.950
 to catch a terrible hatred had a 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.659
 disgusting support and instead these 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.189
 maps is not to say good you're going to see a 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.329
 moment in this gameplay that kill me 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.709
 because these are the rest and 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.420
 Obviously, he has to appear 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.859
 the enemies but is that in the maps 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.599
 previous especially on the map of the 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:12.819
 island is that you appeared in the pussy face 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.010
 is that you were there with your hairline 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.299
 they placed a guy with the laser sight that 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.519
 I just had to shoot because 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.409
 you were there on his in your hip and it kills you 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.150
 I did not automatically fuck that much 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.920
 that backup but well then the maps 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.079
 multiplayer the truth that they are 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.370
 pretty good my favorites because it would be 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.340
 take off that is the stadium a 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.500
 remastered and well I do not know maybe I 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.599
 would stay with said frost that is the one of 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.700
 ice is the least I like maybe it's 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.650
 the one that attracts me the least is good 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.359
 I like what I say because it has 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.060
 got good games in them but 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:45.189
 well I think the dj eickhoff would be 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.599
 my favorites the pod that is the one of the 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.829
 serva is also pretty good too 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.139
 it's pretty good but I would stay with 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.669
 these two since that part for me 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.739
 are the best multiplayer maps that 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:55.629
 they have taken out the zombies 2 zombie copies 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.340
 as opined the best zombies I've 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.379
 I played since I've been playing 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.870
 zombies did not try those of the call of duty 5 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.939
 I did not try all the whites 1 so 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.799
 I do not know who to really think 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.719
 but really if you like innovation 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.699
 if you like things time that 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.829
 employ I do not know what canes things 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:13.030
 different banks is your map to me 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.879
 the truth is the one I liked the most 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.650
 those that I have played and really you what 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.420
 I recommend pretty clear 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.310
 once you have seen my videos 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.560
 from other people that you already know 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.239
 pretty much everything on the map and this play 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.159
 3 that you still can not play it but now 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.019
 you know the vast majority of things 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:32.920
 Of course I would already hesitate to buy it for 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:35.049
 what fuck takes away you like the one that takes away 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.609
 like that of trying a new map and 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.019
 discover the things you do not but good if 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.760
 you have not seen too many videos because 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.319
 you really want to book 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.439
 I recommend origins in general 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.349
 I recommend the apocalypse dlc 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:49.000
 apocalypse if it's the same fk's 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.409
 I liked it more and if you have thought 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.269
 buy one of whites two you can 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.549
 buy them this we are going to spend something else 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.650
 This has been my recommendation and 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.720
 my comment about whether it's worth 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.310
 buy the maps maps are seeing 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.139
 the drug owner, I'll have put you on 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.230
 john kilos is that for the first time 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:08.200
 has shown the video not according to a user 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.670
 has made a video the uncle I do not know if it was the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.280
 best in the world or Microsoft employee 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.139
 but he did not have his xbox one already installed 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.000
 in his house supported it looks like the 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.949
 turn on it looks like I do not know what I know good 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.359
 played raid and it's pretty good I 've 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.739
 cut the most important parts 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.780
 because there is one thing about everything that 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.280
 I want to analyze so I have here the 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.420
 prepared video let's comment 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.130
 a little bit because it's the first time 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.570
 you see a video these features 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.820
 here you see the uncle with the command of the 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.460
 xbox or the sound was lowered and then nothing 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.560
 that they are told I have the command here 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.389
 see the xbox one already supported that by the way 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.680
 it's full of dust the bastard is 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.000
 quite big as you know but 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.770
 good here has it supported that if 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.620
 tickets through here that if you enter through 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.030
 there pim pam and here it looks subtle and 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.680
 so we can see the interface what 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.840
 we are really interested when we see there 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.730
 how it gives to play raid that is in the 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.380
 big screen I do not know if I would have the 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.420
 installed game would be stuck in the 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.440
 in the cd slot but well you see what 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.450
 of always music friends settings 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.040
 internet search engine such the great novelty is 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.780
 what is the skype look to me I love 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.430
 that the xbox has a strong link with 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.350
 skype because I use a lot and that for 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.840
 record with my friends is going to be really 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.520
 a great help but really what I 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.230
 He liked it a lot, it 's that the guy 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.880
 puts you play Rise here you see how it is 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.670
 playing gives the button of the xbox to 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.500
 interface button the game comes out 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.870
 keeps reproducing as we see there from 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.100
 The fact remains that hearing has not been 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.380
 sound but good the game is still 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.180
 hearing and uncle what more thanks that 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.440
 what I like best is that you 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.850
 you can do what you want while you 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.710
 you are playing you can play music 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.030
 and such but what I like is that you're 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.890
 playing and maybe you can go to the 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.020
 sky perfectly and put you there to talk 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.190
 with friends here the game is paused because 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.200
 is when he has to start 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.320
 control it but not good I like it a lot 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.360
 because let's say it's multitasking then 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.400
 Well, I love it because you're playing 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.750
 you go out so you get into the ska and the game 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.030
 still in operation it does not have to 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.620
 close an application to open another 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.750
 that's where I want to get multitasking 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.700
 Well surely there will be many people 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.400
 I was obviously going to have this but I 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.820
 like to see it in practice 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.610
 because it's true that you're playing 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.460
 an application to a game and you go out and 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.320
 it is still working and you have 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.030
 seen the rachita in take off in stadiums 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.710
 remastered the truth that the maps 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.360
 they have quite a lot of coverage in 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.310
 Champions sites but it also depends 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.449
 of the people against you playing so 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.820
 nothing people I hope you liked the 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:24.960
 video this comment and nothing else we 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.960
 we see in another video bye bye
