00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.990
 I have extra if I am mine 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.849
 Career could have chosen because who 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.349
 I certainly have one thing in it 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.280
 that I am the trainer 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.780
 where so rarely plays under the dede 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.520
 And in the end his contract is not 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.570
 extended because I have it 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.310
 met and after a two weeks 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.900
 I phoned a friend 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.430
 and said the best player 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.650
 I ever hear the idea is yes 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.009
 unbelievable what fits that franck 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.170
 everything a player has then 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.790
 unfortunately he is also very much under me 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.020
 seriously injured at the cruciate ligament and in 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.489
 another really crucial one 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.480
 phase hurt again in the knee 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.200
 time marcel schmelzer has the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.300
 Development taken 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.680
 that is the very very positive thing about it 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.899
 Imagine no one gave the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.149
 ddr can put in the time now is 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.530
 a point in which you are in dr 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.059
 sign that the situation is for 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.300
 dede with us in the squad does not change 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.039
 becomes 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.780
 that is, and that's easy for 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.579
 someone who loves football so much he plays that way 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.260
 that's no football 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.149
 the situation to endure is an idea 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.539
 It is great in this club 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.100
 but he wants it at the same time 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.710
 playing football is no longer possible 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.909
 connect to and accordingly 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.170
 then the decision then actually 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.939
 liked together 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.280
 michael sorg of brought him here 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.170
 he has his football live for the long 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.780
 Imagine being a very important person 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.990
 is deciding that together 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.340
 which is not extended here and now 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.950
 he is looking for a new challenge and 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.570
 will definitely be another 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.040
 Bundesliga club still a lot 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.020
 can help but now with us 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.430
 the situation was not given and who the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.840
 idea children as a player then think that 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.950
 he finished the last five years at the end of five years 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.869
 years of his career on the bank 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.619
 except occasionally for 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.140
 to use 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.630
 that would be madness and therefore think 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.149
 I should go to the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.350
 fantastic years that had 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.399
 to say goodbye to one kind 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.020
 and maybe never 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.850
 football player was adopted in the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.829
 club and then easy 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.689
 We will be somewhere else 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.369
 footballing luck is back because 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.420
 we could no longer handle the situation 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.420
 represent there is true
