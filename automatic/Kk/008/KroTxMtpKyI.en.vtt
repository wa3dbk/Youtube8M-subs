kind<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.549> 55<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.299> doesn't<00:01:06.570> trigger

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
kind of like 55 but it doesn't trigger

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.899 
kind of like 55 but it doesn't trigger
too<00:01:07.049> frequently<00:01:07.530> however<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> ten<00:01:08.640> percent

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
too frequently however the ten percent

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.700 
too frequently however the ten percent
adds<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.240> when<00:01:09.390> you're<00:01:09.510> shooting<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> lot<00:01:10.560> of
