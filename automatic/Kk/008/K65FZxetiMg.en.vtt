00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.450 

so<00:00:02.580> Ian<00:00:02.909> why<00:00:03.270> is<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.629> sky<00:00:03.899> blue<00:00:03.980> well<00:00:04.980> it's<00:00:05.250> all

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
so Ian why is the sky blue well it's all

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.130 
so Ian why is the sky blue well it's all
to<00:00:05.700> do<00:00:05.850> with<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.210> fact<00:00:06.509> that<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.870> Sun

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
to do with the fact that the Sun

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.430 
to do with the fact that the Sun
produces<00:00:07.890> white<00:00:08.639> light<00:00:09.080> but<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.230> our

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
produces white light but the our

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.490 
produces white light but the our
atmosphere<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.450> full<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.630> stuff<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.139> much

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
atmosphere is full of stuff and much

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.650 
atmosphere is full of stuff and much
denser<00:00:13.950> than<00:00:14.099> space<00:00:14.460> what<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.240> understand

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
denser than space what I understand

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.480 
denser than space what I understand
about<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.870> Sun<00:00:16.139> producing<00:00:16.590> light<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
about the Sun producing light and the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.920 
about the Sun producing light and the
Earth's<00:00:17.640> atmosphere<00:00:17.850> being<00:00:18.359> quite<00:00:18.570> thick

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
Earth's atmosphere being quite thick

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.410 
Earth's atmosphere being quite thick
what's<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.010> do<00:00:20.130> with<00:00:20.160> color<00:00:20.520> leverage

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
what's that to do with color leverage

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.840 
what's that to do with color leverage
let<00:00:21.660> me<00:00:21.750> show<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.930> I've<00:00:22.380> fill<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.310> tank<00:00:23.609> with

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
let me show you I've fill this tank with

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.269 
let me show you I've fill this tank with
water<00:00:24.320> and<00:00:25.320> I'm<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.740> put<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:25.949> milk

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
water and I'm going to put this milk

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.820 
water and I'm going to put this milk
powder<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.720> this<00:00:27.930> will<00:00:28.140> represent<00:00:28.529> our

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
powder in it and this will represent our

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.830 
powder in it and this will represent our
omelet<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.400> actually<00:00:30.090> quite<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> good

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
omelet it is actually quite a good

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.900 
omelet it is actually quite a good
representation<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> atmosphere<00:00:32.520> because

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
representation of the atmosphere because

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.420 
representation of the atmosphere because
the<00:00:33.210> milk<00:00:33.390> powder<00:00:33.800> represents<00:00:34.800> all<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.250> water

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
the milk powder represents all the water

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.840 
the milk powder represents all the water
droplets<00:00:35.940> all<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:37.020> dust<00:00:37.290> all<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.010> pollen<00:00:38.670> and

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
droplets all the dust all the pollen and

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.450 
droplets all the dust all the pollen and
all<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.450> other<00:00:39.600> particles<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.800> the

all the other particles in the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.410 
all the other particles in the
atmosphere<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.989> our<00:00:43.860> Sun<00:00:44.420> producing

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
atmosphere and this is our Sun producing

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.779 
atmosphere and this is our Sun producing
nice<00:00:45.750> white<00:00:46.410> light<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.399> doesn't

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
nice white light just like it doesn't

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.330 
nice white light just like it doesn't
space<00:00:48.000> us<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.629> sunlight<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.110> space<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.559> white

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
space us the sunlight in space is white

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.990 
space us the sunlight in space is white
now<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.120> lure<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:52.320> sunlight<00:00:52.860> into<00:00:53.850> our

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
now if I lure the sunlight into our

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.110 
now if I lure the sunlight into our
atmosphere<00:00:54.210> you'll<00:00:54.600> see<00:00:54.780> what<00:00:54.960> happens

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
atmosphere you'll see what happens

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.849 
atmosphere you'll see what happens
yes<00:00:57.120> well<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.690> light<00:00:57.930> around<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.590> beam

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
yes well the light around the beam

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.000 
yes well the light around the beam
appears<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.149> blue<00:01:00.660> right<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.649> if<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.829> look

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
appears to be blue right and if I look

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.929 
appears to be blue right and if I look
around<00:01:03.229> into<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> end<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.920> tank<00:01:05.250> or<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
around into the end of the tank or the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.109 
around into the end of the tank or the
sun's<00:01:06.299> light<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:07.470> looks<00:01:07.619> yellow<00:01:07.979> well<00:01:08.820> yes

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
sun's light it looks yellow well yes

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.179 
sun's light it looks yellow well yes
that's<00:01:09.330> because<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.439> know<00:01:10.590> white<00:01:10.920> light

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
that's because as you know white light

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.880 
that's because as you know white light
is<00:01:11.369> made<00:01:11.549> up<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.760> all<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.570> colors<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.409> our

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
is made up of all the colors in our

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.820 
is made up of all the colors in our
spectrum<00:01:14.250> now<00:01:15.030> all<00:01:15.330> these<00:01:15.570> colors<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.470> pushed

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
spectrum now all these colors get pushed

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.760 
spectrum now all these colors get pushed
about<00:01:17.040> by<00:01:17.820> our<00:01:18.119> atmosphere<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:19.650> so

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
about by our atmosphere and it just so

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.100 
about by our atmosphere and it just so
happens<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.729> blue<00:01:21.119> light<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.960> one

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
happens that the blue light is the one

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.740 
happens that the blue light is the one
that<00:01:22.290> scattered<00:01:22.890> most<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.400> all<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.540> when

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
that scattered most of all and so when

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.300 
that scattered most of all and so when
you<00:01:24.900> shine<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.439> white<00:01:25.799> light<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you shine a white light in the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.950 
you shine a white light in the
atmosphere<00:01:26.430> all<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.299> blue<00:01:27.509> light<00:01:27.720> is

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
atmosphere all the blue light is

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.690 
atmosphere all the blue light is
scattered<00:01:28.049> all<00:01:28.439> over<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.979> place<00:01:29.100> all<00:01:29.640> over

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
scattered all over the place all over

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.149 
scattered all over the place all over
the<00:01:30.150> sky<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.750> fact<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.500> course<00:01:31.710> when<00:01:32.040> you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the sky in fact and of course when you

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.810 
the sky in fact and of course when you
take<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.670> blue<00:01:32.880> cars<00:01:33.210> away<00:01:34.340> from<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
take the blue cars away from the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.420 
take the blue cars away from the
sunlight<00:01:36.090> you're<00:01:36.630> left<00:01:36.930> with<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.430> yellowish

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
sunlight you're left with a yellowish

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.880 
sunlight you're left with a yellowish
leukemia<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.570> that's<00:01:39.900> why<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.590> Sun<00:01:40.860> looks

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
leukemia and that's why the Sun looks

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.060 
leukemia and that's why the Sun looks
yellow<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.170> take<00:01:43.320> away<00:01:43.619> some<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
yellow so if you take away some of the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.130 
yellow so if you take away some of the
colors<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.430> make<00:01:44.729> up<00:01:44.909> white<00:01:45.149> light<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.960> get

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
colors that make up white light you get

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.620 
colors that make up white light you get
a<00:01:46.170> new<00:01:46.470> color<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.549> case<00:01:47.850> taking<00:01:48.210> away<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
a new color in this case taking away the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.749 
a new color in this case taking away the
blue<00:01:48.840> use<00:01:49.140> yellow<00:01:49.590> as<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.920> predominant<00:01:50.250> color

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
blue use yellow as the predominant color

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.399 
blue use yellow as the predominant color
giving<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.630> yellow<00:01:51.930> color<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.500> Sun

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
giving the yellow color of the Sun

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.139 
giving the yellow color of the Sun
que<00:01:53.590> venía<00:01:53.920> but<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.249> Sun<00:01:54.460> doesn't<00:01:54.729> just<00:01:54.999> look

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
que venía but the Sun doesn't just look

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.700 
que venía but the Sun doesn't just look
yellow<00:01:55.420> because<00:01:55.869> in<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.079> late<00:01:56.200> evening<00:01:56.409> when

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
yellow because in the late evening when

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.980 
yellow because in the late evening when
it's<00:01:56.859> setting<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.520> can<00:01:57.549> look<00:01:58.060> red<00:01:58.359> and<00:01:58.630> what's

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
it's setting it can look red and what's

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.169 
it's setting it can look red and what's
going<00:01:59.200> on<00:01:59.319> there<00:01:59.530> is<00:01:59.799> it<00:02:00.039> more<00:02:00.759> blue<00:02:00.999> light

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
going on there is it more blue light

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.059 
going on there is it more blue light
being<00:02:01.420> scattered<00:02:01.600> maybe<00:02:02.140> yes<00:02:02.649> more<00:02:02.890> blue

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
being scattered maybe yes more blue

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.800 
being scattered maybe yes more blue
light<00:02:03.100> is<00:02:03.520> being<00:02:03.819> scattered<00:02:04.090> but<00:02:04.359> something

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
light is being scattered but something

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.319 
light is being scattered but something
else<00:02:04.929> is<00:02:05.170> happening<00:02:05.409> as<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.189> Sun<00:02:06.429> starts<00:02:07.270> to

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
else is happening as the Sun starts to

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.719 
else is happening as the Sun starts to
set<00:02:07.450> in<00:02:07.630> laws<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:09.129> light<00:02:09.310> has<00:02:09.549> to<00:02:09.700> travel

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
set in laws the light has to travel

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.119 
set in laws the light has to travel
farther<00:02:10.539> and<00:02:10.929> farther<00:02:11.230> through<00:02:11.980> the

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
farther and farther through the

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.670 
farther and farther through the
atmosphere<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.330> course<00:02:13.510> means<00:02:13.810> even

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
atmosphere and that of course means even

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.770 
atmosphere and that of course means even
more<00:02:14.709> stuff<00:02:15.250> or<00:02:15.489> more<00:02:15.730> particles<00:02:16.480> but<00:02:16.720> they

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
more stuff or more particles but they

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.050 
more stuff or more particles but they
like<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:16.959> travel<00:02:17.260> through<00:02:17.590> exactly<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.819> can

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
like to travel through exactly and I can

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.360 
like to travel through exactly and I can
get<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.330> same<00:02:19.569> result<00:02:19.959> by<00:02:20.230> adding<00:02:20.620> yet<00:02:21.099> more

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
get the same result by adding yet more

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.710 
get the same result by adding yet more
nut<00:02:21.940> powder<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.540> our<00:02:22.660> sky<00:02:22.989> here<00:02:23.590> goes<00:02:24.420> as<00:02:25.420> the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
nut powder to our sky here goes as the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.119 
nut powder to our sky here goes as the
Sun<00:02:25.959> travels<00:02:26.440> through<00:02:26.620> more<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:26.920> the

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
Sun travels through more of the

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.520 
Sun travels through more of the
atmosphere<00:02:27.160> even<00:02:28.150> more<00:02:28.599> blue<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:28.989> scattered

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
atmosphere even more blue is scattered

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.890 
atmosphere even more blue is scattered
making<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.310> sun's<00:02:30.549> light<00:02:30.819> more<00:02:31.239> orange<00:02:31.660> II

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
making the sun's light more orange II

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.050 
making the sun's light more orange II
then<00:02:32.590> some<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.160> yellows<00:02:33.489> are<00:02:33.700> absorbed<00:02:34.030> by

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
then some of the yellows are absorbed by

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.059 
then some of the yellows are absorbed by
the<00:02:34.180> atmosphere<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:35.500> when<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.739> take<00:02:35.920> the

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
the atmosphere and when you take the

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.860 
the atmosphere and when you take the
blues<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.579> the<00:02:36.819> yellows<00:02:36.849> away<00:02:37.420> from<00:02:37.660> white

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
blues and the yellows away from white

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.259 
blues and the yellows away from white
light<00:02:38.140> you're<00:02:38.769> left<00:02:38.980> with<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.250> red<00:02:39.549> color<00:02:39.910> and

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
light you're left with a red color and

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.330 
light you're left with a red color and
that's<00:02:40.750> why<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.049> Sun<00:02:41.410> just<00:02:41.769> as<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.040> sets

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
that's why the Sun just as it sets

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.580 
that's why the Sun just as it sets
appears<00:02:42.730> red<00:02:43.379> okay

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
appears red okay

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.039 
appears red okay
so<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.099> leaves<00:02:45.280> us<00:02:45.430> with<00:02:45.609> the<00:02:45.760> red<00:02:45.970> but<00:02:46.930> it

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
so that leaves us with the red but it

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.470 
so that leaves us with the red but it
also<00:02:47.260> leaves<00:02:47.739> us<00:02:47.920> with<00:02:48.099> green<00:02:48.459> now<00:02:49.060> I've<00:02:49.269> seen

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
also leaves us with green now I've seen

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.809 
also leaves us with green now I've seen
some<00:02:49.540> very<00:02:49.780> red<00:02:50.109> sunsets<00:02:50.680> but<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:50.950> have<00:02:51.340> never

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
some very red sunsets but I have never

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.449 
some very red sunsets but I have never
seen<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.599> green<00:02:52.870> sunset<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.950> does<00:02:54.220> happen

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
seen a green sunset it does happen

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.910 
seen a green sunset it does happen
sometimes<00:02:54.609> if<00:02:55.390> you're<00:02:55.660> very<00:02:56.019> very<00:02:56.170> lucky

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
sometimes if you're very very lucky

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.009 
sometimes if you're very very lucky
normally<00:02:57.819> of<00:02:57.910> course<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.299> red<00:02:58.480> light<00:02:58.690> is<00:02:58.840> so

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
normally of course the red light is so

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.839 
normally of course the red light is so
strong<00:02:59.349> that<00:02:59.380> you<00:02:59.950> don't<00:03:00.130> even<00:03:00.220> notice<00:03:00.519> the

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
strong that you don't even notice the

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.000 
strong that you don't even notice the
green<00:03:01.060> but<00:03:01.989> if<00:03:02.380> you're<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.799> right<00:03:02.950> place

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
green but if you're in the right place

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.069 
green but if you're in the right place
at<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.519> right<00:03:03.700> time<00:03:03.810> something<00:03:04.810> fantastic

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
at the right time something fantastic

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.339 
at the right time something fantastic
happens<00:03:05.980> just<00:03:06.639> as<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:07.030> red<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.780> dipping<00:03:08.109> below

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
happens just as the red is dipping below

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.979 
happens just as the red is dipping below
the<00:03:08.500> horizon<00:03:08.739> was<00:03:09.459> only<00:03:09.940> green<00:03:10.269> left<00:03:10.540> and

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
the horizon was only green left and

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.409 
the horizon was only green left and
that's<00:03:11.290> called<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.859> green<00:03:12.099> flash<00:03:12.519> it<00:03:13.180> only

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:13.419 
that's called the green flash it only

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.750 
that's called the green flash it only
lasts<00:03:13.780> over<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.959> second<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.739> it's<00:03:15.190> easier<00:03:15.609> to

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
lasts over a second and it's easier to

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.150 
lasts over a second and it's easier to
see<00:03:15.940> from<00:03:16.150> space<00:03:16.359> at<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.840> nelle<00:03:17.079> but<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.950> does

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
see from space at the nelle but it does

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.490 
see from space at the nelle but it does
happen<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.299> very<00:03:19.510> lucky<00:03:19.840> scientist<00:03:20.349> in

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
happen and a very lucky scientist in

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.039 
happen and a very lucky scientist in
America<00:03:21.010> managed<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.549> film<00:03:21.819> it<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:22.690> as<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:22.930> can

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
America managed to film it so as you can

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.990 
America managed to film it so as you can
see<00:03:23.109> all<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.709> fantastic<00:03:24.130> colors<00:03:24.669> that<00:03:24.819> make

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
see all the fantastic colors that make

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.059 
see all the fantastic colors that make
up<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.299> sky<00:03:25.569> happen<00:03:26.410> because<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.799> Sun

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
up the sky happen because the Sun

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.180 
up the sky happen because the Sun
produces<00:03:27.669> white<00:03:27.880> light
