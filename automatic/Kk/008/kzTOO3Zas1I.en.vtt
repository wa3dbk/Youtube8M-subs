00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
going to be another in my series about

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.910 
going to be another in my series about
the<00:00:08.189> wooden<00:00:08.370> homemade<00:00:08.820> box<00:00:09.090> traps<00:00:09.920> apparently

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
the wooden homemade box traps apparently

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.950 
the wooden homemade box traps apparently
two<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.610> videos<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:12.120> made<00:00:12.360> never<00:00:12.750> got

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
two of the videos I made never got

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.430 
two of the videos I made never got
posted<00:00:14.450> or<00:00:15.450> at<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.870> very<00:00:15.900> least<00:00:16.109> they<00:00:16.379> were

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
posted or at the very least they were

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.890 
posted or at the very least they were
posted<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.070> removed<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.420> get<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> lot<00:00:18.810> of

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
posted and removed and so I get a lot of

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.210 
posted and removed and so I get a lot of
questions<00:00:19.289> about<00:00:19.410> how<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.710> build<00:00:19.920> one<00:00:20.160> of

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
questions about how to build one of

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.070 
questions about how to build one of
these<00:00:20.369> I'm<00:00:20.910> not<00:00:20.970> going<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.300> do<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.570> again<00:00:21.900> too

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
these I'm not going to do that again too

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.759 
these I'm not going to do that again too
much<00:00:22.260> work

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
much work

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.439 
much work
plus<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.130> have<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> whole<00:00:23.490> lot<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.789> metal<00:00:24.029> traps<00:00:24.269> I

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
plus I have a whole lot of metal traps I

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.990 
plus I have a whole lot of metal traps I
use<00:00:24.630> now<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.900> very<00:00:25.199> rarely<00:00:25.260> use<00:00:25.769> these<00:00:26.189> one<00:00:26.970> of

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
use now I very rarely use these one of

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.120 
use now I very rarely use these one of
the<00:00:27.119> problems<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.689> had<00:00:27.930> with<00:00:28.140> these<00:00:28.320> was<00:00:28.830> that

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the problems I had with these was that

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.859 
the problems I had with these was that
if<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.490> squirrel<00:00:29.789> gets<00:00:30.060> caught<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.660> they

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
if a squirrel gets caught in it they

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.160 
if a squirrel gets caught in it they
will<00:00:31.080> eat<00:00:31.439> their<00:00:31.769> self<00:00:32.099> out<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.610> there<00:00:33.140> so<00:00:34.140> you

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
will eat their self out of there so you

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.709 
will eat their self out of there so you
need<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.590> line<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.950> entire<00:00:35.280> inside<00:00:35.940> with<00:00:36.360> some

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
need to line the entire inside with some

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.900 
need to line the entire inside with some
some<00:00:37.079> kind<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.500> hardware<00:00:38.100> cloth<00:00:38.399> or<00:00:38.640> something

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
some kind of hardware cloth or something

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.100 
some kind of hardware cloth or something
to<00:00:38.969> keep<00:00:39.120> squirrels<00:00:39.480> from<00:00:39.719> eating<00:00:39.899> their<00:00:39.989> way

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
to keep squirrels from eating their way

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.660 
to keep squirrels from eating their way
out<00:00:40.460> but<00:00:42.469> one<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> other<00:00:44.100> videos<00:00:44.489> that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
out but one of the other videos that

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.510 
out but one of the other videos that
disappeared<00:00:45.800> was<00:00:46.800> how<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> whole<00:00:47.309> mechanism

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
disappeared was how the whole mechanism

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.590 
disappeared was how the whole mechanism
worked<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:49.020> if<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.950> if<00:00:50.280> I'm<00:00:50.489> still<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.480> it

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
worked and if I if I'm still have it

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.990 
worked and if I if I'm still have it
somewhere<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.140> can't<00:00:52.469> find<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.160> we're

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
somewhere I just can't find it so we're

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.330 
somewhere I just can't find it so we're
gonna<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.449> right<00:00:54.719> now<00:00:55.129> what<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.309> have

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
gonna do this right now what you have

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.639 
gonna do this right now what you have
here<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.469> a<00:00:58.469> door<00:00:58.829> and<00:01:00.109> then<00:01:01.109> you've<00:01:01.289> got<00:01:01.500> this

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
here is a door and then you've got this

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.190 
here is a door and then you've got this
fulcrum<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.899> lever<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.400> trigger<00:01:06.200> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
fulcrum the lever and the trigger the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.740 
fulcrum the lever and the trigger the
way<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.710> works<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.000> fulcrum<00:01:09.600> is

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
way this works is that the fulcrum is

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.410 
way this works is that the fulcrum is
not<00:01:10.530> connected<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.580> simply<00:01:12.030> sitting

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
not connected it's just simply sitting

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.289 
not connected it's just simply sitting
in<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.600> hole<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.670> register<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
in a hole to it so that can register and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.740 
in a hole to it so that can register and
then<00:01:15.390> there's<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.630> little<00:01:15.869> groove<00:01:16.680> cut<00:01:17.009> up<00:01:17.189> here

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
then there's a little groove cut up here

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.450 
then there's a little groove cut up here
where<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.840> registers<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> reason<00:01:20.340> for

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
where it registers so and the reason for

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.770 
where it registers so and the reason for
that<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:20.880> when<00:01:21.330> they're<00:01:21.479> staying

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
that is that when they're staying

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.510 
that is that when they're staying
triggers<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.439> want<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.040> parts<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.400> go

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
triggers you want all the parts to go

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.460 
triggers you want all the parts to go
flying<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.060> don't<00:01:24.240> want<00:01:24.360> anything<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:25.049> can

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
flying you don't want anything that can

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.380 
flying you don't want anything that can
fall<00:01:25.710> into<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> trap<00:01:26.400> or<00:01:26.759> around<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.150> trap

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
fall into the trap or around the trap

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.649 
fall into the trap or around the trap
that<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.600> animal<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.619> heat<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.659> you

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that the animal can heat on and you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.300 
that the animal can heat on and you
don't<00:01:30.840> want<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.259> get<00:01:31.320> jam<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.130> door

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
don't want it to get jam up and the door

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.249 
don't want it to get jam up and the door
not<00:01:32.490> shut<00:01:32.729> always<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.390> all<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.900> kind<00:01:34.170> of

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
not shut always so all this just kind of

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.450 
not shut always so all this just kind of
collapses<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.920> itself<00:01:37.189> hopefully<00:01:38.189> you

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
collapses on itself hopefully you

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.460 
collapses on itself hopefully you
understand<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> door<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.420> tied<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> lever

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
understand the door is tied to the lever

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.289 
understand the door is tied to the lever
and<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.040> triggers<00:01:41.369> tied<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.880> lever<00:01:42.060> but

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and the triggers tied to the lever but

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.910 
and the triggers tied to the lever but
they're<00:01:42.479> not<00:01:42.659> connected<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.320> any<00:01:43.439> way<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
they're not connected in any way to the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.550 
they're not connected in any way to the
fulcrum<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.840> what<00:01:45.840> we're<00:01:45.960> gonna<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.290> here<00:01:46.530> is

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
fulcrum so what we're gonna do here is
