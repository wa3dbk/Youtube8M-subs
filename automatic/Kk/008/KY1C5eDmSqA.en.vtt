00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.350 
without it because it was cheaper but I
do<00:02:07.979> recommend<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.700> you're<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.149> sunny

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
do recommend it if you're in a sunny

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.660 
do recommend it if you're in a sunny
place<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.890> Sun<00:02:11.160> will<00:02:11.340> come<00:02:11.370> into

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
place because the Sun will come into

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.010 
place because the Sun will come into
these<00:02:11.910> top<00:02:12.180> parts

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
these top parts

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.890 
these top parts

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.100 
and then you will be kind of blinded a
little<00:02:16.110> bit<00:02:17.000> but<00:02:18.000> there<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> ton<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.720> inning
