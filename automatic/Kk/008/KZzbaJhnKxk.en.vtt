00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.170
 fourth generation of the legendary subaru 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.240
 forester 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.640
 in general, subaru is not just cars 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.390
 this is a whole religion lifestyle philosophy 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.669
 if you want to 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.500
 food has long been considered major 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.779
 subaru brand buyers were people 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.669
 who love speed and adrenaline 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.590
 but in recent years, the company subaru 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.110
 significantly expanded the circle of buyers 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.149
 due to the fact that to powerful boxer 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.600
 engine and unique complete system 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.249
 the drive added a lot of comfort and 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.679
 modern electronic chips 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:49.249
 meet the subaru forester fourth 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.249
 generations 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.110
 changes in appearance mainly 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.180
 touched the front of the car this 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.090
 updated grille sharp 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.159
 headlights new bumper and forster noticeable 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.869
 grew up and became higher now its clearance 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.159
 makes an impressive 220 millimeters 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.680
 subaru forester under the hood 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.570
 is legendary horizontal 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.149
 boxer engine in this case 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.259
 two and a half liter capacity 171 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.060
 Horsepower 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.039
 the manufacturer assures that its consumption 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.899
 makes up a combined cycle of only 8 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.850
 and 2 liters per 100 kilometers also 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.429
 forster are equipped with engines 2 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.009
 aspirated liter capacity of 150 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.289
 horsepower and the most charged version 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.350
 and bones and comes with a double 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.420
 turbocharged 241 horsepower with 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.710
 younger 2-liter engine you can 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.479
 buy a car like ours 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.640
 step mechanics and variator 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.750
 but two and a half liters and 20 turbo 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.970
 only on the variator 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.190
 here is a fundamentally new variator 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.869
 the line of tronic time and replaced the chain of it 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.720
 which greatly increased its reliability 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.110
 improved dynamics and significantly reduced 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.489
 fuel consumption first thing 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.869
 striking this magnified 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.370
 a doorway appeared like that 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.080
 extra glasses which 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.790
 significantly increase the review at all 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.470
 interior new forster converted 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.709
 very much special attention 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.330
 given the quality of finish here we see 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.129
 we have a brand new instrument 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.750
 a panel with such an interesting board 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.670
 a computer that shows not only 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.370
 fuel consumption information 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.200
 active safety systems also 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.269
 self-diagnostic information panel 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.550
 not overloaded with any buttons here 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.349
 there is only a multimedia unit 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.300
 systems with navigation and 2-zone 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.640
 climate control is controlled by such 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.160
 here are very comfortable 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.170
 see the presence of various pockets of niches 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.940
 for various small things is very convenient 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.780
 is now the heat button 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.150
 the seats 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.209
 Well, here's one minus the highlight in 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.010
 visors they somehow you did not 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.719
 very comfortable multifunction steering wheel 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.879
 also convenient block buttons on the side 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:04.609
 the driver and finally he got 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.819
 full backlight but most importantly 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:10.430
 what struck me was this electric drive 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.159
 trunk and its opening angle can 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.829
 well program it in advance and now 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.689
 volume is an impressive 505 liters 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.269
 and if you fold the rear seat pay 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:25.629
 attention as they add up 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.629
 the volume will increase and will be 1584 liters 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.409
 this is how every test drive passes 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.269
 for customers subaru auto when 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.069
 new factor flies into development 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.579
 graders keep driving like a 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.430
 rails 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.079
 the client has all the questions and all 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.450
 this is because engineers are coordinated 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.120
 redesigned suspension making it more a 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.909
 collected and energy-intensive all the irregularities 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.010
 forza swallow without a hint of 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.139
 breakdown due to more massive 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.569
 stabilizer managed to significantly reduce 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.109
 body roll give the body became noticeable 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.329
 tougher 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.280
 all this provides a new card not 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.379
 just great handling and 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.909
 stability regardless of coverage 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:09.350
 but also has a positive effect on quality 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.180
 sound insulation 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.860
 another innovation is the si system 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.720
 drive and before that she installed 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.459
 so much on impreza alexis theo and 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.350
 charged legacy outback versions 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.540
 switching buttons you completely change 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.760
 car behavior on the road is not 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.550
 confuse this system with a fake button 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.770
 sport on modern machines 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.930
 really working system which 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.060
 allows you to change the work not only 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.470
 engine but also the boxes in general in words 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:40.230
 it does not explain it just need 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:42.030
 feel the new forester 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.650
 positioned as safe 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.750
 comfortable urban crossover and this 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.060
 really so but moving on it 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.480
 the city you deprive yourself 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.480
 delicious 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.750
 if you have no experience driving a 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.450
 feel professional at 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.640
 off road really hurts then 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.690
 an electronic system to help you 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.540
 it takes into account the parameters of the rotation of the moon 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:14.800
 wind speed motor parameters and 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.800
 lets you make an example of this 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.220
 but if you disable xmod 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:49.440
 and so to speak dissolve all the system 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.440
 then you can do this 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.509
 ate 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.850
 As for the cons, there is no 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.080
 up and down front adjustment 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.780
 passenger seat 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.240
 no backlight in the visor and on 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.090
 two-liter versions no cruise control 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.510
 but the main disadvantage of this car 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.820
 this sensation of permissiveness causing 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.340
 serious addiction and dependence 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.770
 having experienced it as we have experienced today 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.620
 you are no longer in another car 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.880
 forester is one hundred percent 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.440
 driven controlled car 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.270
 who is not afraid of any meandering 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.320
 turns no snow barriers and so 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.360
 more off-road 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.910
 it combines all the modern 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.300
 security technology comfort prices 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.710
 new for star start at 1 million 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.350
 169 thousand and ends at 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:51.410
 million in 829 thousand to 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.390
 expensive but trust me it is worth it 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.640
 Sign up for a test drive of the new subaru 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:59.210
 forester in the cabin avia car on the street 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.670
 Belyaev 58 I am sure you will like on 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.660
 this all you looked at hire see you soon 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.660
 meetings and good luck on the roads
