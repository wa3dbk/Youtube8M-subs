00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
influence of Jimmy Choo who I've been a

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.960 
influence of Jimmy Choo who I've been a
fan<00:01:34.480> up<00:01:34.660> for<00:01:34.870> many<00:01:35.830> many<00:01:35.980> years<00:01:36.100> well

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
fan up for many many years well

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.670 
fan up for many many years well
obviously<00:01:37.450> it's<00:01:37.780> brilliant<00:01:38.200> because<00:01:38.260> it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
obviously it's brilliant because it

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.500 
obviously it's brilliant because it
means<00:01:38.830> everyone<00:01:39.400> can<00:01:39.610> afford<00:01:39.730> it<00:01:40.150> and<00:01:40.300> where

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
means everyone can afford it and where

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.910 
means everyone can afford it and where
Jimmy<00:01:40.840> Choo<00:01:41.050> I<00:01:41.320> think<00:01:41.650> though<00:01:41.890> that

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
Jimmy Choo I think though that

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.250 
Jimmy Choo I think though that
tomorrow's<00:01:42.580> ethos<00:01:42.970> is<00:01:43.270> kind<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:43.930> like<00:01:44.050> she

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
tomorrow's ethos is kind of like she

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.960 
tomorrow's ethos is kind of like she
wants<00:01:44.530> everyone<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:44.920> be<00:01:45.070> able<00:01:45.160> to<00:01:45.400> be<00:01:45.520> stylish

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
wants everyone to be able to be stylish

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.020 
wants everyone to be able to be stylish
so<00:01:46.210> this<00:01:46.360> is<00:01:46.480> like<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.750> ideal<00:01:47.020> way<00:01:47.080> I<00:01:47.560> love<00:01:48.250> hmm

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
so this is like the ideal way I love hmm
