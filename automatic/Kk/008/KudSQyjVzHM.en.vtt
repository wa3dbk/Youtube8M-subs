00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello everyone with you greenlight and in this 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.310
 autumn lesson 4d 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.069
 I will tell you how to create such 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.260
 glowing led backlight effect 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.670
 for your text 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.590
 let's look again like this 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.960
 it will look like a video 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.789
 and here it will be in the program itself 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.980
 there is only one color 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.990
 let's change a bit 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.470
 create go file create new 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.720
 document 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.810
 then click here and select the spline 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.480
 text after that in the text field we write 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.920
 any wife i'm porridge gwen and also i will change 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.540
 font and above it rape pics free 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.640
 after that let's choose it a 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.920
 this is done very simply we pin here 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.180
 and choose extruding nurbs after 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.070
 This spline text is like this 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.620
 assign extrusion nurbs 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.780
 accordingly he extruded after that 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.910
 let's hold control and our spline 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.129
 copy the text here so that we have 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.739
 there will be 11 line text under extrusion 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.690
 the other is not thereafter let's again 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.000
 click here and create spline 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.090
 circle and then in the radius of the field 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.339
 let's put one centimeter can be 2 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.229
 Well I for one will approach this font 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.210
 centimeter is great that is with us 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.610
 a very small one was formed 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.840
 the spline further click here here and 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.030
 we choose our refineries 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.100
 After that, with the clamped control, select 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.710
 spline text and spline circle and 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.080
 assign light to the RTS here and so 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.000
 will create a little blank for our 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.770
 future illumination only left 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.540
 apply texture for this two times 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.460
 click here and create a new one 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.680
 material then open it 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.380
 remove the tick next to the gloss and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.540
 we put it with the glow itself and also we 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.299
 can change the color of the glow itself i its 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.400
 I will change something like this 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.920
 close and apply this texture us vip 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.229
 nps now with we from the renderer see what 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.540
 we will have the same thing that we need 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.630
 now you only have to animate 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.729
 our blinking is done very easily 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.979
 just click on the sweep thumbs 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.049
 right click taiga cinema 4d and 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.119
 so choose the presentation further so what 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.680
 click on it and put it in the menu 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.600
 tick next to use where 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.540
 written visibility put it right here 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.729
 That will animate itself and visibility 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.709
 how it is done for starters go to 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.410
 the tenth frame put the slider here 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.290
 here 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.760
 and press control next to the visibility 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.670
 have it put the key 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.710
 but before that you need to put a percentage 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.420
 visibility by zero percent and 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.620
 again since i haven't done this before 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.440
 did we clamp control 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.870
 and put for this key that is now 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.480
 we will not see our lights here 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.960
 for mounting traders after that 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.370
 go to 14 about a frame and set 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.170
 visibility is one hundred percent like this 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.980
 again we hold the curl and put the key 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.040
 now with we will see we will 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.720
 such an animation can now take place 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.060
 here and so highlight this key 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.070
 and squeezed control of their copy what 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.870
 have create so much mega few you 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.870
 you need here for example two moments will not 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.260
 You can also put them closer to 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.650
 it was blinking straight very well 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.750
 around here so well that the same result we 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.700
 achieved if you come to Nemirov her 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.260
 blinks are good enough and 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.950
 spend some of your own 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.020
 of time 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.030
 then you will get very beautiful and 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.190
 interesting intro variation 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.470
 Well this tutorial has exhausted itself 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.360
 subscribe to new lessons link y 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.190
 put you on the screen like 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.930
 this video well, and you had greenlight 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.930
 Good luck and see you in new releases
