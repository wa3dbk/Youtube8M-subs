00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 before the apple system others do not 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.240
 live without the versatility of the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.460
 Google 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.040
 we did a brief comparison with 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.990
 resources that are present in one and not 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:24.390
 necessarily in the other 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:26.609
 check out this is an endless battle and with 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.830
 defenders engaged on both sides 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.510
 we resolved to compare the two 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.960
 more mobile operating systems 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.450
 popular planet of apple and s8 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.480
 google android system the apple has 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.090
 its great brand in stability iphones 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.160
 and ipads hardly catch another 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.350
 interesting feature is that as the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.539
 system is tailor made to run in 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.180
 specific devices they can be 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.550
 the luxury of for example having less memory 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.949
 since the operation is more optimized 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.469
 even the iphone 6 a newer model 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.570
 of apple runs with only 1 GB of memory 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.760
 while the androids 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.580
 perform functions similarly 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.229
 usually need a lot more other 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.689
 feature that leaves the apple 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.390
 excited maniacs is the integration 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.010
 between iphones and ipads and the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.930
 apple computers 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.030
 not that it does not exist for devices 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.159
 android the difference is that in this case 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.860
 this integration usually depends on 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.890
 specific applications in the case of apple 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.680
 is almost always on active for example who 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.140
 installed s8 will notice the application 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.909
 facetime got even smarter 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.680
 Now if you want, you can do it. 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.869
 phone calls from the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.189
 computer to other landlines 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.320
 or cell phones 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.210
 just open the facetime select 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.950
 voice connection and ready 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.110
 if the computer is on the same network 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.720
 wifi that iphone it automatically 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.899
 use your smartphone to connect and 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.549
 transfers the audio to the computer 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.950
 supersimples and this is just an example 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.960
 there are several others that should increase 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.630
 even more from the new version of the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.030
 mac os and the semi that is in phase 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.140
 beta or is almost ready to be 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.140
 released to the public 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.370
 stability and seamless integration 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.870
 with other apple devices are trademarks 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.480
 registered s 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.360
 versatility is the great asset of the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.070
 android 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.650
 a good example of this is precisely the 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.670
 ability to multitask the possibility 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.220
 open multiple applications 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.440
 simultaneously and work with everyone in 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.440
 parallel is present on android 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.310
 if the software integration of the flame 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:42.189
 attention can not be despised 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.620
 that iphones and ipads are poor when 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.239
 the subject is connections for example 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.359
 various models of android devices 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:56.109
 hdmi output and what makes it easy to 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:58.359
 connection with gestures 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.060
 it's not the time thing with android is 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:03.430
 possible to use motorola moto x 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.169
 without hands simply set the 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.900
 smartphone so that it performs tasks 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:10.629
 when you hear your voice 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.699
 Of course the iphone has serials it takes 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.010
 add manually before making a 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:16.090
 request for voice and she still does not speak 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.949
 Portuguese 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.079
 the only way to dress work 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:23.760
 automatically is when the iphone is 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:28.349
 connected to the light 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.209
 space to the crucial issue at the time of 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.159
 to choose a smartphone primarily 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.110
 by the number of photos and videos 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.629
 We recorded on the device nowadays 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.299
 iphone 6 plus with larger capacity 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.940
 comes with 128 gb of memory which is already 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.640
 Quite a lot but if by chance this does not 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.400
 enough the user will be obliged to 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.989
 pay for apps photos or videos for 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.180
 free space 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.909
 already the smartphones with android in its 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.310
 most have space for external cards 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:04:02.909
 micro sd that can be changed when 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:05.220
 are much more practical it is a 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.079
 of the things that copied them from the android was 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.030
 the quick settings menu that 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.909
 appears when the user drags the finger 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.739
 bottom up on the screen but this copy 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.959
 has two limitations 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.810
 the first is the amount of tasks that 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.430
 can appear there while the galaxy s 5 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.310
 displays 20 possibility 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.260
 iphone only shows 10 plus it is not 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.300
 choose which settings 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.300
 available in that space. 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.560
 smartphones with android can be 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.780
 fully customized and not just 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.360
 exchanging place icons and placing 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.220
 new customization wallpapers is 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.440
 so deep that the user can 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.660
 transform the interface into something else 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:52.810
 completely different from the one that comes 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:55.600
 from factory with s8 to apple released 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.550
 ids in the notification center but they 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.360
 not come close to the possibilities of 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.640
 android 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.890
 the google system home screen can 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.500
 house the ids that control everything 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.510
 from radio applications to others that 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.950
 fluctuation of currencies and 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.950
 social networking information 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.620
 already thought about transforming your smartphone 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.650
 remote control and control the TV 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.380
 your home because it is with infrared that 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.170
 possible on devices like the galaxy s 5 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.180
 htc one year and lg g 3 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.010
 and it's not just the TV you can control 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.290
 it's still possible to move in the air 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.960
 on the stereo between 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.000
 other things iphones can even be 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.520
 used as a remote control but only 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.840
 on connected devices using the network 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.840
 wifi or bluetooth 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.110
 And you what do you think of this comparison in 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.150
 stability and integration with 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.760
 other apple devices offered by 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.260
 iphone or prefer the versatility of 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.360
 androids good
