00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.120
 movies with angelina jolie someone 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.370
 computer games tomb raider series 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.980
 the first association that occurs when 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.019
 mention of this charming 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.670
 researchers this adventure if 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.890
 talk about the gaming industry 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.260
 most of the games in the series were in this or 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.590
 different degree platform frame with elements 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.930
 action acrobatics riddles and of course 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.390
 the delightful lara became integral 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.160
 part of the cult tomb raider game series 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.320
 but what will happen if you take the key 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.750
 features a series of games about Lara and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.450
 put it all in isometry thought 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.629
 crystal dynamics guys made a game 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.489
 Lara Croft nz tempalov VASILIS project 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.340
 which we look at today is 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.770
 a sequel released in 2010 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.539
 lara croft and the guardian of light 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.539
 so much surprised at such 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.640
 We will not be playing 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.010
 for Lara Croft who went to 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.350
 excavations in Egypt where accidentally awakened 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.780
 ancient Egyptian god of chaos set 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.390
 who lara with a colleague carter and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.270
 two gods and gray mountains will try 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.760
 prevent us from destroying the world of people in the game 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.130
 we move around the location divided into 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.140
 several pieces of a kind of dungeon 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.750
 on the way to our goal will arise 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.939
 many traps and obstacles not all 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.659
 from them it will be possible to overcome using 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.880
 acrobatics 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.439
 sometimes you need to use a gun hook 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.330
 with it you can not only 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.820
 rise and fall well and 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.650
 move along the wall beyond that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.439
 to the goal will be blocking a different type 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.900
 riddles sometimes it's simple like put 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.880
 on the stove heavy object or pull the lever 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.040
 but there are those that make 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.500
 think and it happens so that time 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.540
 on reflection there is absolutely no more often this 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.520
 due to the fact that nearby enemies are running and 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.320
 they hinder us in every way to 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.180
 deal with opponents in our 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.939
 arsenal there are several types of weapons 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.070
 At first, the staff of Osaris is available to us 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.470
 using it you can raise the platform 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.079
 destroy objects and destroy enemies 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.210
 almost anytime and anywhere we 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.579
 we can install a bomb besides how 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.070
 destroy the enemy in an explosion it can 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.110
 use as a springboard for objects 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.060
 from firearms we have 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.160
 paired pistols confuse them 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.770
 almost no but the farther we go 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.740
 the more arsenal at our disposal 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.230
 For example, a flamethrower perfectly performs its 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.600
 the role of the enemies are burning and destroyed in a couple 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.240
 seconds but it consumes fuel 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.930
 which is replenished by dropping from enemies 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.510
 drawers 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.790
 in addition to cartridges and first aid kits with enemies and 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.709
 environments fall crystals they can 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.600
 exchange for opening chests with 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.310
 outfit 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.590
 chests are found mostly in 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.690
 end of the level in a lot but so 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.520
 can they be found in the common area for 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.800
 opening different types of chests 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.690
 will require a different number of crystals 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.850
 the more crystals is spent on 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.430
 opening the more chance to get 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.330
 equipment is better equipment happens 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.520
 several types 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.860
 In addition to weapons that can be taken at a time 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.530
 three samples and the staff of the Lara wears 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.989
 a pair of rings charms suit each item 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.450
 equipment gives some bonuses than 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.090
 the higher the rarity of the subject the more and 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.920
 better bonuses we get in the review 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.260
 shadow elite kindom with i talked about 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.260
 felt hitting the enemy so 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.510
 here it is executed very well, sort of 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.090
 burn and scatter from 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.250
 shotgun explosions not just takes only 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.390
 not a slot in the inventory but its really 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.239
 I want to use 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.790
 physics in the game worked let york 1 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.519
 but it looks works very well in 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.769
 the game is destructible to smash 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.760
 and you can break not only urns of which 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.519
 serves crystals 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.920
 but most of the gameplay themes 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.230
 quite high time for a breather on 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.630
 some plot just don't we forever 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.810
 somewhere we run someone we kill something 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.360
 collect and it's fun with it even if 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.970
 our character is dying far back us not 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.500
 will drop the checkpoints scattered very 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.180
 grams 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.030
 besides a good picture of interesting 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.560
 gameplay great ambience style in 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.989
 the game has a cooperative 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.239
 designed for four people where 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.650
 besides Lara, your friends can play 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.750
 crankcase not sitting 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.820
 and the city is a portion of good mood 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.430
 races with friends you are definitely 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.070
 get the game a lot of advantages 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.800
 cons if there is something they donâ€™t 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.720
 to mean 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.780
 but that less whether your game 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.030
 time as usual you decide thanks for
