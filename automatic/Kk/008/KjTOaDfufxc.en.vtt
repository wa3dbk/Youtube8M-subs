00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.710
 So the conference really got me out 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.720
 carved the socks or 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.189
 the part that makes for battlefield 4 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.590
 has been made and that was like 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.329
 a lot of minutes eight minutes from one 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.309
 hour and 40 minutes met 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.930
 I could also do the rest for Spain 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.300
 because I'm not very special 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.410
 great fan for fifa or so i have that 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.960
 played earlier when i was little 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.220
 but today it's about battlefield 4 yes 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.480
 we have seen everything we have 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.920
 a new map seen we have the 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.809
 Premium service seen what we did 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.030
 so to speak we can expect 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.230
 hey, so to speak, will be on everyone 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.030
 be there and that will be natural 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.070
 also be there and let's start 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.379
 with the information to the others 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.719
 DLCs ​​for balls much include label strike 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.920
 Dragons and clubs stood I do not know 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.890
 why did you announce that early ? 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.390
 probably because they are people there 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.729
 has him crazy after that is so 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.380
 it really blatant if one of those things 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.300
 was crazy about Battlefield 4 and the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.130
 all the time has been waiting so almost 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.720
 for a year since then the men of honor 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.570
 I'm crazy about 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.460
 berlin quotes and waits happily for it 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.350
 this game but there are some 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.600
 has information to say that too 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.920
 noticed that this system was something 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.780
 you have tried to explain 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.700
 really did not get it 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.220
 is from most people so to speak 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.000
 let's get that these perks what they do 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.470
 have announced 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.479
 it really was not understood so 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.579
 there are definitely a few things that 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.829
 But first is that, so to speak 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.049
 armor, so to speak, a protective vest for 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.060
 the person or the soldier which 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.549
 one protects only the chest head 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.310
 in the chest area and so to speak 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.850
 Just stop the corpus I know red 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.740
 korbes next level or he has the 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.509
 belly area so to speak if someone 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.520
 you guys shoot up so to speak 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.840
 close range so to speak if you want to 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.130
 example klaus borchers have played 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.950
 Do you know what I mean by that? 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.810
 all the shotgun kids are coming around 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.189
 corner and shoot you with a shot 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.509
 download the coffee really can not be 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.759
 even if no dominion is since you 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.690
 Immediately there and there is paint in the chest 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.730
 and up to do that 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.870
 and why do you speak well 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.549
 I would definitely be that 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.769
 why not use one like that 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.090
 small advantage has gone to such 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.959
 small children who hold him in the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.160
 shotgun must come 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.720
 because of me 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.580
 the next extra consists of that 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.290
 so to speak, people from houses too 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.870
 houses she jumps so to speak 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.400
 do not feel sorry to say that 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.010
 you do not have a bit of life 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.540
 lose and that's really critical 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.370
 if you jump under it for example 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.260
 and not early enough his parachute 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.480
 can open the can, so to speak well 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.220
 make sure that somehow with 50 1 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.780
 Everything on the ground can be real 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.740
 happen and still has him to the 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.740
 third and fourth day 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.100
 that is why we have so ensure it was on 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.710
 every case first for the helicopter 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.450
 or planes ready to say that 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.950
 if someone tagged you that one 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.990
 takes a bit longer, for example 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.790
 relax or the heated was that 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.070
 a bit difficult because somehow too 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.930
 Escape at especially at first 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.030
 That was really a big priority 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.470
 big difficulty because somehow too 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.390
 survive and so that was 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.100
 relatively heavy there somehow 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.900
 get single card so I have 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.580
 that usually does not work out especially 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.780
 because i'm not a jet pilot but 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.310
 otherwise if you are a pretty 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.020
 good player is that you can do it 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.030
 mostly not and that is supposed to be now 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.980
 infantrymen come and that's how it is 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.230
 if someone marked you then you are 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.850
 you generally when you stop off the 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.650
 field of vision has been changing from seven to seven 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.480
 for a few seconds on the map 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.070
 marked and that should be reduced 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.780
 at five if you like this people 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.330
 have unlocked another one 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.490
 information by the way this box gets 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.550
 by the way, all the time you go to 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.980
 example with your squad some mission 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.720
 fulfilled or just fulfilled orders of that 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.700
 commander if the commander you 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.320
 orders gives these and this one 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.820
 flag or does that and that then 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.500
 you should also do that around 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.700
 Stop getting these things because of it 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.800
 are no disadvantages 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.600
 it's just just benefits so completely 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.610
 small benefits that you can use around 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.010
 to become a better player or a better player 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.230
 to have a smaller advantage 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.940
 towards the opponents because the hot 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.560
 Opponents are mostly dom and dom 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.840
 go on a fund in the battlefield 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.190
 and that's why it's pretty good 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.770
 so that 's it for the whole 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.890
 Specialization in parks or elsewhere 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.299
 that's per se storm and that 's the one 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.500
 new multiplayer map you get on the 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.880
 gamescom can play 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.800
 And these are the boats, yes, the swimming 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.600
 find the banners and videos and 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.300
 learn but four you know again 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.340
 the whole the ak 12 with the horny 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.460
 ironside though that's not so cool 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.780
 because you 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.130
 some people might never see 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.800
 but thinks it lotti also cool 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.759
 the hip sprayed but in any case 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:48.199
 Let's get to dv 15 yes that looks 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:50.000
 very heavily armored from year 20 for 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.380
 the chinese group sees the 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.660
 It's great for everyone 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.680
 case relatively cool and take a look 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.319
 on the left the radar finally divine 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.449
 I found the radar the radar for 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.430
 Battlefield 3 was not really good at it 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.960
 mostly you could get some information 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.910
 not read it or it was relative 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.340
 shit and that looks like it 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.550
 so a signal scan so to speak 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.020
 that you can permanently rada some in the air 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.520
 People can scan how to get it from the 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.550
 but ohrbooten knows in any case 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:24.349
 chamber to the berit yes the 15 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.789
 50 caliber and that is called the m82 a3 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.199
 There was also a video on one 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.750
 where I leave the 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:32.690
 singleplayer campaign kvf out 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.120
 battlefield 3 and mine 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.979
 It is so hard that it will be 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.900
 definitely be strong so have a look 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.370
 like the guy so to speak in the 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.470
 trailer you can see who the types 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.349
 it has and here again a mg 4 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:48.289
 reminds me somehow a m 249 or 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:52.039
 But that's why we're still here 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:54.349
 once see the map by day 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.800
 at night it's that easy 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.800
 next time
