priming so first thing you want to do is
turn<00:00:13.270> the<00:00:13.690> system<00:00:13.900> off<00:00:14.170> right<00:00:14.440> there<00:00:14.680> and

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
turn the system off right there and

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.080 
turn the system off right there and
let's<00:00:16.480> come<00:00:16.690> down<00:00:16.720> here<00:00:17.699> next<00:00:18.699> thing<00:00:18.849> that<00:00:18.880> you

hard<00:01:34.870> plumbed<00:01:35.229> in<00:01:35.440> there<00:01:35.620> when<00:01:35.770> I<00:01:35.800> have<00:01:35.979> my

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
hard plumbed in there when I have my

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.280 
hard plumbed in there when I have my

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
these so if you're thinking about

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.610 
these so if you're thinking about
getting<00:01:40.600> a<00:01:42.150> pool<00:01:43.150> I<00:01:43.450> would<00:01:43.600> highly<00:01:44.020> recommend

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
getting a pool I would highly recommend

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.620 
getting a pool I would highly recommend
this<00:01:44.710> because<00:01:44.979> it's<00:01:45.159> so<00:01:45.340> easy<00:01:45.610> just<00:01:46.090> spin

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
this because it's so easy just spin

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.660 
this because it's so easy just spin
these<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.140> you<00:01:47.920> can<00:01:48.040> go<00:01:48.250> ahead<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.549> remove

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
these and you can go ahead and remove

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.469 
these and you can go ahead and remove
that<00:01:48.880> now<00:01:49.780> in<00:01:50.020> here<00:01:50.560> is<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:51.460> pump<00:01:51.729> housing

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
that now in here is the pump housing

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.670 
that now in here is the pump housing
gasket<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:54.670> they<00:01:55.000> can<00:01:55.150> sometimes<00:01:55.390> get<00:01:56.049> worn

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
gasket that they can sometimes get worn

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.100 
gasket that they can sometimes get worn
out<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.130> cracked

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
out and cracked

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.070 
out and cracked
and<00:01:59.200> it's<00:01:59.770> very<00:01:59.950> easy<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.640> take<00:02:00.910> apart<00:02:01.090> just

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
and it's very easy to take apart just

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.350 
and it's very easy to take apart just
have<00:02:02.230> these<00:02:02.700> these<00:02:03.700> screws<00:02:04.740> right<00:02:05.740> there<00:02:06.360> go

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
have these these screws right there go

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.070 
have these these screws right there go
ahead<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:07.600> remove<00:02:07.690> those<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:09.750> replacing<00:02:10.750> the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
ahead and remove those and replacing the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.370 
ahead and remove those and replacing the
gasket<00:02:11.530> in<00:02:11.620> there<00:02:11.800> is<00:02:11.920> very<00:02:11.950> very<00:02:12.310> simple

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
gasket in there is very very simple

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.850 
gasket in there is very very simple
now<00:02:14.770> if<00:02:14.980> yours<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.370> hard<00:02:15.550> plumbed<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:18.580> is<00:02:18.760> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
now if yours is hard plumbed this is the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.610 
now if yours is hard plumbed this is the

overheats the pump motor overheats this

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.120 
overheats the pump motor overheats this
in<00:02:29.170> this<00:02:29.800> can<00:02:30.130> melt<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.090> wore<00:02:31.930> which<00:02:32.890> can

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
in this can melt and wore which can

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.030 
in this can melt and wore which can
cause<00:02:33.400> air<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.750> get<00:02:34.900> into<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.380> system<00:02:35.590> as<00:02:35.860> well

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
cause air to get into the system as well

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.720 
cause air to get into the system as well
now<00:02:36.820> this<00:02:37.510> particular<00:02:37.750> one<00:02:38.140> just<00:02:38.830> has<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.370> valve

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
now this particular one just has a valve

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.060 
now this particular one just has a valve
right<00:02:40.600> here<00:02:40.660> but<00:02:41.200> if<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:41.440> have<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.590> Jannetty

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
right here but if you have a Jannetty

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.550 
right here but if you have a Jannetty
valve<00:02:42.690> many<00:02:43.690> times<00:02:43.930> we'll<00:02:44.080> have<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.230> Jannetty

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
valve many times we'll have a Jannetty

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.390 
valve many times we'll have a Jannetty
valve<00:02:44.740> that<00:02:45.370> sits<00:02:45.640> right<00:02:45.730> here<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:48.040> inside

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
valve that sits right here the inside

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.510 
valve that sits right here the inside
can<00:02:48.970> get<00:02:49.150> worn<00:02:49.690> out<00:02:49.810> as<00:02:49.959> well<00:02:50.140> also<00:02:50.620> when<00:02:51.340> it

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
can get worn out as well also when it

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.580 
can get worn out as well also when it
comes<00:02:51.730> together<00:02:51.940> like<00:02:52.810> that<00:02:52.840> when<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.380> sits

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
comes together like that when it sits

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.030 
comes together like that when it sits
down

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
down

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.730 
down
maybe<00:02:54.490> it's<00:02:54.700> it's<00:02:55.120> off<00:02:55.720> a<00:02:55.750> little<00:02:56.110> bit<00:02:56.260> when

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
maybe it's it's off a little bit when

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.830 
maybe it's it's off a little bit when
you<00:02:56.920> tighten<00:02:57.310> those<00:02:57.550> up<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:58.060> want<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.510> be<00:02:58.600> sure

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
you tighten those up you want to be sure

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.900 
you tighten those up you want to be sure
that<00:02:59.020> you<00:02:59.110> do<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.350> in<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.530> star<00:02:59.830> pattern<00:02:59.910> not

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
that you do it in a star pattern not

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.240 
that you do it in a star pattern not
just<00:03:01.150> go<00:03:01.270> around<00:03:01.390> in<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:03.340> circle<00:03:03.900> also<00:03:05.070> this<00:03:06.070> is

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
just go around in a circle also this is

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.520 
just go around in a circle also this is
a<00:03:06.280> skimmer<00:03:06.670> side<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.269> this<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.170> main

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
a skimmer side and this is the main

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.530 
a skimmer side and this is the main
drain<00:03:08.769> side<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.370> lot<00:03:09.700> of<00:03:09.790> times<00:03:09.970> dirt<00:03:10.330> and

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
drain side a lot of times dirt and

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.410 
drain side a lot of times dirt and
debris<00:03:10.810> can<00:03:11.050> get<00:03:11.230> caught<00:03:11.590> in<00:03:11.800> here<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.489> if

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
debris can get caught in here and if

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.710 
debris can get caught in here and if
that's<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.870> case<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:15.820> can<00:03:15.940> pick<00:03:16.330> up<00:03:16.480> one<00:03:16.630> of

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
that's the case you can pick up one of

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.320 
that's the case you can pick up one of
these<00:03:16.780> bladders<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:18.730> is<00:03:18.880> one<00:03:19.030> that<00:03:19.209> I've

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
these bladders this is one that I've

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.870 
these bladders this is one that I've
been<00:03:19.360> using<00:03:19.480> for<00:03:19.840> quite<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.650> while<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.340> it

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
been using for quite a while and it

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.540 
been using for quite a while and it
really<00:03:22.150> really<00:03:22.390> works<00:03:22.660> just<00:03:23.560> hook<00:03:24.190> up<00:03:24.310> the

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
really really works just hook up the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.360 
really really works just hook up the
hose<00:03:25.560> garden<00:03:26.560> hose<00:03:26.739> in<00:03:26.950> here

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
hose garden hose in here

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.360 
hose garden hose in here
and<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.700> can<00:03:27.850> stick<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.239> in<00:03:28.510> there<00:03:29.500> like<00:03:30.340> that

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
and you can stick it in there like that

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.220 
and you can stick it in there like that
and<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:32.260> expands<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.100> it<00:03:33.160> forces<00:03:33.540> water<00:03:34.540> out

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
and it expands and it forces water out

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.140 
and it expands and it forces water out
of<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.680> tip<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.900> can

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
of the tip of it and you can

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.930 
of the tip of it and you can
directed<00:03:40.020> either<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:41.100> know<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.370> skimmer<00:03:41.670> or

directed either you know the skimmer or

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.680 
directed either you know the skimmer or
the<00:03:42.300> bottom<00:03:43.230> drain<00:03:43.500> side<00:03:44.300> loosens<00:03:45.300> up<00:03:45.420> the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
the bottom drain side loosens up the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.010 
the bottom drain side loosens up the
debris<00:03:46.590> on<00:03:46.740> there<00:03:46.950> also<00:03:47.190> what<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.180> can<00:03:48.330> do<00:03:48.480> is

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020

and on the tab feeder top there's an
o-ring<00:04:40.910> right<00:04:41.910> in<00:04:42.060> there<00:04:42.240> these<00:04:42.510> things<00:04:42.720> are

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
o-ring right in there these things are

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.469 
o-ring right in there these things are
very<00:04:42.870> easy<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.830> replace<00:04:44.100> just<00:04:45.030> going<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:45.360> take

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
all these this system has a lot of 90s

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.090 
all these this system has a lot of 90s
on<00:05:03.600> here<00:05:04.140> so<00:05:04.410> be<00:05:05.130> sure<00:05:05.160> that<00:05:06.560> you<00:05:07.560> know<00:05:07.650> you

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
want to check those to be sure that

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.950 
want to check those to be sure that
they're<00:05:11.100> not<00:05:11.250> leaking<00:05:11.880> as<00:05:12.030> well<00:05:12.240> and<00:05:12.720> these

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.330 
that's about it let's go over in look at
the<00:05:20.310> skimmer<00:05:21.080> okay<00:05:22.080> so<00:05:22.229> you<00:05:22.800> want<00:05:22.950> to<00:05:23.010> be<00:05:23.070> sure

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
the skimmer okay so you want to be sure

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.370 
the skimmer okay so you want to be sure
that<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:24.169> skimmer<00:05:25.169> is<00:05:26.270> free<00:05:27.270> of<00:05:27.450> debris<00:05:27.840> also

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
that the skimmer is free of debris also

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.560 
that the skimmer is free of debris also
have<00:05:28.560> a<00:05:28.590> couple<00:05:28.800> rocks<00:05:29.130> in<00:05:29.370> here<00:05:29.640> is<00:05:29.820> to<00:05:30.360> wait

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
have a couple rocks in here is to wait

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.510 
have a couple rocks in here is to wait
the<00:05:30.720> skimmer<00:05:30.990> down<00:05:31.229> be<00:05:31.650> sure<00:05:31.680> that<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.250> rocks

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
the skimmer down be sure that the rocks

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.620 
the skimmer down be sure that the rocks
are<00:05:32.820> bigger<00:05:33.419> than<00:05:34.640> the<00:05:35.640> actual<00:05:36.000> hole<00:05:36.210> because

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
are bigger than the actual hole because

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.390 
are bigger than the actual hole because
if<00:05:36.840> they<00:05:36.990> fall<00:05:37.200> in<00:05:37.380> there<00:05:37.590> you're<00:05:38.220> going<00:05:38.340> to

have a pretty big problem also the

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.839 
have a pretty big problem also the
skimmer<00:05:42.510> we're

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.990 

can<00:05:45.849> be<00:05:45.940> found<00:05:46.210> was<00:05:47.169> it<00:05:47.319> right<00:05:47.550> right<00:05:48.550> there<00:05:48.789> up

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
can be found was it right right there up

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.119 
can be found was it right right there up
I<00:05:49.300> don't<00:05:49.690> want<00:05:49.810> to<00:05:49.870> get<00:05:49.960> my<00:05:50.050> camera<00:05:50.259> wet<00:05:50.729> but

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
zoomed in there anyway yeah I know the

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.869 
zoomed in there anyway yeah I know the
screamer<00:05:58.690> where<00:05:58.930> is<00:05:59.460> right<00:06:00.460> here<00:06:00.729> at<00:06:00.789> the

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:00.879 
screamer where is right here at the

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:03.149 
screamer where is right here at the
opening<00:06:01.300> be<00:06:02.139> sure<00:06:02.319> that<00:06:02.500> that's<00:06:02.590> in<00:06:02.800> working

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
opening be sure that that's in working

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:05.820 
opening be sure that that's in working
order<00:06:03.280> as<00:06:03.520> well<00:06:03.729> because<00:06:04.440> if<00:06:05.440> that<00:06:05.620> is

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
order as well because if that is

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.719 
order as well because if that is
sticking<00:06:06.159> up<00:06:06.460> that<00:06:07.120> will<00:06:08.190> restrict<00:06:09.190> the<00:06:09.340> water

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
sticking up that will restrict the water

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.180 
sticking up that will restrict the water
flow<00:06:10.030> going<00:06:10.449> in<00:06:10.629> here<00:06:10.960> and<00:06:11.080> you<00:06:11.560> can<00:06:11.710> draw<00:06:11.889> air

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
flow going in here and you can draw air

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
flow going in here and you can draw air
in<00:06:12.550> your<00:06:12.909> system<00:06:13.240> that<00:06:13.270> way<00:06:14.970> so<00:06:15.970> I<00:06:16.000> hope<00:06:16.180> that

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
in your system that way so I hope that

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.080 
in your system that way so I hope that
