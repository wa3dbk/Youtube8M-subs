 old ones who are of this xj d2 and 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.260
 now most new ones are 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.260
 from the three dalphond I you 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.340

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.550
 the difference with the vigils and 3 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.680
 is that the x of the holes the young people who 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.239

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.230
 layer surely 18.5 I have a big one 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.020
 migrant who did that to go from 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.630
 secure on as much as possible but a 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.119
 way of your past that with a dog 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:25.320
 as winners to the conflict and then I 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.930

 excellent goalkeeper close with him he 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.270
 this is because 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.680
 it's the same procedure as the kg the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.369
 two are that they have to make a 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.490
 more thing is to allow marc 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.530
 hervÃ© point saint jean but polite that 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.619
 I have two is just to pass this 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.350
 step to play as six 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:57.539
