butter<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.490> if<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.670> want<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.090> can<00:00:18.240> add<00:00:18.390> a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
butter and if you want to you can add a

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.320 
butter and if you want to you can add a
little<00:00:18.660> vanilla<00:00:18.900> as<00:00:19.260> well<00:00:19.580> we<00:00:20.580> start<00:00:20.910> off<00:00:21.090> with

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
little vanilla as well we start off with

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.240 
little vanilla as well we start off with
a<00:00:21.359> sugar<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.199> should<00:00:22.350> be<00:00:22.439> refined<00:00:22.890> sugar

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
a sugar and it should be refined sugar

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.439 
a sugar and it should be refined sugar
because<00:00:24.240> unrefined<00:00:24.900> can<00:00:25.199> crystallize<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:26.449> like

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
because unrefined can crystallize I like

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.240 
because unrefined can crystallize I like
to<00:00:27.570> add<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> little<00:00:27.960> water<00:00:28.050> because<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.980> helps

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
to add a little water because that helps

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.209 
to add a little water because that helps
it<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.460> dissolve<00:00:29.869> but<00:00:30.869> basically<00:00:31.380> all<00:00:31.500> caramel

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
it to dissolve but basically all caramel

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.750 
it to dissolve but basically all caramel
is<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:33.020> sugar<00:00:34.020> where<00:00:34.860> all<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.309> water<00:00:35.520> has<00:00:35.670> been

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
is is sugar where all the water has been

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.190 
is is sugar where all the water has been
evaporated<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> point<00:00:36.960> where<00:00:37.110> it's

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
evaporated to the point where it's

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.290 
evaporated to the point where it's
beginning<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.590> brown<00:00:37.980> now<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.000> store-bought

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
beginning to brown now it's store-bought

beginning to brown now it's store-bought
caramel<00:00:40.110> sauce<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.649> often<00:00:41.100> bitter<00:00:41.370> because

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
caramel sauce is often bitter because

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.639 
caramel sauce is often bitter because
the<00:00:42.090> caramel<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.540> brought<00:00:42.809> too<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.469> high

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the caramel is brought too to high

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.950 
the caramel is brought too to high
temperature<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.390> dark<00:00:45.719> brown

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
temperature I like it to be a dark brown

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.260 
temperature I like it to be a dark brown
but<00:00:46.320> not<00:00:46.530> burnt<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.899> start<00:00:49.350> off<00:00:49.969> by<00:00:50.969> heating

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
but not burnt so I start off by heating

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.569 
but not burnt so I start off by heating
this<00:00:51.719> sugar<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.980> water<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:55.010> I<00:00:56.010> often<00:00:56.219> use<00:00:56.550> a

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
this sugar and water and I often use a

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.610 
this sugar and water and I often use a
nonstick<00:00:57.270> pan<00:00:57.329> because<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.050> way<00:00:58.199> all<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
nonstick pan because that way all of the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.139 
nonstick pan because that way all of the
caramel<00:00:59.010> will<00:00:59.129> come<00:00:59.340> out<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.640> won't<00:00:59.699> stick<00:00:59.969> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
caramel will come out it won't stick to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.720 
caramel will come out it won't stick to
the<00:01:00.239> bottom<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> pan<00:01:01.010> it's<00:01:02.010> important<00:01:02.609> to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the bottom of the pan it's important to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.579 
the bottom of the pan it's important to
make<00:01:02.910> sure<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.180> all<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> sugar<00:01:04.260> has

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
make sure that all of the sugar has

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.039 
make sure that all of the sugar has
dissolved<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> water<00:01:05.880> because<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:06.930> you

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
dissolved in the water because if you

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.810 
dissolved in the water because if you
have<00:01:07.140> little<00:01:07.320> crystals<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.280> sugar<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
have little crystals of sugar on the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.700 
have little crystals of sugar on the
side<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> pan<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.990> takes<00:01:10.260> only<00:01:10.380> one

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
side of the pan it takes only one

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.920 
side of the pan it takes only one
crystal<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.640> crystallize<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> entire<00:01:12.630> batch

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
crystal to crystallize the entire batch

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.830 
crystal to crystallize the entire batch
and<00:01:13.260> they<00:01:13.770> don't<00:01:13.979> melt<00:01:14.220> down<00:01:14.520> again<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.000> before

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
and they don't melt down again so before

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.510 
and they don't melt down again so before
you<00:01:15.930> start<00:01:15.990> heating<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.619> make<00:01:16.830> sure<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.340> all

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
you start heating it make sure that all

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.420 
you start heating it make sure that all
of<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.729> sugar<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.240> moistened<00:01:19.430> continue

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
of the sugar is moistened continue

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.890 
of the sugar is moistened continue
stirring<00:01:20.729> until<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.930> comes<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> full<00:01:22.920> boil

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
stirring until it comes to a full boil

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.800 
stirring until it comes to a full boil
as<00:01:24.900> soon<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.560> starts<00:01:25.890> boiling<00:01:26.630> take<00:01:27.630> out

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
as soon as it starts boiling take out

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.600 
as soon as it starts boiling take out
the<00:01:27.960> spatula<00:01:28.500> don't<00:01:28.740> allow<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.189> drip<00:01:29.430> back

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the spatula don't allow it to drip back

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.090 
the spatula don't allow it to drip back
in<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.150> rinse<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.110> off<00:01:31.290> because<00:01:31.799> we're<00:01:31.979> going

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
in and rinse it off because we're going

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.630 
in and rinse it off because we're going
to<00:01:32.189> use<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.520> spatula<00:01:32.759> later<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.460> don't

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
to use the spatula later on and we don't

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.580 
to use the spatula later on and we don't
want<00:01:35.790> any<00:01:35.909> grains<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.390> sugar<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.930> go<00:01:37.020> back<00:01:37.290> into

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
want any grains of sugar to go back into

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.249 
want any grains of sugar to go back into
the<00:01:37.770> sugar<00:01:37.950> syrup<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.670> now<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.900> bring<00:01:40.110> up

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the sugar syrup and now we can bring up

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.670 
the sugar syrup and now we can bring up
the<00:01:40.409> heat<00:01:41.780> once<00:01:42.780> all<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> water<00:01:43.259> has

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the heat once all the water has

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.480 
the heat once all the water has
evaporated<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:44.549> will<00:01:44.700> start<00:01:44.970> caramelizing

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
evaporated it will start caramelizing

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.550 
evaporated it will start caramelizing
today<00:01:47.490> I'm<00:01:47.640> not<00:01:47.790> using<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.329> nonstick<00:01:48.780> pan<00:01:48.840> but

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
today I'm not using a nonstick pan but

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.649 
today I'm not using a nonstick pan but
the<00:01:49.740> advantage<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.280> using<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.700> nonstick<00:01:50.909> pan<00:01:51.420> is

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the advantage of using a nonstick pan is

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.600 
the advantage of using a nonstick pan is
that<00:01:52.079> none<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.500> caramel<00:01:52.950> sticks<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
that none of the caramel sticks to the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.530 
that none of the caramel sticks to the
bottom<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.030> pan

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
bottom of the pan

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.690 
bottom of the pan
so<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.899> get<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.170> eat<00:01:55.290> all<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:58.700> it's

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
so you get to eat all of it it's

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.730 
so you get to eat all of it it's
beginning<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.210> brown<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.439> have<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.649> be

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
beginning to brown and you have to be

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.319 
beginning to brown and you have to be
very<00:02:01.979> careful<00:02:02.460> because<00:02:02.490> not<00:02:02.939> only<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.299> it

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
very careful because not only is it

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.959 
very careful because not only is it
extremely<00:02:03.869> hot<00:02:04.200> but<00:02:04.799> caramel<00:02:05.310> sticks<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.880> you

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
extremely hot but caramel sticks to you

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.089 
extremely hot but caramel sticks to you
so<00:02:06.240> if<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.570> were<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.840> land<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.229> your<00:02:07.350> skin<00:02:07.740> it

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
so if it were to land on your skin it

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.380 
so if it were to land on your skin it
would<00:02:08.250> be<00:02:08.369> burning<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.090> couldn't

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
would be burning you and you couldn't

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.750 
would be burning you and you couldn't
take<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.569> off<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.530> be<00:02:10.739> very<00:02:10.979> very<00:02:11.099> careful<00:02:11.459> in

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
take it off so be very very careful in

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.059 
take it off so be very very careful in
working<00:02:12.090> with<00:02:12.120> caramel<00:02:12.720> now<00:02:13.379> here's<00:02:13.739> the

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
working with caramel now here's the

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.259 
working with caramel now here's the
trick<00:02:14.219> of<00:02:14.249> telling<00:02:14.760> with<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.090> right

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
trick of telling with the right

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.610 
trick of telling with the right
temperature<00:02:15.510> when<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.290> don't<00:02:16.469> have<00:02:16.590> a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
temperature when you don't have a

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.440 
temperature when you don't have a
thermometer<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:17.700> put<00:02:17.969> a<00:02:18.120> heatproof

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
thermometer is you put a heatproof

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.259 
thermometer is you put a heatproof
spatula<00:02:18.959> into<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.400> mixture<00:02:20.790> at<00:02:20.849> this<00:02:20.999> point

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
spatula into the mixture at this point

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.750 
spatula into the mixture at this point
don't<00:02:21.450> stir<00:02:21.810> but<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.189> can<00:02:23.340> see<00:02:23.370> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
don't stir but just you can see the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.119 
don't stir but just you can see the
color<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.299> the<00:02:24.810> caramel<00:02:25.290> against<00:02:25.709> that<00:02:25.859> white

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
color of the caramel against that white

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.399 
color of the caramel against that white
if<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.760> were<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:26.939> use<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.090> red<00:02:27.420> spatula<00:02:28.260> you

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
if you were to use a red spatula you

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.929 
if you were to use a red spatula you
would<00:02:28.530> not<00:02:28.620> be<00:02:28.769> able<00:02:28.889> to<00:02:28.980> tell<00:02:29.249> what<00:02:29.730> color

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
would not be able to tell what color

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.660 
would not be able to tell what color
it's<00:02:30.180> getting<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.889> of<00:02:31.889> course<00:02:32.129> you<00:02:32.219> can<00:02:32.370> smell

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
it's getting to of course you can smell

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.699 
it's getting to of course you can smell
it<00:02:32.849> but<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.090> true<00:02:33.329> test<00:02:33.359> is<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.049> color<00:02:34.290> you

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
it but the true test is the color you

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.229 
it but the true test is the color you
want<00:02:34.889> it<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.129> a<00:02:35.159> deep<00:02:35.400> amber<00:02:35.639> but<00:02:36.090> not

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
want it to be a deep amber but not

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.420 
want it to be a deep amber but not
beginning<00:02:36.629> to<00:02:36.900> get<00:02:37.049> blackened<00:02:37.680> or<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.129> brown

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
beginning to get blackened or to brown

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.259 
beginning to get blackened or to brown
and<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:39.480> goes<00:02:39.659> very<00:02:39.750> fast<00:02:40.290> at<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.650> point<00:02:44.269> like

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
and it goes very fast at this point like

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.520 
and it goes very fast at this point like
a<00:02:45.299> mahogany<00:02:45.689> Brown

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
a mahogany Brown

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.610 
a mahogany Brown
okay<00:02:47.370> removing<00:02:47.849> from<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.090> heat<00:02:48.419> and<00:02:48.620> now

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
okay removing from the heat and now

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.309 
okay removing from the heat and now
we're<00:02:49.950> going<00:02:50.099> to<00:02:50.250> add<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.879> heavy<00:02:51.030> cream<00:02:51.319> make

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
we're going to add the heavy cream make

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.390 
we're going to add the heavy cream make
sure<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.859> cream<00:02:53.159> is<00:02:53.219> either<00:02:53.639> heated<00:02:54.329> or

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
sure that the cream is either heated or

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.979 
sure that the cream is either heated or
at<00:02:56.400> least<00:02:56.699> a<00:02:56.879> room<00:02:57.060> temperature<00:02:57.269> because<00:02:57.870> if

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
at least a room temperature because if

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.619 
at least a room temperature because if
it's<00:02:58.139> cold<00:02:58.439> it<00:02:58.769> will<00:02:58.919> spatter<00:02:59.400> like<00:02:59.819> crazy<00:03:00.269> and

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
it's cold it will spatter like crazy and

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.319 
it's cold it will spatter like crazy and
I<00:03:01.409> use<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.949> ladle<00:03:02.189> so<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.549> can<00:03:02.790> keep<00:03:02.939> a<00:03:03.090> safe

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
I use a ladle so I can keep a safe

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.399 
I use a ladle so I can keep a safe
distance<00:03:03.359> from<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.989> see<00:03:07.139> how<00:03:07.260> it's

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
distance from it and see how it's

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.059 
distance from it and see how it's
bubbling<00:03:07.829> up<00:03:08.150> because<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.329> used<00:03:09.829> cream<00:03:10.829> that's

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
bubbling up because I used cream that's

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.069 
bubbling up because I used cream that's
at<00:03:11.189> room<00:03:11.340> temperature<00:03:11.939> it's<00:03:12.180> not<00:03:12.389> spattering

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
at room temperature it's not spattering

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.720 
at room temperature it's not spattering
out<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.379> the<00:03:13.469> pan<00:03:13.680> although<00:03:14.370> it's<00:03:14.489> getting

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
out of the pan although it's getting

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.059 
out of the pan although it's getting
really<00:03:14.849> close<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.480> sometimes<00:03:16.349> do<00:03:16.709> this<00:03:16.829> right

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
really close I sometimes do this right

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.670 
really close I sometimes do this right
in<00:03:17.219> the<00:03:17.310> sink<00:03:17.609> so<00:03:17.790> if<00:03:17.879> it<00:03:18.000> does<00:03:18.209> bubble<00:03:18.569> over<00:03:18.900> it

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
in the sink so if it does bubble over it

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.520 
in the sink so if it does bubble over it
will<00:03:19.889> bubble<00:03:20.069> over<00:03:20.400> in<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.609> sink<00:03:20.909> if<00:03:21.530> the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
will bubble over in the sink if the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.319 
will bubble over in the sink if the
cream<00:03:22.769> were<00:03:22.889> cold<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.459> would<00:03:23.519> start<00:03:23.790> hardening

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
cream were cold it would start hardening

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.599 
cream were cold it would start hardening
so<00:03:25.139> then<00:03:25.319> I<00:03:25.349> would<00:03:25.470> put<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.799> back<00:03:25.979> on<00:03:26.189> the<00:03:26.310> flame

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
so then I would put it back on the flame

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.809 
so then I would put it back on the flame
and<00:03:26.909> continue<00:03:27.780> stirring<00:03:28.220> for<00:03:29.220> maybe<00:03:29.400> one<00:03:29.790> or

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
and continue stirring for maybe one or

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.699 
and continue stirring for maybe one or
two<00:03:30.030> minutes<00:03:30.389> until<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:30.930> becomes<00:03:31.319> smooth

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
two minutes until it becomes smooth

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.879 
two minutes until it becomes smooth
again<00:03:32.720> now<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.780> want<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.109> let<00:03:34.259> this<00:03:34.409> sit<00:03:34.470> off

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
again now you want to let this sit off

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.610 
again now you want to let this sit off
heat<00:03:35.459> until<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.150> stops<00:03:36.419> bubbling<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.199> then

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
heat until it stops bubbling and then

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.640 
heat until it stops bubbling and then
you<00:03:37.680> can<00:03:37.829> transfer<00:03:38.069> it<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.639> a<00:03:39.030> bowl<00:03:39.090> or<00:03:39.780> heat

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
you can transfer it to a bowl or heat

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.809 
you can transfer it to a bowl or heat
proof<00:03:40.859> measuring<00:03:41.430> cup

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.209 

and<00:03:48.569> now<00:03:48.719> we<00:03:48.780> can<00:03:48.989> stir<00:03:49.290> in<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.620> butter<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:50.129> at

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:50.219 
and now we can stir in the butter and at

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:52.880 
and now we can stir in the butter and at
first<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:50.909> will<00:03:50.969> be<00:03:51.030> streaky<00:03:51.629> but<00:03:52.439> once<00:03:52.739> it

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
first it will be streaky but once it

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.750 
first it will be streaky but once it
melts<00:03:53.250> in<00:03:54.170> will<00:03:55.170> be<00:03:55.290> totally<00:03:55.680> smooth<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.670> at

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
melts in will be totally smooth and at

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.830 
melts in will be totally smooth and at
this<00:03:56.879> point<00:03:57.090> if<00:03:57.299> you're<00:03:57.390> adding<00:03:57.659> a<00:03:57.719> little

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
this point if you're adding a little

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.979 
this point if you're adding a little
vanilla<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.920> would<00:03:59.040> add<00:03:59.219> it<00:03:59.370> now<00:03:59.989> otherwise

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
vanilla you would add it now otherwise

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.990 
vanilla you would add it now otherwise
all<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.379> vanilla<00:04:01.650> just<00:04:01.859> bubbles<00:04:02.459> away<00:04:02.609> and

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
all the vanilla just bubbles away and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.110 
all the vanilla just bubbles away and
evaporates<00:04:04.459> you<00:04:05.459> would<00:04:05.549> think<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:05.849> this<00:04:06.060> is

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
evaporates you would think that this is

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.420 
evaporates you would think that this is
going<00:04:06.359> to<00:04:06.420> be<00:04:06.569> very<00:04:06.720> soupy<00:04:07.260> but<00:04:07.470> when<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.099> cools

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
going to be very soupy but when it cools

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.330 
going to be very soupy but when it cools
off<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:09.030> will<00:04:09.390> be<00:04:09.420> thick<00:04:09.870> enough<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.319> pour<00:04:10.620> you

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
off it will be thick enough to pour you

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.670 
off it will be thick enough to pour you
could<00:04:11.519> pipe<00:04:11.760> it<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.569> thickens<00:04:12.989> considerably

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
could pipe it it thickens considerably

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.840 
could pipe it it thickens considerably
on<00:04:13.859> cooling<00:04:14.310> right<00:04:14.459> now<00:04:14.579> it's<00:04:14.730> very<00:04:15.120> very<00:04:15.209> hot

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
on cooling right now it's very very hot

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.159 
on cooling right now it's very very hot
now<00:04:17.850> see<00:04:18.359> how<00:04:18.449> this<00:04:18.600> is<00:04:18.750> beginning<00:04:18.900> to

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
now see how this is beginning to

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.420 
now see how this is beginning to
incorporate<00:04:19.919> in<00:04:20.099> and<00:04:22.009> once<00:04:23.009> you've<00:04:23.190> stirred

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
incorporate in and once you've stirred

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.240 
incorporate in and once you've stirred
it<00:04:23.639> in<00:04:23.820> just<00:04:24.240> let<00:04:24.479> it<00:04:24.599> sit<00:04:24.840> undisturbed<00:04:25.169> and<00:04:25.800> if

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
it in just let it sit undisturbed and if

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.830 
it in just let it sit undisturbed and if
it's<00:04:26.400> still<00:04:26.580> slightly<00:04:26.849> streaky<00:04:27.479> when<00:04:27.690> it's

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
it's still slightly streaky when it's

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.300 
it's still slightly streaky when it's
totally<00:04:28.320> cooled<00:04:28.770> down

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
totally cooled down

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.020 
totally cooled down
just<00:04:30.060> give<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.419> slight<00:04:30.690> stir<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:32.810> that's<00:04:33.810> it

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
just give it a slight stir and that's it

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.450 
just give it a slight stir and that's it
so<00:04:36.030> remember<00:04:36.509> it's<00:04:36.810> easy<00:04:37.349> it's<00:04:37.770> much<00:04:38.160> more

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
so remember it's easy it's much more

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.400 
so remember it's easy it's much more
delicious<00:04:38.759> and<00:04:39.120> I<00:04:39.389> do<00:04:39.449> hope<00:04:39.900> that<00:04:39.930> you'll<00:04:40.199> try

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
delicious and I do hope that you'll try

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.530 
delicious and I do hope that you'll try
it
