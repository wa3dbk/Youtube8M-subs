00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.010 
just makes them look thicker because
there's<00:04:53.550> more<00:04:53.730> of<00:04:53.850> a<00:04:53.910> contrast<00:04:54.390> between<00:04:54.570> where

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
there's more of a contrast between where

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.460 
there's more of a contrast between where
your<00:04:55.140> brow<00:04:55.290> starts<00:04:55.680> and<00:04:55.860> where<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.040> ends<00:04:56.280> so

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
your brow starts and where it ends so

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.510 
your brow starts and where it ends so
that<00:04:58.470> has<00:04:58.590> made<00:04:58.740> a<00:04:58.770> huge<00:04:58.980> difference<00:04:59.160> I<00:04:59.490> think

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
that has made a huge difference I think

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.160 
that has made a huge difference I think
in<00:04:59.850> my<00:04:59.970> brows<00:05:00.180> they<00:05:01.080> look<00:05:01.320> so<00:05:01.530> much<00:05:01.740> more<00:05:02.090> just

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
in my brows they look so much more just

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.620 
in my brows they look so much more just
put<00:05:04.170> together<00:05:04.320> now<00:05:04.770> that<00:05:05.130> I<00:05:05.640> kind<00:05:06.180> of<00:05:06.300> trend

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
put together now that I kind of trend

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.930 
put together now that I kind of trend
the<00:05:06.900> top<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.350> the<00:05:07.440> bottom<00:05:07.590> so<00:05:08.070> i<00:05:08.310> definitely

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
the top and the bottom so i definitely

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.330 
the top and the bottom so i definitely
recommend<00:05:09.150> doing<00:05:09.900> that<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.710> your<00:05:10.800> brows<00:05:11.010> if

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
recommend doing that to your brows if

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.300 
recommend doing that to your brows if
you<00:05:11.520> want<00:05:11.760> a<00:05:11.970> mortify<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.510> look<00:05:13.100> and<00:05:14.100> then

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
you want a mortify the look and then

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.880 
you want a mortify the look and then
other<00:05:14.460> than<00:05:14.550> that<00:05:14.790> just<00:05:14.820> pluck<00:05:15.360> away

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
other than that just pluck away

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.380 
other than that just pluck away
everything<00:05:16.890> I<00:05:17.190> just<00:05:17.250> pluck<00:05:17.730> all<00:05:17.940> these<00:05:18.210> I've

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
everything I just pluck all these I've

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.480 
everything I just pluck all these I've
got<00:05:18.570> tons<00:05:18.840> of<00:05:18.960> blonde<00:05:19.230> hairs<00:05:19.500> and<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:20.370> makes

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
got tons of blonde hairs and it makes

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.980 
got tons of blonde hairs and it makes
such<00:05:20.670> a<00:05:20.700> big<00:05:20.760> difference<00:05:20.910> like<00:05:21.360> you<00:05:21.750> don't<00:05:21.900> see

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
such a big difference like you don't see

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.240 
such a big difference like you don't see
them<00:05:22.290> and<00:05:22.530> it<00:05:22.620> doesn't<00:05:22.830> really<00:05:22.950> make<00:05:23.100> a

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
them and it doesn't really make a

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.140 
them and it doesn't really make a
difference<00:05:23.490> when<00:05:23.790> you're<00:05:23.880> looking<00:05:24.090> at

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150
