so<00:00:04.100> here<00:00:04.310> again<00:00:04.430> is<00:00:04.609> the<00:00:04.819> hypothalamus<00:00:06.100> right

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100 
so here again is the hypothalamus right

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.879 
so here again is the hypothalamus right
over<00:00:07.370> here<00:00:07.759> this<00:00:08.360> place<00:00:08.660> where<00:00:08.990> you<00:00:09.500> see<00:00:09.710> this

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
over here this place where you see this

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.080 
over here this place where you see this
bulge<00:00:10.250> this<00:00:10.790> is<00:00:11.150> the<00:00:11.450> medial<00:00:11.960> side<00:00:12.679> of<00:00:13.059> one<00:00:14.059> of

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
bulge this is the medial side of one of

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.040 
bulge this is the medial side of one of
the<00:00:14.299> two<00:00:14.509> talam<00:00:15.139> I<00:00:15.610> so<00:00:16.610> you<00:00:16.670> have<00:00:17.150> two<00:00:17.450> thousand

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
the two talam I so you have two thousand

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.710 
the two talam I so you have two thousand
line<00:00:18.200> and<00:00:18.610> this<00:00:19.610> is<00:00:19.849> one<00:00:20.210> of<00:00:21.399> them<00:00:22.399> and<00:00:22.640> you<00:00:23.540> can

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
line and this is one of them and you can

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.479 
line and this is one of them and you can
see<00:00:23.869> right<00:00:24.020> over<00:00:24.079> here<00:00:24.470> there<00:00:24.800> is<00:00:24.829> little<00:00:25.220> knob

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:25.489 
see right over here there is little knob

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.589 
see right over here there is little knob
here<00:00:26.079> this<00:00:27.079> represents<00:00:27.520> the<00:00:28.520> place<00:00:28.790> where<00:00:29.210> in

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
here this represents the place where in

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.840 
here this represents the place where in
most<00:00:30.410> brains<00:00:30.800> you<00:00:31.040> have<00:00:31.340> a<00:00:31.730> bridge<00:00:32.719> of<00:00:33.050> tissue

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
most brains you have a bridge of tissue

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.870 
most brains you have a bridge of tissue
connecting<00:00:34.850> the<00:00:35.060> two<00:00:35.330> phthalimide<00:00:36.640> so<00:00:37.640> this

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
connecting the two phthalimide so this

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.530 
connecting the two phthalimide so this
is<00:00:38.060> referred<00:00:39.020> to<00:00:39.050> as<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:40.340> inter<00:00:40.910> thalamic

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
is referred to as the inter thalamic

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.440 
is referred to as the inter thalamic
adhesion<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:43.100> is<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:43.400> inter<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:44.090> lamech

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
adhesion this is the inter the lamech

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.260 
adhesion this is the inter the lamech
adhesion<00:00:45.200> so<00:00:45.920> right<00:00:46.100> over<00:00:46.130> here<00:00:46.340> we<00:00:46.490> have<00:00:46.790> the

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
adhesion so right over here we have the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.350 
adhesion so right over here we have the
thalamus<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:48.430> we're<00:00:49.430> only<00:00:49.490> seeing<00:00:49.910> a<00:00:50.120> small

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
thalamus and we're only seeing a small

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.030 
thalamus and we're only seeing a small
part<00:00:50.810> of<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:51.020> thalamus<00:00:51.230> because<00:00:51.740> it<00:00:51.950> bulges

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
part of the thalamus because it bulges

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.569 
part of the thalamus because it bulges
behind<00:00:55.540> what<00:00:56.540> you're<00:00:56.690> seeing<00:00:56.900> here<00:00:57.460> so<00:00:58.460> you're

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
behind what you're seeing here so you're

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.270 
behind what you're seeing here so you're
only<00:00:58.640> seeing<00:00:58.880> a<00:00:58.970> small<00:00:59.180> piece<00:00:59.480> of<00:00:59.510> this

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
only seeing a small piece of this

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.370
