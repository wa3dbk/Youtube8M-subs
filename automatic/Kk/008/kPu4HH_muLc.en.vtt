tutorial<00:00:54.190> now<00:00:54.790> what<00:00:55.030> you<00:00:55.150> want<00:00:55.330> to<00:00:55.390> try<00:00:55.570> to<00:00:55.630> do

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
tutorial now what you want to try to do

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.390 
tutorial now what you want to try to do
is<00:00:55.930> get<00:00:56.080> a<00:00:56.110> care<00:00:56.380> package<00:00:56.590> about<00:00:56.890> that

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
is get a care package about that

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.280 
is get a care package about that
distance<00:00:57.910> away<00:00:58.060> where<00:00:58.420> we<00:00:58.450> just<00:00:58.720> do<00:00:58.900> that<00:00:59.050> care

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
distance away where we just do that care

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.220 
distance away where we just do that care
package<00:00:59.440> marker<00:00:59.950> but<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:01.120> probe<00:01:01.420> a<00:01:01.630> biggest

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
package marker but the probe a biggest

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.650 
package marker but the probe a biggest
problem<00:01:02.620> with<00:01:02.680> this<00:01:02.860> is<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:03.820> care<00:01:04.120> packages

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
problem with this is the care packages

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.500 
problem with this is the care packages
sway<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.530> by<00:01:05.740> this<00:01:05.800> I<00:01:06.160> mean<00:01:06.369> the<00:01:06.970> chopper<00:01:07.300> that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
sway and by this I mean the chopper that

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.990 
sway and by this I mean the chopper that
drops<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.470> care<00:01:08.650> pack<00:01:08.920> it<00:01:09.160> rocks<00:01:09.490> back<00:01:09.760> and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
drops the care pack it rocks back and

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.540 
drops the care pack it rocks back and
forth<00:01:10.270> before<00:01:11.050> it<00:01:11.470> drops<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:11.890> care<00:01:12.070> pack<00:01:12.310> so

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
forth before it drops the care pack so

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.460 
forth before it drops the care pack so
it<00:01:12.700> doesn't<00:01:13.119> always<00:01:13.270> land<00:01:13.630> exactly<00:01:13.840> where<00:01:14.350> the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
it doesn't always land exactly where the

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.410 
it doesn't always land exactly where the
marker<00:01:14.830> is<00:01:14.950> as<00:01:15.130> you<00:01:15.610> saw<00:01:15.820> right<00:01:16.030> there<00:01:16.300> it

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
marker is as you saw right there it

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.850 
marker is as you saw right there it
didn't<00:01:16.690> land<00:01:16.869> where<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.110> marker<00:01:17.440> was<00:01:17.590> but<00:01:17.740> it

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
didn't land where the marker was but it

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.520 
didn't land where the marker was but it
rolled<00:01:18.130> over<00:01:18.369> into<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.760> spot<00:01:19.030> so<00:01:19.530> still

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
rolled over into the spot so still

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.650 
rolled over into the spot so still
worked<00:01:20.740> out<00:01:20.920> for<00:01:21.130> you<00:01:21.250> fine<00:01:21.550> but<00:01:22.270> then<00:01:22.420> right

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
worked out for you fine but then right

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.719 
worked out for you fine but then right
there<00:01:22.930> he<00:01:23.080> threw<00:01:23.320> that<00:01:23.470> care<00:01:23.770> pack<00:01:24.010> right<00:01:24.400> next

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
there he threw that care pack right next

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.010 
there he threw that care pack right next
to<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:24.940> wall<00:01:25.119> which<00:01:25.300> didn't<00:01:25.750> look<00:01:25.810> like<00:01:25.869> a

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
to the wall which didn't look like a

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.260 
to the wall which didn't look like a
good<00:01:26.290> spot<00:01:26.440> but<00:01:27.100> then<00:01:27.250> it's<00:01:27.400> swayed<00:01:27.729> over<00:01:28.060> into

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
good spot but then it's swayed over into

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.790 
good spot but then it's swayed over into
a<00:01:28.300> good<00:01:28.570> spot<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:29.020> started<00:01:29.320> reaching<00:01:29.710> this

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
a good spot and started reaching this

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.480 
a good spot and started reaching this
right<00:01:30.040> here

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
right here

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.870 
right here
so<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.150> sway<00:01:31.540> really<00:01:32.259> takes<00:01:32.830> a<00:01:32.979> big<00:01:33.250> effect<00:01:33.700> in

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
so the sway really takes a big effect in

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.040 
so the sway really takes a big effect in
whether<00:01:34.090> or<00:01:34.270> not<00:01:34.420> you're<00:01:34.600> actually<00:01:34.930> gonna

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
whether or not you're actually gonna

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.530 
whether or not you're actually gonna
breach<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:35.740> then<00:01:36.400> right<00:01:37.120> here<00:01:37.150> I've<00:01:37.390> just

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
breach and then right here I've just

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.180 
breach and then right here I've just
speeded<00:01:37.900> up<00:01:38.020> because<00:01:38.380> it's<00:01:38.620> a<00:01:38.710> lot<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:39.010> time

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
speeded up because it's a lot of time

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.280 
speeded up because it's a lot of time
with<00:01:39.430> me<00:01:39.700> just<00:01:39.970> running<00:01:40.330> into<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.660> corner<00:01:41.050> and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
with me just running into the corner and

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.020 
with me just running into the corner and
trying<00:01:42.040> to<00:01:42.160> just<00:01:42.340> run<00:01:42.550> out<00:01:42.700> cuz<00:01:42.880> that's

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
trying to just run out cuz that's

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.640 
trying to just run out cuz that's
usually<00:01:43.570> what<00:01:43.720> you<00:01:43.840> do<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.140> you<00:01:44.260> have<00:01:44.350> somebody

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
usually what you do is you have somebody

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.620 
usually what you do is you have somebody
jump<00:01:45.160> on<00:01:45.310> your<00:01:45.460> head<00:01:45.640> when<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:45.940> get<00:01:46.060> stuck<00:01:46.390> and

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
jump on your head when you get stuck and

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.930 
jump on your head when you get stuck and
then<00:01:47.110> run<00:01:47.380> out<00:01:47.410> because<00:01:47.680> knifing<00:01:48.430> does<00:01:48.610> not

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
then run out because knifing does not

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.390 
then run out because knifing does not
you<00:01:49.870> can't<00:01:50.140> lunge<00:01:50.530> when<00:01:50.800> you're<00:01:50.920> standing<00:01:51.190> in

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
you can't lunge when you're standing in

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.090 
you can't lunge when you're standing in
one<00:01:51.460> spot<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.720> knifing<00:01:53.260> will<00:01:53.409> not<00:01:53.620> be<00:01:53.980> able

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
one spot so the knifing will not be able

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.950 
one spot so the knifing will not be able
to<00:01:54.220> lunge<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:54.850> outside<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.360> map<00:01:55.540> like<00:01:55.810> in

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
to lunge you outside the map like in

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.590 
to lunge you outside the map like in
black<00:01:56.200> ops<00:01:56.440> only<00:01:57.340> jumping<00:01:57.790> on<00:01:57.970> your<00:01:58.150> head<00:01:58.360> will

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
black ops only jumping on your head will

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.870 
black ops only jumping on your head will
and<00:01:58.810> right<00:01:59.440> here<00:01:59.740> what<00:02:00.100> happens<00:02:00.520> is<00:02:00.700> like<00:02:00.850> a

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
and right here what happens is like a

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.930 
and right here what happens is like a
once-in-a-lifetime<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:03.430> this<00:02:03.580> is<00:02:03.760> like

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
once-in-a-lifetime but this is like

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.910 
once-in-a-lifetime but this is like
jumping<00:02:04.570> should<00:02:04.930> be<00:02:05.020> your<00:02:05.140> last<00:02:05.350> resort<00:02:05.530> cuz

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
jumping should be your last resort cuz

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.100 
jumping should be your last resort cuz
right<00:02:06.130> here<00:02:06.430> he<00:02:07.060> couldn't<00:02:07.450> jump<00:02:07.659> on<00:02:07.780> our<00:02:07.900> heads

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
right here he couldn't jump on our heads

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.330 
right here he couldn't jump on our heads
cause<00:02:08.320> we're<00:02:08.470> down<00:02:08.649> beneath<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.130> care

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
cause we're down beneath the care

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.770 
cause we're down beneath the care
package<00:02:09.610> too<00:02:09.760> much<00:02:09.910> but<00:02:10.119> then<00:02:10.269> right<00:02:10.450> here<00:02:10.600> you

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
package too much but then right here you

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.560 
package too much but then right here you
see<00:02:10.959> I<00:02:10.989> jump<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.830> then<00:02:12.430> he<00:02:12.640> jumps<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.209> hits<00:02:13.420> my

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
see I jump and then he jumps and hits my

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.539 
see I jump and then he jumps and hits my
head<00:02:13.720> at<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.930> same<00:02:14.140> time<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.560> jump<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.430> then

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
head at the same time that jump and then

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.160 
head at the same time that jump and then
I<00:02:15.640> was<00:02:15.760> able<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.030> get<00:02:16.209> out<00:02:16.299> that<00:02:16.540> way<00:02:16.750> but<00:02:16.810> this

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
I was able to get out that way but this

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.289 
I was able to get out that way but this
thing<00:02:17.440> that's<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:18.010> rare<00:02:18.310> thing<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.670> happen<00:02:18.790> as

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
thing that's a rare thing to happen as

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.539 
thing that's a rare thing to happen as
the<00:02:19.480> jumping<00:02:19.989> reaching<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.560> doesn't<00:02:21.400> happen

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
the jumping reaching it doesn't happen

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.440 
the jumping reaching it doesn't happen
very<00:02:21.760> often<00:02:22.209> it's<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:23.130> really<00:02:24.130> rare<00:02:24.280> but<00:02:24.450> it's

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
very often it's a really rare but it's

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.300 
very often it's a really rare but it's
hey<00:02:26.110> if<00:02:26.290> you're<00:02:26.440> not<00:02:26.500> breaching<00:02:26.799> it'll<00:02:27.190> be

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
hey if you're not breaching it'll be

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.100 
hey if you're not breaching it'll be
just<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.549> last<00:02:27.820> resort<00:02:28.150> thing<00:02:28.390> just<00:02:28.660> jump<00:02:28.959> and

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
just the last resort thing just jump and

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.370 
just the last resort thing just jump and
try<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.320> breach<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.799> way<00:02:29.980> but

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
try to breach that way but

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.170 
try to breach that way but
I'm<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.920> just<00:02:32.010> like<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.520> think<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.760> moment<00:02:32.880> here

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
I'm I just like to think a moment here

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.700 
I'm I just like to think a moment here
to<00:02:33.270> say<00:02:33.480> sorry<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.080> we<00:02:34.350> haven't<00:02:34.530> been

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
to say sorry that we haven't been

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.250 
to say sorry that we haven't been
uploading<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.370> much<00:02:35.610> we<00:02:36.270> actually<00:02:36.690> found

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
uploading that much we actually found

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.780 
uploading that much we actually found
the<00:02:37.470> breaching<00:02:37.830> technique<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.400> got<00:02:38.550> out<00:02:38.640> of

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
the breaching technique and got out of

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.270 
the breaching technique and got out of
our<00:02:38.880> first<00:02:39.180> map<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.630> day<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.050> came<00:02:40.320> out<00:02:40.530> but

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
our first map the day it came out but

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.770 
our first map the day it came out but
we've<00:02:41.460> just<00:02:41.490> been<00:02:41.820> trying<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.120> perfect<00:02:42.360> the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
we've just been trying to perfect the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.560 
we've just been trying to perfect the
technique<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.610> try<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.670> just<00:02:45.060> make<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.450> as

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
technique and try to just make it as

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.390 
technique and try to just make it as
easy<00:02:45.810> as<00:02:45.960> possible<00:02:46.080> before<00:02:47.010> we<00:02:47.040> actually

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
easy as possible before we actually

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.940 
easy as possible before we actually
uploaded<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.170> what<00:02:49.380> we've<00:02:49.530> been

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
uploaded it and this is what we've been

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.500 
uploaded it and this is what we've been
able<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.220> come<00:02:50.460> up<00:02:50.520> with<00:02:50.730> before<00:02:51.270> we<00:02:51.420> were

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
able to come up with before we were

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.510 
able to come up with before we were
actually<00:02:51.630> using<00:02:51.870> hyah<00:02:52.380> chills<00:02:52.740> to<00:02:53.040> bounce<00:02:53.220> the

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
actually using hyah chills to bounce the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.820 
actually using hyah chills to bounce the
care<00:02:54.390> packs<00:02:54.630> off<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:55.260> just<00:02:55.320> want<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.680> take<00:02:55.800> a

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
care packs off I just want to take a

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.440 
care packs off I just want to take a
minute<00:02:55.980> right<00:02:56.160> here<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.460> say<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.970> road<00:02:57.240> is

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
minute right here to say that road is

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.540 
minute right here to say that road is
the<00:02:57.570> road<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.870> was<00:02:58.020> at<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.800> end<00:02:58.980> up<00:02:59.220> in<00:02:59.430> the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
the road I was at the end up in the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.090 
the road I was at the end up in the
beginning<00:02:59.820> of<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.180> video<00:03:00.330> but<00:03:01.260> yeah<00:03:01.830> we<00:03:02.010> were

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
beginning of the video but yeah we were

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.950 
beginning of the video but yeah we were
using<00:03:02.250> riot<00:03:02.670> shields<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.240> Bostick<00:03:03.600> air<00:03:03.750> packs

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
using riot shields the Bostick air packs

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.990 
using riot shields the Bostick air packs
off<00:03:04.200> just<00:03:04.470> because<00:03:04.740> we<00:03:05.250> thought<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.760> would<00:03:05.850> be

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
off just because we thought it would be

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.600 
off just because we thought it would be
easier<00:03:06.380> not<00:03:07.380> having<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.950> get<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.190> kill<00:03:08.490> streak

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
easier not having to get a kill streak

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.310 
easier not having to get a kill streak
to<00:03:08.880> bounce<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.210> off<00:03:09.300> ugh<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:09.690> place<00:03:09.780> arrived

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
to bounce it off ugh this place arrived

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.990 
to bounce it off ugh this place arrived
shields<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.040> got<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.370> work<00:03:11.520> up<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.730> two

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
shields and you got to work up to two

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.640 
shields and you got to work up to two
killstreaks<00:03:12.570> instead<00:03:12.990> of<00:03:13.080> getting<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.410> carry

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
killstreaks instead of getting to carry

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.160 
killstreaks instead of getting to carry
packs<00:03:13.830> just<00:03:14.070> beat<00:03:14.460> one<00:03:14.510> but<00:03:15.510> bouncing<00:03:15.960> it<00:03:16.110> off

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
packs just beat one but bouncing it off

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.380 
packs just beat one but bouncing it off
with<00:03:16.350> one<00:03:16.560> care<00:03:16.830> package<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.430> whole<00:03:18.120> lot

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
with one care package is a whole lot

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.390 
with one care package is a whole lot
easier<00:03:18.420> yeah<00:03:19.380> another<00:03:19.710> point<00:03:20.070> we're<00:03:20.190> actually

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
easier yeah another point we're actually

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.140 
easier yeah another point we're actually
using<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:21.890> AGR<00:03:22.890> drones<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.580> push<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.940> care

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
using the AGR drones to push the care

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.000 
using the AGR drones to push the care
pack<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:25.080> wasn't<00:03:25.290> turning<00:03:25.650> out<00:03:25.770> so<00:03:25.980> well

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
pack and that wasn't turning out so well

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.970 
pack and that wasn't turning out so well
but<00:03:26.400> this<00:03:26.670> turned<00:03:27.000> out<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.270> be<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.540> best<00:03:27.980> way

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
but this turned out to be the best way

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.700 
but this turned out to be the best way
that<00:03:29.010> we<00:03:29.340> could<00:03:29.520> do<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.320> this<00:03:31.320> is<00:03:31.440> what<00:03:31.590> we

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
that we could do it and this is what we

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.700 
that we could do it and this is what we
came<00:03:31.920> up<00:03:32.100> with<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.300> yes<00:03:33.990> you<00:03:34.200> guys<00:03:34.350> we

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
came up with and and yes you guys we

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.650 
came up with and and yes you guys we
know<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.190> other<00:03:35.340> people<00:03:35.460> are<00:03:35.820> uploading<00:03:36.510> out

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
know that other people are uploading out

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.570 
know that other people are uploading out
of<00:03:36.780> maps<00:03:36.990> using<00:03:37.470> our<00:03:37.620> technique<00:03:38.130> we<00:03:38.340> keep

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
of maps using our technique we keep

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.340 
of maps using our technique we keep
getting<00:03:38.700> people<00:03:39.180> linking<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.690> videos<00:03:40.020> to<00:03:40.230> us

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
getting people linking the videos to us

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.960
