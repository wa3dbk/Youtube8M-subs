00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
simple but in my previous bell we work

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.149 
simple but in my previous bell we work
it<00:01:47.700> out<00:01:47.939> by<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> zoo<00:01:48.720> Morel<00:01:49.020> packing<00:01:49.860> focus

it out by a zoo Morel packing focus

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.969 
it out by a zoo Morel packing focus
punch<00:01:50.399> still<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:51.299> did<00:01:51.450> break<00:01:51.689> us<00:01:52.290> up<00:01:52.710> in

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
punch still we did break us up in

to swallow is like you know screw it
let's<00:01:56.820> go<00:01:56.939> straight<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.450> obvious<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.960> see

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
let's go straight for the obvious I see

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.620 
let's go straight for the obvious I see
this<00:01:58.890> guy<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.100> relying<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.759> me<00:01:59.909> predicting<00:02:00.450> way

this guy is relying on me predicting way

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.780 
this guy is relying on me predicting way
too<00:02:00.689> much<00:02:00.930> now<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.469> want<00:02:01.890> him<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.219> start

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
too much now I want him to start

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.070 
too much now I want him to start
predicting<00:02:03.329> for

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
predicting for

change<00:02:04.410> so<00:02:05.250> I'm<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.580> kind<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.760> brave<00:02:06.240> bird<00:02:06.480> I

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
change so I'm just kind of brave bird I

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.540 
change so I'm just kind of brave bird I
can<00:02:06.810> all<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:07.140> logic<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.710> using<00:02:08.040> focus<00:02:08.369> punch

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
can all the logic in using focus punch

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.060 
can all the logic in using focus punch

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
safe and on faster I know it's gonna be

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.930 
safe and on faster I know it's gonna be
overkill<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.230> he<00:03:19.860> actually<00:03:19.980> closed<00:03:20.370> into<00:03:20.700> San

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
overkill and he actually closed into San

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
/ a really good thing let's go tank but

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.020

but pokes that lap recovery are going to

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.040 
but pokes that lap recovery are going to
go<00:03:29.310> down<00:03:29.550> eventually<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.420> as<00:03:30.600> you<00:03:30.750> can<00:03:30.840> see<00:03:31.019> I

left<00:03:50.580> i'm<00:03:51.420> pretty<00:03:51.690> sure<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:51.930> i<00:03:52.170> can<00:03:52.200> take

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
left i'm pretty sure that i can take

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.990 
left i'm pretty sure that i can take
true<00:03:52.709> because<00:03:53.010> I'm<00:03:53.100> physical<00:03:53.459> bulky<00:03:53.730> as<00:03:53.790> well

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
true because I'm physical bulky as well

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.660 
true because I'm physical bulky as well
and<00:03:54.239> it<00:03:55.200> is<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.769> but<00:03:55.980> I'm<00:03:56.100> still<00:03:56.370> pretty<00:03:56.519> sure

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
and it is that but I'm still pretty sure

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.940 
and it is that but I'm still pretty sure
and<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.150> do<00:03:57.209> take<00:03:57.630> two<00:03:57.840> right<00:03:58.470> now<00:03:58.620> I'm<00:03:58.709> going<00:03:58.890> to

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
and I do take two right now I'm going to

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.580 
and I do take two right now I'm going to
go<00:03:59.040> into<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.370> whole<00:03:59.670> new<00:03:59.700> level<00:04:00.200> I'm<00:04:01.200> gonna<00:04:01.440> be

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
go into a whole new level I'm gonna be

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.650 
go into a whole new level I'm gonna be
in<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.920> game<00:04:02.100> I'm<00:04:02.310> like<00:04:02.519> predicting<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.540> the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
in the game I'm like predicting to the

in the game I'm like predicting to the
bones<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.170> know<00:04:04.590> he's<00:04:04.950> bluffing<00:04:05.430> giving<00:04:06.060> me

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
bones I know he's bluffing giving me

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.820 
bones I know he's bluffing giving me
thinking<00:04:06.570> he<00:04:06.720> doesn't<00:04:06.870> have<00:04:07.260> racks<00:04:07.500> been

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
thinking he doesn't have racks been

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.460 
thinking he doesn't have racks been
right<00:04:08.070> I<00:04:08.310> did<00:04:08.760> put<00:04:08.940> up<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.209> rocks<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.660> I<00:04:10.410> know

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
right I did put up the rocks and I know

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.860 
right I did put up the rocks and I know
I<00:04:10.799> mr.<00:04:11.250> I'm<00:04:11.370> gun<00:04:11.820> can<00:04:12.090> just<00:04:12.390> to<00:04:12.510> destroy

I mr. I'm gun can just to destroy
his<00:04:13.050> leftovers<00:04:13.560> so<00:04:14.459> I<00:04:14.700> know<00:04:15.000> he's<00:04:15.510> gonna

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
his leftovers so I know he's gonna

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.610

after not using it before I'm pretty

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.199 
after not using it before I'm pretty
sure<00:04:18.840> he's<00:04:18.989> gonna<00:04:19.229> rapid<00:04:19.590> spin<00:04:19.799> just<00:04:20.699> to<00:04:20.880> save
