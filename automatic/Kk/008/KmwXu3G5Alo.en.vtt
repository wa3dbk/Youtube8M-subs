00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.820
 hello everyone how are you 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.130
 and today we find ourselves 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.439
 a first commented video so that's 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.000
 a presentation of my time so 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.529
 just before I start I wanted 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.840
 accurate and a little thing I'm 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.420
 do not pretend to be a fisherman 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.490
 I am really an amateur so the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.109
 rude please do not look 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.699
 this is a video that please do not 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.040
 not comment on it incorrectly 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:37.589
 they tell us lakepa and try to 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.300
 respect the work done on this one is going 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.720
 go directly to the presentation of 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.860
 theirs so I often advocate these 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.400
 hours at the beginning of the season 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.690
 why because carnivores are 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.269
 on the young fry in the new 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.949
 reproduction of this year so we go 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.049
 start directly with the little ones 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.420
 theirs so everybody knows them 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:01:00.030
 little reigns here are the regrets do not know 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.559
 not if you see very well so that's it 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.199
 really works really well with a swim 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.070
 really very very attractive but me 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.770
 what I do is I love him 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.770
 often on a tp leaded with 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.030
 speaking texan it really works really 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.460
 well 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.620
 it's like these it's super nice 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.620
 so different colors more or less 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.630
 false and more or less brilliant here 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.400
 for example this one bicolor she 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.010
 works really well I do not know if 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.690
 you 're really going to see so just for 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.320
 specify at the camera level you 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.730
 will surely see focus I am 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.070
 sorry I can not settle the 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.240
 worry about that then second 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.800
 their meaning the Wolofs at Sauber 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.370
 so this one really is a magnet 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.980
 perch 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.780
 it's beautiful so either wanting them 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.410
 universe often beginning of season it's this 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.120
 that I do I bring it back to linear and 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.650
 mid-season I want dandy like 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.530
 that's really her little girl she was going 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.560
 really beautiful super trail attracts 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.840
 so in different colors green with 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.030
 little swords 2 g it goes nickel 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.220
 it's great for the boom I'm going 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.860
 of ashes with scenic and even of 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.479
 pike so we'll go to theirs 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.340
 following then the next bacon is a 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.709
 lure that everyone knows in 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.690
 different colors 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.490
 it's mister twist that does that 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.140
 so it's the little twist 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.360
 ideal for the pole to put in 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.190

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.870
 is really beautiful 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.540
 I recommend it clearly so 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.040
