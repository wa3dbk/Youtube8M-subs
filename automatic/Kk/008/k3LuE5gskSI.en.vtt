first color and just going to be using
this<00:02:08.580> sort<00:02:08.850> of<00:02:08.910> champagne<00:02:09.420> II<00:02:09.450> color<00:02:09.780> as<00:02:10.080> a

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
this sort of champagne II color as a

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.590 
this sort of champagne II color as a
base<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.950> I'm<00:02:11.910> actually<00:02:12.060> going<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.420> use<00:02:12.570> my

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
base and I'm actually going to use my

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.720 
base and I'm actually going to use my
finger<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.200> apply<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.860> because<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:14.460> feel

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
finger to apply it because I just feel

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.790 
finger to apply it because I just feel
like<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:15.000> gives<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.300> more<00:02:15.420> natural<00:02:15.630> finish<00:02:16.590> and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
like it gives it more natural finish and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.470 
like it gives it more natural finish and
it's<00:02:16.920> also<00:02:17.070> easier<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.580> apply<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.120> using

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
it's also easier to apply that using

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.410 
it's also easier to apply that using
eyeshadow<00:02:18.690> brush<00:02:22.460> ok<00:02:23.460> so<00:02:23.550> now<00:02:23.850> I'm<00:02:23.970> going<00:02:24.120> to

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
eyeshadow brush ok so now I'm going to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.560

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
be using this brown color here to just

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.380 
be using this brown color here to just
put<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.650> outer<00:02:28.980> edges<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.520> my<00:02:29.730> eyes<00:02:30.030> and

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
put on the outer edges of my eyes and

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.720 
put on the outer edges of my eyes and
blend<00:02:30.600> into<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.140> crease<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.740> i<00:02:32.520> will<00:02:32.700> be

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
blend into the crease and i will be

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.300 
blend into the crease and i will be
using<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.420> brush<00:02:33.630> for<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.350> just<00:02:34.590> works

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
using this brush for that it just works

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.180 
using this brush for that it just works
better<00:02:35.520> for<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.720> step<00:02:37.050> using<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.710> brush<00:02:37.920> than

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
better for this step using a brush than

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:46.310 
better for this step using a brush than
your<00:02:38.340> hand<00:02:43.489> ok<00:02:44.489> so<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.880> next<00:02:44.910> step<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.510> going
