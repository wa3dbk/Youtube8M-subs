some<00:02:21.420> not<00:02:21.599> big<00:02:21.840> changes<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.349> depends<00:02:22.709> on<00:02:22.769> how

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
some not big changes it depends on how

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.250 
some not big changes it depends on how
you<00:02:22.980> look<00:02:23.219> at<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:24.000> me<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.239> feels<00:02:24.420> more<00:02:25.019> or<00:02:25.109> less

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
you look at to me it feels more or less

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.929 
you look at to me it feels more or less
the<00:02:25.409> same<00:02:25.439> I<00:02:25.859> mean<00:02:26.040> you're<00:02:26.159> still<00:02:26.370> pedaling

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
the same I mean you're still pedaling

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.470 
the same I mean you're still pedaling
the<00:02:26.969> bike<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.420> still<00:02:27.689> sit<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.109> saddle<00:02:29.480> you

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
the bike you still sit on the saddle you

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.899 
the bike you still sit on the saddle you
still<00:02:30.750> have<00:02:30.870> hamla<00:02:31.200> bars<00:02:31.489> there's<00:02:32.489> no<00:02:32.640> motor

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
still have hamla bars there's no motor

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:41.980 
still have hamla bars there's no motor
pushing<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.480> bike<00:02:33.719> yet<00:02:34.139> so

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.560 

yeah<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:43.460> don't<00:02:43.640> know<00:02:43.880> if<00:02:44.000> i've<00:02:44.150> really<00:02:44.420> noticed

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
yeah I don't know if i've really noticed

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.180 
yeah I don't know if i've really noticed
the<00:02:44.840> difference<00:02:44.990> I<00:02:45.290> think<00:02:45.320> it's<00:02:45.650> always<00:02:45.980> been

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
the difference I think it's always been

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.980 
the difference I think it's always been
really<00:02:46.430> fast<00:02:46.850> on<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.270> descents<00:02:48.070> clearly<00:02:49.990> yeah

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
really fast on the descents clearly yeah

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.010 
really fast on the descents clearly yeah
clearly<00:02:51.380> in<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.860> inspain<00:02:52.870> nebulae<00:02:53.870> was

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
clearly in the inspain nebulae was

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.900 
clearly in the inspain nebulae was
trying<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.350> drop<00:02:54.530> me<00:02:54.710> on<00:02:54.740> the<00:02:54.950> descent<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.610> mean

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
trying to drop me on the descent I mean

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.900 
trying to drop me on the descent I mean
that<00:02:56.060> was<00:02:56.210> his<00:02:56.530> sole<00:02:57.530> goal<00:02:57.770> many<00:02:58.070> times<00:02:58.400> was<00:02:58.730> to

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
that was his sole goal many times was to

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.280 
that was his sole goal many times was to
get<00:02:59.060> ready<00:02:59.240> to<00:02:59.390> try<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.600> get<00:02:59.750> rid<00:02:59.900> of<00:02:59.930> me<00:03:00.080> on<00:03:00.170> the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
get ready to try to get rid of me on the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.870 
get ready to try to get rid of me on the
descents<00:03:00.740> and<00:03:00.830> bridge<00:03:01.070> up<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.400> teammate<00:03:01.820> or

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
descents and bridge up to a teammate or

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.990 
descents and bridge up to a teammate or
two<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.840> he<00:03:02.930> put<00:03:03.140> up<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.350> road<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:03.830> that<00:03:04.730> was

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
two that he put up the road so that was

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.440 
two that he put up the road so that was
definitely<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.450> factor<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.890> i<00:03:07.490> am<00:03:07.910> not<00:03:07.970> certain

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
definitely a factor and i am not certain

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.770 
definitely a factor and i am not certain
if<00:03:08.780> it's<00:03:08.960> changed<00:03:09.620> or<00:03:09.890> if<00:03:10.100> that<00:03:10.310> was<00:03:10.460> just<00:03:10.780> what

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
if it's changed or if that was just what

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.840 
if it's changed or if that was just what
was<00:03:11.990> the<00:03:12.290> option<00:03:12.710> that<00:03:12.740> was<00:03:13.010> left<00:03:13.310> at<00:03:13.460> the<00:03:13.520> time

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
was the option that was left at the time

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.560 
was the option that was left at the time
and<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:15.080> clearly<00:03:15.610> options<00:03:16.610> when<00:03:16.820> you<00:03:16.970> when<00:03:17.540> you

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
and so clearly options when you when you

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.090 
and so clearly options when you when you
race<00:03:17.840> in<00:03:18.020> a<00:03:18.110> bike<00:03:18.320> if<00:03:18.500> you're<00:03:18.650> not<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:18.890> best

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
race in a bike if you're not the best

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.380 
race in a bike if you're not the best
climber<00:03:19.400> you<00:03:19.520> got<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.760> find<00:03:19.970> some<00:03:20.150> other<00:03:20.270> way

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
climber you got to find some other way

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.370 
climber you got to find some other way
to<00:03:20.510> get<00:03:20.780> rid<00:03:20.990> of<00:03:21.020> a<00:03:21.140> guy<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:22.580> so<00:03:23.180> as<00:03:23.990> we've

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
to get rid of a guy and and so as we've

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.440 
to get rid of a guy and and so as we've
seen<00:03:24.620> of<00:03:24.830> course<00:03:25.130> if<00:03:25.850> you're<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.210> best

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
seen of course if you're the best

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.030 
seen of course if you're the best
climber<00:03:26.780> in<00:03:26.960> the<00:03:27.020> best<00:03:27.200> time<00:03:27.410> trellis<00:03:27.800> in<00:03:27.950> a

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
climber in the best time trellis in a

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.290 
climber in the best time trellis in a
grand<00:03:28.280> tour<00:03:28.580> you're<00:03:28.790> not<00:03:28.940> going<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.150> try<00:03:29.270> to

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
grand tour you're not going to try to

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.790 
grand tour you're not going to try to
drop<00:03:29.540> someone<00:03:29.810> on<00:03:30.020> the<00:03:30.110> descent<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.620> don't

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
drop someone on the descent you don't

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.020 
drop someone on the descent you don't
care<00:03:31.010> yeah<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.270> and<00:03:32.690> so<00:03:33.050> I'm<00:03:33.830> not<00:03:34.070> certain<00:03:34.640> if

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
care yeah and and so I'm not certain if

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.820 
care yeah and and so I'm not certain if
it's<00:03:35.240> changed<00:03:35.810> or<00:03:35.990> if<00:03:36.230> it's<00:03:36.380> always<00:03:36.650> been

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
it's changed or if it's always been

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.800 
it's changed or if it's always been
there<00:03:37.010> but<00:03:37.070> clearly<00:03:37.670> we<00:03:37.940> hear<00:03:38.240> about<00:03:38.270> it<00:03:38.630> more

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
there but clearly we hear about it more

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.720 
there but clearly we hear about it more
but<00:03:38.990> maybe<00:03:39.440> we<00:03:39.650> hear<00:03:39.890> about<00:03:39.920> more<00:03:40.340> because<00:03:40.550> we

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
but maybe we hear about more because we

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.610 
but maybe we hear about more because we
hear<00:03:40.940> about<00:03:40.970> more<00:03:41.330> information<00:03:41.990> you<00:03:42.410> have<00:03:42.530> to

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
hear about more information you have to

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.680 
hear about more information you have to
remember<00:03:42.800> 20<00:03:43.190> years<00:03:43.400> ago<00:03:43.580> there<00:03:44.150> wasn't<00:03:44.420> the

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
remember 20 years ago there wasn't the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.060 
remember 20 years ago there wasn't the
internet<00:03:45.080> we're<00:03:45.230> getting<00:03:45.440> everything<00:03:45.650> from

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
internet we're getting everything from

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.190 
internet we're getting everything from
the<00:03:46.370> magazine<00:03:46.550> that<00:03:47.000> comes<00:03:47.180> two<00:03:47.690> months<00:03:47.840> late

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
the magazine that comes two months late

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.100 
the magazine that comes two months late
and<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:49.370> of<00:03:50.210> course<00:03:50.270> in<00:03:50.600> a<00:03:50.660> magazine<00:03:50.840> they

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
and so of course in a magazine they

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.270 
and so of course in a magazine they
can't<00:03:51.320> write<00:03:51.500> about<00:03:51.680> everything<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:52.190> they

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
can't write about everything and they

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.770 
can't write about everything and they
probably<00:03:52.460> didn't<00:03:52.790> see<00:03:53.000> everything<00:03:53.570> because

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
probably didn't see everything because

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.030 
probably didn't see everything because
they<00:03:53.870> don't<00:03:54.020> even<00:03:54.080> see<00:03:54.290> everything<00:03:54.650> now<00:03:54.830> with

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
they don't even see everything now with

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.910 
they don't even see everything now with
the<00:03:55.160> cameras<00:03:55.610> and<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.870> so<00:03:57.050> I'm<00:03:57.470> not<00:03:57.650> certain

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
the cameras and and so I'm not certain

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.950 
the cameras and and so I'm not certain
it's<00:03:58.160> it's<00:03:58.580> any<00:03:58.790> different<00:03:59.030> I<00:03:59.420> dish<00:03:59.660> think

the bottom with the exception being in

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.740 
the bottom with the exception being in
the<00:05:31.310> rain<00:05:31.520> could<00:05:31.789> be<00:05:31.940> a<00:05:31.970> little<00:05:32.150> bit<00:05:32.330> different

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
the rain could be a little bit different

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.439 
the rain could be a little bit different
because<00:05:32.810> then<00:05:33.080> you<00:05:33.229> really<00:05:33.680> see<00:05:34.010> a<00:05:34.449> difference

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
because then you really see a difference

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.640 
because then you really see a difference
between<00:05:36.110> riders<00:05:36.590> in<00:05:37.310> the<00:05:37.370> dry<00:05:37.760> and<00:05:38.440> a<00:05:39.440> dry

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
between riders in the dry and a dry

Sagan<00:05:40.099> and<00:05:40.220> kun<00:05:40.370> a<00:05:40.490> go<00:05:40.639> but<00:05:40.760> in<00:05:40.909> the<00:05:41.030> rain<00:05:41.210> you

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
Sagan and kun a go but in the rain you

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:50.040 
Sagan and kun a go but in the rain you
can<00:05:41.419> see<00:05:41.720> some<00:05:41.930> differences

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.390 

I<00:05:51.180> think<00:05:52.180> you<00:05:52.270> when<00:05:52.389> you<00:05:52.479> look<00:05:52.629> at<00:05:52.780> writers<00:05:53.400> the

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
I think you when you look at writers the

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.460 
I think you when you look at writers the
main<00:05:54.879> problem<00:05:55.090> is<00:05:55.449> is<00:05:55.629> if<00:05:55.780> you<00:05:55.900> do<00:05:56.050> the<00:05:56.199> tour

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
main problem is is if you do the tour

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.790 
main problem is is if you do the tour
it's<00:05:57.460> in<00:05:57.699> the<00:05:57.819> middle<00:05:58.000> of<00:05:58.210> season<00:05:58.419> and<00:05:58.780> so<00:05:59.710> you

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
it's in the middle of season and so you

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.189 
it's in the middle of season and so you
don't<00:06:00.099> have<00:06:00.190> much<00:06:00.400> time<00:06:00.610> to<00:06:00.789> prepare<00:06:00.909> for<00:06:01.199> the

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
don't have much time to prepare for the

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.070 
don't have much time to prepare for the
volta<00:06:02.889> afterwards<00:06:03.520> to<00:06:04.060> recover<00:06:04.449> and<00:06:04.780> prepare

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
volta afterwards to recover and prepare

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.960 
volta afterwards to recover and prepare
for<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.289> vault<00:06:05.530> afterwards<00:06:06.069> and<00:06:06.580> you<00:06:06.789> don't

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
for the vault afterwards and you don't

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.869
